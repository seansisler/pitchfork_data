Ardipithecus,Willow,by: Cameron Cook,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2aa5e6ef9596932232c/1:1/w_160/e693ee70.jpg,2016-01-07 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21370-ardipithecus/,Roc Nation,"It's been five years since Willow Smith released ""Whip My Hair,"" her undeniably catchy, exuberant debut single. It was light. It was fun. It was a good song. At nine years old, she was the youngest-ever signee to Roc Nation: perhaps not an astonishing fact given who her parents are, but hitting the limelight before middle school can be tough on the psyche no matter how silver your spoon is. Therefore, it was a pleasantly surprising decision when, a few years later, Willow decided to bail on starring in a remake of Annie, canned all follow-ups to her burgeoning music career, and focused on growing up with whatever artistic integrity the world would allow her. Although still in the public eye, giving increasingly mature and existential interviews, and sporadically releasing music online, Willow has now released what amounts to her first official album, Ardipithecus (which is ""a genus of an extinct hominine that lived during Late Miocene and Early Pliocene in Afar Depression, Ethiopia,"" according to Wikipedia, FYI), and the fact that it is such a pointed departure from her earlier musical forays is a surprise to no one. Nepotism and talent aren't mutually exclusive, but behind all the psychic awakenings and blossoming chakras, something about Ardipithecus remains unbaked. The potential is there, definitely—Willow's complete subversion of R&B/pop tropes (shaved head, age-appropriate sexuality, asymmetrical fashion) is a breath of fresh air, and comes off as totally natural, not the posturing of someone pretending to be cooler than they are. Her vocals are untrained, but not gratingly so, coming off as throaty and confident even when she misses notes. The current alternative R&B landscape is filled with artists who may not be the most powerful vocalists (Frank Ocean, FKA twigs) but more than compensate with lyrical style and production skills. It's clear that this is what Willow aspires to; however, by focusing so heavily on her mystical lyrics and desire to express her worldview, the overall production value takes a backseat. Can the spiritual musings of a high school student, albeit one with above-average life experience, sustain themselves for an entire record? And furthermore, is Willow's persona enough to detract from her somewhat forgivable artistic shortcomings? Even after multiple listens to Ardipithecus, frankly, those questions persist. Ardipithecus' problems are even down to its track sequencing—by the time the album picks up at ""Stars,"" an uptempo, synth-lead collaboration with frequent musical partner JABS, you're already twelve songs in, many of which aren't complex or structured enough to hold much of your attention. ""Why Don't You Cry,"" the record's lead single, is also its closer, a puzzling decision which, again, seems much too little too late after a full listen. It's a shame, because many of the ideas within Ardipithecus are solid, just shoddily executed. Willow is able to flow from tribal chanting (the fast-paced and shuddering ""Natives of the Windy Forest,"" an early highlight) to more traditional R&B leanings (""IDK,"" a song that proves that when her lyrics about mortality and spirituality are slightly subdued, the effect can actually be arresting), which is no small feat. But at the same time, Willow has written and produced the whole album pretty much by herself, and it shows. When she sings, on opener ""Organization & Classification,"" ""I'm just a teenager/ But I feel angrier than a swarm of hornets,"" it's a painfully unnecessary statement, because literally no other type of person would follow it up with a song that's unironically called ""dRuGz,"" which includes the line ""I'm the heroin inside the syringe/ And I'm not going in/ I'm just the girl."" But if you were Willow Smith, would you care? Her crown as Most Woke Millennial is secure, and her mission of completely abandoning her pop past has definitely been accomplished. In the same way that the leap between ages 10 and 15 is gigantic, so is the leap between 15 and 20, and in another five years, if not sooner, it's absolutely plausible that Willow could deliver the polished, brilliant record she is clearly capable of. It's just that, in between bursts of inspiration, Ardipithecus is largely a record of growing pains.","After debuting with her hit single ""Whip My Hair,"" Willow Smith (daugher of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith) left her music career. Five years later, she emerges with a precocious, fitfully interesting new record that shows growing pains in between bursts of inspiration.

Nobody 2,Chief Keef,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b297b1335d7bf169a468/1:1/w_160/138fb44b.jpg,2016-01-07 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21355-nobody-2/,Glo Gang,"It’s inevitably saddening to watch rappers who once risked international crossover success become gradually regarded as more marginal, release by release. In 2012—Chief Keef’s breakout year—the particulars of the then-teenage, Chicago-reared rapper’s music was as much under scrutiny as his sudden, controversial rise. These days, only stories of career self-sabotage, and legal or financial missteps (most recently, his suspension from his record deal with hologram and online television entrepreneur Alki David’s multipurpose entertainment corporation FilmOn) make for major headlines. The unlikely regional and viral success of ""Faneto""—a fiery, rhythmically deranged 2014 mixtape track—was comparatively little commented upon, despite around 60 million cumulative YouTube views, a lengthy paper trail of virality, a 10-minute remix featuring the biggest names in his hometown’s hip-hop scene, and even a Drake cover. Admittedly, there's a top-heavy static-to-signal ratio on Keef’s mixtapes of the past two years. His default ritual—long days and nights in the studio with his in-house production team—results in plenty of appealing, distinctively styled rap songs, but filling his increasingly frequent projects out to between 15 and 20 tracks necessarily makes for redundancy. The Keef devotee must be prepared to rifle through his tapes, scouting for the buried handful of standalone hits. It’s to be expected, really: The over-saturation business model is the profitable and logical choice for a modern street rapper with a diehard fan base. Releases like December’s Nobody 2 evidence the downside of this approach. The tape is both on the more unruly end of the musical spectrum for Keef, and his most poorly curated project since 2013’s Bang 2. That’s not to say it's uninteresting. It is, at least, full of inimitable and decidedly bonkers beats from notoriously prickly executive producer 12 Million (formerly 12Hunna), who also masterminded its predecessor—last December’s meditative, AutoTune-drenched Nobody—and is threatening a third installment this month. On songs like ""Phone"" and ""Sex With Me,"" most elements of the drum loops lag queasily behind the tempo. ""Andale,"" even more extremely, plays out like some untested gear-operated machine lurching into motion and chugging unsteadily along, obscuring twinkling synth constellations in the background. One of 12 Million's hallmarks is his invasive snare patterns, in which wildly backfiring trails of delay become more important that the actual on-the-beat hits themselves. Keef’s terse phrasing holds everything together, demarcating time stylishly, if sometimes to little additional effect. Keef songs like ""Mirror"" function like levels of early Nintendo games—not because of the actual bleep-bloop sonic likeness, but because of the mileage they get from the deceptively complex overlap of a handful of miniature, mechanistic moving parts. Keef’s vocal take sounds as assembled from tiny scraps as the beat itself, but packs in just enough in the way of conversational one-liners to lend the track cohesion (""I think you need a chair/ Waiting on me to fail/ You say you seen some money/ N*gga, tell me where/ Is it over there/ Or is it in here?"") ""Mirror"" is enough to make one go cross-eyed after focusing in too hard on any of its particular irregular elements, but falls together perfectly after pulling back and zoning out a bit. But though 12 Million’s work on this tape is his most compelling to date, Keef, unfortunately, is less present than ever. On tracks like ""Sex With Me,"" he murmurs nearly inaudibly in the background for the better part of the song—more a sound effect than anything else. On the appropriately titled, delay-riddled ""In the Stu,"" it sounds like he’s set foot in the booth without even an embryonic idea or plan of attack. Sometimes, as on the distorted jeremiad of a pre-chorus on ""Tony Hawk,"" he's nearly incomprehensible. Nobody 2 is a far cry from the more lyrically clever and emotionally charged Sorry 4 the Weight, and *Bang 3’*s diplomatic songwriting and sonic clarity. This is chilly, uninviting music, implicitly and explicitly about isolation. ""I feel like I need to separate myself from hip-hop, don’t let nobody come around me, don’t let nobody learn from me,"" Keef intones menacingly on the album’s central skit. A few years into his still-influential career, nobody quite sounds like Chief Keef in rap music. But if he doesn’t let anyone push him to complicate his now-time-tested vision, his songs may never expand back into being something more than fringe experiments, and even the interest those hold may, after a healthy amount of reiteration, wane for good.","Nobody 2 is on the more unruly end of the musical spectrum for Chief Keef, and his most poorly curated project since 2013’s Bang 2.

Blackstar,David Bowie,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b277ea9e61561daa691e/1:1/w_160/1a2fb918.png,2016-01-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21332-blackstar/,ColumbiaRCAISO,"David Bowie has died many deaths yet he is still with us. He is popular music’s ultimate Lazarus: Just as that Biblical figure was beckoned by Jesus to emerge from his tomb after four days of nothingness, Bowie has put many of his selves to rest over the last half-century, only to rise again with a different guise. This is astounding to watch, but it's more treacherous to live through; following Lazarus’ return, priests plotted to kill him, fearing the power of his story. And imagine actually being such a miracle man—resurrection is a hard act to follow. Bowie knows all this. He will always have to answer to his epochal work of the 1970s, the decade in which he dictated several strands of popular and experimental culture, when he made reinvention seem as easy as waking up in the morning. Rather than trying to outrun those years, as he did in the '80s and '90s, he is now mining them in a resolutely bizarre way that scoffs at greatest-hits tours, nostalgia, and brainless regurgitation. His new off-Broadway musical is called Lazarus, and it turns Bowie’s penchant for avatars into an intriguing shell game: The disjointed production features actor Michael C. Hall doing his best impression of Bowie’s corrupted, drunk, and immortal alien from the 1976 art film The Man Who Fell to Earth. Trapped in a set that mimics a Manhattan penthouse, Hall presses himself up to his high skyscraper windows as he sings a new Bowie song also called ""Lazarus."" ""This way or no way, you know, I’ll be free,"" he sings, smudging his hands against the glass. ""Just like that bluebird."" Bowie sings the same song on Blackstar, an album that has him clutching onto remnants from the past as exploratory jazz and the echos of various mad men soundtrack his freefall. Following years of troubling silence, Bowie returned to the pop world with 2013’s The Next Day. The goodwill surrounding his return could not overcome the album’s overall sense of stasis, though. Conversely, on Blackstar, he embraces his status as a no-fucks icon, a 68-year-old with ""nothing left to lose,"" as he sings on ""Lazarus."" The album features a quartet of brand-new collaborators, led by the celebrated modern jazz saxophonist Donny McCaslin, whose repertoire includes hard bop as well as skittering Aphex Twin covers. Bowie’s longtime studio wingman Tony Visconti is back as co-producer, bringing along with him some continuity and a sense of history. Because as much as Blackstar shakes up our idea of what a David Bowie record can sound like, its blend of jazz, codes, brutality, drama, and alienation is not without precedent in his work. Bowie’s first proper instrument was a saxophone, after all, and as a preteen he looked up to his older half-brother Terry Burns, who exposed him to John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, and Beat Generation ideals. The links connecting Bowie, his brother, and jazz feel significant. Burns suffered from schizophrenia throughout his life; he once tried to kill himself by jumping out of a mental hospital window and eventually committed suicide by putting himself in front of a train in 1985. Perhaps this helps explain why Bowie has often used jazz and his saxophone not for finger-snapping pep but rather to hint at mystery and unease. It’s there in his close collaborations with avant-jazz pianist Mike Garson, from 1973’s ""Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)"" all the way to 2003’s ""Bring Me the Disco King."" It’s in his wild squawks on 1993’s ""Jump They Say,"" an ode to Burns. But there is no greater example of the pathos that makes Bowie’s saxophone breathe than on ""Subterraneans"" from 1977’s Low, one of his most dour (and influential) outré moments. That song uncovered a mood of future nostalgia so lasting that it’s difficult to imagine the existence of an act like Boards of Canada without it. Completing the circle, Boards of Canada were reportedly one of Bowie’s inspirations for Blackstar. At this point, it is all but impossible for Bowie to escape himself, but that doesn’t mean he won’t try. Thematically, Blackstar pushes on with the world-weary nihilism that has marked much of his work this century. ""It’s a head-spinning dichotomy of the lust for life against the finality of everything,"" he mused around the release of 2003’s Reality. ""It’s those two things raging against each other… that produces these moments that feel like real truth."" Those collisions come hard and strong throughout the album, unpredictable jazz solos and spirited vocals meeting timeless stories of blunt force and destruction. The rollicking ""'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore"" gets its name from a controversial 17th-century play in which a man has sex with his sister only to stab her in the heart in the middle of a kiss. Bowie’s twist involves some canny gender-bending (""she punched me like a dude""), a robbery, and World War I, but the gist is the same—humans will always resort to a language of savagery when necessary, no matter where or when. See also: ""Girl Loves Me,"" which has Bowie yelping in the slang originated by A Clockwork Orange’s ultraviolent droogs. Though this mix of jazz, malice, and historical role-play is intoxicating, Blackstar becomes whole with its two-song denouement, which balances out the bruises and blood with a couple of salty tears. These are essentially classic David Bowie ballads, laments in which he lets his mask hang just enough for us to see the creases of skin behind it. ""Dollar Days"" is the confession of a restless soul who could not spend his golden years in a blissful British countryside even if he wanted to. ""I’m dying to push their backs against the grain and fool them all again and again,"" he sings, the words doubling as a mantra for Blackstar and much of Bowie’s career. Then, on ""I Can’t Give Everything Away,"" he once again sounds like a frustrated Lazarus, stymied by a returning pulse. This tortured immortality is no gimmick: Bowie will live on long after the man has died. For now, though, he’s making the most of his latest reawakening, adding to the myth while the myth is his to hold.","Blackstar has David Bowie embracing his status as a no-fucks icon, clutching onto remnants from the past as exploratory jazz and the echos of various mad men soundtrack his freefall.

The Bell,Ches Smith,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2929d034d5c69bf4bbd/1:1/w_160/86fbf6a5.png,2016-01-06 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21350-the-bell/,ECM,"Ches Smith is best known to indie rock liner-note devotees as a percussionist who has appeared on over half a dozen Xiu Xiu releases (going all the way back to Knife Play). In recent years, he’s been consistently active on the contemporary jazz circuit—lending his talents to a series of celebrated albums by artists such as guitarist Mary Halvorson and saxophonist Tim Berne. The music of both those composers occasionally strays close to avant-rock, which helps explain Smith’s in-demand status around jazz’s cutting-edge galleries. But he also led those bands through quieter, softer passages, proving his depth and range. For his first album as a composer and bandleader on Germany’s iconic ECM label, Smith has chosen a subtlety that seems influenced by his most recent bandmates and peers. It’s a stylistic course that will be broadly familiar to fans of Manfred Eicher’s jazz-and-classical imprint, and less so to fans of Women as Lovers. But The Bell isn't placid, either: In the company of pianist Craig Taborn and violist Mat Maneri—an experienced pair of collaborators—Smith forges a quiet intensity. There’s heat here, even if it takes some time to feel it. Things begin calmly. The album’s title-track opener announces itself with a lone, delicate smack of pitched percussion, before the other players enter. Though the nine-minute piece never strays very far from a static and spacious feel, there’s often something new happening: Smith moves from the bell-like elements in his kit to some vibraphone shimmers, or thrumming timpani playing. Maneri moves from a low drone on his viola to high-pitch wisps of brief, almost-scratchy timbre. Collectively, the group’s sound is constantly tempting you into a false sense of ease that individual players delight in subverting with little tics—adding extra notes to minimalist phrases before they become too predictable. While all The Bell’s tracks were composed by Smith, the group’s status as ""an improvising trio"" is clear during ""Barely Intervallic,"" a cut where Smith indulges skittering, freer playing. ""I’ll See You on the Dark Side of the Earth"" and ""I Think"" follow the big-canvas, pensive-but-driven feeling of ""Isn’t It Over?"" In the album's final third, ""Wacken Open Air"" gives up its theme right away, the better to let us hear the group work the spare material into a potent acoustic riff. Maneri deals in some lyrical soloing toward the end of ""It’s Always Winter Somewhere."" And the finale, ""For Days,"" re-establishes the set’s quiet equilibrium. The largely hypnotic, not-quite-repetitive quality of the music will, for some listeners, call to mind Taborn’s own Junk Magic, an early-21st century triumph of electrified chamber jazz (and an album that also featured Maneri). But The Bell isn’t just some less kinetic, acoustic redo of that project, with Smith holding down the percussion chair. Despite the album’s restricted range, it suggests a malleable aesthetic, likely the result of the year and a half these improvisers put in together before recording their debut outing. You can imagine this band doing a wide variety of impressive work, in the very near future: perhaps adding in some electronics, or including compositions from all members. But for now, it’s persuasive enough as a demonstration of Smith’s continued career shift into contemporary jazz.","Percussionist Ches Smith has played on over half a dozen Xiu Xiu releases, but in recent years he's been consistently active on the contemporary jazz circuit, playing with guitarist Mary Halvorson, saxophonist Tim Berne, and others.

T r i s h EP,Odd Nosdam,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2a8ea9e61561daa6974/1:1/w_160/19e93acd.jpg,2016-01-06 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21368-t-r-i-s-h-ep/,Sonic CathedralSonic Cathedral,"What does it mean to remember someone? Beyond the abstract idea of remembrance lie some hard truths about our own limitations: our memories are imperfect and constructed and they degrade over time much as we do ourselves. Odd Nosdam’s T r i s h EP is an act of remembrance that wrestles with these limitations. Its six largely instrumental songs bear the tenor of memories: at once warmly familiar and hazily indistinct. Nosdam recorded the T r i s h EP in memory of the late Trish Keenan of English noise-pop act Broadcast. Originally released as a limited-run cassette on the Baro label in 2013, the out-of-print EP is now seeing wider release on vinyl. While Nosdam is known best as a producer of cerebral hip-hop beats, the songs on T r i s h are comparatively formless, often eschewing low-end and percussion altogether. This is Nosdam at his most abstract and untethered, dispensing with any notion of genre to explore the evocative qualities of sound. Working with tape loops, samples, and layers of distortion, he constructs churning songs whose melodies lie buried under blankets of static. While Nosdam is certainly no stranger to noise in his work, these tracks often push into Broadcast territory, sounding like transmissions from a radio station that’s just out of range. Nosdam’s primary focus here is texture; he spends much of T r i s h smearing recognizable shapes into more impressionistic forms. Take the chiming opening melody of ""O l y n n,"" which feels like it was ripped straight out of a Broadcast song. Around the two-minute mark, the track cuts to silence before that same melody returns, pitched up, massively delayed and barely recognizable. Grouper’s Liz Harris contributes a vocal to the song—a haunting, wordless wail—but even that ultimately gets swallowed up by a cloud of echo as well. Nosdam approaches samples with a similarly warped sensibility on T r i s h; ""L o n j a e"" sounds like a yé-yé 45 left skipping on a turntable until it transforms from a song to a drone. Broadcast’s greatest trick might have been sculpting pop songs out of noise and Nosdam manages to perform a similar alchemy on the closing track, ""T r i s h."" Here, the producer gives himself over fully to Broadcast’s school of songcraft, employing the sort of fuzzy organ and heavily distorted bass that became hallmarks of that band’s sound. Even more striking, though, is the vocal that floats through the middle of the track. It's a sample from a late-'60s Norwegian folk record but the singer, Annlaug Lofthus, is a dead ringer for Keenan. For a brief moment, amid swells of noise, we catch a glimpse of Trish Keenan through the haze. And then, just like that, she’s gone. Correction (1/6, 3:50 p.m. EST): An earlier version of this review incorrectly identified the singer on ""T r i s h"" as Trish Keenan. It is Annlaug Lofthus, as now stated.","Odd Nosdam recorded the T r i s h EP in memory of the late Trish Keenan of English noise-pop act Broadcast.

Dreamville II: Revenge of the Dreamers,Various Artists,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f59d034d5c69bf4c4f/1:1/w_160/7eb45917.jpg,2016-01-06 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21416-dreamville-ii-revenge-of-the-dreamers/,InterscopeDreamville,"If nothing else, J. Cole has made it abundantly clear that he wants to be judged alongside rap's all-time greats. So let's do that: Revenge of the Dreamers II, the new nine-song compilation from his Interscope imprint, Dreamville Records, is not The *Dynasty—*it doesn't have the color, the heart-wrenching personal asides, the 1-900 numbers that teach you how to sell crack. Nor does it have the slick condescension of any Bad Boy collaboration, the virtuosity of Soundbombing, the knowing sneer of anything the Diplomats made on their worst day. The problem with Revenge of the Dreamers II, beyond the absence of a ""This Can't Be Life"" or a ""Dipset Anthem,"" is the same as the problem with much of Cole's solo catalog: In his desperation to be canonized beside his idols, he shies away from the risks they took to earn those spots. His performance on a song-by-song basis from his debut, Cole World: The Sideline Story, to last December's 2014 Forest Hills Drive oscillates wildly, but never shakes the feeling that it's checking boxes, doing X because Kanye did and Y because Pac did. Take the opener, ""Folgers Crystals,"" where Cole compares himself to Bob Marley and Nat Turner in the first handful of bars. In many ways, his background is remarkable; the Fayetteville, N.C. native has detailed his experiences in schools with various socioeconomic makeups, including his time at St. John's University in New York. (As always, his rapping on Revenge owes more to the latter locale.) His plan to turn his childhood home—on Forest Hills Drive—into a shelter where single mothers can live rent-free is not just admirable, but is a sincere, inspired way to alleviate the conditions he grew up in and around. But in Cole's more serious writing, most of that personal touch is filtered out, replaced by blunt aphorisms: ""'Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him/ Raised in hell but heaven sent him/ Let 'em diss him."" That kind of toothless penmanship might slide if it weren't delivered so deliberately. Cole's always been at his best when the stakes are low, or at least self-contained; when he's rapping for its own sake, or reveling in the fact that he signed his friends (""Night Job""), he can be a well above-average technician. (To be fair, that song is nearly derailed when he says he's ""Horny like that Coltrane album,"" one of a handful of sex-centric bars that he and his Queens-bred signee Bas inexplicably cling to.) But when he's moralizing or getting somber, it's robotic, as with ""Caged Bird""'s refrain, ""Freedom's just an illusion/ That's my conclusion."" On ""Crystals,"" he punctuates a particularly intense, clumsy passage with, ""So you can take my cock and chew on it,"" a line that needs a wink or some levity to redeem itself, but is given neither. Fumbled legacy-building though it is, Dreamers is not without its bright spots. The tape introduces the label's two newest signees: the Washington, D.C.-bred singer Ari Lennox and lute, a rapper from Charlotte who joins Cole in representing North Carolina. Each artist contributes one song here, both of which are among the best on the tape; lute's Dilla-cribbing ""Still Slummin"" in particular is superb, throwing you immediately into his world (""Took off my work badge, realized I'm back in the hood"") and dispensing plaintive, delightfully un-cinematic notes: ""Lost more friends to bullshit than a bullet."" Lennox's introduction comes in the form of ""Backseat,"" a song that racked up tens of thousands of plays between its October 2014 release and when it was scrubbed from the Internet last month. It's a knowing, slinking cut that succeeds on almost every front: fun, warm, a little sleazy. Cozz, the Los Angeles rapper who inked his Dreamville deal last year, updates the single with an uncharacteristically flat verse; fortunately, his later contributions to the tape, ""Tabs"" and especially the introspective closer ""Grow,"" are excellent. (His pre-Interscope singles ""Dreams"" and ""I Need That"" remain two of the most delightfully menacing street rap songs of the past several years.) Bas—whose braying ""Housewives"" is the weakest cut by a country mile—is joined in Dreamville's relative old guard by Omen, a Chicago native. He and Cole mostly sleepwalk through ""Caged Bird,"" but his headlining song, the Donnie Trumpet-assisted ""48 Laws,"" is a welcome contrast; Omen finds the kind of pocket that always seems to elude his more famous partner, and it makes for a sleek, collected track that feels immediately more vibrant than any of the tape's weightier material. And that, in many respects, is Revenge of the Dreamers II: compelling when its focus is at its most narrow, leaden and impersonal when it reaches for the Very Serious and Very Important. It's like Bleek said: ""The strong move quiet, the weak start riots/ We know you got a brick but sell 'em 20s 'til they tired.""","Revenge of the Dreamers II, the new nine-song compilation from J. Cole's Interscope imprint, Dreamville Records, has the same problems as much of Cole's solo catalog: In his desperation to be canonized beside his idols, he shies away from the risks they took to earn those spots.

From Joy,Kyle Hall,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2ba9d034d5c69bf4bf8/1:1/w_160/36a6340b.jpg,2016-01-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21377-from-joy/,Wild Oats,"Through no fault of his own, Kyle Hall landed in the somewhat precarious position of having Detroit's hopes pinned to him. Since the young DJ and producer debuted in 2007 on fellow Detroiter Omar S's FXHE imprint, Hall has been viewed as the great hope for the next generation of Detroit dance music. Hall kept up his end of the bargain, fostering the potent Wild Oats label, throwing parties in the city and, crucially, not absconding to New York or London or Berlin. Kyle Hall is doing it all, and his 2013 debut album, The Boat Party, sounded like it, anxiously flitting between a host of styles: electro, ghetto tech, filter disco, beat tracks. It's against this backdrop of fervent activity that Hall's second album, From Joy, stands out so fully. A richly melodic exploration that expertly balances astral reverie with rhythmic heft, it's the kind of fully realized statement no one was really expecting Hall to make. Not because he didn't have the talent, but because, well, he seemed busy. A three-LP set featuring eight expansive tracks, From Joy is ambitious but warm and approachable. In its openness, imagination, and sense of history, From Joy feels like the child of Detroit's legendary exploratory radio shows. The concept is simple: jazzy pianos, walking basslines, and probing synth explorations welded to house music's 4/4 drum templates. Jazz has always been valuable in house music—as source material and as a thematic link to another form of (largely black) outsider expression—but From Joy uses jazz a little differently than usual. Hall doesn't sample much here, instead borrowing from jazz its ensemble nature, the sense of unity achieved when the elements of a track lock together just so. Where most dance music feels sequenced, From Joy feels played. Where most machine music employs randomizations and swung notes to remind you of its human nature, From Joy just kind of flows. Hall is able to achieve this in part because From Joy sounds fantastic. You will pass entire tracks—five- and six-minutes long—zeroing in on the richness of one tone or another. For all of a synthesizer's endless possibilities, it's easy to remember that many of them were conceived with the more conservative purpose of emulating traditional instruments. And From Joy is conservative in this sense, dialing up exquisite, harmonically rich synth basslines—see opener ""Damn! I'm Feeln Real Close""—and sonorous leads. One of the album's least dance-y tracks, the contemplative ""Wake Up and Dip,"" is a showcase for a squelchy solo as expressive and felt as any old vanguard. Hall does all this without betraying his dance music bonafides, as side-long tracks such as ""Dervenen"" and ""Strut Garden"" offer DJs and dancers ample acreage. The latter track improbably lives up to its name, a whole lawn of little jukes and swaggers. Its bassline makes all the familiar moves, freeing you to make the unfamiliar ones. From Joy effortlessly functions as both dance music and a home listening experience. Kyle Hall, an artist who has built his young career around doing it all, has made an album that does it all. From Joy, imbued with the past but not overly reverent of it, is Hall cashing in on the prodigious talent glimpsed in his prior work. It's tempting to hold it up as a capital-letter statement, a totem of his hometown. It's equally tempting, and probably healthier, to spin it back and delight in its abundance.","The young Detroit DJ and producer Kyle Hall makes good on his promise with his latest album From Joy. A three-LP set featuring eight expansive tracks, From Joy is ambitious but warm and approachable, blending the ensemble feel of jazz with the 4/4 drums of house music.

Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven,Kid Cudi,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b293c0084474cd0c1fb9/1:1/w_160/e6de59a6.png,2016-01-06 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21351-speedin-bullet-2-heaven/,Republic,"Is Kid Cudi serious? This is the first thing I asked myself listening to Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven, and it's not as snide a question as it sounds; it's genuinely hard to tell. While his diehard fans await his long-delayed Man on the Moon III*,* Cudi opted instead to release *this—*a 90-minute, double-disc rock album, unfiltered and unpolished even compared to his 2012 side-project WZRD. Cudi is not a very good singer or guitarist, and his artlessly blunt lyrics are even more exposed in this context. So what are we to make of this? It's tough to guess the motives of someone who commissions Mike Judge to wedge painful ""Beavis and Butthead"" skits in between songs about self-harm with nihilistic lines like ""I’m feeling I’m a goner."" There is something morbidly compelling about the tenacity of this project: ""Wedding Tux"" plods along for two-and-a-half minutes on two chords and has a hook that goes, ""everything, everyone sucks"" until it almost grows mesmerizing. ""Judgmental Cunt"" sounds an awful lot like self-laceration (""look at you, dumb stoner little boy"") with Cudi breaking his voice while screaming. On ""Trauma,"" he offers this: ""When I was eleven I saw my dad’s corpse."" The discomfort level might be high enough to inspire rubbernecking from people who wouldn’t otherwise care about a new Cudi record. But Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven is interesting the same way a friend getting a dramatic bad haircut is interesting: Once the shock wears off, you still have to look them in the eye and level with them. The album is a failure, and not even a noble one. Cudi insists on calling the album ""alternative,"" and with the ""Beavis and Butthead"" narration, the shout-out to Cobain on ""Man in the Night,"" and a flat drawl that curls into awkward Layne Staley or Scott Weiland impersonations, it’s clear his approach to making a ""rock album"" is even more dated than Lil Wayne’s, grounded in ideas and sounds that are now two decades old. There are fleeting moments, here and there. On single ""Confused!,"" he manages one of the album’s more memorable lines, repeating ""hate the drugs but I love the numb."" When he hits on a nice guitar tone or melody or lyric, the songs are so simple that they assume a semi-meditative quality. The title track is the best song here, with a nostalgic breakbeat and Cudi softly singing about manic depression: ""If I crash, or when I land, no matter the case, I’m all smiles."" It’s a simple but effective tone poem. And sometimes the songs are so uncomfortably direct it feels wrong to be evaluating them at all: How do you judge the value of ""Fuchsia Butterflies""' chorus ""I’ll be happy getting shitfaced by myself?"" It might be a confessional, but again Kid Cudi undercuts himself: If he is committed to this direction, and the album’s flaws are just the result of his limited voice and guitar skills, why include ""The Nothing,"" a song that’s a riff on ""Mary, Mary Quite Contrary""? Moments like this only reinforce the impression that the whole project is one long failed joke, a comedian bombing onstage trying to will it into performance art. So again: is he serious? Either way, Speedin' Bullet is a remarkable flop, and there is a certain amazement whenever something this self-indulgent and messy gets released on a major label.","While his diehard fans await his long-delayed Man on the Moon III*,* Kid Cudi opted instead to release a 90-minute, double-disc rock album.

America's Greatest Hits,Gag,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b27f9d034d5c69bf4b9b/1:1/w_160/9625dc53.jpg,2016-01-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21338-americas-greatest-hits/,Iron Lung,"America's Greatest Hits, the first full-length by Olympia hardcore act Gag, is a pitch-black album about cackling in the abyss, cracking jokes in the humorless confines of hardcore. They are deeply entrenched in the underground: The album is out on Iron Lung, the quietly reigning West Coast punk and hardcore label operated by a band of the same name; Iron Lung's drummer, Jensen Ward, accompanies members of Gag in White Wards. And Gag's clutch of tapes and EPs, which date back to 2012, demonstrate a rigorously fundamental understanding of hardcore: forbidding thickets of guitar feedback; dour, mid-tempo riffs evocative of dogged trudging and furrowed brows; and rhythmic motifs limited to lumbering backbeat and pugilistic punctuation. That makes Gag at once highly traditional—wavering little from formal touchstones like, say, Poison Idea's original ""Pure Hate""—and at odds with hardcore's prevailing inclinations today. There's none of the studied staccato blitzkrieg of Punch, no d-beat homage à la Ajax or Gas Rag. Rather, America's Greatest Hits is a sturdy and relatively unhurried exercise in stylized hostility: ""Steel Forced Twin"" is a strident salvo of floor-tom thud, while ""Pretty Boy"" is all showy strut and bratty leads. Trenchant and thuggish without relief, America's Greatest Hits is predictable but never rote; if contemporary hardcore is less in conversation with originators and more indentured to them, Gag threatens to depose its masters. Indeed, the ghoulish jester adorning the cover of last year's Locker Room EP looks something like Gag's spiritual advisor. And America's Greatest Hits, like Gag's catalog at large, is distinguished by its humor. Historically, hardcore has prized clarity—rejecting irony and sarcasm in favor of a more imperative and sincere tone—whereas punk is more likely to traffic in farce and black humor. Gag, however, forces an impressive amount of sardonic punch lines, guttersnipe mockery, and macabre wit into its otherwise purist hardcore. In the squelched, scabrous vocals, quizzical references to shrimp, sunglasses, and Wal-Mart abound. ""It's Just Me"" begins, ""There's no justice/ There's no justice—just me*,*"" which illustrates how skillfully Gag uses the few syllables allotted each line: there's a simplistic pun, a cynical assertion, and even something of a political statement. All throughout America's Greatest Hits, Gag fulfills the music's nearly monosyllabic requirement with a rare capacity for invention and play. But they aren't simply clever. They mix mastery and transgression. Perhaps Gag explains its perspective best: Consider one of its finest little maxims, from the 40 Oz. Rule '90 EP: ""Ha ha ha/ Blah blah blah/ Either way you die."" Like the very most resonant sentiments in hardcore, it's inarguable and essential. And America's Greatest Hits affirms that Gag guffaws in the face of death.","America's Greatest Hits, the first full-length by Olympia hardcore act Gag, is a pitch-black album about cackling in the abyss, cracking jokes in the humorless confines of hardcore.

Why Pay More?,The Soft Pink Truth,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b28f13d197565213a7bf/1:1/w_160/300abb16.png,2016-01-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21348-why-pay-more/,self-released,"Drew Daniel of the Soft Pink Truth remembers the first thing he ever watched on YouTube. For most people with Internet access, recalling one's initiation into the era of video streaming is like remembering the first picture they ever saw, or the first song they heard—it's damn near impossible. Daniel, on the other hand, remembers the moment he clicked the play button, saw an Iraqi sandstorm, and set off down the path into one of the biggest repositories of human experience ever constructed. At the end of 2015, he put that self-awareness to the test by dropping Why Pay More?, a musical case study of YouTube and the ways it amuses, alarms, alienates, and unites the modern mind. Half abstract collage, half dance album, and altogether weird, it's a fitting tribute to the website a decade after its rise to popularity. Rather than look to globally recognized memes to illustrate YouTube's power and ubiquity, Daniel calls on the mostly forgotten fragments floating out there in the algorithmic abyss, waiting to be stumbled upon by accident or odd search (in other words, no Crazy Frog here). His samples come from the clips on the nth page for the search result ""party,"" the 10 videos viewed a collective 10 times, the zeroes and ones that never mattered—until now. Sonic traits most listeners would consider detrimental—poor sound quality, background noise—form the basis of the record's texture. Within the tightly wound confines of ""Acappella,"" for example, an amateur soul performance that sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom finds new life as an echoey sample in a house track. Various explosions, screeching tires, and sarcastic anti-drug monologues find their way into the ragtag mix as well, colliding and collapsing until the junk gets vulcanized into a speedy machine. Queerness is intrinsic to the Soft Pink Truth: 2014's Why Do the Heathen Rage? sought to expose and deconstruct the homophobic attitudes lurking beneath the surface of black metal fandom, and Daniel's introduction to the project, 2003's Do You Party, drew upon the sounds and experiences of his time as a go-go dancer at Bay Area gay bars earlier in his life. As a musical case study of YouTube—one of the century's near-universal mediums—Why Pay More? requires a broader lens to illustrate the amorphous, anonymous nature of the website. But there are many tracks on the record—""I Love Your Ass,"" "" Fire Island of the Mind,"" the title track—that bring the queer-as-fuck energy of Daniel's earlier material. ""Are You Looking?"" assembles results for the terms ""Looking"" and ""Step"" into a brittle-sounding dancefloor turn, solidified by a sample from Madonna's ""Vogue,"" a song inspired by (and arguably pilfered from) gay culture; aside from that, the former keyword links a classic term for soliciting gay sex to the act of trolling YouTube, suggesting that something each of us does is queer—that by extension, we all are. It's a sneaky statement that functions simultaneously as a compelling thesis as well as a clap-back to homophobic trolls. Then there's the title track, which was conceived as a contest/concert at Dan Deacon's Whartscape festival where guests had to guess the track's BPM. Daniel doesn't make that task easy, burying the beat beneath harsh, tinny game show music, warped house synths, and, most unsettlingly of all, a voice-altered clip of what appears to be a demonic android ordering off the Taco Bell value menu. Isolated from its traditional performative context, ""Why Pay More?"" scans more overwhelming than engaging, putting it in step with the blaring, boorish ""Awesome"" (hope you like bagpipes) and the cartoonish ""Party Pills."" Nevertheless, such compositions realize the album's mission of sensory overload—that inevitable, mind-numbing state that we all acquiesced to (however subconsciously) when we clicked on that play button for the first time.","The Soft Pink Truth is the project of Drew Daniel, one-half of Matmos, and Why Pay More? is a typically conceptual project based on samples culled from YouTube.

This Thing Called Life,August Alsina,by: Renato Pagnani,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b283ea9e61561daa6932/1:1/w_160/c5ff26a6.jpg,2016-01-05 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21341-this-thing-called-life/,Def Jam,"Ever since August Alsina emerged in 2012 with his first official mixtape The Product, he's been somewhat of a curio. In essence, he's a rapper in an R&B singer's body, more likely to sing about his harrowed past and the things he's done to keep food on the table for his family than some romantic tryst. Even ""Would You Know?,"" the lone love song on the New Orleans native's latest album, This Thing Called Life, is a conflicted ballad on which Alsina is a ball of nerves, afraid that opening up to the possibility of love would leave him vulnerable. But Alsina applies the tender, ruminative aspects of R&B—and its sense of longing, especially—to his street tales, and his second studio album solidifies his place amongst the upper echelon of modern-day R&B. Like many of his contemporaries, Alsina shares the same interest as Jeremih and PARTYNEXTDOOR—even Young Thug—in exploring the percussive elements of rapping and the myriad of ways they can be married to melody. On sepia-toned lead single ""Hip-Hop,"" he effortlessly slips back and forth between sweet rhythmic singing and melody-oriented rapping as he describes the environment he grew up in and how he ""came up in criminal ways."" The chorus of ""Dreamer"" finds Alsina employing a triplet cadence à la Migos, a clever flip of the rap-song-with-a-sung-chorus template. Alsina's line-blurring between rapping and singing is never quite as experimental as someone like Jeremih or Young Thug, but it feels completely natural. Alsina's music also gestures towards his gospel roots. A singer in his church's choir as a child, he hangs hard onto the idea that salvation can be found through perseverance and a strong sense of belief, whether in a higher power or simply your own ability to get through the day. Persistence is Alsina's default mode of engaging with the world—when he's boasts about ""buying the same thing three times"" on ""Why I Do It,"" a horn-laden banger featuring an engaged Lil Wayne, Alsina sounds prouder of the work he put in to get to where he is than the spoils of that work. This Thing Called Life also corrects one the most egregious flaws of Testimony, Alsina's 2014 debut: its guests actually make thematic sense. There are only four: in addition to Weezy, Anthony Hamilton, Jadakiss, and Chris Brown all make appearances. With the exception of Brown, who doesn't subtract anything from the slick radio-ready earworm ""Been Around the World"" but adds nothing, the guests feel like kindred spirits rather than label-mandated concessions, artists for whom the experiences of a hard-luck upbringing are never far from the center of the frame. The album loses a bit of steam toward the end, when another love song or two would actually be a welcome change of pace, but it perks back up in time for closer ""The Encore."" A joyously triumphant paean to perseverance, the track captures Alsina's wide-eyed and generous approach to songwriting: ""Always thought that it would be good, but I never had it this good."" It's hard not to root for someone whose music is suffused, at the DNA level, with such appreciation. He's grateful for his good fortunes even as he can't help but be surprised by them.","August Alsina is a rapper in an R&B singer's body, more likely to sing about his harrowed past and the things he's done to keep food on the table for his family than some romantic tryst.

Leave Me Alone,Hinds,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b286b1335d7bf169a446/1:1/w_160/21b15074.jpg,2016-01-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21343-leave-me-alone/,Mom + Pop,"The Madrid-based quartet Hinds makes fuzzy garage pop that seems as intrinsically linked to the warmth and sunshine of their home as California-infused idleness is to many Burger Records bands. They began as a duo called Deers after Carlotta Cosials and Ana Perrote met back in 2011. Inspired by bands like the Black Lips, Mac DeMarco, and the Strokes, the pair wrote woozy pop tracks about love, partying, and the complicated problems that occur when mixing the two. After releasing their first single, 2014's DEMO, Hinds completed their lineup with Ade Martin on bass and Amber Grimbergen on drums, and soon after were forced to change their name due to legal issues (Hinds means a female deer). Hinds may be aware that their casual origin story and goofy demeanor (catch them cracking beers and dancing on tables in their videos) may cause some to think they are not a serious project, so the foursome chose to challenge themselves on their debut LP Leave Me Alone, and the decision pays off. Hinds have described the 12 tracks on Leave Me Alone as the various ""faces of love"" they experienced while writing their debut, and therefore is more emotionally varied than their previously lighthearted singles. While the title indicates detachment, a majority of the songs suggest the opposite, pleading quite literally on ""Fat Calmed Kiddos"" ""please don't leave me."" Leave Me Alone is a record of human contradictions, of the admissions of vulnerability, and the realization that these things are beautiful. It's no coincidence that the phrase ""You're on my mind"" appears on several songs; for better or worse, Hinds realize that there are some feelings that cannot be escaped. Leave Me Alone's singles focus on their purely poppy side, from the smooth opener ""Garden"" to the glorious jangle of ""San Diego"" to the wailing harmonies of ""Bamboo."" The previously released ""Castigadas En El Granero,"" which translates to ""punished in the barn,"" is perhaps the most frenzied track on the album, which is only amplified by rapid-fire, somewhat absurd observations like ""All I see is a big cow/ And now I'm eating all your corn."" Another particular standout is ""Fat Calmed Kiddos,"" a sunny whirlpool of a song with a particularly poignant chorus: ""And I needed to risk 'cause I needed to try/ And I needed a breath 'cause you were out tonight."" These tracks show off what truly sets Hinds apart: Cosials and Perrote's shared vocal responsibilities, which fit together perfectly. Cosials' voice switches between a silky drawl and a Joplin-like howl while Perrote's is grounding and steady. When one is singing, the other often emphasizes or counters, the Ego and Id so to speak. The best moments on Leave Me Alone occur when Cosials and Perrote are going all-out, belting together without restraint. But even on the ""slower"" songs (there isn't really a lull on Leave Me Alone, except for the midway instrumental interlude ""Solar Gap"") the possibility exists for the energy to be cranked up all the way. After a few final mellow jams like the spacey ""And I Will Send Your Flowers Back"" and ""I'll Be Your Man"", Hinds conclude with ""Walking Home"", a fuzzy and almost-tropical declaration of love. The song embraces silly metaphors like ""You're the map to my toe"" and ""You're the rice of my bowl"" before softly fading out with the words, ""You're the love of my life."" ""Walking Home"" is a lovely reminder of two important facts: that love does not need to be complicated and that Hinds are not afraid to wear their hearts on their sleeves.","Leave Me Alone, the debut LP from the Madrid-based garage-pop quartet Hinds, is a record of human contradictions, the admissions of vulnerability, and the realization that these things are beautiful.

Almost a decade after he passed, we're on posthumous record #3, and you start to wonder if we're officially scraping the barrel. Compared to The Naked Soul of Sweet Jones, which at least featured producers Pimp C worked with in life and was rooted in the country-rap sound, 2011's lesser Still Pimping, Long Live the Pimp is the worst of his posthumous output. This is partly due to the uncharacteristically sleepy and subdued verses from Chad Butler himself, but it's not helped out by the production either. Instead of the country-inspired bounce of Pimp's own productions, a lot of Long Live the Pimp works a dank, marching-band percussion rhythm associated with Juicy J's late-career resurgence, more ""Bandz a Make Her Dance"" than ""Sippin on Some Syrup"". In fact, Juicy J oversaw production on several of these songs, and his fingerprints are all over the album. ""Payday"" sounds like something from this year's 100% Juice. The two collaborated often and were representatives for their own regional scenes, but the songs here are discomfiting because they sound too obviously inspired by current trends, an ill fit for a voice so closely aligned with a singular aesthetic. Ty Dolla $ign is a great artist, but you can't pair one of his hooks with a Pimp C verse any more than you can digitally insert John Candy into Krampus. And the overt tributes to Pimp's  sound—church organs and wah-wah guitars—sound flimsy as well, the Diet Coke version of country rap tunes. ""Trill"" is nice enough, with three professional verses from three signature Houston voices—Slim Thug, ESG, and Lil Keke. But everyone sounds careful and reverent, on their best behavior. The Lil Wayne, A$AP Rocky, Juicy J, and Nas features fall predictably flat (though ""Friends"" works a TLC-inspired hook as well as it can), but something like ""Bitch Get Down"" with Bun B and 8 Ball & MJG or ""Twerk Something"" with T.I. should have been home runs. They all feel too tasteful to really be essential, not at all a proper tribute to Pimp's spirit. Pre-release hype pegs Long Live the Pimp as the culmination of what Pimp C was working on toward the end of his life. But it makes you wonder—why did it take eight years for this stuff to see the light of day? Maybe the best verses he left behind have already been used on UGK's final album, 2009's UGK 4 Life, and two other posthumous solo records. Pimp C's work is in good hands (I don't see any Duets: The Final Chapter-type fiascos in the future) but maybe it's time to leave well enough alone.","Long Live the Pimp is the worst of Pimp C's posthumous output.

She's a true triple threat, equally searing as a rapper, soul singer, and personality and an unstoppable force on record, as amply proven with single ""Batches and Cookies"" (and its buttered-up hunkfest of a video) and with previous groups GRRRL PARTY and the Chalice. Big GRRRL Small World comes off as the work of an already minted star—her introduction to the small world, which she's already stepped over, laughing. Big GRRRL Small World—named for a line on LIZZOBANGERS, and Lizzo's label BGSW, on which she released the album—finds her reckoning with her sudden fame, and also the things that plague it: white culture vultures, terrible dudes (consigned on ""Ride"" to the ""Support Group for Men Without Lizzo,"" a demolishingly hilarious couple of bars), people who need her references RapGenius'd clear for them, needy people, misogynists. It's all delivered with sheer glee, and some of it is among the most wicked fun committed to record in 2015. It also sounds gorgeous; largely produced by BJ Burton (Low, Sylvan Esso, Poliça), the album is full of unexpected turns and immaculate codas. Lizzo bends each track to her will, twisting them until they're anything but obvious. ""Ain't I"", the closest thing here to a LIZZOBANGER, begins with references to reparations and Russian czars but ends with a distant, slightly untuned piano interlude and distorted guitar squeals. The ballads speak the language of vulnerability but twist R&B tropes to different ends. Standout single ""Humanize"" begins as a shimmering post-coital reverie sung in feather-soft voice and ends smothering and alone, with a voice like the feather's sharp end. Lizzo's lyrics on ""Humanize"" complicate everything, full of reversals (""your skin is warm—it keeps me up though I am tired"") and pinprick-perfect lines: ""No, you can't lay on my shoulder, there are spikes and scales and your cheek would just press them in."" It's an exhausted, near-existential sigh: one of yearning for connection but unable to find it, particularly when the ones you're supposed to connect with are the aforementioned terrible dudes. ""En Love"" begins as another sumptuous soul piece, Lizzo's besotten cooing resting upon beds of '90s synth pads, until Lizzo drops the punchline—""with myself!""—and turns the track into a trap jam. Lizzo's force of personality prevents the switch up from being mere gimmick, as does her generosity; she dedicates a verse to her best friend, and to her listeners. Indeed, the most straightforward tracks on Big GRRRL Small World, such as empowerment ballad ""My Skin"", are explicitly about and for everyone who looks like and looks up to her. This—not only her indie friends, or her crystalline production, and especially not her place in any made-up taxonomy of female rappers she's been placed into—is largely responsible for her whirlwind success, and Lizzo knows it. ""I love that because I am a woman and because I rap and I look the way I look, I can connect with the demographic of people who feel like they have a voice in me,"" Lizzo told Billboard. ""I get to speak to these people who did not get spoken for in this genre."" Big GRRRL Small World succeeds because it's just that: a showcase for the small world, a keepsake for the big grrrls. Correction: An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that Bon Iver's Justin Vernon produced LIZZOBANGERS.","The Twin Cities artist Lizzo is a triple threat, equally searing as a rapper, soul singer, and personality.

Black Market,Rick Ross,by: Julian Kimble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2879d034d5c69bf4bac/1:1/w_160/d581a9dd.jpg,2015-12-10 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21344-black-market/,Maybach/Warner Bros.,"The life of a boss is defined by highs and lows. Five years ago, Rick Ross was voraciously bragging about blowing up like napalm and parking his Caddy in the living room on Ashes to Ashes, a free Christmas gift-slash-Teflon Don victory lap. But since reaching his pinnacle with 2012’s Rich Forever, oversaturation has exhausted much of what made him successful in previous years. It’s not that Ross’s output has been poor, but releasing Mastermind and Hood Billionaire in 2014 made both largely forgettable. Worse, the cracks in the seemingly untouchable Maybach Music Group’s beautiful granite finish have deepened. If MMG is rap’s luxury car dealership, then Ross is its cigar-smoking general manager; Meek Mill and Wale his top salesmen. At this stage of his career, Ross should be sitting and tallying sales. But after Meek Mill fumbled a winning hand against Drake, Wale and Meek began squabbling, and Ross himself went to jail for assaulting his groundskeeper. Ross was forced to roll up his sleeves and right the course of his imprint. September’s Black Dollar was a step in the right direction, with a refocused Ross proving that he’s more interesting with his back against the wall than when he’s dropping hits like Steph Curry three-pointers. With Black Market, he continues this narrative. ""Bottom of the black market, time to rise again,"" he announces on the album’s opener, ""Free Enterprise"". As the first song written for the album (albeit, during Ross’s jail stint earlier this year), it’s a strong tone-setter. Aided once more by John Legend’s soaring vocals, Ross ponders future possibilities. Think of it as the next step after Black Dollar carryover ""Foreclosures"", where he waxes eloquent about how financial problems can still complicate the lifestyles of the rich and famous: ""You reap what you sow, and they speakin’ repossessions/ To the culture itself, these are powerful lessons."" Ross excels when given a focal point, and adversity (specifically, the fear of going back to rags from riches) gives him something to dig his teeth into. Absent from Black Market is the boisterous production heard on previous Rick Ross projects. With the Lex Luger trademark heard on ""B.M.F."", ""MC Hammer"", and ""9 Piece"" pirated into extinction over the years, Ross has wisely moved on. He's at his most effective when he dials back the Rick Ross character, so the album’s standouts feature him laying bawse insight over slow-burners. The radiance of Jake One’s production and CeeLo Green’s chorus add another layer of warmth to ""Smile Mama, Smile"", lifting it out of routine homage territory. ""Crocodile Python"" is as smooth as the title indicates, and ""Silk Road"" is beautifully minimal. On the latter, he explains that he fixates on ostentatious imagery to create something vivid for the less fortunate: ""I entertain niggas under poverty lines/ So I paint these pretty pictures as part of my rhymes."" ""Black Opium"" falls into the same neighborhood, adding scratches from DJ Premier for furnishing and decoration. But amidst the good, errors loom. ""Peace Sign"" treads into lazy, ""Diced Pineapples"" territory. Meanwhile, ""Can’t Say No"" revives and refurbishes an old Mariah Carey gem. Carey sounds great, but the song’s inclusion is as unnecessary as the resurrection of its source material. It’s the inverse of what Carey previously did to Cam’ron’s ""Oh Boy"". ""Dope Dick"" features more stellar production from Jake One, but the laughable title and hook (has ""dick"" been uttered more over a five-minute period?) makes you wish Ross saved the beat and verses for something more serious. ""Success is a precious jewel,"" Ross warns on ""Foreclosures"". It should be cherished, because, like popularity, it can vanish at a moment’s notice. Rick Ross’ has waned in recent years, but the trials have added new shadings to his four-color persona. The motivated, slightly weary Ross heard on *Black Market—*which has no MMG features—is a better fit for the moment than the bulletproof supervillain of old. Ross has proven his resilience in the past; maybe carefully controlled doses of reality are just what he needs to move forward.","September's Black Dollar showed Rick Ross refocused, proving that he’s more interesting with his back against the wall. His new album, which has no MMG features, continues the motivated, slightly weary feeling of that mixtape, scrapping his cartoon supervillain persona.

Purple,Baroness,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19e9d034d5c69bf4a55/1:1/w_160/18e978b7.jpg,2015-12-10 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21179-purple/,Abraxan Hymns,"It's been almost four years since Baroness’ last record, 2012’s Yellow & Green. That 18-song, 75-minute double album found the onetime sludge group making calmer, more melodic rock music, and seemed to presage a crossover. There was energy around the band, a palpable sense of momentum. But a month or so after the release of the record, Baroness got into a bus crash while on tour in England. It was a serious accident, a slide off the road, that stalled the Yellow & Green roll-out and almost ended the band. It was jarring enough that drummer Allen Blickle and bassist Matt Maggioni, who both suffered fractured vertebrae, ended up leaving the group. There was emotional and psychological healing, as well as bones that had to be reset: A photo of the banged-up band surfaced and frontman and visual artist (and the group's poet and beating heart) John Baizley said he was close to having his arm amputated. But he healed, as did longtime guitarist Peter Adams. After the accident, Baizley wrote an amazing letter reaffirming his commitment to Baroness and music and art in general before he and Adams went on tour with new members, bassist/keyboardist Nick Jost and drummer Sebastian Thomson. Their shows after the accident were powerful—even the calmer Yellow & Green songs had a magnetic, life-affirming force. Shortly before Y&G's release, before the accident, I interviewed Baizley. He told me he wanted Yellow & Green’s cover art, like the songs themselves, to reflect the feeling of the moment before or after a disaster. It’s eerie rereading his words now: ""A lot of what I tackled lyrically or conceptually with [Y&G] is present on first glance but has... this implication of horror, or 'this is the moment before a car crash,' or the moment after a car crash. It seemed a little bit more engaging and interesting to me to consider those moments before, those moments after, rather than the ease and bluntness that comes with graphic violence or obvious, terrifying things."" In a very real-life way, Purple, their first studio album since the accident, has ended up doing this, too. Purple is the color of fresh bruises. It's also the combination of Red and Blue, which makes sense musically for those familiar with the group's albums of those names. These are some of the biggest, strongest songs Baroness have written; it's rock music that folds in their more metal leanings, along with something more delicate and spare. The hooks and melodies are their best. It also marks a number of firsts for the band. They're releasing it themselves on their new Abraxan Hymns imprint, and instead of recording with John Congleton, who produced the last couple of albums, they worked with Dave Fridmann, best known for his longtime collaboration with Flaming Lips (and you'll notice a larger presence of psychedelic keyboards throughout). It's also the first album to feature the new lineup, the same group as that first tour after the accident, and at this point they play together like longtime vets. It’s shorter and more precise than Yellow & Green, with 10 songs in 43 minutes. The opener ""Morningstar"" rips into the thoughtful synths of ""Shock Me"", before that song, too, starts to burn. ""Shock Me""'s an elegant song about being shocked into a new reality, about bad dreams coming true, about going into battle without proper preparation. On one level it feels like a song about the struggle and battle of day-to-day living, but this isn't dour or sad music: In fact, Baizley sounds thankful for the clearer, sharper vision personal tragedy's afforded him. Songs like ""Kerosene"" and ""Desperation Burns"" nod to heat or flames, as do many of the lyrics. There are also lyrics about breathing and disappearing, doctors and spines and pills and death. The excellent, epic first single ""Chlorine & Wine"", features a harmonizing breakdown after a gentler piano bridge that seems to signal survival. In it, the entire band sings (or, shouts really): ""Please don't lay me down/ Under the rocks where I found/ My place in the ground/ A home for the fathers and sons."" These feel like war stories, or more aptly, stories from some people who feel ecstatic to be alive. Baizley likes to tell stories through his cover art as well. On the sleeve of Purple, four women huddle together in what looks like the cold, with calm dogs and falcons by their sides. There are some mice (food for the birds) and nails (tools for building). There's a full moon, too, as well as blooming flowers and bees and berries and honey (the promise of Spring). The picture, which seems to be referenced in the lyrics to ""Morningstar"", communicates the hardiness of spirit it takes to live through tougher times and emerge hopeful. It's easy enough to see the four band members reflected in these four women. Here they are, alive and astonished, and here is this record.","These are some of the biggest, strongest songs that Baroness has written; it's rock music that folds in their more metal leanings, along with something more delicate and spare.

Technoself,Deantoni Parks,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b26e5e6ef959693222c7/1:1/w_160/b4ddae53.jpg,2015-12-09 06:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21327-technoself/,Leaving,"In the mid-'00s, a combination of Dilla’s Donuts, easy-to-use digital production technology like Fruity Loops, and websites like SoundCloud gave aspiring producers of instrumental rap a muse, a method, and a destination. The beat music ecosystem exploded; Donuts was a record that launched 10,000 loopers, a globalized corps of dedicated amateurs, some of whom—Shungu, Teebs, Lee, Knxwledge—have been able to break out ahead of the pack. But the SoundCloud universe isn’t necessarily kind to aspiring producers with no formal sense of what they’re doing behind the boards. Some of the stronger beat albums of the past decade have come from knowledgeable studio musicians, people like Karriem Riggins, who cut his teeth playing behind some of the biggest names in the world (Paul McCartney, Diana Krall). Deantoni Parks has a comparably decorated background: He’s collaborated with canonical progressive acts of several different decades (John Cale, Sade, the Mars Volta, Flying Lotus) and is an astounding technical musician, as evidenced by his tenure teaching at the Berklee College of Music, or, if you prefer, this Nike ad. Parks’ latest solo, Technoself, is above all else a showcase for what the Georgia native can do with a drum kit, a sampler, and a limited number of hands. (He only has two.) Every track here is a live recording, an astounding feat given the percussive complexity present on something like ""Graphite"", which with its surround-sound distortion and riffage feels as if it were carefully engineered over the course of a month of lab work. Frequently, the aggression of the drumming itself is a thrill. ""Automatic"" is a fantastic pump-up track, with the same wall-to-wall excitement as Eminem’s ""Til I Collapse"" (and none of the yelling.) The ambition on Technoself is staggering, particularly given the technical limits that Parks has imposed on himself. Album opener ""Black Axioms"" uses alternating samples and BPMs to deliver a crash course on modern African-American music, hinting at different eras and genres (blues, house, hip-hop, footwork) by use of speed and musical association. Another track, ""Fosse in the Grass"", manages to deal cleverly (and wordlessly!) with the issue of appropriation, as it references the choreographer Bob Fosse, and Michael Jackson’s famous borrowing of his moves for ""Billie Jean"". (Beyoncé was also accused of stealing from Fosse for the ""Single Ladies"" dance, worth noting given Parks’ connection to the queen through his work with producer Boots.) And yet, when building upon those two sturdy legs of musicianship and conceptual heft, Parks is sometimes guilty of leaving the third leg of the tripod unstable. Several of the tracks here are not all that much fun to listen to, and it can seem as if Parks values astounding his audience over engaging them. Try watching the video for the track ""Bombay"" and then simply listening to the instrumental. When you can see what Parks is doing with his set-up, you can’t help but to be impressed. But the track alone isn't even half as compelling. As an exercise in musicianship and high-level conceptual art, Technoself is masterful. But over the course of an entire album, it becomes overwhelming and just a little bit masturbatory.","Deantoni Parks has collaborated with John Cale, Sade, the Mars Volta, and Flying Lotus.

City Lake,Bing & Ruth,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b213c0084474cd0c1ef4/1:1/w_160/7f63a272.png,2015-12-09 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21256-city-lake/,Rvng Intl.,"City Lake is not a new Bing & Ruth record, but it might as well be. Only 250 copies of the chamber-ambient ensemble's album were pressed when it was first released on vinyl in 2010. It reappears now, on New York's RVNG Intl., as a sort of coda to last year's RVNG-released Bing & Ruth album Tomorrow Was the Golden Age. That record, a luminous affair for piano, cello, clarinet, bass, and tape delay, was many listeners' first encounter with David Moore's group, so it makes sense the label would want to dust off a recording that most people never got the chance to hear. City Lake is very much of a piece with its successor, although there are subtle (and not-so-subtle) differences between the two. While Tomorrow utilized just seven players, City Lake features an 11-person ensemble—two clarinets, two cellos, two voices, bass, lap steel, tape delay, percussion, and piano—and the effect of the expanded lineup is notable. It's a fuller, richer sound with more definition. The piano leads the way, knocking out rapidly repeating chords that emphasize the instrument's percussive side, and the reeds, cello, and lap steel frequently twist into sturdy, vine-like shapes. Tomorrow, with its shimmering delay, has a wispier, more featherweight feel; City Lake, while still beautiful and tinged with melancholy, leaves more room for dissonance, and even flat-out chaos. If, already familiar with Tomorrow's calm, cozy atmospheres, you turn to City Lake to soundtrack your next dinner party, maybe don't use the fine china: Your meal may take an unexpected turn some 40 minutes in, when the music explodes into a buzzing, squealing maelstrom of insistent crash cymbals and earsplitting glissandi. Just like Tomorrow, City Lake is built upon exceedingly simple musical figures, but the results are anything but. Moore is often compared to American minimalists like Steve Reich and Terry Riley, and not without reason; he is fond of repeating patterns and stalwart pedal tones, and his chord progressions are usually content to stay in one place, shifting from foot to foot. And, just like Reich and Riley, Moore's own music doesn't easily square with a concept like minimalism. Immersed in the billowing harmonics of City Lake, you don't think of empty space, but of fullness. You don't think of absence, but of presence. The dominant motif of ""Broad Channel"" may be the piano's hollow open fifth, but the way he uses the rest of the instruments to color in that interval, you're left with the impression of a sound that can't be contained. You feel it most in ""City Lake / Tu Sei Uwe"". Gentle piano chords, wreathed in glowing drones, create a sense of space that exists outside of time. The rhythm plays out only in the broadest of strokes, like the movement of waves. It builds imperceptibly, until, some 10 minutes in, cymbals and voices and a stream of gravelly feedback rise in a squall that, in the score, is notated as ""HEADACHE INDUCING LOUDNESS."" It might feel out of character for Bing & Ruth; in fact, if you dropped in unawares, you might mistake the passage for Swans. But it's over just as quickly as it's begun—a sudden cutoff, then silence. If Tomorrow Was the Golden Age corresponds to what Erik Satie termed ""furniture music,"" City Lake is a glimpse at the raw materials before all the splinters have been sanded down—and it is all the more exciting for them.","Bing & Ruth's debut album, first released in a tiny run in 2010, has been reissued. City Lake features an 11-person ensemble—two clarinets, two cellos, two voices, bass, lap steel, tape delay, percussion, and piano—and the large lineup brings David Moore's ambient-leaning compositions to life.

Glamorous Damage,GUM,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b26b9d034d5c69bf4b7d/1:1/w_160/75fe5c5f.jpg,2015-12-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21324-glamorous-damage/,Spinning Top,"As a multi-instrumentalist for the touring lineup of Tame Impala, Jay Watson has rode shotgun on Kevin Parker's accelerated ascent from acid-rock purist to synth-pop aesthete. But Watson's pursuits outside that band have veered in all sorts of directions. His other group, Pond, is the unbridled id to Tame Impala's steely superego, a band that feels no shame in giving songs titles like ""Heroic Shart"" or compunction in flipping between blown-out narco-rock and new wave in the space of two releases. Likewise, in just a year, Watson's solo alter ego GUM has hot-wired the grotty psych-pop of 2014's Delorean Highway into the block-party prog of sophomore effort, Glamorous Damage. What ultimately unites Watson's constellation of bands is a desire to divorce '60s psychedelia from period details and infuse it with other temporally dislocated sounds, be it '70s art rock, '80s electro, or '90s lo-fi. Compared to Tame Impala's IMAX-scaled productions, Glamorous Damage is like the 8-bit, Nintendo videogame adaptation of a blockbuster film—an offshoot that can't possibly match the grandeur of its esteemed affiliate, but possesses a quirky charm all its own. And where Tame Impala's super-sized sound swaddles Parker's intimate lyricism, GUM's downsized dimensions can barely contain Watson's eccentric, multi-voiced personality. Watson may double down on cheeky '80s signifiers here—arcade-game laser blasts, boombox beats, falsetto hooks, high-pitched cathode-ray frequencies—but they're the foundations that support his freakery, like the skull-piercing synth drone that overwhelms the Princely funk of ""Anesthetized Lesson"". Where Delorean Highway featured a wobbly but ultimately faithful cover of Genesis' 1980 pop crossover hit ""Misunderstanding"", Glamorous Damage deviously twists synth-pop until it turns into prog-rock: The brief opening snippet ""G.U.M."" introduces a budget Chemical Brothers bass groove that reappears in extended form as ""R.Y.K."", where it ultimately serves as the canvas for a splatter of Kraftwerkian synths and smeared guitar solos. Glamorous Damage succeeds so long as that impulsive energy is given enough space; when Watson stays locked in a single gear—like on the pastoral goth of ""Greens and Blues"", or the Ariel Pink Floyd reverie ""She Never Made It to Tell"" or the spoken-word title-track throwaway—the album stalls. Of course, even GUM's most fanciful gestures will feel modest next to Tame Impala's interstellar overdrive. But there's enough synthetic psychedelic splendor on Glamorous Damage to soundtrack a DIY planetarium laser show under the covers with tinted flashlights.","Multi-instrumentalist Jay Watson tours with Tame Impala.

#HORROR OST,EMA,by: Louis Pattison,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b27cc0084474cd0c1f9e/1:1/w_160/29ba8fe8.jpg,2015-12-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21336-horror-ost/,Matador,"Horror has always been deeply embedded into Erika M. Anderson’s music—not the lurid B-movie scares of lurking bogeymen or masked slashers, but a trauma more rooted in the quotidian and everyday, of neuroses roaming in a fog of prescription medication and of self-inflicted scars hidden beneath long sleeves. First as part of Los Angeles group Gowns, and now in her solo incarnation as EMA, Anderson has pursued a raw, husky lo-fi music that feels intensely personal, the sort that you either feel and empathize with on a deep and profound level, or listen to uncomfortably, like an intruder. On #HORROR, though, we find Anderson not airing personal demons, but writing to commission, as she scores the debut feature film by the actress, fashion designer, and socialite Tara Subkoff. As the hashtag implies, this is a calculatedly millennial take on the genre, a tale of pre-teen girls, inherited privilege, and cyberbullying that takes an inevitable dark twist. On paper, Anderson is a good fit for the subject matter—not just for the fraught emotions that crackle in her music, but for her digital nativity. While EMA’s early output was firmly rooted in a DIY punk idiom, Anderson’s work has increasingly expanded into virtual and connected spaces, from the song-portraits of technological malaise found on her 2014 LP T**he Future’s Void to her recent exhibition ""I Wanna Destroy (Sacred Objects From Suburban Homes)"" at New York's MoMA PS1 and London’s Barbican, which employed Oculus Rift virtual reality technology to memorialize or consecrate banal or defunct artefacts of consumer culture. Now on *#HORROR—*recorded with long-time collaborator Leif Shackelford—we find Anderson again working at the boundary line between the real and the virtual, taking up vocals, strings, and electronics to soundtrack a sinister online realm unrolling its tendrils into our own. Certainly, Anderson and Shackelford have done their homework. These 18 tracks add up to an hour of music, gesturing out to horror score landmarks past and present. ""Running Danger"" and ""Dr White in the House"" channel the analogue synth work of John Carpenter, unfurling throbbing electronic tones around which Shackelford twines long, melancholy violin strokes. ""Locust Strings"" recalls the sinister orchestral clamor of György Ligeti—or, if you want a more contemporary antecedent, the wasp’s nest hum of strings Mica Levi wove throughout Under the Skin. And while many of the album’s tracks feel fleeting, working with shadowy atmospherics, one fully-fledged song emerges in the shape of ""Amnesia Haze"". Taking its cues from the soundtrack to Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive, it’s a diaphanous synthpop confection of twinkling arpeggios and soft-strummed guitar that recalls Chromatics in its minor-key yearning and opiated pacing. ""You were just a child,"" repeats Anderson, and the results are striking, if a touch more pristine than the raw angst with which EMA made her name. #HORROR often feels like a slick thing, with few of the rough edges that have defined Anderson’s work. But the above zig-zag of reference points here perhaps gestures at the real reason #HORROR doesn’t entirely come off. It feels a little too surface and referential, lost amidst legacies. You might argue a horror film soundtrack can never be anything other than a genre exercise: the process, after all, comes with certain demands and strictures—the tension of suspense, the release of the scare. But such is the genre-skipping on show that it’s hard to grasp what dark truth about Subkoff’s film #HORROR is trying to express. Perhaps we get closest on a handful of tracks that feel like they play off the aesthetics of the web itself: ""Horror #2"", with its coldly impassive choral voices and buzzing tones that evoke jagged waveforms; or ""Harshmallow World"", a twinkly fantasia of pizzicato strings and tolling bells recalling the sumptuous, exotic darkness of Italian maestros like Bruno Nicolai, but presented with a bright, hyperreal glaze. With John Carpenter off on tour and labels like Death Waltz and Waxwork Records resurrecting dusty old scores as luxury consumer products, the vintage horror soundtrack has never been more sung. But at times like this we need someone to advance the form, and #HORROR doesn’t quite have the strength of conviction. Next time, perhaps, more guts.","Erika M.

Late Nights: The Album,Jeremih,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b28213d197565213a7a8/1:1/w_160/23346138.jpg,2015-12-09 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21340-late-nights-the-album/,Def Jam,"Imagine a Groundhog Day sequel where each day is another doomed re-run of your significant other's birthday. ""It's the best day of the year, girl,"" you mumble for the thousandth time, fumbling for a Cialis. No one gets older, and nothing changes. That's been the unfortunate majority of Jeremih's career—somewhat bafflingly, considering the singer and multi-instrumentalist has racked up three platinum singles and features on hits from half the rap game. Since ""Birthday Sex""—his 2009 debut single, recorded in college classmate Mick Schultz' makeshift studio—took hold of Chicago radio and then the world, he's tried in vain to politely distance himself from the song. And meanwhile, he obsessively adjusted and readjusted Late Nights, his third studio album: the one that officially renders his early career a distant memory and establishes himself as one of R&B's most singular voices. The Late Nights universe pays no mind to the swagless Gregorian calendar, abiding instead by the hours of Patron shots and wanton DM slides. Each day begins at dusk and ends at sunrise, eyelids gently twitching from leftover molly. It is a purgatory in the best sense, a retreat from reality for discerning hedonists. Jeremih seems to zone out a lot: two separate instances on Late Nights find him coming to the realization that he is the only clothed person in the room, as if he'd absentmindedly stumbled into a drunken orgy. Above all else, he needs room to breathe. Late Night's guiding principle is space—for his weightless upper register to float, and for the album's barely-there production to echo off itself. ""Man, my whip's so big when you in it,"" he crows to his beguiling passenger on ""Planez"", this year's best radio R&B single in spite of J. Cole's paraphiliac trainwreck of a guest verse. It's a small sentiment that gestures at something grander: When you're with me, my world opens up. And that's exactly how Late Nights feels. There is almost no continuity between this album and Jeremih's last, 2010's paint-by-numbers All About You. With its dim-lit crackle and delicate suggestions of beats, Late Nights' only real predecessor is his 2012 mixtape of the same title—one he released for free against the guidance of Def Jam, who seemed unwilling to give Jeremih the benefit of the doubt. To be fair, no one could have seen it coming: impeccably produced, subtle, and hot as fuck, it showed Jeremih like no one had seen before. Parts of Late Nights, the album, feel like direct continuations of that tape's sound: third single ""Oui"" builds on the delicate doo-wop of ""Rosa Acosta"" like a gently-traced impression of a Terius Nash creation. But then the bottom drops out, and Jeremih slips into a momentary interpolation of Shai's ""If I Ever Fall in Love"". It's easy to see what draws him to the 1992 hit: a wisp of a backdrop, over which the quartet's harmonies defy gravity. But Late Nights' most stunning moments take the mixtape's best ideas and strip them down further than seemed possible. ""Pass Dat"" is little more than suggestive synth echo and bass tremor; ""Woosah"" rations percussion like there was a drought, sustaining itself off muted finger-snaps and the flick of a lighter. More than ever, Jeremih—who taught himself the drums at three years old—has learned to use his own voice as a rhythmic element, redefining the idea of ""flow"" for the R&B set. It's the logical reverse of the direction rap's been moving in for most of the 2010s, blurring rapped and sung delivery to indistinguishability; on ""Drank"", he skips nimbly from rap-inspired staccato to half-chanted dancehall melodies, the R&B equivalent of Young Thug's ""Stoner"". Late Nights' most overt hip-hop crossovers (""Giv No Fucks"", ""Royalty"") feel less essential, but to watch Jeremih approach rap and R&B's midpoint from the opposite direction as rhythmic innovators like Future, Migos, and Twista is a fascinating study in contrasts. It feels like poetic justice that the high point of Late Nights—an album about patience, space, the agonizing tease of perfectionism—is saved for its final track. Over nothing more than an acoustic guitar, Jeremih yawns blearily at his beachside paradise, kind of faded, the only one still awake. He pops some Tylenol, revisits the preceding night's debauchery, smiles. ""Sooooo fuckin' wasted,"" he harmonizes like a delinquent angel choir. It's a derelict canticle, a lullaby for the perpetually hungover, a deep breath. It took him long enough to get here, and he's going to savor the moment for as long as he possibly can, in the little universe he's carved out because the industry didn't have space for him. Late Nights, in its subtle seduction, feels all the more special in an era that increasingly rewards artists who shout the loudest. Jeremih makes you shut everything else out so that you can hear him whisper in your ear. It was worth the wait.","Jeremih's long-delayed third studio album officially renders his early career a distant memory and establishes himself as one of R&B's most singular voices.

Before Nostromo,Stephan Mathieu,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b260ea9e61561daa68f5/1:1/w_160/75b40cde.jpg,2015-12-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21313-before-nostromo/,Schwebung,"It's ironic that Alien's famous tagline—In space no one can hear you scream—emphasizes the silence of the void, because sound is woven into the film's innermost fibers. A nearly constant backdrop of rumble accompanies the Nostromo as it slips across that godforsaken quadrant of the galaxy. The steady drone whipped up by the ship's vibrations quietly erupts into all manner of rustle and whirr—the bleeping of the navigation system, the hissing of steam vents, and countless quavering whines of uncertain provenance—until the entire world of the film feels cocooned inside an omnipresent hum. That buzzing matrix is the subject of Before Nostromo, a new album by the German musician Stephan Mathieu. Mathieu has been working the seam between ambient, musique concrète, and microsound since the late '90s, running vintage acoustic instruments and obsolete media like wax cylinders through electroacoustic processing and digital treatments. Mathieu describes Before Nostromo as an homage to Alien's sound design, and he has given the work a novel premise. Just prior to being awakened from hypersleep by the ship's computer, the film's seven characters—Ripley, Dallas, Parker, Lambert, Kane, Brett, and even Ash, the android—each have a dream. So does Jonesey the cat. Eight tracks, ranging from four minutes to nearly 20 minutes in length, represent those respective dreams. (A ninth, ""Anamorphosis"", rounds out the set; Mathieu suggests that it may be attributed to the Nostromo's other passenger, the alien.) To record the music, Mathieu used two large gongs, piano, and shortwave radio, but none of those elements are obvious from the sound of the music, which changes colors as imperceptibly as late-afternoon light. ""Entropic processes,"" like those Alvin Lucier used to create I Am Sitting in a Room, in which a spoken text gradually decays as it bounces back and forth between two reel-to-reel players, are key to the music's soft, rounded forms. Using relatively modest means, Mathieu evokes a vast expanse. Rarely, though, do you hear a note being produced; sounds slink into being like shadows creeping across the wall, and they abscond just as imperceptibly. There's a brief tinkling, as of wind chimes, in ""Stasis 7 (Ash the Android's Dream)""; in ""Stasis 1 (Dallas' Dream)"" there's a sourceless tapping that reappears in ""Stasis 4 (Brett's Dream)"", as if Harry Dean Stanton's character were down in the engine room, banging away on pipes. Otherwise, though, everything is as soft and sanded down as a coastline worn smooth by the millennia. His abstracted shapes genuinely resemble dreams, albeit the memories of one from which you've just emerged tugging at the edges of your consciousness. Before Nostromo is best suited for deep listening. With so few obvious features to grasp on to, even after multiple plays you may not immediately be able to tell the difference between one ""dream"" and another. But that's hardly the point. These bottom-of-the-well fantasies are the headiest kind of echo-chamber music, fusing the unstable oscillations of Kevin Drumm's Imperial Horizon and Folke Rabe's What?! with the soft spectral explosion of Ligeti's Lux Aeterna and the melancholy decay of William Basinski's Disintegration Loops. It's worth noting that Before Nostromo is a digital-only release—a format that Mathieu has dedicated himself to with religious zeal, for reasons both economic and audiophile. The album takes the form of a 24-bit FLAC (the download also includes a beautifully designed PDF booklet designed by his wife, Caro Mikalef) and it sounds unusually sumptuous, with a richness—dynamic, timbral, spatial—that is all too rare in digital music. Spend some time with Mathieu's gorgeous, absorbing tribute, and then return to Alien, and you may find yourself hearing the film as you never have before.","German musician Stephen Mathieu created Before Nostromo in homage to Ridley Scott's original Alien.

"Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs",Nadia Reid,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b24d13d197565213a74d/1:1/w_160/5a46f33b.jpg,2015-12-08 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21297-listen-to-formation-look-for-the-signs/,Scissor Tail,"New Zealand songwriter Nadia Reid's debut album begins with the kind of Zen-like certainty that only comes after taking stock. ""When I hit the ground in all my glory/ I will know where I have come from,"" she sings on ""Runway"", its opening track. Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs finds the 24-year-old Aucklander dissecting a relationship whose end illuminates new layers of failure and hidden motives with each re-examination. Reid's outlook on love may be hopeless, but her blunt words are cocooned by the warmth and unusual hookiness of the varied arrangements. Listen is a soothing, folky Americana album that recalls the work of Laura Marling, Gillian Welch, Hope Sandoval, and Nina Nastasia. Reid isn't reinventing anything, in other words, though Listen is itself more inventive than many records of its ilk. Its main mode is a kind of glowering hush made up of gentle acoustic guitar, glints of pedal steel from Sam Taylor, and Richie Pickard's glacial double bass, very occasionally chased by Joe McCallum's spindly drums. The band changes the pace with waltzing rhythms that evoke rural dance halls (""Just to Feel Alive""), or pare back the already-ghostly instrumentation to let Reid's nimble voice come to the fore (""Ruby""). There are a few electric moments that evoke the leap Sharon Van Etten took between Because I Was in Love and Tramp. The stormy weather of ""Reaching Through"" is broken up with sparkling, ascendent layers of Reid's voice and strings; the bowed guitars and clanking metallic chords of ""Seasons Change"" bring to mind the National. The gorgeous ""Call the Days"" marries the poppier sensibility of Reid's heavy songs with the grave palette of her more candlelit numbers. Throughout, she shapes her words into characterful, sticky hooks, which feels rare for this genre of music. Not to underestimate the experiences behind Reid's lyrics, but the loss of faith that unravels throughout the record comes off a little grave, reminiscent of those fogged post-heartbreak moments where it's impossible to believe you'll ever be happy again—the kind you look back on and laugh. And some of these songs are seven years old, written in her teens, which may explain why love is a ""fiery black disease"" and delusion, marriage is a convenience, and she can't even believe other people's happiness. ""Bittersweet I am when it comes to young love,"" Reid sings on ""Ruby"", exposing her occasional tendency for Folk Yoda-style inversions. But there are also beautiful, revealing turns of phrase: on ""Reaching Through"" Reid admits, ""If I am bound for something, honey won't you know, that I always take the shortest fucking road."" ""Seasons Change"" sneaks a crushing truth into the lifespan of a relationship: ""It's good to love a heart who surely understands/ The coming of the day/ The beauty of the land/ The act of being sorry/ The breaking of a man."" ""Call the Days"" feels like the resolution to all the heartache and anger, Reid declaring, ""I threw out my winter coat/ I cut the sleeves off all I'd known."" Although by no means the finished article, Reid's acute understanding of where she's been sets her up nicely for what happens next.","New Zealand singer/songwriter Nadia Reid's debut album dissects a relationship whose end illuminates new layers of failure and hidden motives with each re-examination.

It owes quite a bit to '80s and '90s goth-leaning college rock but thankfully never feels like a direct tracing thereof. It’s a good record for the winter, reflecting long nights, and the search for comfort and safety, the desire to wrap ourselves in layers. Where right on! sticks its landings—which it does more often than it falters—it’s in the moments where Lindberg’s bass work drives her songwriting. ""boom boom"" is a constant, tense pulse, a stutter in the chest; ""never"" has a classic goth club-floor feel. ""bully"", with its central, just-vague-enough threat of ""I’m not playing around"", moves like a shadow behind a theater scrim. ""riot"" has noise and discord at its core, with Lindberg’s howl buried in the mix and played to perfectly disturbing effect. It’s easy to overplay your hand with horror, the line between terror and corniness divided by camp, but that watery scream is genuinely scary. The couple of tracks that meander, though, are frustrating. ""blind"" is a bleak highway drive to nowhere. ""long lonely winter"" begins with promise, articulating the flatness of isolating depression with remarkable accuracy, but trails off in layers of synth and desert haze. ""he fresh"" feels more like sketch than song. But right on! is an immaculately produced record—again, not a surprise from a member of a relatively technical band known for their attention to detail. It’s rare to hear a solo album by a bass player that highlights that instrument’s primacy but doesn’t feel overly filigreed. The bass is the butt of jokes; the bass is the instrument people pick in movies when the other rock instruments are taken, and so bassists often feel like they have to overcompensate. Lindberg, thankfully, never falls into that trap. Her voice as an artist, as brought to highlight via production decisions, feels uncluttered and distinct.","Jenny Lee Lindberg (aka jennylee) is the bassist for Warpaint. More focused than the last Warpaint record, her debut solo album is subtle, with the softness and density of cashmere.

The Complete Matrix Tapes,The Velvet Underground,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1de5e6ef959693221cb/1:1/w_160/c2550b53.png,2015-12-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21317-the-complete-matrix-tapes/,InterscopePolydor,"The Velvet Underground were pioneers with blazing heads, Jesus' sons and daughter, the progenitors of seemingly everything that came after them. Assessing the four studio albums they released between 1967 and 1970 on the Pitchfork scale is like measuring a yardstick. They were also a perpetually struggling touring rock group like any other, playing extended engagements at large and small clubs all over the East and West Coasts, often two shows a night, to an audience of people who mostly just wanted to dance. The Complete Matrix Tapes is a document of that side of the band: Supposedly, it's a collection of the 42 songs the band played in two nights at a 100-capacity San Francisco club, The Matrix, some of which formed the bulk of 1969: The Velvet Underground Live with Lou Reed 40 years ago. The conventional wisdom is that the Velvet Underground were at their best on stage, and the high points of The Complete Matrix Tapes bear that out. The peculiarly thin sonics of Matrix owner Peter Abram's recordings don't do Maureen Tucker's caveman drumming any favors, but they make a serious case for Sterling Morrison as God-Emperor of Rhythm Guitarists. The first disc's magnificent ""What Goes On"", with Morrison and Lou Reed's guitars chattering together at breathless speed while Doug Yule hammers at an organ, is the wellspring for, among other things, the Wedding Present's entire catalogue; ""Ocean"" is the seed and the soil for both Low and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The version of the throwaway two-line rocker ""We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together"" on disc two is utterly thrilling, and the hushed, droning ""Heroin"" later in that set is a solid 20 years ahead of its time. Both ""White Light/White Heat"" and ""I'm Set Free"" are much more dramatic and vivid here than in their studio incarnations. That said, some of the Matrix box's extended vamps get draggy, and there's a lot of song duplication here: four versions apiece of ""Some Kinda Love"", ""Heroin"", and ""We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together"", three apiece of ""There She Goes Again"" and ""I'm Waiting for the Man"", two apiece of seven others. But The Complete Matrix Tapes is useful as a way to hear how the Velvets constantly reworked their repertoire. Yule later said of Reed that ""there were times when he would invent or put together songs on the fly in a performance, and he'd just turn around and say, 'Follow me'"". The bizarre take on ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" that opens the box is slowed down to a crawling blues, extended to 13 minutes with some seemingly extemporaneous new verses; ""Lisa Says"", which the group had recorded in a studio just a month earlier, has almost totally rewritten lyrics and an entirely new bridge. Their most protean song, ""Sister Ray"", turns up in a relatively relaxed, noodly 37-minute performance that's far from its face-melting White Light/White Heat incarnation. This box isn't exactly a grand opening of the vaults: as nice as it is to have all this stuff in one place, less than a quarter of it hasn't been officially issued before, and it's not like there's a shortage of Velvet Underground live recordings that could stand to be released for real. On the other hand, you can think of The Complete Matrix Tapes as a greatly expanded, better-mixed version of 1969 with less perfect sequencing and four songs missing, and considered that way, it's a jewel with a chip knocked off its top. Elliott Murphy's liner notes for *1969—*written in 1972, when the Velvet Underground were still a commercial nonentity with an enthusiastic but tiny cult—imagined a kid a hundred years later, in a ""classical rock'n'roll class,"" listening to the Velvets and wondering what to make of them. We're close to halfway there now, and their place in the canon is secure, but we still haven't entirely figured them out.","The conventional wisdom is that the Velvet Underground were at their best on stage, and the high points of The Complete Matrix Tapes bear that out.

Chi-Raq OST,Various Artists,by: kris ex,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b25613d197565213a761/1:1/w_160/5b281995.jpg,2015-12-08 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21305-chi-raq-ost/,RCA,"Chi-Raq suffers from Spike Lee's worst tendencies as a storyteller. The movie attempts to speak on Chicago's heartbreaking gun violence and gang culture, but it's not so much a narrative as a succession of overwrought messages and ham-fisted editorializing bolstered with history and current-events lessons, heavy statistics, and too many ideas bogged down by rhyme in an ode to the source material, Aristophanes' Athenian comedy, ""Lysistrata"". The soundtrack doesn't fare much better. Like the movie—whose trailers were met with head-scratching and rebuttals from Chi-Town rappers across the board—the music was met with controversy before even being released, when DJ Slugo, a Chicago native working as the film's music supervisor, was discovered running an unnecessarily complex payola racket for soundtrack placement. Upon getting caught, Slugo apologized, writing ""This is not the way Spike Lee nor his team operates and I take full responsibility for my bad decision,"" but the mini-scandal casts a harsh light over this collection. Like Dr. Dre's Compton: A Soundtrack, which featured not many artists from its titular city, Chi-Raq's original motion picture soundtrack is largely devoid of Chi-Town talent. The city's hip-hop elite—Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, Common—are nowhere to be found. Like wise, OG's like Twista, Crucial Conflict, and Shawnna are absent, and the new crop of progressive Chi-Town MC's—Mick Jenkins, Chance the Rapper, Rockie Fresh—aren't here. (Vic Mensa appears briefly in the movie as a hype man, but has no role in the soundtrack.) Most egregiously, save for a beat from Young Chop, there are no notables from the drill scene present—not Chief Keef, not Lil Durk, not G Herbo, or any of the other young talents who could have furthered dialogue about Chicago's horrendous and shameful bloodshed. The movie argues against intra-community crime through a lens of respectability politics—it all but ignores the systemic causes that have made the Windy City a war zone. The Chicago PD—currently under pressure for the cover up of Laquan McDonald's murder, not to mention Homan Square, its Guantanamo-like black site—is treated like an afterthought. Without an abundance of homegrown voices, nothing about Chi-Raq feels authentically Chicago. Some of the numbers seem picked from Lee's wishful thinking. Kevon Carter's ""WGDB"" (for ""we gotta do better,"" the de facto slogan of the respectability movement) is an incredibly sanctimonious string-and-keys lamentation replete with clunky (and false) observations like ""We're the only race that shoots and kills themselves"" and the laborious opening lines: ""Everybody's talkin' about brother Bill Cosby/ Looks like our favorite dad was drugging girls."" It's a song that would make sense within the context of a Hamilton-esque musical, but it's not presented in the film as a performance number—it just seems to be Lee believing his audience should be condescended to with simple answers to complex issues. The disconnect is an extension of Lee's heavy-handed and off-center vision. Nick Cannon, who plays a gang member named Chi-Raq, comes through with two songs in character—the uplifting ""Pray 4 My City"" (whose lyrics are flashed across the film's opening credits with ebonicized spellings—dey, dat, dis, cuz, Lawd) and the Young Chop-produced thuggery-by-numbers of ""My City"". Both songs feel like they're trying to bring Afterschool Specials back. There's no true gravitas in any of it, and the only place where these songs fit is in Lee's movie, with its reliance on outdated tropes, such as a ridiculous preponderance of gang colors and a reference to Brooklyn as ""Bucktown"". It's not all bad. Treasure Davis' ""Simple"" is a sunny and bouncing number about on-and-off love; Sam Dew's ""Desperately"" is yearning, body-grinding boudoir music; Mali Music and Jhené Aiko's Caribbean-tinged ""Contradiction"" is perfectly tailored for break-up and reconciliation. When Mali sings ""If you say that it's over/ I won't die,"" you're not sure if he's coming or going, but it doesn't matter, because the song just works. And here's a troubling thing: R. Kelly—still one of the most reviled and gifted artists in R&B—comes through with the album's best song. It makes so much sense—Kelly is as much a Chi-Town icon as Michael Jordan, Barack Obama, or Oprah Winfrey. And ""Put the Guns Down"" is topically in line with movie's message, especially with a guest verse from Tink, who notes that kids are ""Fifteen, buying a tool/ Just to feel more safe when they gotta make it home from school."" It's targeted, but not pedantic and—most importantly—it's girded by a four-on-the-floor track that actually entertains. When R. Kelly sings, ""Just do your dance, get in your zone/ No, they can't take you out that,"" meaning and music come together as they do nowhere else on this album. And that's the state of Chi-Raq, a movie that uses a term for a city that no one in the city actually uses: a soundtrack about said city that uses very few voices from the despair it seeks to shed light upon. Its best number comes from guy who is all but a pariah in the urban community, which all but ensures that none of these messages are going reach the people who need to hear them most. And that may be the real tragedy here.","Like Dr. Dre's Compton: A Soundtrack, which featured few artists from its titular city, the soundtrack to Spike Lee's Chi-Raq is largely devoid of Chi-Town talent.

Musique Sans Paroles,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b23513d197565213a723/1:1/w_160/c27ae170.jpg,2015-12-07 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21280-musique-sans-paroles/,Editions Syliphone ConakryEditions Syliphone Conakry,"Guinea’s state-sponsored record label Editions Syliphone Conakry closed permanently in 1984, with the death of President Ahmed Sékou Touré. The economic, cultural, and political situation in the newly independent African country had been sliding downward since the mid-'70s, but at one point the label had been a beacon for the country. Sékou Touré, perceiving that creating a strong national identity for the one-time French colony hinged on developing its culture, established a record label and a national radio station, distributing instruments to citizens and funding bands. The imperative was for the young nation of Guineans to create the voice of a new Africa. The sound that Syliphone promoted was an astonishing, elegant blend, embracing old Guinean folk music as well as newly heard Cuban music (by way of the Congo) and American jazz bands, all under the banner of ""authenticité"". In an ideal world, proponents of small government and shuttered arts programs might hear the twinkling, beguiling music rendered by Guinea bands like Bembeya Jazz National, Jardin De Guinée, Balla et Ses Balladins and be charmed into state sponsorship of the arts so as to ""Make (insert country) Great Again."" By 1976, Guinea was in turmoil, with a failed assassination plot on Sékou Touré, and detention of political dissenters. Some of the strongest music from Syliphone predates this struggle, but that's part of what makes Musique Sans Paroles (translation: Music Without Words), released that same year, such a jewel: Amid increasing unrest, Sans Paroles serves as an oasis. This compilation documents some of the label’s lesser known acts: Only one of them, alto saxophonist Momo Wandel, has more than one release to his name. Given the turmoil of Guinea, it’s likely that many of these groups never got the chance to record again. Opening band Sombory Jazz most closely resembles the flagship acts of the imprint, the rhythm shuffling between African polyrhythms and Cuban rhumba without quite settling. The horn work evokes comparison to Bembeya Jazz National, the guitar solo imbued with that rippling, eddying guitar tone so prevalent in the era, liquid and psychedelic at once. But from there, Sans Paroles explores little-heard wrinkles. Wandel’s ""Tam-Tam Sax"" emulates Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango but with squawks that bring to mind spiritual jazz players like Pharoah Sanders and Archie Shepp. Each song shows a stylistic shift. The seldom-recorded Quintette Guinéenne does a rhythm & blues number on ""Douga"", while ""Flute Parlante"" is as close as the album gets to words. Highlighting solo flute, it brings to mind the recordings that the old Folkways Records used to document. The highlight is Quintette Guinéenne’s second contribution, ""Massane Cissé"". A Griot thought to date back to the 12th-13th century, it exemplifies Sékou Touré’s mission to update his country’s traditions in the new century. Between the extended guitar solo and battery of percussion, it brings to mind the exploratory psychedelic rock happening across the Atlantic Ocean. Trio Papa Kouyaté, named and propelled by Miriam Makeeba’s longtime conga player, offers up two nimble acoustic numbers with Kouyaté shadowed by stand-up bass and acoustic guitar. Kouyaté’s conga playing hints at Arsenio Rodriguez’s groups of the 1950s. Close your eyes and the capital of Conakry starts to turn into downtown Havana. Or, in the case of ""Massane Cissé"", the epicenter of San Francisco a decade prior.","The music on this compilation documents the bursting scene in Guinea from the late '70s, when state-sponsored record label Editions Syliphone Conakry urged the residents of the newly independent African country to forge the voice of a new Africa through music.

Live and Unreleased: 1997-2000,Laddio Bolocko,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b23b9d034d5c69bf4b35/1:1/w_160/ce26280b.jpg,2015-12-07 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21283-live-and-unreleased-1997-2000/,No Quarter,"Formed in 1996 and over and done within four years, Laddio Bolocko was the strangest, most slept-on New York band of its time. They had some precedent in far-out outfits like Faust and This Heat, who used studio technology, isolation, and willful primitivism to push their music to into extreme places. And, because they blended '70s experimentalism with elements of American underground punk music, they had distant cousins in post-rock groups, like Tortoise and Trans Am (with whom they toured). Their vibe was very different, though. Tortoise was serene and vibey. Trans Am had a sense of humor. Laddio plowed down a different path altogether -- following common influences toward dark psychedelia and the occult. Live and Unreleased collects odds and ends pulled from Laddio Bolocko's archives, including rehearsal tapes, concert recordings, and a DVD's worth of grainy concert footage. These are hardly throwaways or fans-only ephemera, though. The set—which spans two CDs or three LPs—adds depth and dimension to the group's unfairly thin catalog, allowing a peek into the communal jamming and weeded-out home studio experimentation that drove the band's creative process. Liner notes by Oneida drummer Kid Millions give insight into the quartet's brief, grubby existence. After relocating to Brooklyn from southern Illinois during the mid '90s, drummer Blake Fleming, guitarist Drew St. Ivany, and bassist Ben Armstrong found a low-rent practice/living space in then-blighted Dumbo that offered no shower, but allowed no-complaints all-hours music-making. The 20-minute ""43 Minutes of (Excerpt)"" is drawn from this time and captures the trio finding its stylistic footing. They trance out big-time here, with Armstrong and St. Ivany plugging away at car alarm-style riffs on bass and keyboard while Fleming goes wild on the kit. The tape marked the emergence of an idea that would drive the band's later work—mainly, the skewing of the senses through high-volume repetition—and also possibly helped to win over saxophonist Marcus DeGrazia, who engineered the session and who would join the band full-time shortly thereafter. Looking for a change in scene, Laddio later decamped to an abandoned ski lodge in upstate New York. This period accounts for the collection's darker, more abstract material— where the band moved off the grid and completely into its own territory. Tracks like ""Catskills # 3"" and ""Catskills #5"" are full of alien melodies, haunting found sounds, and phantom piano tones. The music has an eerie energy to it, as if it wasn't so much being consciously written as channeled into existence. It's as if the quartet slipped down some strange Lovecraftian wormhole -- not so much in these sense that the music evokes horror, but that the band's druggy transcendence brings only disquiet and distance. After plotting out the material for their second record, In Real Time, Laddio ended its stay in the countryside and returned to Dumbo, where they landed in an even filthier crash pad. Not long after, the group called it quits. Armstrong and St. Ivany would go on to form the excellent trio, the Psychic Paramount while Fleming would do a few off-and-on stints in the Mars Volta and perform in the band Electric Turn to Me, along with DeGrazia. Awesome as they were, it's hard to say that Laddio Bolocko has spawned many imitators. They were just too obscure. Millions' band, Oneida, embraced similar ideas and sounds, but the drummer admits that during Laddio's lifetime, even he had never heard of the band. But it would be hard to replicate the quartet's magic, anyway. Laddio toured extensively throughout its existence and the live recordings included here—six songs taped during a performance in Slovenia—provide the some of the set's most compelling material. On stage, the band's strange and diverse ideas gel together perfectly. The songs are otherworldly, but visceral. The quartet performs with intensity and shared purpose that seems somehow paranormal, nudging out of their regular songs into unknown territory, searching out an ecstatic state.","Formed in 1996 and over and done within four years, Laddio Bolocko was the strangest, most slept-on New York band of its time.

Christmas in Reno,Cassie Ramone,by: Sarah Sahim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2595e6ef9596932229b/1:1/w_160/785a115e.jpg,2015-12-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21307-christmas-in-reno/,Burger,"""Alternative"" (in the loosest sense of the word) Christmas covers are usually brimming with positive holiday cheer, even if they have a slight humorous bent à la Yo La Tengo's ""Toymageddon"" or Ben Folds' ""Bizarre Christmas Incident"". Cassie Ramone's collection of covers, however, forgoes the usual Christmassy spectacle; the songs on here are dark and harrowing in their interpretation. As gusts of wind introduce both the record and Ramone's drawling take on ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"", she immediately projects loneliness and isolation. As she sings ""The snow's comin' down/ I'm watchin' it fall,"" Ramone counteracts Darlene Love's powerful hopefulness in the original song with sheer hopelessness. While she had some assistance from Ariel Pink on bass and Jay Heiselmann in mastering on her first solo effort, The Time Has Come, this time Ramone, formerly of Vivian Girls and the Babies, is truly on her own*. Christmas in Reno* was recorded and mixed mostly by Ramone herself, rendering these covers with a vulnerable and intimate touch. Nothing is tight and structured per se, but everything is meticulously executed in order to reach its intended effect: portraying a despondence and loss of interest in life. Reverb guides Ramone's disturbed voice on her version of Paul McCartney's ""Wonderful Christmastime"", letting her pain linger. The track fades out with a wobbly wah-wah, leading into a haunting and fuzzy rendition of ""Blue Christmas"". ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" is tragically slurred and toward the end Ramone's recital of Bing Crosby's popular lyrics becomes indecipherable. ""Run Run Rudolph"" is probably the most upbeat thing here—it sounds like a rough DIY track, which Ramone accentuates with guileless yelping. But even ""Sleigh Ride"", possibly the chirpiest and most festive Christmas ditty of all time, feels haunted. Ramone zooms in on the ""you"" in the line ""It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you,"" letting it linger with ache; she wants whoever ""you"" is to know how much they hurt her. Her memories of Christmases together with a former lover are too painful, but she tortures herself over and over, ending the song with a repeating ""you."" Christmas in Reno is uncomfortable to listen to—the tracks that you so often associate with being jolly are torn up into pieces and burned at the core. However, that's exactly Ramone's intention—to find the melancholy in a ""joyful time of year."" Bad things can happen to you no matter the time of year. She affirms this using Nat King Cole's ""The Christmas Song"", halfheartedly ending the record with a bleak ""Merry Christmas to you.""","Former Vivian Girls and the Babies member Cassie Ramone has marked her transition to Burger Records by taking on the modern Christmas classics.

"A Folk Set Apart: Rarities, B-Sides & Space Junk, ETC.",Cass McCombs,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b219b1335d7bf169a3a2/1:1/w_160/19bd70ad.jpeg,2015-12-07 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21289-a-folk-set-apart-rarities-b-sides-space-junk-etc/,Domino,"A friend once told me a story about the singer-songwriter Cass McCombs that I've always liked. One night, my friend was at a party in the Bay Area when McCombs showed up with a guest. It was a real punk-rock party. (My friend remembers overhearing someone insist that what people didn't understand about the American Revolution was that the American Revolution was still going on.) My friend was sitting on the porch when McCombs and his guest came out to leave. He said McCombs looked like he was about to cry. Not in a remarkable way, but like about-to-cry was his resting face. ""Well,"" McCombs said to his guest, ""we were just two sweaters at a sweatshirt party."" They left without saying goodbye. This was about 15 years ago, before McCombs had released his first album (the enigmatically titled A), but the sweater bit was prophetic. McCombs is one of those artists who looks out of place no matter where you put him. His biography says he was born in Concord, Calif., but it seems hard to say where he's from (in the metaphorical sense) or even where he lives (in the utility-bill one). He has no attachment to any particular scene, and though he has collaborated with a hundred unrelated artists over the last decade—including a producer for Vampire Weekend and Adele (Ariel Rechtshaid), the bass player from Phish (Mike Gordon), and an Academy Award–nominated actress (the late Karen Black)—he often appears to be totally alone, a tumbleweed drifting through the interior of nowhere. Characters in Cass McCombs songs are executioners, truck drivers, lifelong bachelors who treat liquor as their personal ticket to the moon and other people for whom being alone is not the product of bad luck but of religious election. At one point he only answered interview questions through the mail. The style of McCombs' music differs from album to album but all shares a low-key American spirit that joins the personal freedom of '60s counterculture with the reticence of late-'90s indie rock—cowboy music for people with a lot of library fines. As a writer, he has a trickster's gift for resignation: He makes misery seem funny and his ability to control it seem smart. (This is why I tell the ""sweater"" story: Half because it presents McCombs as a loner, half because it presents him as someone with the ability to understand his solitude so well that he can turn it into a joke that connects with other people. ) His most recent album is a B-sides and outtakes collection called A Folk Set Apart. It covers 2003 to 2014, from A through the Wild West epic of Big Wheel and Others. On it you will hear songs that resemble garage-punk (""A.Y.D.""), Neil Young ballads (""Bradley Manning""), nursery rhymes (""Three Men Sitting on a Hollow Log""), and stretches of recorded sound that people in the commuter pool would probably identify as non-music (""Texas""). One of my favorite things about listening to McCombs is that he seems unafraid to make some really bad decisions. This is a man who once orchestrated a three-minute outro that sounds like a dog sleeping in a clarinet (""Memory's Stain"") and interrupted an otherwise beautiful song to ask what it was like to shit in space (""Morning Star""). A Folk Set Apart is scattered by nature but it has some of these moments, too—moments in which some line or turn that at first sounds unnatural becomes a signal both of McCombs' quiet confidence and of his casual rebellion against the idea of how songs are supposed to go. It's easy to understand why he was fascinated with someone like Bradley—now Chelsea—Manning, the trans woman dishonorably discharged from the Army and convicted of espionage for her relationship with WikiLeaks: Not only is Manning a modern variation on the American outlaw, but the turns in her life defy every extant script. So start with Catacombs, or with the funereal WIT'S END or Dropping the Writ. Big Wheel is good, too. They all are in their idiosyncratic, prickly little ways. If pop's goal is to forge a path of identification between artist and listener, McCombs is defiantly un-pop, a singer continually trying to figure out how to outpace his audience's comfort levels without driving them out of the room. In modern parlance, Cass McCombs didn't come here to make friends. Which is good. There are plenty of sweatshirts in the hamper if you want them.","Cass McCombs's music joins the personal freedom of '60s counterculture with the reticence of late-'90s indie rock—cowboy music for people with a lot of library fines. A Folk Set Apart, a collection of B-sides and outtakes, is scattered by definition but still contains moments of his quiet confidence and casual rebellion.

The Ties That Bind: The River Collection,Bruce Springsteen,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b257b1335d7bf169a404/1:1/w_160/bf130e73.jpg,2015-12-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21306-the-ties-that-bind-the-river-collection/,ColumbiaColumbia,"The River doesn’t flow—it floods. Bruce Springsteen’s fifth album gushes forth with the fury of a burst dam, delivering torrents of despair, inspiration, heartbreak, and joy. Coming after the deliberate twin masterpieces of Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, records epic in scope but precise in execution, The River not only appears to be a mess but embodies the classic definition of a double album: it seems to be a clearinghouse for every song Bruce Springsteen had at the ready in 1980. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection shows just how wrong that assumption is. Expanding the original 20-song double album to a 4xCD set supplemented with video, it laughs at the notion that the original album was much too much by underscoring exactly how Springsteen intended the album to overwhelm. Initially, Springsteen planned to follow 1978’s Darkness on the Edge of Town with an album called The Ties That Bind but he withdrew the record in the fall of 1979, believing that it wasn’t ""big enough."" This claim came from the stage during a 2009 performance of The River at Madison Square Garden, with Bruce going on to say, ""I wanted to capture the themes that I’d been writing about on Darkness. I wanted to keep those characters with me and at the same time added the music that made our live shows so much fun and enjoyable for our audience."" On this box, the scrapped The Ties That Bind gets an official airing as the third disc on the set—here it’s dubbed The River [Single Album]—and it does indeed play like a truncated, miniature version of The River, containing in its 10 tracks seven of the double-album’s songs, along with two alternate versions of tunes that wound up on the released record. What’s striking is what’s absent: shorn of its party songs, the record feels gloomy and haunted—even ""You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)"" in a lonesome Sun rockabilly incarnation feels like a transmission from the lonely black of night. It reiterates many of the themes of Darkness, only without aggression, fury, or precision, the very things that give that record a lift that fights against its undercurrents of hopelessness. Surely recognizing this deficit, Springsteen spent roughly another year in the studio, reviving old songs and writing new ones, arriving at full-blown, completed recordings of most of these tunes, then picking and choosing from his surplus to create the final album. The result was enough material for another double album, presented here as The Ties That Bind, a collection that runs two songs longer the 1980 double-LP but winds up six minutes shorter. This is an absurd amount of shelved material—and, even with this abundance, there are a handful of bootlegged cuts that didn’t make the grade. There’s a lot of unheard music here, even if some tracks are colored with new Bruce vocals, a slightly sour grace-note that is only notable upon close inspection. Listening through the box, it’s hard not to be struck by Springsteen’s labor-intensive creative method. He knew the broad outline of what he wanted to achieve, so he kept tweaking his material in the studio, rearranging and recording until he found just the right emotion. If The Cutting Edge 1965–1966 proves how Bob Dylan sought to capture the lightning of a live performance, Springsteen always is seduced by the illusion of a record: sure, he’s invigorated by live performance—and the Tempe concert included here is tremendous, the E-Street Band at the peak of their power—but he sculpts his albums out of tracks that are powerful as recordings, not simply songs. This is especially true of The River, which Bruce loaded up with the purest, hardest, and happiest rock’n’roll the E-Street Band ever cut in the studio. ""She’s the One"" pulsated to a beat borrowed from Bo Diddley and Darkness surged with desperate passion, but Bruce’s first four records rarely touched on the ecstatic joy that can be had from just making noise. The River is full of these moments (""Sherry Darling"", ""Crush on You"", ""I’m a Rocker"", ""Cadillac Ranch""), and some of the weightier items trade in this same sense of exuberance—a sense of desperation cuts against the grain of the sunny hook on ""Hungry Heart"", and ""Two Hearts"" spins headfirst into unfettered romanticism. But this music is so simple, so visceral, that it’s often been tagged as throwaway, the detritus surrounding the haunting ""The River"", ""The Price You Pay"", and ""Stolen Car"". Thing is, these throwaways give The River its cinematic scope. Some of the newer additions were cut from a familiar forlorn cloth (""Independence Day"", the closing pair of ""Drive All Night"" and ""Wreck on the Highway"") while ""Point Blank"" and ""Jackson Cage"" split the difference between the celebration and sorrow. But the biggest distinction between The River and the original Ties That Bind is this full-on bash, funny and furious and entirely sincere in its worship of the sounds rocking frat houses and AM radio in a '60s that didn’t belong to the Beatles. It’s the Springsteen album that can easily slip onto any show on Little Steven’s Underground Garage, and this party winds up providing an ideal counterpoint to the sweeter, sadder moments on The River. Take the second side, which opens with ""Hungry Heart""—Bruce’s first genuine hit single, reaching number five on a combination of its hook and Springsteen’s general momentum—then dwells upon the cinematic escape ""Out in the Street"" and serves up two breakneck rockers before settling into the dreaminess of ""I Wanna Marry You"" and the stark ""The River"", the latter two hitting harder due to the companions. Each side is structured similarly, with the last song tipping slightly toward melancholy, the cumulative effect suggesting there’s no separating pleasure from the pain. It all comes at once and, depending on mood, The River either seems like the happiest or saddest of Bruce’s records: in its mess lies a mirror that reflects the listener’s state of mind. The Ties That Bind illustrates this sprawl was no accident. Within these 22 rejects—some of them sneaking out as B-sides or on previous reissues, including the 1998 box Tracks and the bonus disc on 2003’s The Essential Bruce Springsteen—Springsteen explores the same terrain as he does on The River: urban romance, accidental violence, working-man’s blues, and restless nights. Like its parent, The Ties That Bind achieves a delicate balance between adult despair and adolescent freedom: he may dwell upon ""Little White Lies"" and ""The Time That Never Was"", but he also borrows a song title from Claudine Clark (""Party Lights"") and tips a hat to Connie Francis’ beach classic Where the Boys Are (""Where the Bands Are""). Enough great songs didn’t make a cut that it’s possible to cobble together a killer single album from the outtakes—one that would open with the breathless ""Meet Me in the City"" and contain the cloistered paranoia of ""The Man Who Got Away"", the blank desperation of ""Roulette"", the open-hearted ""Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own"" and ""From Small (Big Things One Day Come)"", a heightened Chuck Berry story song Bruce turned over to Dave Edmunds. But like the completed album, what resonates is the magnitude of the sprawl itself. As they spill out, the songs play off each other, accentuating the sorrow or celebration heard in their predecessors. Combing through these outtakes, it quickly becomes clear how Springsteen, Van Zandt, and Jon Landau constructed each track to deliver its own specific visceral thrill and then culled through their finished product to find the cuts that fit their intended design. Some of these rejects rely on that headstrong old time rock’n’roll—""Living on the Edge of the World"" bops along to its syncopated swing, ""Paradise by the C"" is a roadhouse jam highlighting Clarence Clemons—but others play like ripostes to the E-Street Band’s peers: the live ""Held Up Without a Gun"" (which would later morph into the finished ""You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)"") careens like Elvis Costello & the Attractions, the chiming guitars of ""Take ’Em As They Come"" seem like an answer to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, while ""I Wanna Be With You"" pulses to the Iron City rush of Joe Grushecky & the Houserockers. Thirty-five years after the release of The River, it’s easy to think of Bruce Springsteen as existing on a separate plane from such contemporary kindred spirits or perhaps as somebody who only belongs to part of a self-styled lineage that runs through Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. By adding The Times That Bind, both the scrapped '79 LP and this new double-disc collection of outtakes, to The River, this box highlights the plain, prosaic ways he belonged to his time. On these 52 songs, Springsteen sings about gas shortages, cold beer, unemployment agencies, busted dreams, and Burt Reynolds, fleeting images of a blue collar America that unknowingly was entering its decay but these words are married to the sound of a working band that knows it has to work, aware that it has to have songs to fuel those marathon three hour shows. Springsteen never really let these straight-up rockers be part of his records again—maybe on Born in the U.S.A., but both ""Darlington County"" and ""Working on the Highway"" end in tears—but he also never quite worked the same way again, producing such a ridiculous surplus of finished material as he set out on his quest for bigger, greater things. The River brought Bruce to those heights, giving him his first number one album and Top 10 single, but it’s hard not to think of it as not a beginning but an end, the last record where he and the E-Street Band were not the biggest band in the land but merely the best. In that light, piling on a ton of unreleased music, all in the same spirit and feel as the final album and nearly as good as what made the cut, feels like a gift. And for those who may think four CDs and three DVDs are too much, consider this: for an album that is all about contradictions, excess and mess, more of everything is most certainly a good thing.","Bruce Springsteen’s fifth album gushes forth with the fury of a burst dam, delivering torrents of despair, inspiration, heartbreak, and joy. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection expands the original 20-song double album to a 4xCD set supplemented with video.

Rivers and Streams,Lubomyr Melnyk,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b26913d197565213a77b/1:1/w_160/4fede3dc.jpeg,2015-12-04 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21322-rivers-and-streams/,Erased Tapes,"Ukrainian pianist and composer Lubomyr Melnyk has spent his career developing a method of performance called ""continuous music."" In pieces that stretch anywhere from 10 minutes to nearly an hour in length, Melnyk delivers a sustained flurry of high-speed arpeggiated notes. By holding down the sustain pedal, he allows tones to ring out indefinitely, creating droning ambience and phantom melodies. The pursuit of continuous music has brought Melnyk impressive chops—his website boasts that he is the fastest pianist in the world—but little in the way of critical recognition or financial reward. In interviews, he has expressed some disappointment at falling through the music industry's cracks, his playing too unorthodox for the classical establishment and too traditional for the experimental music community. However, in the last several years, Melnyk has begun to connect with a larger audience through releases on small labels like Unseen Worlds and Erased Tapes, which concentrate on modern classical and electronic music. Rivers and Streams is Melnyk's third release for Erased Tapes. In execution, it's not too different from his previous works for the label. The music is busy and technique-intensive, but tuneful and meditative. As Melnyk plays, his melodies meld together, shifting in tone and volume. Because he allows the piano to resonate, the sound blurs, turning concise and complex patterns into aural fog. According to the composer, the album is a meditation on water—not a huge stretch given the steady, trickling, ambient nature of Melnyk's style. The performances are enhanced via co-production from label founder Robert Raths and London-based composer, Jamie Perera, who modestly augment Melnyk's arrangements with guitar. Informed by the work of American minimalists like Steve Reich and Terry Riley, Melnyk's music draws on repetition and also a certain degree of impromptu inspiration. However, those composers—Riley in particular—often employed alternate tunings and distinctive harmonies that helped to distance their compositions from Western classical music. Melnyk's music is just as expansive, but more conservative in its approach to harmony. He's more overtly romantic. Listening to the plaintive minor key melodies on ""Parasol"", you can understand how, for some, the pianist's sensibility might have crossed the sometimes-thin line that divides minimalist classical and new age. However, this is less of a liability than it might have been in the past. New age is no longer the reviled genre it once was. And there are other, more appropriate modern parallels. Melnyk's shifting chords and rising crescendos will click easily for those who follow post-rock bands like Godspeed You! Black Emperor or Explosions in the Sky. And in continuous playing, sustained repetition, and simple harmony you can also hear him as a more organic cousin to the burbling synthesizer music of '70s groups like Tangerine Dream or Ashra. This is not machine music, though. It's very human—serenity delivered through sustained concentration and ecstatic energy, via a lifetime of practice and perfection rather than the twist of a knob.","Ukrainian pianist and composer Lubomyr Melnyk has spent his career developing a method of performance called ""continuous music,"" one that splits the difference between Minimalism and New Age.

Second Toughest in the Infants,Underworld,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b221b1335d7bf169a3b3/1:1/w_160/bb241d6b.jpg,2015-12-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21265-second-toughest-in-the-infants/,InterscopeInterscope,"At this point it seems that Underworld are remembered, at least by casual observers, as the rave act most like a rock band. There's nothing really harmful about this interpretation, but acting like a rock band—a euphemism for ""had a frontman""—isn't really what separated Underworld from their peers. After all, the Prodigy and the Chemical Brothers both worked in the album format to great effect, and, like Underworld, their live shows and general demeanor had more in common with Oasis than with, say, Spiral Tribe. In fact, what truly makes Underworld unique, and what coincidentally most closely aligns them with rock bands, is that they took themselves really seriously; their ambitions leaned to the serious and important. Unlike most people—lots of ravers included—they thought these things could be achieved using the rave template. Second Toughest in the Infants is the band's second, spectacular attempt at making big, important rave music, and their second with young fusionist DJ Darren Emerson helping steer the ship (frontman Karl Hyde and Rick Smith had been making music, in one style or another, since the early '80s). It was reissued for its 20th anniversary this November, in both two- and four-CD editions, remastered and bundled with exclusive and/or unreleased extras. You can see the band posing in the album title, a funny little comment made by Smith's nephew that conveniently reads like poetic word soup. You see this, probably, before you realize the album opens with a 16-minute, three-part suite entitled ""Juanita : Kiteless : To Dream of Love"" and follows that with a 15-minute, two-part suite entitled ""Banstyle/Sappys Curry"". There it is, comrades: a heaping helping of Big, Important Music. If you want funny voices and funny haircuts, the Prodigy are in the tent to the left. The great thing about mid-'90s Underworld is they made this beat-poetry-cum-rave-anthem splice work against the odds. Their secret was to act as if Hyde was not a vocalist at all but rather a particularly charismatic sampler: spitting out short, repetitive phrases that were afforded little more purchase on a track's mix than any other melodic curlicue. As an album, and as disc one of this reissue, Second Toughest holds up marvelously, dominated by the shapeshifting opening tracks but also featuring fan-favorite ""Confusion the Waitress"" and the stupefying ""Pearl's Girl"", perhaps the fist-pumping-est epic in a discography chockablock with them. ""Stagger"", the tormented kosmische saga that closes the affair, betrays the band's album-centric aspirations and beats Thom Yorke to the meandering electro-ballad by a decade. The band's profile raised considerably with Second Toughest, which roughly coincided with the release of Trainspotting, the film making prominent use of non-album track ""Born Slippy.NUXX"". The track's popularity, and its association with the movie, perhaps unfairly tethers the band's sound to the '90s, though there's some comfort in remembering a time when music this loopy and progressive could dominate (European) airwaves. Disc two reproduces all of the exclusive material from the absurdly good Pearl's Girl EP—five long pieces over 35 minutes that would stand as most band's best work even before adding the worthy reworks of the title track—and adds ""Born Slippy (Instrumental Version)"", which functionally has almost nothing to do with the more famous NUXX version, as well as ""Born Slippy.Nuxx (Deep Pan)"", an intriguing but ultimately boring remix. Disc three offers a full slate of unreleased material, some of which (""D+B Thing"", ""Techno Thang"", ""D'Arbly St"") gives away its throwaway nature by its title. ""D'Arbly"", meanwhile is seven minutes of downtempo lounge noodling. Only an extra version of ""Pearl's"" and ""Bloody 1"", yet another loopy 16-minute epic (Underworld could do no wrong in this format in the mid '90s), rescue this disc. Disc four offers seven (!) different versions of ""Born Slippy.NUXX"" (often simply titled ""Nuxx""), several of them live. The main takeaway here is that you do not, in fact, want Hyde's scintillating vocal melody to continue for the entire runtime, no matter how much you think you love the opening minutes. But the disc also illustrates how much Underworld has in common with a jam band, iterating over long passages, massaging a track into form. Second Toughest marks the last time Underworld's blend of ferocity, earnestness, and expanse felt transcendent. By the time they returned with Beaucoup Fish in 1998 they seemed more like an institution than a contender. But there's an absolute trove of potent material associated with Second Toughest; lesser bands might've mined this period for two or even three albums. The remasters sound great, and the two-disc version makes exploration reasonable for the unfamiliar, though both the original album and the essential Pearl's Girl EP can be had for a song in your local used bin. For the fanatic, the four-disc version offers a couple of gems and a thorough examination of the genesis of the band's most famous track, i.e. exactly the type of thing you might hope for from a not-explicitly-necessary reissue. Underworld made a point of going deeper, and carrying on for longer, than most bands would dare; they're worthy of a reissue that does the same.","Second Toughest in the Infants is Underworld's second, spectacular attempt at making big, important rave music.

iLoveMakonnen 2,iLoveMakonnen,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b246ea9e61561daa68d2/1:1/w_160/f88751f5.jpg,2015-12-04 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21292-ilovemakonnen-2/,Warner Bros.OVO Sound,"The sense of intimacy social media allows with stars can be tricky. Even in the most naturalistic and organic-feeling social media moments—a Snap of DJ Khaled extolling the virtues of water and cocoa butter; unscheduled Twitter rants that turn into full-blown hip-hop feuds—an element of pre-meditated performance still exists. These guys wouldn't be successful entertainers without that instinct. iLoveMakonnen is one of a few genuinely engaging artists on Snapchat. When he Snaps himself covered in blankets in a cold hotel room, or of himself confronting pre-show jitters, his personality comes through so clearly it's hard to not feel moved. He's always seemed like a genuinely unique and humble guy, maybe somewhat performatively so. But what social media isn't in some way performative?*
* This matters in perceiving Makonnen's art because his relatability has always worked in his favor, even when some of his songs threaten to go off-the-rails, since his limited voice can only take him so far. He seems like a guy you know. ""Tuesday"" was a giant hit because it nailed something about the melancholy one feels when out on a weekday—it feels liberating, because so few people are out, but it can also be a stark reminder of the aimlessness that comes when you're unemployed, or depressed, or, in the conceit of the song, dealing drugs on the weekend. But those details didn't matter. We've all had a Tuesday (or Wednesday, or Thursday) night end far later than it should have. And it struck the kind of relatable chord that Drake does well, which naturally led to his golden co-sign. Fast-forward a year and after this spring's experimental but quietly compelling Drink More Water 5 mixtape, and Makonnen has released the official follow-up to his first EP on OVO Sound. Some of these songs have floated around for a year or so and are staples of his live performances. But more than even the first EP, which delivered a handful of great hip-hop-indebted pop songs, this sequel EP bursts with a confidence that's earned after you go through the hit-song-now-what? grinder. Compared to his last mixtape, the hooks are sharp enough to cut glass, and the sequencing ensures that every facet of Makonnen—from Heartbroken Makonnen to Riotous Makonnen to Warble Makonnen to Onomatopoeia Sex Jam Makonnen—alternates every song. On the lights-down, open-curtain starter ""Forever"", Makonnen hits the ground running: ""I remember when you said you needed a love that lasted forever,"" before the ominous beat finally drops. The open-throated ballad kicks off his second EP as ably as Tom Cruise scaling a mountain during the first moments of Mission: Impossible 2. By the time Santigold shows up to memorably rap a few bars, the hooks (literal and figurative) have sunken in—Makonnen is aiming for the fences with his pop instincts. However, the record is at its best in the contemplative heartfelt-loner love songs, like ""Second Chance"" and ""Being Alone With U"", in which Makonnen embodies his hip-hop-Morrissey role. Closer ""I Loved You"" perfects this formula with a stark piano on a trap beat. Makonnen offers formulaic Drake-isms like ""I know you think about me when I'm not around,"" but they feel fresh in context because we feel like WeKnowMakonnen. ""Trust Me Danny"" is the EP's signature moment, a windows-down banger that pays homage both to Makonnen's producer Danny Wolf and a viral Vine. It encapsulates Makonnen's aesthetic as well as his target audience—fans and students of hip-hop who recognize that hooks need to sail for maximum effect for a track to land as a rap anthem. Makonnen isn't another ""weird"" rapper cashing in, making disposable jokes and internet references for a Twitter-ready crowd before everyone wakes up and goes, ""Where are the hits? Where are the hooks?"" On this EP, he's angling to be a real pop star, to step out of the OVO shadow (which hasn't produced a major pop crossover artist since the Weeknd) and onto the radio. It's hard to know if that'll happen, but coming with a likable persona, real pop-songwriting chops, and an established audience never hurt anybody.","Coming on the heels of Drink More Water 5, iLoveMakonnen's sequel to his breakout EP bursts with a confidence that’s earned after you go through the ""hit-song-now-what?"" grinder.

A Head Full of Dreams,Coldplay,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b268c0084474cd0c1f7c/1:1/w_160/64b8f1da.jpg,2015-12-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21321-a-head-full-of-dreams/,AtlanticParlophone,"On the very first song on their very first album, Coldplay introduced themselves with a heartfelt declaration: ""We live in a beautiful world."" Fifteen years and some 80 million albums sold later, the British quartet haven’t elaborated on that philosophy—they’ve just amplified it. Where massive success has a tendency to make bands more jaded and aloof, Coldplay only seem more gobsmacked and in awe of life itself. Their songs aren’t just designed to uplift, they’re often about the very sensation of being uplifted. But on the band’s seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams, the band’s relentless campaign to raise our spirits is liable to induce altitude sickness. Of course, there’s a perfectly logical reason for the album’s oversold optimism—A Head Full of Dreams is a reactionary retort to 2014’s Ghost Stories, a low-key response to a high-profile split that literally wore its (broken) heart on its sleeve. The new album, by contrast, is Martin’s unconscious recoupling record, the sound of a freshly single man stepping out onto the dancefloor to lose his mind and find new love. ""You make me feel like I’m alive again,"" he sings atop the slinky disco of lead single ""Adventure of a Lifetime"", a lyric that succinctly sums up the spirit of the record like a movie poster tagline. A Head Full of Dreams is Coldplay’s chance to reassert the eager-to-please exuberance that Ghost Stories deliberately downplayed, and prove that Adele isn’t the only artist who can mobilize a monoculture in 2015. Though written off by detractors as middle of the road, Coldplay’s centrist position is what ultimately makes them so singular—they’re the only rock band that could (and would want to) wrangle Beyoncé, Noel Gallagher, Tove Lo, Norwegian Top 40 architects Stargate, Kendrick Lamar producer Daniel Green, alt-rock lifer Nik Simpson, and “Gimme Shelter” scene-stealer Merry Clayton on the same record. A Head Full of Dreams is emblematic of Coldplay’s burning desire to be all things to all people, rolling up symphonic Britpop bluster, club-thumping bangers, dentist-office soft rock, finger-snapping R&B, and even some trippy touches that remind you of a time when this band just wanted to be as popular as Mercury Rev. But the album has bigger ambitions. By weaving a spoken-word reading of an inspirational 13th-century Persian poem and a sample of Barack Obama reciting ""Amazing Grace"" into the mix, the album essentially conflates Martin’s post-rebound optimism with an all-encompassing, heal-the-world mission. His relentless need to take us higher feels most genuine when we get a sense of what got him so low in the first place. ""Everglow"" and the Tove Lo collab ""Fun"" bring ultimate closure to the Gwyneth saga with a pledge to enduring friendship (and, to prove it, the former track features Martin’s ex on backing vocals). And despite bearing a title that isn’t going to dispel their poor-man’s U2 rep, ""Amazing Day"" is a sweet ode to blossoming, post-divorce romance that channels the winsome charm of early singles like ""Shiver"". Best of all is ""Birds"", a shot of taut, Phoenix-styled motorik pop that provides a rare moment of intensity on an album that’s all about arm-swaying, Super Bowl-crashing bombast. Even when A Head Full of Dreams hints at experimentation, it inevitably drifts back onto predictable paths. The title track eases us into the album on a glistening groove but halts its momentum for a now-obligatory ""woah oh oh oh"" breakdown that sounds like it was focus-grouped into the song. When Martin sings ""I feel my heart beating"" on ""Adventure of a Lifetime"", the arrangement drops out, save for a throbbing bassline that mimics the sound of, well, take a guess. And the readymade, gospelized charidee-anthem-in-waiting ""Up&Up"" sees many of the aforementioned guests get together to sing, ""we’re gonna get it together,"" before Gallagher delivers a send-off guitar solo that essentially turns the track into Coldplay’s Perrier Supernova. At one point in the song, Martin asks, ""How can people suffer/ How can people part/ How can people struggle/ How can people break your heart?"" He doesn’t profess to understand the root of all our problems, but he’ll do his damnedest to provide a cure anyway. For all the record's eclecticism, Coldplay remain a band that put the ""us"" in ""obvious,"" blowing up the simplest sentiments for maximum appeal. Nearly every song is about ascension and transcendence, be it through intoxicants (the Beyoncé-assisted ""Hymn for the Weekend""), rocket ships (the unlisted, listless slow jam ""X Marks the Spot""), out-of-body experiences (bonus track ""Miracles""), large ocean waves (""Fun""), rooftop stargazing (""Amazing Day""), winged creatures (""Birds""), or just sheer force of will (""Up&Up""—and this from a band that’s already written a song called ""Up With the Birds""). But Martin has a tendency to sing of extraordinary, mind-expanding experiences in muddled metaphors (""My army of one is going to fight for you … my heart is my gun"") and rote ""high""/""sky"" rhymes. And with his many wide-eyed ruminations on stars and moons and hearts and diamonds, it can sound like he gets his lyrical inspiration from a spoonful of Lucky Charms. Martin recently told the Wall Street Journal that he wanted ""Hymn for the Weekend"" to be the sort of single that would soundtrack a bottle-service bender at a nightclub and, essentially, that spirit of bonhomie permeates the entirety of A Head Full of Dreams.

100 Ladies EP,Zora Jones,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b26513d197565213a774/1:1/w_160/73d64618.png,2015-12-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21318-100-ladies-ep/,Fractal Fantasy,"Zora Jones has described 2010 as her year zero. She saw DJ Rashad spin for the first time at a party in Montreal, where it was pretty much everyone's first encounter with footwork in a club setting. She and her friends ended up spending a week with the Chicago DJ, and he gave them a batch of tracks he'd produced with his Ghettoteknitianz crew. It opened up a whole new world for her. ""That folder is still one of the main folders I go to for inspiration,"" she told The Fader. ""Those tracks are so crisp to me and so influential. 2010 was the year for me."" You can hear the late Rashad's influence on Jones' debut EP, 100 Ladies—or at least, you can deduce it. Many of her tracks move at 160 BPM, smack in the middle of footwork's sweet spot. But in the past five years, Jones has also established her own sound, one that's indebted to footwork (and also to grime), but irreducible to either of those genres. It's several steps removed—and that's a direct result of the work that she's put in. The title of the Austria-born, Barcelona-based producer's EP is a reference to a pact that she made with herself: to make 100 tracks before she released anything. This isn't the first thing she has unveiled; there have been collaborations with Sinjin Hawke and DJ Taye on FractalFantasy (the imprint she runs with Hawke, which began life as an online outlet for audiovisual productions), and she's posted the odd solo track to her SoundCloud account. But this is her first extended statement, and the singularity of her vision is immediately apparent. Aside from the occasional anchoring 808 kick, she favors thin, silvery sounds: brittle rimshots, tinny hi-hats, and 808 toms tuned toward their upper limits. Her main instrument is the voice—resampled, stacked in dizzying fifths, pitched up near dog-whistle frequency, and painted on in bright, loopy brushstrokes. Put together, these elements combine to suggest club music injected with helium and sent bobbing high overhead. Of the album's seven tracks, only two come anywhere close to resembling established forms. ""Zui"", with its shuddering 808 patterns and stuttering monosyllables, wears its footwork influences proudly on its sleeve, and the lurching cadence of ""Too Many Tears"" sounds like an outgrowth of the ""weightless"" style of grime favored by Mumdance, Rabit, and Murlo. Again, though, her wordless vocal melodies stand proudly apart; they're eerie, shapeshifting things, part violin and part warbling bird, and their effect is spellbinding. The EP is bookended by its best tracks. The footwork-tempo closer ""First Light"" pumps away like Philip Glass rearranged for tin whistle, Gameboy, and chipmunk, while the opening ""Oh Boy"" forsakes drums entirely; it's just wordless vocal trills pitched up into icy configurations accompanied by the hollow hum of whirly tubes. Despite their novelty, both songs remain unusually moving; for all the flyaway nature of her sounds, her compositions carry real emotional weight. They offer the equivalent of a solid musical form being melted down and channeled into tiny, sidewinding rivulets; it will be fascinating to see where these streams carry her next.","Austria-born, Barcelona-based producer Zora Jones makes tracks indebted to Chicago footwork, but with a unique vision.

Civil Circus,Diggs Duke,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b064ea9e61561daa65fb/1:1/w_160/f1a0988e.jpg,2015-12-03 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20996-civil-circus/,Following Is Leading,"Across several albums and EPs, the singer and composer Diggs Duke has channeled the greats of '90s hip-hop and soul, with a multifaceted sound touching lightly on D’Angelo and A Tribe Called Quest. In 2012, he caught the attention of British DJ and tastemaker Gilles Peterson, who included the musician’s ""Nine Winning Wives"" on Brownswood Bubblers Nine and signed Duke to his Brownswood imprint in 2013. Duke released long player Offering for Anxious on the label that year, and made what I thought was a nice splash on 2014’s The Upper Hand & Other Grand Illusions, a quick EP that dissected the power struggles in romantic relationships. On Civil Circus, Duke reverts to the soulful sound he employed on Anxious, yet the vibe here is firmly rooted in jazz. Album opener ""Busker"", with its mix of saxophones and live drums, works well in intimate spaces and carries a strong hip-hop knock. While some of the tracks are traditional in scope, others have an alternative slant that fit alongside artists like Thundercat and Flying Lotus, both of whom put esoteric spins on funk, EDM, and rap. Civil Circus is full of shape-shifting compositions that make the album feel longer than its 26-minute runtime in a good way. The music feels remarkably spacious, and Duke’s songwriting is equally abstract and observational: Civil Circus conveys Duke’s innermost thoughts, no matter how vast or disconnected they might be. There’s a voyeuristic aspect to the album, and Civil Circus feels like a deep chat with a close friend. It’s almost gospel-like, and ""Compensation""—a poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar—hits the theme head-on: ""God, in his great compassion/ Gave me the gift of song."" ""Stoplight Lessons"" speaks to the newness of life and uncertainty of growing older. ""Old enough to crawl,"" Duke hums atop an acoustic guitar, ""but speech evades your grasp."" The album's structure gives way to a loose instrumental procession toward the end: ""Street Preacher"" and ""Bumper to Bumper"" stamp the LP’s panoramic view; ""Damn Near Home"", with its light horns and scenic moans, sets the scene for album closer ""We Don’t Need Love"", which chides superficiality. It’s a fitting end for the album and the impressive career Diggs has built so far. Civil Circus is about being honest and vulnerable. It's about looking up to observe the small things that make life so fruitful, and taking the time to appreciate what's normally taken for granted.","The singer and composer Diggs Duke channels '90s hip hop and soul greats with his light, mulifaceted sound.

Journey Blind,Magic Circle,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b21f5e6ef9596932223d/1:1/w_160/05024e1a.jpg,2015-12-03 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21263-journey-blind/,20 Buck Spin,"There's little better than the mixture of punk speed and metal riffs. Punk tempo supplies the adrenaline injection that metal's compositional superiority clearly needs. Massachusetts' Magic Circle are a variation on this principle: its members come from a variety of hardcore and punk bands, such as Mind Eraser, the Rival Mob, Innumerable Forms, and Doomriders, and they make traditional metal with a deceptively youthful spunk. Even as most of its members were known figures in their home state, Magic Circle's debut still came out of nowhere in a sense: who knew they were capable of this? Their second record, Journey Blind, doesn't have the mystique of the first, but it makes up by being more assertive. With its faster rhythms paying homage to that nook when NWOBHM was picking up but thrash hadn't quite emerged, the lead-off title track shows the influence of Stone Dagger, which features bassist Justin DeTore, vocalist Brendan Radigan, and guitarist Chris Corry, bleeding into Magic Circle. Don't get fooled by the Mellotron intro and think this will be a prog effort. Corry, along with Dan Ducas, turn every melody and lead into a hesher motivational speech. ""The Damned Man"" takes the majesty of the title track and gives it a more proto-thrash, biker-like thrust. Radigan is the ideal vocalist for this material, going in for maximum horn-raising wailing while maintaining a tough edge in most of the verses. Another spirit that Magic Circle absorb, albeit not as obvious, is that of early Pentagram. Radigan's vocal range is greater than that of Bobby Liebling's, but he is able to convey darkness with a light of hope shining through, like Liebling before he descended into the path that's been covered to death elsewhere already. ""Ghost of the Southern Front"" is where the Pentagram influence really emerges, with Corry and Ducas adding a macabre boogie to their riffing. Their ending solos have that purgatorial feeling of Pentagram's ""Death Row"", perfect for looping. Closer ""Antedivullan"" begins with a softer passage not unlike Black Sabbath's ""After Forever"", and when they rage into their standard battle charge, the song's placements gives it a do-or-die urgency. Much like Metallica's ""Damage Inc."", it's a choice anthem for going down swinging. Magic Circle belong to a special group of new traditionalist bands alongside High Spirits, Crypt Sermon, Ranger, Iron Age, and (on the more progressive, much weirder end) VHÖL. All of these bands wear their influences on their battle jackets while bringing a real hunger to the table. Journey isn't just a great heavy metal record, it also dismantles the narrative that punk was put on earth to rid rock of its excesses. Hardcore kids can do something with more complicated structures too, and can draw the same sense of purpose that metal has been excellent in instilling for decades.","Magic Circle's members come from a variety of hardcore and punk bands, but they make traditional metal with a deceptively useful spunk.

Return of the Tender Lover,Babyface,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ecc0084474cd0c1eb9/1:1/w_160/b8ae78a6.png,2015-12-03 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21228-return-of-the-tender-lover/,Def Jam,"In the late 1980s and early '90s, Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds, along with songwriting partners Daryl Simmons and L.A. Reid, developed a form of pop soul that's as geometrically precise as it is weightless. Songs like Toni Braxton’s ""Breathe Again"", Madonna’s ""Take a Bow"", and Boyz II Men’s ""Water Runs Dry"" occur in a seamless universe, all undisturbed surfaces that relentlessly shimmer. In 1995, ""Water Runs Dry"" itself seemed the most formally perfect incarnation of one of Babyface's primary pop expressions, the vaporous ballad; it’s gently animated by a brushed snare and an acoustic guitar, over which the members of Boyz II Men weave their voices together in fluid braids. Babyface’s aesthetic is a distant refinement and elaboration of Prince and, beyond that, Curtis Mayfield, both of whom condensed pop and soul into irreducible collage. He’s capable of elastic funk and vast balladry but both are organized by an unusual pop sensitivity. Return of the Tender Lover, his first solo album of originals in 10 years, is part a period of renewed productivity for Babyface. Last year he released an album with Toni Braxton called Love, Marriage & Divorce, which described the length of a relationship through both gliding surfaces and reduced, raw circumstances; this year he contributed minimal blossoms of acoustic guitar to the Ty Dolla $ign single ""Solid"". But his new album is a kind of retreat—Babyface reduced to plush textures. Though Return of the Tender Lover deliberately references his sophomore album, 1989’s Tender Lover, nothing here is as dry and muscular as ""It’s No Crime"", or generously expansive as ""Whip Appeal"". In their place is buoyant, effortless pop soul. It sometimes feels like a conscious inversion of Love, Marriage & Divorce; where that record was often capable of a fluorescent hostility, Return of the Tender Lover almost exclusively communicates security and support. ""We've Got Love"" and ""Love and Devotion"" convey an inflexible confidence, and the songs also seem supportive in their structure, as if engineered for maximum uplift. Babyface’s voice is as smooth as it's ever been, but it’s also always been somewhat granular in design; it sounds like a bloom of smoke. El DeBarge appears on ""Walking on Air"", his first duet with Babyface since 1994’s ""Where Is My Love""; like Babyface, DeBarge has been minimally present in the music industry over the past ten years, except for a solo album, Second Chance, in 2010, and in brief flourishes on DJ Quik records. His presence here is satisfying both texturally and textually, and ""Walking on Air"" is as rich and vivid as their previous collaborations. DeBarge’s voice is miraculously preserved, an incandescent peal capable of infinite ascent; in ""Walking on Air"", it seems to land somewhere in the troposphere. The only other collaboration on the record is with After 7, an R&B group from the '90s that contains two of Babyface’s brothers. On ""I Want You"", they supply harmonies, adding considerable weight to Babyface’s nimble vocal, and repeating the title until it melts into a kind of plural exhalation. The collaborations on Return of the Tender Lover and the design of its production feel traditional, in the sense that they don't attempt to update Babyface's sound and instead lean comfortably on a long, established career. This dedication to tradition and honoring of his craft is less a throwback than a micro-adjustment of an enduring formula.","In the late 1980s and early '90s, Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds, along with songwriting partners Daryl Simmons and L.A.

Wake Up!,Pope Francis,by: Jia Tolentino,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f5c0084474cd0c1ec8/1:1/w_160/4271d569.jpg,2015-12-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21235-wake-up/,Believe Digital IT,"""Pope Francis releases prog-rock album"" could only be a better punchline if the genre was swapped out with ""chillwave,"" and nonetheless, here we are. Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the 78-year-old Argentine, is the 266th man to hold papal office; he is the first to directly condemn climate change and revive liberation theology and to have worked as a bouncer, and although past popes have released classical/liturgical compilations, Pope Francis is the first to go straight pop. Pope John Paul II, for context, released three albums during his papacy. They consisted of classical sacred music, and none inspired fond remembrances by the executives who released them (the Pope's records ""shipped gold and returned platinum"", one industry insider recently quipped to Billboard). Pope Francis might be different: He is our meme Pope, the Pope of Kim Kardashian tweets and re-Vines. Just this week, he found himself the subject of a #Popebars hashtag that imagined him spitting raps by Eminem and Drake.  The Holy See's populace is growing increasingly unruly, and it's a trip to hear this confusion worked out musically in the age of Spotify. With collaborators that include a folk-swami, a theatrical lyricist, and a former member of Italian prog-rock band Le Orme, Wake Up! exists at a tremendously strange midpoint between a two-hour mass and a corporate recruitment video. It’s like you drank a bunch of cough syrup and went to Live Aid: The Vatican. Every track features a Barnes & Noble-CD-section pop instrumental, sometimes with additional choral or solo vocals, building momentum that halts when Pope Francis starts speaking. The opening track is ""Annuntio Vobis Gaudium Magnum!"", the Latin for ""we announce with great joy."" Following that phrase is an assumed ""habemus papem,"" or ""we have a new pope,"" and the excerpted speech is Pope Francis’s first one after being appointed. It’s a powerful moment to commemorate, only slightly compromised by the fact that the instrumental sounds like a holiday-themed IMAX. The song titles in Wake Up!, exclamation-point-loaded and decidedly outré, are in many ways better than the songs themselves. There’s a climate change track (""Cuidar El Planeta""); another track whose title translates to ""The Church Cannot Be an NGO!"", and one in Spanish that translates to ""Faith is whole, does not liquefy!"" There’s a track in Italian whose title translates to ""Do not steal the hope!"", and a closing track in Portuguese whose title translates to ""Do what he tells you!"" Only the title track (in full, ""Wake Up! Go! Go! Forward!"") bears a name in English. On it, Pope Francis speaks to a crowd after wheeling streaks of electric guitar, a cinematic horn section, the track gridded loosely by a high-hat. ""It is a duty to be vigilant,"" he intones, to a crowd in South Korea, as a light revue piano tinkles in the background. ""To not allow the pressures, the temptations and the sins to dull our sensibility of the beauty of holiness."" But, if this album is the indication, beauty isn't exactly holiness's sound. But there is something beautiful about this album; it exists. Pope Francis, already a more human papal figure than any in recent history, is humanized even further by this album's total musical awkwardness, its bewildering genre, its pluralistic good heart. The album's producer Don Giulio Neroni—who produced Pope John Paul II's 1999 choral album; the Vatican is on a relaxed release schedule, but a release schedule all the same—told Rolling Stone that he ""tried to be strongly faithful to the pastoral and personality of Pope Francis: the Pope of dialogue, open doors, hospitality."" He succeeded. Chill Pope, the leader of 1.2 billion people, urges you to accept this weird-ass album as your spiritual Genesis, your graceless way of saying Yes.","Past popes have released albums, but Pope Francis is the first to go straight pop.

Kannon,Sunn O))),by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b23f5e6ef9596932226c/1:1/w_160/f675c211.jpg,2015-12-03 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21286-kannon/,Southern Lord,"In 2008, Sunn O))) played a short series of duo concerts meant to acknowledge the band's modest, mimetic origins. Sunn O))) began as a tribute of sorts to Earth, the influential duo whose low, slow riffs and steadfast amplifier worship established the doom-metal mold that Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley were trying to fill anew. And for the first few years, that was the limit of the pair's output—lumbering riffs, played at a near-tectonic pace and deliriously high volumes. During the next half-decade, however, Anderson and O'Malley evolved. They incorporated a constellation of metal, noise and experimental guests into a series of high-concept records—White1, White2, and Black One, each of which expanded the pair's personnel and possibilities.They staged high-profile, full-length collaborations with counterparts and heroes. They turned concerts in clubs and cathedrals alike into frame-shattering, wall-shaking temporary installations, where robes, fogs, and a shrine of their namesake amplifiers shaped a sort of heavy-metal happening. More than a 10-year anniversary, those 2008 shows represented chances to jettison the excess and prove that the anchoring idea—chords played so long and loud the listener heard every overtone and felt every subtle change—remained potent. The new art-metal masters wanted to show they could still get back to basics. A year after those concerts, Sunn O))) issued Monoliths & Dimensions, an aptly named colossus that folded a horn section, a choir, a string section, a blown conch shell and black metal legend Attila Csihar speaking slowly into four pieces that were just ridiculous and divergent enough to work. In the years since, collaborations with Ulver and Scott Walker have also pushed Anderson and O’Malley farther beyond the early, atavistic comforts of Earth. Kannon is the first complete Sunn O))) since Monoliths & Dimensions, and it likewise documents a return to the elements for Anderson and O'Malley. Cut with a cast of familiar collaborators playing mere support roles to Anderson, O'Malley, and their amplifiers, Kannon reneges on that progression with a triptych of elegant yet underwhelming arcs and drones. It is typically loud. It is often pretty. It is, cumulatively, the first minor full-length studio album of Sunn O)))'s career. There are, no doubt, many beautiful and bracing passages throughout Kannon. Few musicians can summon the same mix of patience, intensity, roar, and meticulousness as Anderson and O'Malley; it's wonderful to hear them interact in the pristine, refined acoustic setting offered by producer Randall Dunn. Near the midsection of ""Kannon 1"", the bass, guitar, Csihar's obscured voice, and a capillary of feedback lock into a perfect unison. Even delivered through headphones, the sound is somehow paralyzing and exhilarating, as though a team of masseurs has just found all the right pressure points. The playing is so careful and the recording so crisp that, during ""Kannon 3"", you can listen to chords and notes arrive one by one and track their slow disappearance into the din around them. It's like watching time-lapse footage of solitary raindrops forming a deep puddle. But where Kannon exceeds as a collection of moments, it fails as both an album and an experience, especially given the general Sunn O))) scale. Brevity may be the only truly new idea the band incorporates here, as these three tracks just break the 33-minute mark. But Anderson and O'Malley don't seem to have squeezed the normal complications and layers into a tighter space so much as omitted them altogether. ""Kannon 1"" slowly gathers its riffs, pulling back the stage curtains for the subterranean rattle of an oddly subdued Csihar. ""Kannon 2"" begins with a wrestling match with a guitar that resolves in feedback and, again, introduces a familiar choir of incantatory voices, all surrounded by a wispy veil of electronic oscillations. The album's most unexpected instant actually comes at that song's end, when one massive, static bass note hangs still in the air. Percussion jostles beneath it, as though the enormous tone were rattling a household cupboard. Rather than explore the strange sound, Sunn O))) simply shut down the amps and discard it. And that's the problem, really: Kannon feels underdeveloped and rushed, like the start of a project that's been delivered prematurely. Since the release of Monoliths & Dimensions, Anderson and O'Malley have taken very separate paths. Anderson has re-launched the blues'n'doom outfit Goatsnake and retooled his label, Southern Lord, for old-school hardcore, crusty metal, and crossover fare. O'Malley, on the other hand, started an improvisational band with Keiji Haino and Oren Ambarchi, scored a film, composed for an orchestra, performed a new Alvin Lucier work, and launched a label devoted to such interests. That tension has long been an animating, thrilling force for Sunn O))). On Kannon, though, Anderson and O'Malley have opted to avoid rather than embrace it, to find a middle ground of compromise that steers safely away from the frisson of conflict. At least they sound good doing it.","Kannon is the first complete Sunn O))) album in six years, and it documents a return to the elements for Greg Anderson and Stephen O’Malley.

Pregnant With Success,Junglepussy,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b247b1335d7bf169a3e7/1:1/w_160/38a9571c.png,2015-12-02 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21293-pregnant-with-success/,self-released,"Junglepussy is working within a lineage of comedic rappers, from Biz Markie to Ghostface Killah to Cam'ron and Action Bronson, rappers who elevate the muck and mundanity of life with zany non-sequiturs, ad libs, and references. In terms of sharp-witted artists who led to the increasingly rare seismic belly laughs on the subway this year, she's up there with novelist Paul Beatty, whose 2015 book The Sellout sent up American politics and culture in a way that proves good satire can change your truth. Junglepussy's Pregnant With Success is another reminder of how humor can bring the audience closer and form an emotional connection. It's as bright as Beatty's novel is dark, but they're both charmingly demented, sharp-witted, and necessary social critiques. They remind me how humor can transform literature and music, forms that often aren't as empirically funny as film and television, bringing the audience closer and forming an emotional connection. She has a rare confidence that's rooted in playfulness: ""This pussy don't pop for you,"" she gloats on ""Pop For You"", a song with watery snares and a glitchy melody. The hook feels like she's playing a character, a parody of contemporary male rappers, but it's more of a roast that has its roots on the surreal experience of being a woman in 2015. It also riffs on the language of the oppressor, so to speak. Junglepussy spits: ""You look up to these dudes to tell you who to screw/ What she'll look like if she your type/ Compliment her if she's light/ If she's black don't get her hype."" The joke comes at the end, when she compares a guy who takes her to the zoo versus one who buys her leopard print lingerie: ""I got niggas taking me to see live animals and you're pulling up with animal prints?"" It's her perspective as a black woman, a regular woman, from New York City that makes this album transgressive. She raps as much about her voracious appetite as she does about fashion and sex. She references Money and Violence and haute Japanese eatery Nobu over a series of glossy melodies and booming bass courtesy of producer Shy Guy. She swiftly cycles through cadences that approximate the balloon-lunged bellowing of Ludacris and a spiky Da Brat flow. On ""Country Boy"", a song that feels like a nod to her Trinidadian and Jamaican roots, she channels Lady Saw's squawk and the grim commands of Buju Banton before issuing a whimsical sign-off: ""I be dutty winin' down the Yellow Brick Road!"" The beat on ""Get to Steppin'"" is the album's most aggressive: a synthetic Orientalist synth loop fights with battering bass and Junglepussy is in your face, exhorting you to step off whilst bigging herself up (""I was fuckin' with me when you wasn't""). It ends with a hilarious outro, a dorky jingle about online shopping and a rush of true swagger: ""When your Fendi boots come in the mail, time to front on everyone in here."" But mostly Junglepussy is pure idiosyncratic id; she is unapologetically crass (""If your face ain't a sitting place, fuck up out my face"") and freewheeling. Pregnant With Success*'* appeal lies largely in hearing Junglepussy talk shit like one of the girls, with the aim of pulling apart the patriarchy as she experiences it.

Top 5 Dead or Alive,Jadakiss,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2379d034d5c69bf4b2f/1:1/w_160/4306a29a.jpg,2015-12-02 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21281-top-5-dead-or-alive/,Def Jam,"Jadakiss' first LP in over six years had its title as far back as 2010, when ""Top 5 Dead or Alive"" appeared on The Champ is Here 3 as a teaser for a record due later that year (and then in 2012). Like the original Champ is Here mixtape, 3 proved far superior to Kiss tha Game Goodbye and Kiss of Death, but it was bittersweet all the same for highlighting Jadakiss' strengths (spitting raspy punchline bars over someone else's beats) and admitting to his weaknesses by omission (putting actual songs together, getting those beats for himself). Impressive first-week sales notwithstanding, no one expects Jadakiss to be a commercial force anymore, which would presumably work to his advantage. Without the temptation to cater to a non-existent audience clamoring for him to make pop songs, you'd figure the boundaries between ""album"" and ""mixtape"" would no longer exist. This is kinda true of Top 5 Dead or Alive; the problem is that one of the world's best and most frustratingly aimless rappers ends up in the same no-man's land he always does. The good news is that Jadakiss' typical means of scoring a chart hit is completely outmoded in 2015, so there aren't any chintzy Neptunes beats, unctuous R&B hooks or blatant attempts to recreate ""Why"" in its entirety. Yeah, Future shows up on the ""street single"", but he did the same favor for Uncle Murda this year—don't confuse his appearance for a guarantee of any kind of chart success. While Jadakiss can wild out on his own terms__,__ the gothic turn-up of ""You Can See Me"" is a long way from the Tunnel; for not a single second are we led to believe that We the Best producer Lee on the Beats, Future and Jadakiss were ever in the same room, let alone the same frame of mind here. Otherwise, Jadakiss continues to show why he was a perfect fit to do player introductions for the Brooklyn Nets back in October—Top 5 Dead or Alive is likewise an intermittently entertaining, but dead-end collective of big-money heavyweights long past their prime. Puff Daddy's yelling spree on ""You Don't Eat"" might as well have been sourced from a Bad Boy conference call in 1996. On ""Kill,"" Lil Wayne continues his path towards tragicomic, Neil Hamburger-esque performance art: ""She a Cancer, I hit her with that chemo dick"" would be a prime candidate for Weezy's preeminent sad trombone line of 2015 if he didn't just quote Smash Mouth on No Ceilings 2. While Jeezy occupies a similar ""veteran hardhead"" ground as Jadakiss at this point, ""Critical"" doesn't try to find common ground; instead, it's the kind of hyperactive hi-hat beat that predates Thug Motivation 101 with Jada on a double-time Dirty South flow that interrupted ""who's the best MC?"" discussions during the late 90s in New York. Despite its street-level money, power and respect rhymes, almost all of it feels divorced from reality, free of any kind of narrative grounding or personal disclosure: ""you can call me Paul/ long as Peter pay,"" ""If you ain't in the circle, for a square I'll get you lined"" are typical punchlines that generate a smirk and disappear completely, mildly impressive feats of wordplay that only have meaning within the format's strictures. You might as well be watching Jadakiss solve crossword puzzles. There are brief indications that Top 5 Dead or Alive was workshopped within the past three years. There's a track about smoking weed and, wouldn't you know, Wiz Khalifa is on it instead of Redman. The chorus of ""Jason"" gives brief mentions to Eric Garner and Ferguson. Otherwise, Jadakiss has to remind you of a time when ""top 5 dead or alive"" was something fans of mainstream rap actually discussed: ""Synergy"" is the requisite give-n-go tandem rap with Styles P and it's flagrantly modeled after ""We Gonna Make It"", right down to the cadence of the hook. Even if there isn't the requisite track here in the style of ""Why,"" Jada can't help but invoke its most infamous line (the one about Bush knocking down the towers). In the most desperate recall of his glory days, Jadakiss spits, ""you heard my name on the last verse of 'Ether,'"" which is technically true but feels like the equivalent of a boxing judge taking credit for Ali/Frazier. Beyond muddled aims, extremely confusing and tone-deaf skits also seem to be a constant on Jadakiss projects. ""Ahaa Interview"" is a Madd Rapper-style Q&A where a salty veteran claims he's going solo over his resentments towards Jadakiss. You'd swear this was a scorched-earth attack on Sheek Louch, except the guy shows up two tracks later. I mean, Puff Daddy is here too, so I guess he didn't take ""Rape'n U Records"" skit to heart either. More importantly, a patron who sure sounds a lot like Busta Rhymes starts complaining about how heads don't check for ""bars"" anymore and now it's all about dancing and wearing blouses. You'd swear this was a diss against Young Thug, who's frankly been packing more inventive wordplay into a single verse these days than Jada does on the entirety of this ""rapper's rapper"" album.","Jadakiss's first LP in over six years features Jeezy, Puff Daddy, Future, and others. At a point in his career when he should be completely free from commercial expectations to make whatever music he wants, one of the world's best and most frustratingly aimless rappers ends up in the same no-man's land he always does.

White Light from the Mouth of Infinity / Love of Life,Swans,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b21a9d034d5c69bf4b01/1:1/w_160/38642e3f.jpg,2015-12-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21259-white-light-from-the-mouth-of-infinity-love-of-life/,Young GodYoung God,"In the half-decade since Swans reformed, they have hammered away at a monolithic, all-consuming sound with unwavering focus. The three albums they've released since Michael Gira resurrected the project—2010's My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky, 2012's The Seer, and 2014's To Be Kind—taken together with contemporaneous tours and live albums, all feel like variations upon a single theme, expressions of an essential Swans-ness. For a while, though, they were the most mutable of bands. In a half-decade span beginning in the mid '80s, they swiftly transformed from bone-crushing no wave brutalists to God-fearing gothic rockers, and then to featherweight neo-folkies. White Light from the Mouth of Infinity and Love of Life, originally released in 1991 and 1992, respectively, marked the end of that metamorphosis, as the band settled into a sound at once songful and vast, luminous as a glass menagerie and forceful as a falling anvil. The two albums have long been treated as minor works in Swans' discography: out of print for years, they were cherry-picked (alongside selections from 1989's major-label fiasco The Burning World and the Gira/Jarboe side project the World of Skin) for 1999's inauspiciously titled Various Failures 1988-1992. ""I'm ambivalent about much of it, but then what do I know????"" Gira has written of the music on that anthology. ""Some of it is genuinely good I think. Anyway, I was learning (how to write a song) as I went."" It's true that the period marked a shift from pummeling mantras to something more ""musical,"" with singing instead of shouting and cascading chords instead of just drop-tuned gut-punches. That said, even here, Gira's concept of ""songwriting"" remains idiosyncratic: there's little in the way of verse/chorus structures, mainly just mantra-like incantations and chords wreathed around gleaming pedal tones surrounded by wide-open expanse. Drummers Anton Fier (White Light) and Vincent Signorelli and Ted Parson (Love of Life) lay into their snares with military gusto, driving the music forward in surging tattoos, and their nonstop rattle contributes to a sensation of overwhelming excess. Close your eyes, and you can practically see the sounds exploding like fireworks against the darkness of your lids. The textures and tone colors are well suited to Gira's favorite themes, like love, death, and the sublime. Where early Swans lyrics were notable largely for their grueling power dynamics and limitless abjection—see ""Raping a Slave"", ""Filth"", ""Cop"", etc.—here Gira explores a more nuanced perspective. It's hardly all kittens and rainbows; both albums are littered with ugliness, from the dirge-like ""Better Than You"" (""So glad I'm better than you,"" he sings, in the world's most dead-eyed Dear John letter) to the claustrophobic ""Amnesia"", where he tells us ""sex is a void filled with plastic"" and ""everything human's necessarily wrong."" Gira has rarely wallowed as beautifully as he does on ""Failure"", one of the great nadirs—in the best way possible—of the band's catalog. Over bluesy acoustic guitar and frigid digital synthesizers, his preacher's drawl drips like blood from a stone; it would be hard to imagine a voice with more gravitas. But Gira has never met a dichotomy he could resist—he eats love and hate, sprinkled with a bit of good and evil, for breakfast—and here we can see the pendulum beginning to tip from darkness back to daylight. ""Her"" wraps clanging, Children of God-style thunderbolts around one of the tenderest love songs Gira has ever written, and ""Song for the Sun"", ""Love of Life"", and ""The Sound of Freedom"" all stretch their arms wide to embrace the limitless possibility of the universe, anticipating the way that love and spiritual ecstasy will return to the fore in the group's post-reunion work, particularly on 2014's To Be Kind. A bonus disc accompanying the reissues is mostly anticlimax. It features a handful of alternate takes and mixes from both albums, along with a Burning World-era B-side, selections from the World of Skin's Ten Songs for Another World, and a few live songs from Omniscience and Anonymous Bodies in an Empty Room, plus another live cut, ""The Unknown"", that doesn't seem to have been released before but probably could have stayed that way. There's a fair amount of overlap with Various Failures, and the sequencing is haphazard, zigzagging from release to release without much rhyme or reason. But it's never a bad thing to be reacquainted with Jarboe's harrowing rendition of Nick Drake's ""Black Eyed Dog"", and her a cappella rendering of ""Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes"", a centuries-old popular English song, is a welcome addition. (Both are from the World of Skin's 1990 album Ten Songs for Another World.) That the bonus disc leaves off ""God Damn the Sun"", The Burning World's heartbroken highlight, seems like a missed opportunity. In fact, at this point, a full Burning World reissue (along, perhaps, with both the band's 1988 ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" covers) is long overdue, no matter how much Gira professes to regret making that album. Who knows, maybe he'll eventually come around. But for now, for anyone who wants to understand Swans' path from atonal self-flagellators to beatific supplicants of the sublime, these two reissues light the way, blindingly.","In a half-decade span beginning in the mid '80s, Swans swiftly transformed from bone-crushing no wave brutalists to God-fearing gothic rockers, and then to featherweight neo-folkies.

Free Fall EP,Jlin,by: Britt Julious,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2525e6ef95969322290/1:1/w_160/11270817.jpg,2015-12-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21302-free-fall-ep/,Planet Mu,"Jlin's debut album Dark Energy felt like a keyhole peek into a bedroom producer's mind. In the broad array of vocal and synth samples, off-beat time signatures that varied from song to song, and even within the song itself, the conjunction of tens of ideas competing for dominance, you could hear a singular aesthetic being forged. One can imagine Jlin (Jerrilynn Patton) spent hours crafting the music in a way that spoke to her. On her new EP, Free Fall, this same excitement is still at work, though not in a manner as excitingly weird as Dark Energy. Dark Energy was a record for the individual, feeling more at home for solo listening than in a club setting*. Free Fall* feels like a tribute to the sounds that brought her to where she is. It is critical that these tracks are gathered on a single EP; it's not that they don't have a place in her larger oeuvre, but they also feel distinctly familiar in a way that Dark Energy did not. But because Patton is still smarter than almost any of her peers, it means that Free Fall creates the kind of thrills that only she can provide. The EP builds to peaks that grip the heart in a joyful vice; the listener will feel both excited and overwhelmed and unsure which emotion to embrace over the other. Certain songs elicit this feeling more than others. ""Eu4ria"", like the aptly named ""Guantanamo"" from her debut, layers piercing screams and yells to create a horror-laden universe in three minutes. The track also sounds connected to Dark Energy closer ""Abnormal Restriction"", as definitive a statement about Patton's musical identity as you'll get. Populated with samples of Faye Dunaway's turn as Joan Crawford in Mommie Dearest, ""Abnormal Restriction"" added a blood-freezing exclamation point to the end of the album. ""Eu4ria"" is lighter; Patton sampled an iconic phrase from the original film version of Stephen King's Carrie. ""They're all gonna laugh at you,"" Carrie's mother yelled to her daughter in the film. Here, the phrase is interspersed in a frenetic beat that transforms it from a cry of anger and desperation to one of defiance. ""I Am the Queen"" and ""BuZilla"" are two biting pieces of footwork that don't let up and shouldn't. It's not the sometimes lovely structural sonics of classic Chicago South Side footwork. Instead, like the EP itself, the tracks push things into weirder realms of aural storytelling in a matter of minutes. ""BuZilla"" reuses the phrase ""live and let die."" The longer one listens to the track, the more it feels like a call that refuses to wait for a response. Whatever happens will happen. Patton will continue to create regardless. It's an aggressive and focused answer to her ""genre."" Whereas Dark Energy was fueled by a personal, cinematic vision of doom, Free Fall is an invigorating wash of sounds, a collection of ideas that meld together the past with Patton's present to form another hard-won and potent artistic statement.","Jlin's debut album Dark Energy felt like a keyhole peek into bedroom producer Jerrilynn Patton's mind.

PRODUCT,SOPHIE,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d29d034d5c69bf4a9d/1:1/w_160/12a8637a.jpg,2015-12-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21212-product/,Numbers,"When music from the project SOPHIE first emerged in 2013, it sounded state-of-the-art. It was the work of a producer who had rarely been photographed and who never gave interviews, which seemed appropriate if also tiresome. Such mystery had long become a cliché by this point, but uncertain authorship suited these bulbous, sparkly audio objects, which seemed to float down out of the sky like a cluster of neon-colored balloons ready to pop. ""Bipp"" and ""Elle""—the former impossibly buoyant with an earworm vocal line, the latter featuring deep bass and chasms of space, a bright and twinkly counterpoint to the grim tone common to dubstep—promised that future music was going to be weirder and more disorienting than we imagined but that it would also function as a bent version of popular song. Two years and several singles later, SOPHIE—long known to be the work of London-based producer Samuel Long—is now understood mostly in the context of PC Music, a loose UK collective centered on producer A. G. Cook that recasts brazen commercialism as a kind of winking postmodern art project. PRODUCT, which collects the SOPHIE singles to date and adds some new songs, was released in limited-edition versions that packaged it with a jacket, sunglasses, and platform shoes, as well as a version sold with an object that looked like a sex toy. When you take into account that bounty of merch, and add the fact that SOPHIE’s ""Lemonade"" has in the last year been used to soundtrack a McDonald’s commercial, of all things, it’s clear that the act of buying and selling is deeply embedded within this project. You might look at all this as a Warholian transformation of commerce into art or you might just see a run-of-the-mill cash-in, but neither of these perspectives adds much to the enduring brilliance of SOPHIE’s first pair of singles. Following on ""Bipp"" and ""Elle"", ""Lemonade"" intensifies the sound, like switching from a freshly squeezed glass of the titular drink to drinking Minute Maid concentrate right out of the cardboard can. Befitting music constructed at least in part as a critique of consumerism, SOPHIE’s tracks are gleaming and immaculate on the surface and hollow to the core beneath it. ""Hard""’s chiming synths and rippling bass are again set against wide spaces of unnerving silence, a void where a deeper sense of meaning might be. These tracks argue, often convincingly, that the surface is everything. It’s Turing Test pop: if its exterior catches your ear and makes you feel things, that communication is proof enough that some kind of soul resides inside the machine. The closing track here, ""Just Like We Never Said Goodbye"", shows this contrast in widescreen. It’s a melodic construction worthy of Max Martin, but the pitched-up voice, drum-free production, and generally half-finished feel highlight all the immediate pleasures of pop music while completely erasing the idea of a point of view. It’s so ""almost there"" you can’t help but play it over and over. But SOPHIE is not, alas, an album-length proposition. Even at 26 minutes, the record drags, and the three song stretch of ""MSMSMSM"", ""Vyzee"", and ""L.O.V.E.""—that’s 38 cents of your album dollar—is depressingly skippable. These tracks either recycle bits from the earlier singles (chirpy vocals, squeaky percussion) or fold in new elements that sound mundane (trap percussion, doomy synths), leading to tracks that sound like they could have come from anybody. That these are the newer songs doesn’t help matters or bode particularly well for what might come next. And then there’s the fact that music this compressed and this syrupy is best heard in small doses, before your ear gets tired listening to it. So the main problem with PRODUCT, ironically enough, is one of format. Every industrialist wanting to get his or her goods to the world knows that you have to package them properly. Heard individually and spaced many months apart, the best tracks here were diamond-hard realizations of very specific sonic ideas; placed on an album alongside songs that use similar ingredients but are markedly inferior, they rattle around in the can, perfect objects in search of the right container.","When music from the twisted pop project SOPHIE first emerged in 2013, it sounded state-of-the-art. Those early singles, gathered here with some newer material, still sparkle, but the problem with PRODUCT, ironically enough, is one of format.

Catalina Breeze,The Blue Jean Committee,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b25513d197565213a75d/1:1/w_160/cf0b96a0.png,2015-12-01 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21304-catalina-breeze/,Drag City,"This summer, Jenny Hval sang of ""soft dick rock"" on her incredible and unsettling Apocalypse, girl. She explained to Pitchfork that part of this idea—an inverse of hyper-masculine cock rock—stemmed from her watching the two-part, three-hour History of the Eagles documentary. Like Hval, ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni Bill Hader and Fred Armisen found something to ponder with History of the Eagles. On a two-episode chunk of their new parody series ""Documentary Now!"", they paid tribute to the same expansive documentary that inspired Hval. But instead of the Eagles, Armisen and Hader focused on the fictitious Blue Jean Committee. What started out as fake has become fact with the Blue Jean Committee’s new EP, Catalina Breeze. The duo don't just lend their faces to the band: they wrote and recorded all these songs themselves, too—Armisen has a long history as a drummer, and is currently the bandleader on ""The Late Show with Seth Myers"", his ""Documentary Now!"" co-creator and ""SNL"" cohort. Catalina Breeze barely passes the 10-minute mark through seven songs, but even in its brevity, Hader and Armisen manage to hit every hallmark of the California band they sought to be in ""Documentary Now!"". The opening title track offers the most complete portrait of the Blue Jean Committee: keys mix with bongos and a swishy percussion section, while the repeating chorus of ""Catalina breeze, Catalina"" is just as breezy as you’d hope. It feels so comfortable and familiar that, for a minute, it feels like it’s not just funny business after all. Later, ""Gentle and Soft"" arrives as a harmony-heavy acoustic ballad adorned with an occasional twinkling chime. Elsewhere on Catalina Breeze, it feels like the Blue Jean Committee is trying to hit as many '70s songwriting themes as they can in as little time as possible. ""Going Out to Hollywood"" follows the trope of a narrative of a small-town diner waitress who’s got bigger dreams than her home can accommodate, while ""Mr. Fix It"" directly recalls ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" in its jumpy, earnest appeal to a powerful cosmic figure. The band throws the slightest bit of funk into the mix with ""Mama You’re a Dancer"", and ""Walking Shoes"" mimics the not-so-Southern rock peddled by the likes of the Doobie Brothers with a banjo hiding under peppy guitar licks. All of this is enjoyable for music nerds, who get to pick out the embedded inspirations and influences. But ultimately Catalina Breeze is an impressive, if perhaps not entirely necessary, follow-through on a joke. It wasn’t enough for these songs to exist on TV; they had to get cut to vinyl and put out through Drag City, as well. Catalina Breeze makes for a fun exercise, but as a standalone release, it’s a little, well, soft.","The Blue Jean Committee is a fictitious soft-rock '70s soft-rock band fronted by SNL alumni Bill Hader and Fred Armisen.

Love Is a Hurtin' Thing,Gloria Ann Taylor,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b227ea9e61561daa68ad/1:1/w_160/601c9f1b.png,2015-12-01 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21269-love-is-a-hurtin-thing/,Ubiquity,"A month before the release of their debut album on 4AD, U.S. Girls dropped the video for the Slim Twig-produced single ""Window Shades"". For most listeners, it was a song about the emotional breakthrough of a woman finally confronting her unfaithful partner. But its production, with looped strings, piano, and hand drum, was startling to deep soul fans. ""Window Shades"" incorporated a licensed sample of Gloria Ann Taylor's 1973 single, ""Love Is a Hurting Thing"", a song found on a privately-pressed 12"" called Deep Inside You featured one of the more anonymous spirograph sleeves from that era. Seen in the racks, the 12"" might have looked like any number of local gospel or marching band albums from the mid-'70s, but this one came with a twist: a copy of the release, credited to Gloria Ann Taylor and Walt Whisenhunt's Orchestra, routinely tops four figures in online auctions, making it one of the most coveted soul/disco albums of its ilk. Deep Inside You is the centerpiece of Love Is a Hurtin' Thing, Ubiquity's long-gestating compilation of highlights from Gloria Taylor's brief career, gathering five singles recorded between 1971 and 1977. For those of more modest means who've relied on mp3s culled from long-deleted music blogs, Hurtin' Thing fills in her discography as well as her biography. The mystery inherent in her music has led to some strange speculations online. Even her Discogs page puts her birthplace as Alabama, saying that she formed gospel group Sweet Honey in the Rock and passed away 10 years ago (no doubt conflating her with one Gloria Ann Taylor-James). As these liner notes clarify, though, Taylor was actually born in a coal-mining town in West Virginia and is still very much with us. That Gloria Ann Taylor didn't become a household name isn't of much concern now. It's difficult to become a star, much easier to be star-crossed, to find your music lost to time. So the fact that she never made it is not cosmic injustice so much as the actual indifference of the universe. It was in fact at the start of Taylor's career as a soul singer based in Toledo that she had her best shot at stardom. Compared favorably to Aretha Franklin, she had a powerful, church-bred voice that caught the attention of one of James Brown's arrangers and associates, Walt Whisenhunt, fresh off of working on Doris Troy's ""Just One Look"". They became both musical partners and a couple. The number of forgotten, obscure, or lost soul singers revived in the 21st century runs long and deep, the ""personal sacrifice, failed relationships, and missed opportunity"" that these notes describe are all attendant of this peculiar genre. But before allowing hard-knock biography to color the reception of Love Is a Hurtin' Thing, just listen to the opening seconds of the title track. A blistering psychedelic guitar solo, like something left off of Nuggets, flares across the opening 10 seconds, but 20 seconds in, we're awash in opulent strings, piano, and Taylor's voice, a powerful instrument that seem to be echoing from a subterranean tunnel. As production choices for a potential hit single in the early 1970s go, it's baffling, one part psych-rock, one part Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra, all competing with the fresh wound of Taylor's voice. There's a raw pain and cavernous hurt in Taylor's every exhalation, the lyrics questioning how love could bring such joy and pain. And the music itself is bent on evoking all of the ecstasy and agony, the crazed jags of adoration and confusion that stems from a dysfunctional relationship. ""How Can You Say It"" has Taylor talk about giving her lover her last dime, then finding tears on his pillow. That wrenching whiplash of emotions are scored by lush orchestration and percussion swaddled in so much echo so as to suggest the sound Lee Perry would get out of the Black Ark in a few years' time. Same goes for ""Deep Inside of You"", where the strings, vibraphone, and Taylor's voice are all doused in heavy reverb, and for an instant, everything becomes disorienting and indistinct. No other soul producer in that era would smother their vocalist in so many effects or arrange backing harmonies at such cross purposes to the main melody. So while Taylor voices heartbreak and anguish, Whisenhunt's idiosyncratic productions suggest something close to madness. But his choices—which no doubt made mainstream success impossible—are staggering 40 years on. On the haunting dirge of ""Burning Eyes"", Taylor's voice frays before our ears, shadowed by a muted trumpet and a horn section that seems to have lurched up from a graveyard. ""World That's Not Real"" is ominous yet ephemeral, buoyed by xylophone and Taylor's desolate voice. Almost a minute in, the piano hits a chord that Oliver Wang at Soul-Sides once deemed ""Death's ringtone,"" yet at that, the song briefly brightens, only to sidle back into darkness, perching at the edge of the void. Harrowing and feverish as these sides are, the most uncanny song remains the seven-minute version of ""Love Is a Hurtin' Thing"", a befuddling megamix comprised of the original version of the track as well as chunks of previous singles ""How Can You Say It"" and ""Music"", all cobbled together in the studio by Whisenhunt. To the mix he adds more stinging wah-wah guitar, silken orchestration, and a re-recorded drum track not quite in sync with the original that trainwrecks the whole thing (no doubt an attempt to cash in on disco fever). With funds low, it had a minuscule press run and was soon forgotten. Yet somehow, it all works. It's glorious and bewildering, magnificent and forlorn, defiant and defeated, an emotional speedball. Heard in 2015, the music is as indelible and inscrutable as ever. Or, as Taylor once sang about love: ""It's a mystery no one can explain.""","Love Is a Hurtin’ Thing, Ubiquity’s long-gestating compilation of highlights from Gloria Ann Taylor’s brief career, gathers five singles recorded between 1971 and 1977. Original copies of these releases—featuring dance music with an unusual touch of dubby psychedelia—are among the most coveted of soul/disco rarities.

Broken Flowers EP,Danny L Harle,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b24913d197565213a748/1:1/w_160/af6a97c4.jpg,2015-12-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21294-broken-flowers-ep/,PC Music,"""Broken Flowers"" is often cited as the most fully-realized PC Music single, a polished gem of a track released on a famously ephemeral label. Its author, Danny L Harle, is a shadowy figure, even by PC Music standards. We do know that he's a childhood friend of label head A. G. Cook (with whom he performs in Dux Content), a classically trained composer, and seems to have played a foundational role in defining the PC Music aesthetic. And yet, he's only released a few solo tracks since the label's emergence—he might be the least prolific SoundCloud phenom this side of Jai Paul. Anticipation for new music from Harle is understandably high, a fact that clearly hasn't been lost on PC Music. The Broken Flowers EP marks PC Music's inaugural joint release with Columbia Records, the first shot fired in what the label has described as, ""[a] multi-tier attack exposing the radical DNA of chart music, and the heart and soul behind every lab creation."" Clocking in at 4 songs and just under 15 minutes, the Broken Flowers EP is a focused, purposeful release, clearly meant to introduce the PC Music sound to new listeners and commercial heights. The EP is bookended by the titular single—closing track ""Awake for Hours"" is really just a remix of ""Broken Flowers"" that speeds up the original to a breakneck pace. Luckily, ""Broken Flowers"" is still a thrilling listen two years on. This is the closest thing the label has to a deep-house cut, a song that would feel at home on almost any dancefloor despite its winkingly maudlin lyrics. The track builds with impressive precision, with sinuous arpeggios, marimba notes, and reverberating vocal samples clicking into place atop a driving 4/4 beat. What's more, it sounds as if Harle has rebuilt the song from scratch for this release; where the original reveled in cliché house sounds, every element in this mix, including the vocals, feels cleaned up and refined. The two new songs, ""Forever"" and ""Without You"", don't disappoint, even as they diverge from the template Harle sketched out on ""Broken Flowers"". Both tracks hew much closer to the PC Music playbook, with chirpy, pitched up vocals sitting atop glistening, Technicolor synths. ""Without You"" is a clear standout, surfacing the melancholic undercurrent that gave ""Broken Flowers"" its depth. Vocalist Emily Verlander pines for a lover over an airy track that heaves and sighs, exploring the tension between helium-inhaling vocals and confessional lyrics. The implication here is unclear—we're either being invited to dismiss the heartbroken pop song as naive or confront the infantilization of female narrators in pop. Harle's role as the male auteur behind the curtain further complicates our understanding, lending the song the sort of discomfiting air that's become a PC Music trademark. As compelling as the music on the Broken Flowers EP is, calling it an EP feels like a bit of stretch—it's really just a single, one that's anchored by a remake of a track that's been out for two years. Then again, it's hard to blame Harle and PC Music for playing it safe given the stakes here. At the core of PC Music's agenda lies a desire to simultaneously critique and embrace chart pop by mimicking its form; what better way to signal the fulfillment of the label's ambitions than with an actual charting pop single? ""Sometimes I feel, maybe/ This could be real,"" Verlander admits on ""Without You"". She adds, ironically, ""Trust me.""","The Broken Flowers EP is a focused, purposeful release, clearly meant to introduce the PC Music sound to new listeners and commercial heights.

"And After That, We Didn’t Talk",GoldLink,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1cfc0084474cd0c1e8d/1:1/w_160/93a4cdd6.jpg,2015-12-01 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21209-and-after-that-we-didnt-talk/,Soulection,"On GoldLink's 2014 debut mixtape The God Complex, the then-20-year-old rapper nailed a difficult balance: soft sounds, hard rhymes. The music—an uptempo mixture of house music and hip-hop signifiers (GoldLink coined the term ""future bounce"" for it)—offset lyrics full of hypermasculine, purposefully exaggerated sexual boasts and street-savvy narratives. There was something indescribable about hearing the high-voiced rapper spit something like ""Dick to the face, might choke"" 0ver bubbly champagne synths, and the tape caught on, along with its signature hit ""Ay Ay"". The Washington, D.C. rapper toured alongside Mac Miller, as well as electronic producers like SBTRKT and Kaytranada. He even caught the attention of Def Jam founder/music visionary Rick Rubin, who has served as a mentor for his debut album, And After That, We Didn't Talk. And After That, We Didn't Talk is not a significant sonic departure from Link's previous work, but it carries more thematic weight. The album concerns a relationship and subsequent breakup he had when he was 16, but telling a six-year-old story also leaves the door open for very selective memory. The woman in question remains nameless throughout the album, and though he freely talks about a ""Que"" (with whom she was cheating on Link), an ""Allan"" (a likely previous boyfriend), and sprinkles other biographical notes, the bigger picture of why this moment and this person matter so much to Link that he dedicated his first studio album to her is often missing. Instead, And After That communicates GoldLink's state of mind. He is reflective on the opening track, ""After You Left"", hopeful on ""Zipporah"", with its gospel chant bridge, ""Lord, Lord, I need your help, Lord."" The following three songs (""Dark Skin Women"", ""Spectrum"", and ""Dance on Me"") best encapsulate his hip-hop/dance hybrid sound, and find Link returning to the sexual braggadocio of The God Complex, which is often where he finds the most joy as a writer (listen to his very vivid description of cunnilingus on ""Dance on Me""). Toward the album's end, Link ventures into R&B and, at times, completely abandons rapping. He sings about his obsessive love on ""Palm Trees"", and while it's still unclear why he's obsessed, his pained vocals make you believe. The same emotion comes through on ""Polarized"" when he sings, ""Go down South to Atlanta with your sister and/ I'll fly you myself, if I have to."" In that song, all we learn about the subject is that she's a 5'7"" model, but Link is convincing enough as a communicator to make up for the lyrical gaps. And After That, We Didn't Talk is not quite as immediately exciting as its predecessor, which was a burst of aphrodisiac energy. GoldLink feels tugged down occasionally by the story he is trying to tell. As he said in an interview with Pitchfork, ""I feel like 99% of niggas lie in they raps; I don't."" The literal truths, however, distract from how he expresses them. GoldLink is a total-package artist, someone who does not have to rely entirely on facts to succeed as a rapper. His music works when every element blends together, and And After That, We Didn't Talk is most interesting when he shares only the most vital details from a moment. It's then that he can wring his experiences for their emotions and convey feelings with more than just words.","The Washington, D.C.-based rapper GoldLink broke through with an upbeat fusion of house music and hip-hop on his mixtape The God Complex, snagging the attention of Rick Rubin. His debut album concerns a relationship and subsequent breakup he had when he was 16, and the details are often kept elusive.

But You Caint Use My Phone,Erykah Badu,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2015e6ef9596932220a/1:1/w_160/541e5a18.png,2015-12-01 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21319-but-you-caint-use-my-phone/,self-released,"When Erykah Badu found out that her friend and collaborator J Dilla passed away in February 2006, her mind reeled. The producer was just 32, felled by a rare blood disease that clogged his body with clots and a case of lupus that caused his immune system to go haywire. Badu thought of a story Dilla's mother told her about her son's dying days, when she would find him having conversations with an unseen companion. One time, when she asked him who he was talking to, he said it was Ol' Dirty Bastard, who had died in 2004. As Badu recounted years later, Dilla explained to his mom: “He was telling me what bus to get on when I cross over. He said, ‘Don’t get on the red bus, get on the white bus. The red bus looks fun, but that’s not the one.’” That memory inspired Badu to write a song called ""Telephone"", which starts: ""Telephone, it's Ol' Dirty/ He wants to give you directions home/ Said it won't be too long."" ""Telephone"" originally appeared on Badu's 2008 album New Amerykah Part One (4th World War) and it's reprised in chopped-and-screwed form as a tribute to another late rap producer, DJ Screw, on the singer's new mixtape, But You Caint Use My Phone. For the 44-year-old ankh-worshipping R&B iconoclast, phones aren't just emoji factories or Candy Crush receptacles—they're mystic devices that can span time and space, heaven and Earth. According to Badu, phones can enhance our ability to communicate deep desires across oceans, but they can also jumble our meaning with static or frustrate with busy signals and voicemail. As an extension of ourselves, phones can be heartbreaking, lustful, smart, dumb, noisy, distracting, powerful. But You Caint Use My Phone is a mixtape in the true hip-hop sense, as it largely finds Badu putting her spin on other artists' songs. Created alongside a young producer and fellow Dallas denizen named Zach Witness in just 12 days, the tape feels off-the-cuff, yet also steeped in history and wisdom. This paradoxical quality can be found in much of Badu's work over the last two decades as well as on her initial inspiration for this tape, Drake's ""Hotline Bling"", the SoundCloud loosie-turned-smash about late-night buzzes with a beat taken from Timmy Thomas' 1972 anti-war plea ""Why Can't We Live Together"". ""Hotline Bling"" is old and new, R&B and hip-hop, serious and fun—it's a song that might not exist without the pioneering work of Erykah Badu, so it only makes sense for her to reclaim it. But rather than putting her stamp on a slew of 2015 hits, Badu reaches back across the last 40 years of phone-related pop, patching the Isley Brothers, Usher, Egyptian Lover, and New Edition through her own frequency. As a kid who grew up listening to her family's Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Chaka Khan records before falling in love with hip-hop in the '80s—her first concert was Run-D.M.C. and she began her musical career as a rapper known as MC Apples—Badu has always been ideally positioned between the reverence of classic soul and the irreverence of hip-hop. And on But You Caint Use My Phone she taps into her own language and influence along with everyone else's. The title of the tape and its blaring opening suite reference her 1997 kiss-off ""Tyrone"", and the playful ""Dial’Afreaq"", a remake of the early electro-rap hit ""Dial-A-Freak"" by Uncle Jamm's Army and the Egyptian Lover, offers a brief history of Baduizm: ""'On & On' and Mama's Gun/ Underwater ill motherfucker from the other sun."" Further referential depth comes courtesy of producer Witness, a one-time child turntable prodigy who was a toddler when Badu started her career. He first came to the singer's attention through his remix of ""On & On"", and he melds his star's offbeat spontaneity and cosmic funk with a sleek SoundCloud-ready sheen. Another relatively unknown new artist Badu brought on for the project, rapper ItsRoutine, doesn't come off as well. His two Drake-impersonating verses (""Erykah on my hotline,"" he misdirects) are bizarrely, well, phoney—annoying prank calls on what should be a highly protected line. Badu, a self-described ""analog girl in a digital world,"" has a clear fondness for old-school, pre-cell models with buttons that pushed and dials that turned. It's a nostalgic stance from someone who became famous a decade before the introduction of the iPhone, but it can also be convincing. ""Phone Down"" has Badu pleading for someone to disconnect from the grid and plug into real life, but the track's sinister synths and her melancholy delivery suggest that she knows it's probably too late. And yet. The mixtape's final track, a revamp of the Todd Rundgren/Isley Brothers '70s hit ""Hello It's Me"", features André 3000—aka the father of Badu's only son, Seven—leaving his phone on the table in an effort to find some clarity, and it works. In the late '90s, Badu and Dre were a much-celebrated hip-hop couple, a model of black enlightenment and creativity. They broke up after a few years but remained close, and André famously apologized to Badu's mother on OutKast's ""Ms. Jackson"", promising his commitment to fatherhood: ""Know that everything's cool/ And yes, I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation."" And as Seven turned 18 last month, his parents are still talking, still figuring things out, still collaborating on art. As their duet fades out here, both voices come together, and the conversation keeps going.","But You Caint Use My Phone is a mixtape in the true hip-hop sense, as it largely finds Erykah Badu putting her spin on other artists' songs.

Paranoid London,Paranoid London,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2415e6ef95969322271/1:1/w_160/77da837b.jpg,2015-11-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21288-paranoid-london/,Decks,"Since its inception, acid house was received far more enthusiastically in the UK than in the U.S. Writing about his favorite tracks for Fact, Ed DMX said: ""Even though nearly all the best records were made in Chicago, the music took off in a big way over here, [where] it was massively popular, much imitated."" The UK top 100 for 1989 boasts the likes of Inner City's ""Good Life"", Lil Louis's ""French Kiss"", and British early adopter A Guy Called Gerald's ""Voodoo Ray"" while the U.S. charts bear out that we all but ignored our homegrown sound (though we charted Marshall Jefferson's “Move Your Body” as blanched by the Belgian act Technotronic as ""Pump up the Jam""). No historian or music critic would ever categorize 1989 as Chicago's ""second summer of love"". Beginning in 2007, singles began emanating from a British label and act known as Paranoid London. The duo of Gerardo Delgado and Quinn Whalley, flashed an unfettered enthusiasm for—and emulation of—the mad whinnying frequencies of the 303, but coupled it to an ethos that in the 21st century might more closely align with punk. They didn't do any press, didn't promo their music, didn't upload mixes to Soundcloud to build buzz, and when they released their debut album at the end of December 2014, there was no digital version. While the group were much discussed in Europe and the UK, there was nary a ripple nor mention made stateside. A year on, the ten track album is now readily available digitally and on CD. For an electronic music culture increasingly bloated, glitzy, and insufferable, Paranoid London is a refreshing punch to the nuts. The tracks that Delgado and Whalley craft are simple as a prison shiv, not adding layers of gloss or paint to its acid-house, but stripping it back to its basics. Almost every track is erected from the same blocks: handclaps bright as tin foil, dry snares, sharp hi-hats, concussive kicks, all of it buoyed by queasy undulations of bass. They emulate Trax and those shoddy, shady days of Chicago pressings to the point that you expect a chunk of rubber to be embedded in the records themselves. There are spot-on acid house bangers like ""Headtrack"" and ""Paris Dub 3"" that evoke peak Junior Boy's Own releases as well as late-'80s Chicago. On the latter, the duo collaborate with Paris Brightledge, a vocalist on early tracks by Sterling Void and Joe Smooth. The coup de grace is the deadpan intonation of Mutato Pintado; on the wet cardboard thud of ""Transmission 5"", he switches out words that range from the inane to the lurid: ""skin on my shoes...feeling good...lipstick...hair in my hand...late night..."" and at one point, he croons about ""playing by the rules"" then suppresses a small chuckle. Playing by the rules of making classic acid house while also laughing at them, setting up expectations and then undercutting them: It's what Paranoid London does best. “Lovin U (Ahh Shit)” is a love song but the title sends mixed signals, approximating the cross purposes of hook-up culture. ""You've got the green light/ right past the stop sign"" DJ Genesis sings in her monotone, juxtaposing ""forever loving you/ just a little bit."" Its sentimental in a way that works with the group’s decidedly cheeky unsentimental manner. Earlier this summer I got to see Paranoid London play live as part of Amsterdam’s Dekmantel festival. They were sandwiched between two legends: DJ Harvey and Derrick May. But after a weekend of DJs coolly manipulating laptops, turntables and drum machines, there was something visceral about PL's live set, less clinical, more chaotic. The crowd churned like a mosh pit rather than a dance floor and rather than throw cake into the crowd, Mutato Pintado brandished a bottle of vodka lifted from backstage and began to pour full cups of it, passing it out to the crowd.","For an electronic music culture increasingly bloated, glitzy, and insufferable, the British duo Paranoid London is a refreshing punch to the nuts. They emulate the shoddy, shady days of early Chicago house: The mad whinnying squeals, the 303s, the deadpan vocals—all of it is here, and it hits with visceral force.

9th House,Muja MessiahI Self Devine,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b267ea9e61561daa6902/1:1/w_160/93218efe.jpeg,2015-11-30 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21320-9th-house/,self-released,"You can scoff at astrology and still be moved by 9th House, the long-awaited collaboration between Minneapolis-St. Paul hip-hop pioneers Muja Messiah and I Self Devine. The record’s title and some of its window dressings gesture at Jupiter’s movements, but the artists find themselves planted firmly in the Twin Cities streets they’ve defined and documented over the past two decades. For those unfamiliar, Muja made a name for himself in the early 2000s with a string of show-stealing guest verses, before his solo LPs—like last year’s God Kissed It, the Devil Missed It—solidified him as the Cities’ sneering id. (He’s also written verses for several of your favorite yacht-owning rappers.) I Self Devine’s legacy stretches back even further: together with DJ Kool Akiem as the Micranots, he was one of the first genuine Minneapolis stars, to the point where his nod helped solidify Rhymesayers in its infancy. Rapping together for the first time at length, it’s quickly apparent that Muja and Chaka invert the old duo dynamics. The two MCs still present the point and counter-point on a single theme, but where the variance in many a group setting has come from each rapper’s writing, it’s evident on 9th House mostly in the tone of the vocals. Self is gruff, guttural, and earnest, and Muja’s voice is the audio equivalent of that .gif where Birdman rubs his hands together in front of doves and an explosion. That’s seen most clearly on ""Arrow Dynamics"": Muja’s ""Diagnosed: ADHD/ For white folks, that’s a disability"" and Self’s ""Well-dressed niggas get hit, like, ‘Where the product at?’/ White trash pulling dime sacks out their Prada bags"" complement each other, while in more similar hands they might combine to be too on-the-nose. The song’s hook, though, converges at the group’s de facto mission statement: ""Gun up on my hip, I won’t bust it at my nigs/ But I guarantee I’m shooting at the cops, though."" It’s clear, and it’s potent. And it’s morbidly prescient: On November 15th, a Minneapolis police officer shot and killed a 24-year-old black man named Jamar Clark. Multiple eyewitnesses say Clark was handcuffed when the fatal shot was fired; police deny that he had been handcuffed, but have yet to release video of the incident. Protesters reacted swiftly, shutting down the I-94 freeway and, more recently, occupying the 4th Precinct in North Minneapolis. It was there that five protesters were shot, apparently by a small group of white supremacists. (No one was critically injured.) The following night, more shots were fired at those assembled. At the time of this writing, hundreds of people remain in the blocks surrounding the precinct, and thousands have marched through downtown Minneapolis demonstrating against Clark’s killing, the absence of video evidence, and the police response to the subsequent shootings. Muja has even inserted himself into the protests, demanding answers in Mayor Betsy Hodges’ foyer and clarifying that he’s a “concerned citizen” unaffiliated with any political movement. That sounds about right: 9th House is mostly an act of collage, with pro-black, anti-police sentiments dominating its most lucid moments. There’s malt liquor, gold slippers, and promises to ""suplex label reps,"" but when the MCs cut through, they do it with a knife that’s carefully pointed. On ""IOFWUCUC"" (an acronym for ""I Only Fuck With You ‘Cause You Crazy""), Self raps, ""Dreaming of peace and violence/ Don’t wanna be a martyr/ Defiance in my blood running as clear as water."" For two men who would seemingly expect their closest confidants to read between the lines, some anxieties are made refreshingly clear. The most striking part of 9th House, perhaps even more than its politics, is how it's equal parts loose and specific to its environment. The former quality is thanks to beats from J.Hard, M¥K, and Orko Eloheim, the latter to the Holiday Inn on Eleventh Street and Rashad McCants. In an unsettling time for Minneapolis-St. Paul, 9th House is the record the Cities have created for themselves.","The long-awaited collaboration between Minneapolis-St. Paul hip-hop pioneers Muja Messiah and I Self Devine is mostly an act of collage, with pro-black, anti-police sentiments dominating its most lucid moments.

Look Around,Beat Happening,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20213d197565213a6d4/1:1/w_160/05c5672a.jpg,2015-11-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21245-look-around/,Domino,"The Olympia, Wash., trio Beat Happening were a band often labelled ""twee"" or ""love rock"" because of their stripped-down instrumentation and childlike art direction and song titles, but their music had a darker cast. I remember seeing them perform at Wetlands in New York City in the 1990s, and how unnerving it was when bandleader and K Records cofounder Calvin Johnson made eye contact with the crowd and held you in his gaze while he rubbed his belly and sang in his deep baritone. Johnson's presence carried weight. Beat Happening toured with Fugazi and were covered by Seaweed. Kurt Cobain got a tattoo of the K Records logo. There was an edge to this music, and it’s still there. Beat Happening's lyrics, which included images of hand-holding and hot chocolate, scan as innocent, but the guy in ""Hot Chocolate Boy"" got his name because he’s ""deep sweet and bitter,"" watching TV alone and wishing he had a girlfriend. The songs are populated with zombies, witches, blood sucking. Even on their most famous song, ""Indian Summer"", with its idyllic sense of longing, they are eating their breakfast of apples and cherry blossoms in a cemetery. History is never complete, which is why compilations like Look Around are helpful. Easy downloads and streaming can definitely bring into question the need for compilations—why buy a collection of previously released songs when you can find most of them online? But what you’re paying for—or at least scanning the track list for—is the curation. The 23-song Look Around is perfect in that regard. There will always be favorites missing—it’s the nature of compilations—but there are no major oversights or head-scratching inclusions here. It’s a great primer for new Beat Happening fans, and as it turns out, an excellent reminder for those of us who’d kind of forgotten about them. The songs are presented in chronological order, so it feels like a distilled time capsule, and it offers a chance to watch patterns emerge and themes continue in time-lapse. It’s not the first compilation to focus on the band. There was the now out-of-print 7xCD Crashing Through box set contained all their albums, plus some rarities. The 15-song Music to Climb the Apple Tree By, which focused on just B-sides, felt a bit thin. Here we get a taste of each era. The selections are pretty evenly distributed, with a few songs from 1985’s self-titled debut (the one with the cartoon cat driving a rocket ship on the cover), 1988’s Jamboree (featuring a drawing of a heart-shaped strawberry), 1989’s Black Candy (a simple drawing of black candy), 1991’s Dreamy (the only album featuring the band on the cover), and 1992’s You Turn Me On (which featured a tasteful artistic nude). They’ve also appended 2000’s ""Angel Gone"", from a single produced by Phil Elverum (the B-side, ""Zombie Limbo Time"", appeared on Music to Climb the Apple Tree By). These songs still sound fresh. Maybe because the arrangements are so basic and stripped down, without any overzealous studio tricks or instrumentation that ties it to a particular year, they feel timeless. Or, more accurately, out of time. I think the emotion is important, too, because these lyrics focus on simple human situations most of us have probably experienced. For a lot of people, 1991’s International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, a six-day festival organized by Johnson and his K co-founder Candice Pedersen that featured performances from Fugazi, Bikini Kill, Built to Spill, Unwound, L7, Bratmobile, Mecca Normal, and others, made more sense, and had more of a mythology to it, than Nevermind, which first hit later that same year. Beat Happening and their cohorts represented a part of the Pacific Northwest scene that was less interested in playing bigger venues or making it on MTV. And this still matters now, in part, because 30 years after the release of their debut, there’s a lot of music that hearkens to the band and the K scene they helped spearhead. You can hear them in Girlpool, Frankie Cosmos, Quarterbacks, and in other bands who release a couple of songs and then disappear. You’ll hear them name-dropped in interviews by artists like Carrie Brownstein. This collection contains many of their best and most memorable songs, but their real legacy is found in basement venues and DIY spaces and groups just learning how to play but not being afraid to do so in public.","This 23-track career overview is a great primer for new Beat Happening fans, and as it turns out, an excellent reminder for those of us who’d kind of forgotten about the Olympia indie pop band.

Saint Cecilia EP,Foo Fighters,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b261b1335d7bf169a412/1:1/w_160/d60f85fe.jpg,2015-11-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21315-foo-fighters-saint-cecilia-ep/,RCA,"Dave Grohl is as much of a rock 'n' roll ambassador as he is a rock musician at this point, and his politics stand on a well-meaning, but wobbly platform: whenever someone with an elite level of money, power and influence presents himself as an everydude, cognitive dissonance is inevitable. While the star-studded travelogue Sonic Highways promised ""a musical map of America"", it could've passed for a longform Hard Rock Café commercial, ignoring basically every genre outside of the blues-rock lineage. The featherweight Sound City: Reel to Reel documentary and soundtrack was similarly amicable, but it happened to conflate rock 'n roll's ""human element"" with the Neve console, a machine costing somewhere between $78,000 and $1 million. The same unintended gap in perspective between Grohl's aw-shucks persona and his output defines Saint Cecilia, a free EP dropped right before Thanksgiving. In the virtual liner notes, Grohl gushes over its recording process, telling of good friends digging through old riffs and creating new jams, wasted away in Margaritaville. The results still sound as slickly produced and hedge-betting as any actual Foo Fighters album. As well they should—when Dave Grohl and his friends want to record over a lost week(end), this means having Austin's St. Cecilia Hotel turned into a recording studio within the matter of hours, while Gary Clark Jr., Jack Black and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band jam in the periphery. There are expensive microphones and professional recording engineers and famous photographers namedropped like high school buddies. If you really want to hear Foo Fighters songs in chrysalis, by all means, find a bootlegged copy of Pocketwatch. Meanwhile, St. Cecilia's title track arrives already sounding like it's made the rounds on whatever's left of your local rock radio station. It's the most immediately pleasing thing they've done this decade and also the most instantly familiar, with a robust chorus built on a progression of straight-strummed barre chords, stacked harmonies and broad lyrics that express a general sense of yearning, but nothing that puts Grohl's personal life on the spot. In other words, it's not terribly different than ""Learn to Fly"" or ""Times Like These"" or ""Next Year"", proof that Foo Fighters are modern day, power-pop workhorses in their natural state rather than a rawk band. Whenever that reputation threatens to stick, Grohl always draws on a Northern Virginia upbringing that put him within driving distance of DC's hardcore scene. ""Sean"" and ""Savior Breath"" are punk Foo Fighters, or as punk as they can sound in 2015—infinitely more energetic than anything on Sonic Highways, but only incrementally edgier, Wasting Light without Butch Vig's glossy overlay. Foo Fighters couldn't make a truly sloppy, abrasive or hookless song if they tried, and they're certainly not going to. With every album prepping the inevitable Foo Fighters' Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, Grohl gets closer to actualizing his unstated goal of being this generation's Tom Petty, a real deal, aw-shucks everydude churning out one centrist and likeable rock song after another. Just look at Grohl's personal trajectory: After Kurt Cobain's suicide, he made the painful decision to turn down his hero's offer to play drums on tour with the Heartbreakers (Saturday Night Live had to do) and Foo Fighters have recently added ""Breakdown"" as a staple in their live sets. But even if Grohl's vocals are as immediately identifiable as Petty's by now, he is further than ever from having a distinct voice; Foo Fighters remain our most unknowable and emotionally blank rock stars. Grohl's hooks are wide enough to catch any feeling,—""Things are gonna go, no matter what I say/Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say""; ""Who you runnin' from?""; ""No one lets everyone in."" Foo Fighters are a power-pop band in this sense. But amidst the plodding alt-roots of ""Iron Rooster"", Grohl's genial recriminations (""Have you ever been young enough to feel what you wanted to feel/ Take back those years for something real"") are best pointed back at him; as well as being their most diverse, hooky and unpredictable records, Foo Fighters and The Colour and the Shape were the only ones where you could trace Grohl's lyrics to some kind of source and there was still some question as to what he wanted this band to be. Even at their exalted status, Foo Fighters are not an institution like U2 or Coldplay; unlike those bands, there's never any debate or even discussion surrounding their next artistic move. If you consider Grohl in a rock 'n' roll CEO role, like Dan Auerbach or Jack White, it only draws attention to how perverse and prickly Auerbach and White  seem in comparison. But for as much effort as it takes to love Foo Fighters, it's nearly impossible to dislike them. Read Grohl's letter again and even Beach Slang can seem kinda wishy-washy about rock music, leaving no doubt that making Saint Cecilia was clearly a rejuvenating experience for Foo Fighters. The EP itself is less convincing as evidence.","Foo Fighters dropped the free Saint Cecilia EP right before Thanksgiving. Though Grohl gushes over the spontaneity of its creation in the warm liner notes, the results sound about as slickly produced and hedge-betting as an actual Foo Fighters album.

Ty Rex,Ty Segall,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b24aea9e61561daa68d7/1:1/w_160/41087660.jpg,2015-11-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21295-ty-rex/,Goner,"In any given year, few Record Store Day exclusives are worth the long lines or inflated prices. Sure, a select number of unearthed B-sides and overdue reissues reward the effort, but there's a whole swath of mediocre cover records destined to linger in the leftovers bin. So many of them read as easy cash grabs—not at all essential unless you're a superfan (because really, those are the only people clamoring to own the Foo Fighters' version of ""Kids in America""). In 2011, Ty Segall offered an exception to that rule, releasing a covers EP that was worth buying and quietly stood as one of the best entries in his lengthy discography. Just that name alone, Ty Rex, was exciting—the promise that Segall at the top of his game would record a series of Marc Bolan covers. Now, the entire Ty Rex oeuvre is being issued in full (the original EP, its 2013 follow-up 7"", and an unreleased bonus track). It's a good thing, too, because these covers demand a bigger audience. Ty Rex arrived two months before Goodbye Bread, his most paced and subdued statement up to that point. He'd been touring behind Melted's giant-hook singles (""Girlfriend"", ""Imaginary Person"", etc.), and he'd become very good at performing covers. His live sets usually featured his wide-eyed versions of hard rock staples (by Sabbath, AC/DC, and Motörhead, to name a few). His 2010 Daytrotter recording of G.G. Allin's ""Don't Talk to Me"" was an unhinged star turn. The expected move was for him to bring that same chaos to Ty Rex. But this time around, lizard-brained Segall took a step back. Instead, he showed restraint, recording an aesthetic stepping stone between the fuzz pop fury of Melted and the comparative lethargy of Goodbye Bread. He didn't just run through the hits, either. It opens with ""Fist Heart Mighty Dawn Dart"", which appeared on the 1970 Tyrannosaurus Rex album Beard of Stars. Segall slows and steadies the pace, subbing out Micky Finn's Moroccan clay drums for the traditional rock'n'roll kit, and the vocal melody is smoothed out from Bolan's stilted chorus. Segall's groove is even more gradual on his reading of the 1968 track ""Salamanda Palaganda"", and the restraint gives every whimsical image—the old crones, the night eagles—the opportunity to fully sink in. There's a posthumously released T. Rex record called Rabbit Fighter: The Alternate Slider, which features demos and acoustic versions of Slider songs. It's Bolan at his most restrained and pared back—proof that his songs were already gold before he slathered on the extra gilding (string sections, layered electric guitar solos, and so on). Ty Rex is also an album-length acknowledgment of Bolan's core strengths. Throughout, Segall plays it straight—the solos are never excessively flashy (sticking close to the originals) and the recording quality is slightly muffled. He never attempts a Bolan impression, either, and he largely forgoes any untethered Slaughterhouse wildness to play up Bolan's melodies, chord progressions, and absurd lyrics. He knows that you don't rewrite Shakespeare, and you don't attempt to outswagger one of rock'n'roll history's most confident heartthrobs. Of course, it's a Ty Segall record, so he still brings some of that fire. His previously unreleased version of ""20th Century Boy"" is Ty Rex at its most fuzzy and abrasive, packing the record's most impressive, sky-high guitar solo. But every pound of rock'n'roll aggression is tempered by more withdrawn performances, like the slow burn of ""The Motivator"", ""Cat Black"", and ""The Slider"". That's what the best T. Rex records are like, too—for every ""Rip Off"", there a ""Girl"". Clearly, Segall could do more than one installment of Ty Rex. During his Ty Rex set at Gonerfest 12, people went nuts at just the suggestion of ""Bang a Gong"". There are several reasons why Segall is well-suited to this material—he's a guitar hero and his voice is in exactly the right register. He's an excellent showman and a rock'n'roll screamer, but he can also emote behind his acoustic guitar. With his thoughtful, deft, and exciting performances, Segall also clearly has a reverence for these songs. As Segall works through Bolan's discography—from the early acoustic stuff to the big tent T. Rex singles—he's offering a convincing invitation to deep dive into Bolan's discography.","Ty Segall's T. Rex covers haven't gotten the attention they deserve. Though they were just released as EPs and 7""s, they served as aesthetic stepping stones between Segall's fuzz-pop fury stage (Melted) and the more muted records he would make later.

Night of Your Ascension,Wrekmeister Harmonies,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1cd13d197565213a687/1:1/w_160/89181d06.jpg,2015-11-25 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21208-night-of-your-ascension/,Thrill Jockey,"We don't always recognize it, but the ability to hold back until precisely the right moment is crucial to the act of making even the most concise or chaotic forms of music. As listeners, we both expect music to adhere to familiar formulae while also teasing our ears with traces of the unexpected. And, as with foreplay, certain artists are just more skilled at extending climaxes into exquisite torture. On Night of Your Ascension, it takes a full 15 minutes of guest vocalist Marissa Nadler's chanting within a funereal 16th-century/Renaissance-styled organ/string/choral arrangement before elephantine guitar chords and drums come crashing through the mist. Even if you listened to this album without any context, you would get a sense that it was building up to something. And if you're aware of the backstory or personnel going into it, you'll no doubt wonder when the metallic element is going to rear its head. Either way, Ascension tests your patience in the best possible sense. Like Wrekmeister Harmonies' two previous albums, Night of Your Ascension consists of madrigal/sacred choral music, experimental ambient music, and doom. This time around (thanks to help from arrangers Eric Chaleff, Cooper Crain, and Sanford Parker), J.R. Robinson takes a developmental leap forward in all three arenas, but it isn't until the beginning motif of the second track ""Run Priest Run"" where all these disparate elements actually blend together, in a passage that lasts in excess of 8 minutes and could easily have appeared on Hundred Waters' last album. Before being gradually overtaken by electric guitars à la the title track, ""Run Priest Run"" initially fulfills the potential that Wrekmeister Harmonies show on paper as a 30-plus member ensemble drawing on musicians from metal, rock, and new music circles. Alongside Nadler, harpist Mary Lattimore, electro-acoustic sound artist-composer Olivia Block, and Alexander Hacke of Einstürzende Neubauten, the album features members of the Body, Cave, Indian, Bloodiest, Anatomy of Habit, Come, Twilight, and Mind Over Mirrors. Robinson leans heavily on these musicians to flesh out his compositions and give Ascension its shape and character. For the title track, Robinson nods to 16-century Neopolitan composer Don Carlo Gesualdo, whose experimental approach to madrigals pre-dated widespread use by a good 300 years. Gesualdo is also infamous for murdering his wife and her lover. Robinson bases the first half of the title track on Gesualdo's techniques which, incidentally, influenced Igor Stravinsky and inspired author Aldous Huxley to describe Gesualdo's work as ""a kind of musical no-man's land."" The juxtaposition between the tune's classical and doom modes is clearly meant to invoke a sense of the friction between Gesualdo's towering creative presence and the internal torment that drove him to commit murder. Likewise, for ""Run Priest Run"" Robinson looked to the case of Boston Catholic priest Father John Geoghan, who was accused of sexually abusing over 130 boys, convicted, and murdered in prison in 2003 while serving a life sentence. Once aware of these narrative backdrops, the atmosphere on Night of Your Ascension (and in particular the black metal-styled vocal screeching on ""Run Priest Run"") becomes charged with a dread that elevates this music above the ho-hum gestural negativity of other doom outfits who sound like they're reaching for something to frown over. Robinson draws from real-life tragedy and sexual pathology and does his earnest best to honor the nuances of each case. At the same time, this album's obvious equation of heaviness to violence and psychological despair comes off as heavy-handed. Nevertheless, Night of Your Ascension faces rote themes like killing, death, and despair from a fresh perspective that aspires to be illuminating. It's also, strangely enough, an album listeners can use to make new friends. Given the way Robinson disposed of musical boundaries to put this music together, it spurs the audience to do the same practically by default. If you're into experimental rock or metal, Night of Your Ascension naturally incites curiosity about madrigals and Renaissance composition. The same applies in reverse. If your tastes fall in any of those areas, you can use this album as a bridge to another world by walking up to someone across the aisle and asking ""Have you heard this? What's your take?"" It's bound to be a lengthy, engaging conversation, not unlike the album itself.","Wrekmeister Harmonies' newest collection of sacred choral music, experimental ambient, and doom finds J.R. Robinson taking a developmental leap forward in all three arenas. It features contributions from Marissa Nadler and members of Einstürzende Neubauten, the Body, Indian, Anatomy of Habit, Come, and Twilight, among others.

The Wireless EP,Punch Brothers,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20813d197565213a6e2/1:1/w_160/280e8fad.jpg,2015-11-25 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21250-sarcosuchus-the-wireless-ep/,Nonesuch,"Few modern roots musicians have amassed the critical acclaim and international popularity enjoyed by the honey-voiced, quick-fingered mandolinist Chris Thile. As the frontman and principal songwriter of the progressive bluegrass trio Nickel Creek, the California-born musician spent the early '00s pushing an invigorating, risk-taking acoustic melange he dubbed ""newgrass"", imbuing an art form commonly thought of as static with modernist quirks. Since then—Nickel Creek's 2014 reunion notwithstanding—Thile has shifted focus to Punch Brothers, a quintet who churn out the same dexterous roots music with a little more *oomph. (*Meanwhile, Thile’s Nickel Creek comrades Sean and Sara Watkins issued Watkins Family Hour, an LP birthed from the siblings’ monthly residency at Los Angeles’ Largo). Along the way, he’s won a Genius Grant and released several successful solo albums. Next year, he’ll host A Prairie Home Companion. Recorded during the same sessions that beget their last album, last year’s T-Bone Burnett-produced The Phosphorescent Blues, Punch Brothers' latest, The Wireless EP*,* combines three cuts previously included on that record's deluxe vinyl edition with two never-before-heard tracks, bridging their most recent musical statement with their next avant-American LP. The collection’s diverse blend of pensive instrumentals, rousing singsongs, and stylistic experiments—namely, a roots-y interpretation of Elliott Smith’s ""Clementine""—makes it a great introduction to the Punch Brothers’ quirky, clever bluegrass, as well as a satisfying (if modest) addition to the quintet’s catalog. Guitar, mandolin, fiddle/violin, banjo, bass, and whiskey-smooth vocals: six sounds—no more and no less—comprise the bulk of Punch Brothers’ deceptively full sound, a paradigm familiar to anyone who’s heard put on an Alison Krauss or Doc Watson LP. The biggest challenge for the group is molding this simplistic sonic recipe into a multitude of forms without falling victim to redundancy (or even worse, directionless noodling)—and Thile and company make it look like nothing. Where slow-churning opening track ""In Wonder"" pits soaring harmonies against a relentless, defiant fiddle, slinky instrumental ""The Hops of Guldenberg"" offers a country-fried take on jazz improvisation. There’s even room for existential banter: centerpiece ""Sleek White Baby"" stars Ed Helms of ""The Office"" fame as an old-timey announcer hawking the answer to all life’s problems against a serendipitous shuffle. If Punch Brothers' barbershop-quartet harmonies and old-school instruments are the roots tethering the group to bluegrass convention, then their covers are the shoots reaching onwards and upwards, transgressive in origin but puzzlingly traditional-sounding in practice. Thile and company regularly toss tunes fashioned outside of their rusted wheelhouse onto their setlists, as well as on their studio releases; past interpretations include spindly, creaky takes on Radiohead's ""Kid A"" and ""Packt Like Sardines In a Crush’d Tin Box"", as well as a prickly spin on ""Icarus Smicarus"", from post-hardcore heroes Mclusky. Like the rest of the band’s covers, ""Clementine"" is not so much a playful dalliance as it is another 20th century addition to the Punch Brothers’ envelope-pushing interpretation of the bluegrass canon. What’s more, by seamlessly integrating Smith’s booze-soaked hymn into the Appalachian-indebted mix, Thile and company don't just solidify the song’s latent transcendency: they propose a challenge to modern conceptions of bluegrass.","Chris Thile spent the early '00s as frontman and principal songwriter of the progressive bluegrass trio Nickel Creek, but he's shifted his focus to Punch Brothers, a quintet who churn out the same dexterous roots music with more oomph.

My Name Is,Doug Hream Blunt,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22ac0084474cd0c1f18/1:1/w_160/7d0344f9.jpg,2015-11-25 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21270-my-name-is/,Luaka Bop,"Even with assistance from the Internet, some cult records still have to travel off beaten paths, their pleasures imparted by friends in the know. Just how I came to know about a singer from San Francisco named Doug Hream Blunt four years ago, I am not exactly certain, though I suspect it was on a tip from either a member of Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti or else Park Blvd. Records co-owner Jason Darrah. But the moment that pneumatic, rinky-dink keyboard figure that opens ""Fly Guy"" wheezed and wormed into my ears, I was charmed and confounded. The sleeve art was nothing but a generic white sleeve with a gold sticker advertising the 'hit' ""Gentle Persuasion"" and it was hard to tell if it was a put-on or else proof that outsider music could remain relevant and vital in an age when any musician could upload his music to MySpace and be discovered, when most clues could be tracked down with a simple Google search. I’m not the only one besotted by Hream Blunt, as Ariel Pink is a champion, while former Hype Williams member Dean Blunt posits himself as the progeny of the man. Once hovering in obscurity and mystery, My Name Is makes Doug Hream Blunt readily accessible thanks to David Byrne’s Luaka Bop imprint, no stranger to tracking down itchy, quirky folks like William Onyeabor and Tom Zé. Even as the comp clarifies some of the Frisco fog that enshrouded that self-released CD and its bootlegged 12"", there remains a slippery, eel-like quality to these 10 songs. We learn in the liner notes that in the mid '80s as a 35-year-old prone to taking odd jobs, Blunt answered a flyer for a workshop called 'How to Form a Band.' Nevermind it was intended for Bay Area teens, Blunt approached the classes with a similar sense of the naïf, imparting that spirit onto the other adult students, four of them women who comprise his band. There's the spirit of the Troggs, the Shaggs, and Half Japanese to the grooves, something stupid yet undeniable, unlearned yet impossible to replicate. The whinnying, cyclical keyboard figure that Jeannie Killmer repeats ad nauseam on ""Fly Guy"" brings to mind '90s Ethiopian pop as well as what you might come up with at Guitar Center on a synth using the flute patch and your thumb. Even more charming and baffling are the lyrics, where Blunt makes a streetwise observation about capitalism: ""The rich use paper then they charge you more,"" talks about teaching the youth and then adds: ""Girl, I just wanna chill."" A similarly simple yet inveigling melody and needling guitar sidewinds through the wobbly boogie of said hit, ""Gentle Persuasion"". For all the speculation as to what it means ""to do the ninety-nine"", the notes just equivocate it to the mystery dance itself. Still, it takes a certain kind of Romeo to make a panty-dropping non sequitur of ""like ice, your butt is like dice now, daaaamn."" Charming as those two tracks are, they both run past six minutes and verge on exhausting. But as ""Big Top"", ""Caribbean Queen"", and ""Break Free"" reveal, Blunt sets about recycling both melodies onto other songs to where their appeal becomes threadbare. Perhaps in keeping with the Haight-Ashbury spirit of his home, each song also contains extended, aimless guitar soloing. And while he might have a two-track mind musically, it's solely one track when it comes to his primary theme. Outside of the last song (an instrumental version of ""Fly Guy""), the other nine share a similar beat and subject, the word ""girl"" uttered in every song. So even as My Name Is pulls back the curtain on Doug Hream Blunt’s mystery music, it also makes clear that the opposite sex will always remain one to him.","San Franciso funk outsider Doug Hream Blunt has been championed by the likes of Ariel Pink and former Hype Williams member Dean Blunt, who took his name. David Byrne’s Luaka Bop imprint makes the once obscure Blunt readily acccessible with the My Name Is compilation.

Monastic Living EP,Parquet Courts,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b25013d197565213a755/1:1/w_160/e2c8fd1c.jpg,2015-11-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21301-monastic-living-ep/,Rough Trade,"On ""No No No!"", the opener of Parquet Courts’ new mini-LP Monastic Living, Andrew Savage declares in a mangled grunt, ""I don’t want to be called a poet/ Don’t want to hang in a museum/ Don’t want to be cited, tacked onto your cause/ No, no, no/ I’m just a man."" From a band who've typically resisted disenchantment against the odds, it’s an alarming statement of rejection. On 2012's Light Up Gold, Savage and co-songwriter Austin Brown blazed through mundane minutiae–""train death paintings, anti-meth murals""–yet saw beauty in the banality; on last year’s ""Content Nausea"", released as Parkay Quarts, Savage yelled denunciations of the digital era in excited bursts, like a smalltown newsreader reporting alien landings. Pitched between stoner gags and urgent instructions, their sizzling one-liners felt like a bulwark against capitalist dread, the battle between righteousness and resignation. Monastic Living, their debut EP for Rough Trade presumably ahead of a full-length in the new year, is them saying, ""We’re tired, that’s enough."" ""No No No!"" is unique to the record, in that it has words, a hook, a rhythm you could tap, a sonic and philosophical destination, and replay value. In the liner notes, the track’s expanded lyric sheet blends cliché (""We’re just a band,"" ""retreat into solitude"") and aphorism—""Perhaps silence is purity of spirit""—into a grave mission statement. The remaining eight tracks aren't just wordless but tuneless; they're sometimes baffling, often boring, and always deliberately so. Part of what makes ""No No No!"" work is that its litany of targets—""open letters, long reads""—is broad enough to appeal to everyone’s digital unease. Parquet Courts are resolutely unchill (""Life’s lived best when scrolling least,"" Savage sang on ""Content Nausea""), bewildered by the hot takes and the jostling think-pieces, as are we all. But these are popular targets, and without the counterweight of wit, Parquet Courts' grand disavowal feels reactionary. On Monastic Living, they make a personal decision to reject a web culture constantly renegotiating what it means to be socially conscious (""I don't want to be an essayist!"" begins Savage's salvo), and in doing so they reclaim art’s right to political neutrality. As statements go, it’s fine but hardly revolutionary—a passionate shrug. Redeeming moments in the music are scarce. One is ""Vow of Silence"", with its clattering drums, pleading, squealing guitars, and haywire arpeggios, which resemble the misfiring pistons of a manic brain. ""Alms for the Poor"", comprising several seconds of a postpunk riff that dies suddenly, sounds like the husk of a practice session; a chugging number called ""Monastic Living I."" is Battles without the epiphanies. Unlike that paragon of artistic rejection, Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music, which actually coheres rather nicely, the EP has little textural detail; the music is not immersive, much less transcendent. It isn’t just a score to modern ennui but a work that itself feels indifferent. Yet it’s presented with a straight face: The band are touring the EP and we can buy it, though I’m unsure why anyone would—perhaps its existence as a paid-for product is part of the statement. What it means for the band’s future is, for now, a mystery, though not the kind it is fun to unravel.","Parquet Courts’ new mini-LP Monastic Living contains just one song with words; the remaining eight tracks aren't just wordless, they're also tuneless. It feels like their first true statement of total rejection.

A Love Supreme: The Complete Masters,John Coltrane,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17613d197565213a60b/1:1/w_160/8b1f0d01.jpg,2015-11-25 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21158-a-love-supreme-the-complete-masters/,Verve,"John Coltrane was a late bloomer. Born in 1926, the same year as Miles Davis, he spent his twenties in and out of small-time bands, a promising journeyman moving between playing jazz and the more bar-friendly music that was starting to be called R&B. During these early years he had problems with narcotics and alcohol, alternating stretches of heroin use with periods of binge drinking. Charlie Parker—every sax player's hero when Coltrane was coming up in the 1940s and '50s—had given the junkie life a romantic aura for some naive souls, connecting drug use with creativity. But the underachieving Coltrane was a run-of-the-mill addict, someone broke and in ill health whose habit clearly kept him stuck in place. He was fired from Miles Davis' band in 1957 for showing up on the bandstand dressed in shabby clothes and visibly drunk—by some accounts he took a punch from the trumpeter before being given his walking papers. And if Coltrane had spiraled and his career had ended there, he'd be remembered now as a musician who flamed out just as he was discovering his voice. But that's not what happened. Everything changed for Coltrane in 1957 when, as he wrote in the liner notes to his defining album, A Love Supreme, he ""experienced, by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life."" During that year, Coltrane stopped drinking and kicked heroin, and from that point forward, his career would unfold with an almost frightening amount of focus and intensity. These final 10 years are when Coltrane made his mark on the world of jazz as a leader, and he was then seemingly always on the move, in transition, each moment glimpsed as a blur on a continuum rather than a fixed point in space. He wasn't just covering ground, he was accelerating, and every phase of his later career has the attendant feeling of stomach-dropping free-fall, of being pushed forcefully into new places. A Love Supreme, recorded with what was later called his classic quartet, is Coltrane's musical expression of his 1957 epiphany. It's the sound of a man laying his soul bare. Structured as a suite and delivered in praise of God, everything about the record is designed for maximum emotional impact, from Elvin Jones' opening gong crash to the soft rain of McCoy Tyner's piano clusters to Coltrane's stately fanfare to Jimmy Garrison's iconic four-note bassline to the spoken chant by Coltrane—""a-LOVE-su-PREME, a-LOVE-su-PREME""—that carries out the opening movement, ""Acknowledgement"". By the time the record gets to the closing ""Psalm"", which finds Coltrane interpreting on his saxophone the syllables of a poem he'd written to the Creator, A Love Supreme has wrung its concept dry, extracting every drop of feeling from Coltrane's initial vision. It's as complete a statement as exists in recorded jazz. Hearing it now as part of this exhaustive 3xCD set, which gathers every scrap of material recorded during the sessions as well as a live performance of the suite from later the same year, you get a clearer sense than ever before of the different forms A Love Supreme might have taken, and how Coltrane's desire to communicate something specific and profound led to its final shape. A Love Supreme is also one of the most popular albums in the last 60 years of jazz, selling the kind of numbers usually reserved for pop (it quickly sold more than 100,000 copies, and has almost certainly sold more than a million since). If Miles Davis' Kind of Blue is the most frequently bought first jazz album for those curious about the genre, A Love Supreme is easily number two. But though they were released just seven years apart, there's a world of difference between the two records, and the success of A Love Supreme is trickier to explain. For all its structural daring, Kind of Blue also functions as an ambient record, with slower tempos and a late-night vibe. A Love Supreme is harder to get a handle on. If you can think of Coltrane's work on a continuum, from the gorgeous melodicism of ""My Favorite Things"" or Ballads or his album with Duke Ellington on one end and the brutal noise assault of the 1966 concerts collected on Concert in Japan on the other, A Love Supreme sits perfectly at the fulcrum, challenging enough to continually reveal new aspects but accessible enough to inspire newcomers. Coltrane may have structured the record for just this effect. He had already been further ""out"" than the music heard on A Love Supreme, including some of the knotty extended jams like ""Chasin' the Trane"" recorded at his 1961 sessions at the Village Vanguard. He was fascinated with the innovations of Ornette Coleman from the minute he heard them in the late '50s, and though he never completely abandoned chord changes, he regularly flirted with atonality, improvising outside of a fixed key. With A Love Supreme, it was almost as though Coltrane knew he had to dial things back a little in order to share his message of spiritual rebirth with a wider audience. Though conventionally beautiful in many ways, A Love Supreme is, for many, the exact point beyond which jazz becomes too experimental. It's possible to hear on this set how the album might have gone even further. At a time when a single track might have a dozen collaborators working on it over the course of weeks, it's a little mind-boggling to consider that the music on A Love Supreme was recorded on a single day, December 9, 1964. This wasn't uncommon for jazz records of the time. But though they had the music in the can from that first day, Coltrane wanted to try something else. So on December 10, he called the young tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp, and a second bassist, Art Davis to play with his quartet. The six musicians then ran through two versions of A Love Supreme's opening ""Acknowledgment"", so that Coltrane could explore what the music might sound like with another horn and additional low-end rhythm. Shepp was an up-and-comer deeply influenced by Coltrane; the two takes of ""Acknowledgment"" featuring Shepp find him serving as a kind of textural counterpoint, his more brittle and biting tone commenting on the melody from an oblique angle and hinting at possibilities existing outside of the version recorded the day before. You sense a more abrasive road not taken, one that almost certainly would have found a smaller audience. We hear a different perspective on the fantastic live version of the suite recorded in France five months after the album's release. Five months in '60s Coltrane time was like a decade in the career of other jazz musicians, and he was already imbuing the A Love Supreme material with an extra intensity. Tyner's clanging chords on ""Resolution"" have a harsher edge, and Coltrane's attendant soloing is much rougher and more pointed, his notes seeming to attack the structure of the composition from several directions rather than floating along above it. This is the hard-blowing sound that Coltrane would show on Meditations, another spiritually focused album-length suite recorded later in 1965 that never had a chance at A Love Supreme's level of mainstream acceptance. In the same year, Coltrane would also record Om and Ascension, two harsh and challenging pieces of music that strain against the boundaries of what most people would even consider music. Given what surrounds it, and how sweet and gentle it so often is, A Love Supreme was an expression of a very specific time and place, a conscious attempt by Coltrane to communicate something to his audience that was broad enough to be understood but rich and complex enough to honor both where he was as a musician and the depth of the subject matter. A Love Supreme sounds like nothing else in John Coltrane's discography, and indeed like little else in recorded jazz, sitting at the nexus of so many competing musical ideas. The final piece of the A Love Supreme equation concerns the civil rights movement and black liberation, and how those swirling ideas were inextricably tangled up with the jazz avant-garde.  Coltrane was never overtly political, but he did allow his thoughts and feelings to bleed into his music. Coltrane met Malcolm X, wrote a piece for Martin Luther King Jr., and his 1963 dirge ""Alabama"", a piece with a close tonal connection to A Love Supreme's ""Psalm"", was written to commemorate the four girls killed in the Birmingham church bombing that year. As the '60s wore on, politically conscious ""fire jazz"" grew in currency, much of it directly inspired by Coltrane's music, but during his life he never quite felt the need to connect his music to specific social currents, even as others drew inspiration from it in that context. Coltrane was seeking something broader, communing with God as he understood it. For Coltrane, that spiritual journey led him to A Love Supreme, which became the base he'd explore from during his short time left on Earth. Coltrane occupies a unique position in jazz history. He was famous, especially in the jazz world, but he wasn't really a personality. He was not inclined toward interviews and he wasn't very good at them, preferring to let the music speak for itself. He didn't have the mystery of a Thelonious Monk, the tragic genius of a Charlie Parker, the cool comfort with celebrity or flamboyance of a Miles Davis, the combative verbal dexterity of Charles Mingus, the theoretical underpinnings of Ornette Coleman, the comfort with the mainstream of Louis Armstrong, or the symbolic stature of Duke Ellington. He led a quiet life, putting everything into his music. His chaotic years mostly came when he was an unknown; by the time he was a major jazz figure, almost his entire life was music. If he wasn't on stage or in a recording studio, he was practicing or studying records. Seemingly every other story of an encounter with Coltrane in the 1960s involved him in a room with a saxophone in his hand, playing scales. In his mind, God had saved him, and he was going to give back. A Love Supreme was his expression of gratitude, a hopeful prayer for a better world.","A Love Supreme is John Coltrane's defining album. Structured as a suite and delivered in praise of God, everything about it is designed for maximum emotional impact.

Anareta,Horrendous,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b152ea9e61561daa676e/1:1/w_160/a92745f4.jpg,2015-11-24 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21134-anareta/,Dark Descent,"The Philadelphia death metal trio Horrendous were dubbed vintage revivalists just three years ago, with their 2012 debut The Chills. But their sound opened up drastically for Ecdysis, the album's glimpses of outside influences earning the band increased attention. On A**nareta, a record captured during one obsessive, month-long session spent sequestered in bandleader Damian Herring's home studio, Horrendous' playbook feels truly open. It's as if, bona fides well established, the band set out to form a link between the past they once embraced and a future they imagine. This shift is as clear during opener ""The Nihilist"", where seething whispers curl around a complex math-metal figure, as it is during closer ""The Solipsist"", where a kaleidoscopic melody spins like a spotlight inside a thrash metal bulwark. There are references to antecedents throughout*:* ""Stillborn Gods"" invokes Slayer, while moments of ""Ozymandias"" sound like a Big Four mixtape. The legacy of Swedish death metal looms large, too. But these are the foundations from which Horrendous now sprawl—with bright solos that whip in the wind, with rubber-band basslines that run counterclockwise to the leads, with whiplash rhythms that suggest a short-circuiting carnival ride. Through all of these twists and churns, the band never seems to be showing off its dexterity, or attempting transitions for their own sake. Horrendous have become masters of pacing and dynamics, instinctively knowing when to let the album and audience breathe. ""Polaris"" progresses from doom metal to black metal to death metal and back to doom seamlessly, as though a DJ had spent hours perfecting the cuts between it all. On the first five minutes of ""Acolytes"", they plow through a grindcore sprint and settle into a dense and demanding death-metal section, with a squealing little riff tucked carefully into a rhythm section that refuses to sit still. These additions lend the momentum of mystery to these songs, which surprise every time you hear them. One of the most glorious moments on the album, and in metal this year, arrives as a revelation at the end of ""Acolytes"". Unexpectedly, the guitar stalls, locking into one glowing note as the drums retreat into a low-tempo tap. Then, a new arching riff radiates outward, as though the guitar has suddenly emerged from a mountain's shadow and into the midday sun. The drums double and triple their pace, while Herring musters one final, fade-away scream, like a hero taking his leave of a scene. It's a beautiful passage, as redemptive as anything on Deafheaven's Sunbather and as cathartic as the closing moments of a symphony. Though they sound quite different, Anareta has a lot in common with my other favorite metal album of the year, Tribulation's The Children of the Night. On their earliest albums, both bands wrestled with the past, rendering death metal anew as competent revivalists. But in 2015, they have both stretched those traditions, filling accepted frameworks with unlikely elements. The influences are still recognizable, but the results are no longer obvious. This quest even comes written into Anareta's wonderfully narrative lyrics, where the aim for mortal meaning serves as the cri de cœur. ""Forging a new reality/ Embrace the burning dawn in me,"" goes the end of ""Acolytes"". Indeed, metal can value faithful, enthusiastic recreations more than heretical ingenuity, and vice versa. But like Tribulation, Horrendous show the value of compromise within a record that creates its own middle ground—and stands right there for eight tracks, stunning.","The Philadelphia death metal trio Horrendous were dubbed vintage revivalists just three years ago, with their 2012 debut The Chills. On A**nareta, a record captured during one obsessive, month-long session spent sequestered in bandleader Damian Herring's home studio, Horrendous' playbook feels truly open.

On their studio albums, they are rare arbiters of outside collaboration: They've brought in the likes of the Haxan Cloak, the Assembly of Light Choir, Robert Lowe of Lichens and Om, Braveyoung, and Thou to expand metal’s capacity for exploring terror and inflicting self-prescribed misery. As a live band, the Body forego experimentation and focus on how far amplification can raise them and test you. Chip King sands you down with both multiplying walls of low end and his voice, a hybrid of Xasthur's Scott Conner's ghostly wails and the bleeding highs of Silencer's Nattramn; drummer Lee Buford is the only drummer with enough force to give aim to King’s projectiles. Choirs, religious speaking in tongues samples, and other details get smothered in the pursuit of absolutely demolishing the audience. The Body's latest collaboration is with USBM stalwarts Krieg, specifically their mastermind and sole consistent member Neill Jameson. For the Body, it's the closest meeting of their two sides. It's still not quite close to the heaviness of their live shows—when a medium that can capture that emerges, it'll be huge news—but it’s still a convincing document about how both groups see rawness beyond a production style or anti-aesthetic. Jameson's main contribution to the project is his vocals, which complement and counter King's shrill howl. Where King’s voice can seep into the music like a poisoned wind, Jameson comes through assertively, providing a hardcore edge that is usually more apparent in the Body's live show. He also coaxes rawer work out of them, acting as a pivotal spiritual influence. ""Fracture"" is a house with some of King’s densest noise walls; the suffocation that comes with them playing a narrow dive bar-cum-morgue or DIY house with feeble breakers has never been so effectively bottled. King and Jameson act as an interrogation unit, switching off each other. Like I Shall Die Here, the Body, along with Jameson, explore the relationship between metal and dark electronic music. Their cover of Nine Inch Nails' ""Terrible Lie"" on You, Whom I Have Always Hated has become one of their more heralded tracks, and here, they take on more perverted interpretations of the great electronic and metal clash of the '90s. They warp goth-metal on ""Never Worth Your Name"", taking what would be a gorgeous synth backbone for Anathema or Type O Negative and strips any and all lust. There’s some form of longing left, the only thing left to trace it back to its source material. There's also a deceptive warmth, something also present on their cover of Sinéad O'Connor's ""Boys in Black Mopeds"" from the Body’s 2008 tour CD-R. The closest thing to the Haxan Cloak’s touch on Die Here is ""Carved Out and Caved In"", where distant bells work to loosen the guitar into a noise morass. While this collaboration lacks some of the unity of D**ie Here, it still has enthralling experiments with electronics rarely seen in metal. And for both groups, there’s always the drive for unorthodox aggression.","Portland-via-Providence duo the Body push the boundaries of metal in both the intensity of their live experience and their penchant for collaboration. They've worked with the Haxan Cloak, the Assembly of Light Choir, and many others, and on their latest team up with USBM stalwarts Krieg.

Gode,André Bratten,by: Nathan Reese,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2449d034d5c69bf4b41/1:1/w_160/b70de00e.jpg,2015-11-24 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21299-gode/,Smalltown Supersound,"Some of Norway's best producers seem to compensate for the region's chilly climate by gravitating toward sunny sounds, from Todd Terje's escapist lounge-house to Prins Thomas and Lindstrøm's psychedelic nu-disco. This can't be said for 28-year-old producer André Bratten. Although he records in the same Oslo studio as Terje, Thomas, and Lindstrøm, Bratten's new album Gode is insular and experimental, from conception to execution. Gode is Bratten's second proper full-length record, following 2013's inventively titled Be a Man You Ant and this past summer's Math Ilium Ion EP. It's also the most ambitious work of his career, tackling social and historical injustices of the past—namely the serf-like arrangement between farmers and landowners in early 20th-century Norway. Now, if you're thinking that a double LP about the pre-industrialized Norwegian agrarian economy isn't going to get club kids on the floor, you're right. But this time around that's not Bratten's goal. He wants to tell a story with specific historical context within electronic music, which is an inherently difficult task: A synth stab, field recording, or a programmed drum pattern, however well-conceived, doesn't translate to ""meditation on the darker days of Norway’s past, before the country discovered its oil wealth,"" as Bratten has said. But even if you'd never guess the album's larger themes without reading about it, it's clear from the music that he's attempting something more evocative and wide-ranging. Bratten's production can recall everything from Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works to Andy Stott's murky experimentalism. He's cited Brian Eno as an influence, as well as 20th century classical musicians like Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, and Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi—known for creating music that plays off a single pitch that generates almost imperceptible microtonal oscillations. Bratten is resourceful at assembling whatever sounds or styles needed to fit the need of the moment: ""Primordial Pit"" uses mostly live instruments to create a sweeping, post-rock-like grandeur, while ""Ins."", the album's shortest track, is a dissonant string arrangement that is as beautiful as it is unnerving. For all this wandering, the most overtly pleasing songs on Gode are the ones that call back to Bratten's roots. ""Space Between Left & Right"" has a techno pitter-patter that a patient nightclub crowd could easily appreciate, while the album's title track evokes Boards of Canada at their prettiest. Another clear highlight is ""Cascade of Events"", which features the Norwegian pop singer Susanne Sundfør, who Bratten had previously remixed, her voice shrouded in an analog haze. Having a voice like Sundfør, who has had multiple number one albums in her home country, gives Bratten an anchor to chain his more experimental inclinations to; it'd be fascinating to hear Bratten paired with Sundfør for more than one track. Given the intentions that Gode comes packed with, it's tempting to view its success in terms of that story. Does Gode accomplish Bratten's goal of creating a tribute to the farmers who never had the opportunity to make art because of their circumstances? Quite possibly! But like a museum plaque explaining abstract art to a layperson, background is only a tiny piece of a mostly visceral experience. What's easier to glean, and more universal, is that Bratten has made an expertly produced, emotionally honest record that defies genre and expectation. To understand that requires no homework.","The 28-year-old producer André Bratten records in the same Oslo studio as Todd Terje, Prins Thomas, and Lindstrøm, but his new album Gode bears darker influences: Aphex Twin, Andy Stott. It is insular and experimental, and also his most ambitious work to date.

Sold Out,DJ Paypal,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19113d197565213a634/1:1/w_160/9f2e64fb.jpg,2015-11-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21169-sold-out/,Brainfeeder,"Footwork producer DJ Paypal doesn't appear on the surface to be the type of artist that treats his influences with any sort of mindfulness. From his trollish stage name to the plainly ironic bite of Pen and Pixel's distinctive, lens-flare-heavy aesthetic on the cover of his new mini-LP Sold Out, he reads on first glance like just another node on Internet Art's massive recombination engine, which endlessly churns out kitschy (and occasionally brilliant) assemblages of random late-capitalist pop-cultural detritus.There's also the matter of the style he's working in: footwork is a particularly holistic musical form that until very recently has been virtually inseparable not only from the dance style that it soundtracks, but also from the brutally segregated, impoverished black neighborhoods on Chicago's South and West Sides where it was born. It's a minor revelation to find out that Paypal's far more sincere than his image would suggest. The way that the drums on Sold Out's titular opening track pulse in and out of focus is an expert move well out of reach of the average SoundCloud dilettante, and throughout the album he displays the kind of rule-bending that only comes from closely studying the rules first. ""A lot of kids hear like five tracks and start making footwork, and that’s not respectful,"" he told Pitchfork recently. It's clear from his music that he has listened to thousands and absorbed them into his DNA. And not only does he make incredibly good footwork, he's also helping to clear a path for its future evolution. Paypal's a member of the L.A.-born Brainfeeder coalition of artists representing a certain organic, jazz-indebted segment of bass music experimentalists, and like most of the best material to come out of the Brainfeeder camp, it reconnects beat-based music with styles of pre-digital black music whose more radical avant-garde aspects have been forgotten over the years, or dulled by overfamiliarity—bebop, free jazz, and especially the synthesizer-crazed soul and fusion artists of the '70s. ""Ahhhhhhh"" combines blissed-out piano riffs, pitched up vocal harmonies, and a burbling bassline. ""With Uuuuuuu"" and ""On a Cloud"" teasingly reference early synth-funk (the latter with a vocoder part that Paypal and coproducers Nangdo and DJ Taye blend into a crisp solo trumpet). Other parts of the record reach even further out—""Slim Trak"" folds in Brazilian samba drumming, while ""Say Goodbye"" (featuring Keiska and Tielsie), drifts into a stoned-genius hybrid of dream pop and J-pop that's easily compelling enough to sustain an entire LP. At the same time, Paypal's also a member of Chicago's venerable footwork music crew Teklife, and his tracks never lose sight of the style's more utilitarian roots scoring YouTube footworking videos and high school hallway dance battles. The old slogan that ""music wants to be free"" is a truer fit for remix culture than the music piracy advocates that coined it. There's a point in the life cycle of every musical style where it has to expand its worldview and open itself up to new participants and new influences, or else it stagnates and withers away. No artist needs to ask permission to borrow an influence, and with so much music available and making it becoming so cheap, it's not even a requirement that you dive more than surface deep into a style before you borrow it. But Sold Out shows what a difference it can make when you hold yourself to a higher standard.","DJ Paypal's name might be ironic and trollish, but his love of Chicago footwork is sincere. On his playful and mind-expanding new mini-LP Sold Out, he not only makes incredibly good footwork but helps pave the way for its future.

Heady Nuggs: 20 Years After Clouds Taste Metallic,The Flaming Lips,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b234b1335d7bf169a3d0/1:1/w_160/32af4253.jpg,2015-11-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21279-heady-nuggs-20-years-after-clouds-taste-metallic/,Warner Bros.Warner Bros.,"By 1995, the post-Nevermind dream that any eccentric rock outfit could follow Nirvana’s path from indie outsiders to chart-toppling insurrectionaries was officially dead. The '90s mainstream would not be transformed in the image of the '80s underground after all, and, as it turned out, Sonic Youth weren’t festival-headliner material. By mid-decade, many artists pegged as the next Nirvana had either deliberately swerved from the spotlight or swung for the fences and whiffed, thus ensuring that no used-CD store was ever lacking for multiple copies of  Exit the Dragon and Let Your Dim Light Shine. For a moment there, the Flaming Lips seemed destined to join the also-rans. Released in the fall of 1995, Clouds Taste Metallic was the band’s seventh album, but the first to arrive with any commercial expectations. After a decade on the fringes, the Lips struck paydirt with 1993's Transmissions From the Satellite Heart, whose fluke hit single—""She Don’t Use Jelly""—drove album sales into the low six figures and earned the triple crown of '90s TV appearances. Understandably trying to capitalize on this momentum, the Lips loaded Clouds with more cheery and catchy songs about girls doing strange things with foodstuffs. But album sales floundered and, by the fall of 1996, reclusive guitarist Ronald Jones—whose swirling screech was so crucial to the two aforementioned records—had left the band, reportedly out of frustration with drummer Steven Drozd’s worsening heroin addiction. Clouds Taste Metallic is the last album where the Flaming Lips just sounded like some oddballs from Oklahoma, before Wayne Coyne, Drozd, and bassist Michael Ivins refashioned themselves as studio scientists and transformed into the blood-splattered, laser-shooting, Miley-collaborating freak show that’s topped festival bills since the dawn of the millennium. But the record stands as the peak moment in a fantastic four-album run that began with 1990’s In a Priest Driven Ambulance. It's a sturdy wood-paneled shrine to the band’s teenage rec-room touchstones, channeling the shortwave frequencies of Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the fuzz-toned boogie of The Slide**r, the rustic splendor of After the Gold Rush, the thundering thrust of Houses of the Holy, and a Revolver-like balance of kid-friendly frivolity and strobe-lit freakery. Clouds' sad-eyed opener, ""The Abandoned Hospital Ship"", charts the Flaming Lips’ early '90s evolution in miniature: A creaky Coyne serenade (click-tracked by a wheezing film projector) gives way to a volcanic sludge-rock eruption, but the maelstrom is eventually smoothed over by merry church-bell chimes and swooning choral harmonies. It’s the musical manifestation of what would later become a common Lips lyrical motif—even in the midst of chaos, everything’s going to be okay. Here, the Lips use distortion to exhilarate rather than annihilate: ""Psychiatric Exploration of the Fetus With Needles"" may rumble like a rocket launching out of your floor, but its perma-grin melody invites you along for the ride. Coyne and Jones’ guitar noise is infused with character and humor, like the spasmodic riffs that personify a patently absurd song like ""Guy Who Got a Headache and Accidentally Saves the World"" or the buzzing surges that power ""Lightning Strikes the Postman"". And there’s also something reassuringly earthbound about their sound—amid the high-octane blast of ""Kim’s Watermelon Gun"", Jones drops in countrified fills like he’s plucking an electric banjo, while the cuteness of ""Christmas at the Zoo"" is kept in check by a George Harrison-style refrain that emulates the weepy tone of a pedal steel. But if Clouds Taste Metallic pushes Coyne’s lyrical whimsy into overdrive, it also provides the first inklings of the more emotionally charged songwriting that would flourish on 1999’s orchestro-rock opus The Soft Bulletin. Rather than merely invoke outer-space imagery for trippy effect, stargazing songs like ""Placebo Headwound"" and ""When You Smile"" find Coyne simultaneously awed and humbled by his infinitesimal place in the cosmos. And the alternately rousing and defeatist ""Evil Will Prevail"" resonated all the more deeply in the aftermath of the April 1995 domestic-terrorist bombing in their native Oklahoma. The songs that fill out this expanded three-disc 20th-anniversary edition—part of the band’s Heady Nuggs reissue series—likewise capture the Lips at their most down-to-earth, evincing an intimate charm that’s since been vanquished from the band’s increasingly futurist, high-concept music. Even though, post-Transmissions, the Lips were an MTV-approved major-label rock band touring with the likes of Tool, Stone Temple Pilots, and Candlebox, they were more spiritually in tune with the lo-fi pop and skewed, tape-manipulated psychedelia bubbling up from the American indie underground in the early '90s. The wonderful 1994 EP Due to High Expectations… The Flaming Lips Are Providing Needles for Your Balloons (included here in its entirety) is anchored by an early, slightly scruffier version of future Clouds closer ""Bad Days"", but mostly imagines a parallel '90s where the Lips were signed to Drag City instead of Warner Bros. Woofer-blowing sing-alongs (""Jets Pt. 2"") collide with honky-tonked Alan Vega revamps (""Ice Drummer""), shout-outs to a then-unknown Bill Callahan (via the live in-store performance of Smog’s ""Chosen One"") and impromptu Christmas carols (""Little Drummer Boy""). The Needles EP is supplemented here by corrosive covers of Bowie (""Life on Mars?""), Bolan (""Ballrooms of Mars""), Sinatra (""It Was a Very Good Year"") and other ephemera, but collectively the bonus material reinforces the lo-fi maxim that a great song can withstand the most unforgiving production. No song makes that case more persuasively than ""Put the Waterbug in the Policeman’s Ear"", a piano ballad that sounds like it was recorded into a dictaphone that is nonetheless one of the prettiest, most poignant songs in the Lips canon. It also serves as a reminder of a time when Flaming Lips songs required two-minute preambles from Coyne to explain their meaning (in this case, a half-true story about his stoned brother’s paranoid freak-out at a grocery store, and his imagined superhuman ability to telepathically summon insects to attack meddlesome cops). But where the post-Bulletin Lips thrived by translating serious songs into circus-sized spectacle, back in the mid-’90s, Coyne had a special gift for making the most outlandish concepts seem logical and oddly relatable. Heady Nuggs’ third disc—a bootleg-quality document of a May 1996 show in Seattle—is hardly lacking for expository banter, though the real novelty is hearing the Lips rip through a set untethered to the ceremony and choreography that defines their shows today. It’s a grainy-but-radiant snapshot of the mid-'90s Lips live experience, and the performances—particularly the awesomely interstellar version of In a Priest Driven Ambulance’s ""Take Meta Mars""—capture this version of the band at the peak of their brain-scrambling powers. (You may not be able to see the twinkling pinwheel Christmas lights that smothered their stages at the time, but you can more or less hear them.) But a telling moment emerges from the epic distention of ""Psychiatric Explorations"" that closes the set proper. After stretching what was originally a three-minute song past the nine-minute mark (and seriously straining Coyne’s voice in the process), the Lips sputter out, and within months, their entire guitar-powered aesthetic would follow suit. Ronald Jones was gone just a few months later, and before year’s end, the band had turned into something else entirely. Compared to what followed, the Flaming Lips that made Clouds Taste Metallic were just a rock'n'roll band. But this reissue reminds us of what a uniquely wondrous and marvelous rock'n'roll band they were.","Clouds Taste Metallic, newly reissued in a 3xCD set, is the last album where the Flaming Lips just sounded like some oddballs from Oklahoma. It stands as the peak moment in a fantastic four-album run that began with 1990’s In a Priest Driven Ambulance.

N.V.,Dragged Into Sunlight / Gnaw Their Tongues,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1fe5e6ef95969322205/1:1/w_160/47062bdb.jpg,2015-11-23 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21242-nv/,Prosthetic,"""That's when my rape fantasies first started, when I was in college,"" explains the late serial killer Michael Ross, who is centrally featured on the aptly titled ""Visceral Repulsion"", perhaps the most jarring example of the pointless and even malicious shock that characterizes N.V*.* A collaboration between English extreme-metal quartet Dragged Into Sunlight and Dutch noise musician Maurice ""Mories"" de Jong, who releases music under several monikers and has put out upwards of 30 records as Gnaw Their Tongues, N.V. (""negative volume"") is littered with samples of true-crime confessions from the likes of Ross. As if his presence weren't unpleasant enough, the sample delves into the various techniques Ross used to murder his victims. Presumably, the team of artists who made N.V. would argue that real-life horror is fair game for evoking a reaction(namely: disgust) with art. In fact, judging from two recent interviews, it seems likely that Dragged Into Sunlight even managed to disturb themselves with this record, and that de Jong draws from headline-news violence in his work because it genuinely frightens him. Not to mention that the sound clips are lifted from TV documentaries that sensationalize these acts while purporting to condemn them. Still, the inclusion of these samples is flat-out despicable and speaks volumes about how decades of desensitization have blurred not only the lines of good taste but of common decency as well. If N.V. is any indication, actual murder has become indistinguishable from any other image we passively ingest from the safe, numb remove of our computer monitors. Once artists adopt ""extremity"" as the cowardly affectation that it is, they leave themselves little choice but to keep pushing the envelope. The musicians on N.V. would probably insist that they went this far precisely because they wanted to make the audience feel something. But to indulge them in a rewardless thought-loop by debating their intentions is to allow them to manipulate you and waste your time. It's a shame, because N.V.'s lurid first-person homicide monologues overshadow its wealth of sonic character. Both of these acts are defined by their (arguably unparalleled) ability to create atmosphere, which makes their yin-yang pairing a natural fit that, on paper, overflows with possibilities. Judging from their respective bodies of work, there's no doubt that Dragged Into Sunlight and Gnaw Their Tongues could have rendered tunes like ""Visceral Repulsion"" scary—and taken the audience into a truly murderous, sexually depraved headspace—through other, more imaginative means. Pig Destroyer frontman-lyricist J.R. Hayes, for example, scares the daylights out of you and dives even further into the same thematic terrain but manages to get there without trampling on anyone's grave. Billed as a joint effort, N.V. actually bears the stamp of two other significant contributors, Godflesh/Jesu founder Justin Broadrick and Corrupt Moral Altar drummer-producer Tom Dring. Having produced the first two DIS albums, Dring once again had a hand in shaping the sounds throughout the making of N.V., while Broadrick stepped in as co-producer and sonic overseer later, during the mixing stages. By that point, the initial collaboration had yielded three hours' worth of raw material spanning five years' worth of on-again, off-again back and forth with DIS and de Jong working out of their respective homebases in England and the Netherlands. Stretched as it was over time, distance, and multiple perspectives, N.V. sounds surprisingly focused and, musically speaking, rather non-indulgent (perhaps because Broadrick, Dring, DIS, and de Jong boiled the final product down to a 32-minute runtime). Broadrick's input is somewhat difficult to discern, but de Jong's touch saturates this music. Even in the spots where Dragged Into Sunlight blasts away and it seems like there's no room to cram in any more sonic information, de Jong is there, hovering like a toxic, mind-altering haze that burns your eyes, chokes your throat, and soaks into your skin -- sensations that are not without their appeal. Dragged Into Sunlight had already created a sense of psych-ward hysteria with the black-grind hybrid they established as far back as 2008's Terminal Aggressor, and their ability to use raw ingredients like cymbal wash, inhuman-sounding vocal shrieks, reverbs, and delays gave their music a queasy hall-of-mirrors feel that set the band apart from other likeminded peers. On N.V*.*, they turn to Mories as a kind of set designer who fleshes out and brings spacial and tactile dimension to the Liverpool quartet's caustic exorcisms. Naturally, as an almost supergroup-like meeting of the minds between three highly production-conscious acts, N.V. is crammed with details that don't initially reveal themselves. But even if de Jong and Dragged Into Sunlight grasp the scale of the tragedies they've chosen to rub the audience's nose in, the fact is they're contributing to trivializing the victims in these cases. Will listeners respond to N.V. the way we might once have tittered at the gross-out slasher fantasies on early Cannibal Corpse records, or will they recognize the distinction? At this stage in the game, metal bands should consider it their creative if not human responsibility to view these well-worn subjects through new lenses. Being ""more extreme"" for its own sake is not only lame but creatively and ethically bankrupt. That said, there is undeniably an art to N.V.'s execution. Together, its participants combine layers of abrasion that can be rewarding if you can, well, get past the visceral repulsion.","A collaboration between English extreme-metal quartet Dragged Into Sunlight and Dutch noise musician Mories, N.V. is both a supergroup-like meeting of the minds and an empty exercise in envelope pushing for its own sake.

Invisible Switch,Joey Anderson,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b21613d197565213a6f8/1:1/w_160/cf238b0e.jpg,2015-11-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21258-invisible-switch/,Dekmantel,"Joey Anderson came to house music first as a dancer: Not your average weekend clubber, but a devoted student of a vernacular form, house dancing, that thrived in New York and New Jersey nightclubs in the 1990s—expressive, fluid, acrobatic, and competitive. You can hear that influence in the sparse, wiry productions that he has been recording since the beginning of this decade. They're not made for fist-pumping, and they don't follow neat verse/chorus structures. They ripple and writhe unpredictably, marked by an improvisational sense of movement. They seem to move of their own accord. Anderson comes from the same corner of the house and techno universe that has given us artists like Levon Vincent, Anthony Parasole, and DJ Qu, a fellow dancer. Like them, he favors analog drum machines, hardware synthesizers, and what sounds, above all, like a lot of playing of keys and twisting of knobs in real time. Much contemporary electronic music is composed visually, assembled brick by brick on a computer screen, but Anderson's snake-in-the-grass meanderings suggest live takes stacked one on top of another, thanks to the magic of multi-tracking. ""18 Arms"" goes straight to the heart of his approach. True to its name (leave it to a dancer to come up with a title like that), it opens with a synthesizer pattern that squirms like an octopus' tentacles, and as the track accrues its fistfuls of counterpoints and layers, it becomes easy to imagine the producer as a one-man band. At any given point on the album, three or more synthesizer parts are being woven together; drum hits are flaring up and being muted again; a hi-hat's pitch seesaws up and down. The cumulative effect of all these techniques is at once chaotic and elegant, and fluid above all. But how the music is put together is ultimately less important than how it feels, and Anderson's music is all about feel. It's hard to put your finger on the emotions they evoke, but you're moved all the same. (""'Deep' to me is like the human condition that you don't talk about, that you hold in forever until you are in front of that right person"" Anderson told Resident Advisor, which might go some way towards explaining the slipperiness of his music's emotional register.) A song might be calm and meditative: the spacious ""Organ to Dust"" is a study in stillness in which quietly accelerating figures move like quarters spinning to a halt on the floor. ""Nabta Playa"", named for a drained basin in the Egyptian desert, is fleet and mysterious; in both sound and mood, it's reminiscent of Drexciya's Afro-futurist fantasies, and the Detroit icons' fizzy textures and frantic movements also inform ""Amarna"", whose title refers to the tomb of the Pharaoh Akhenaten. It's the album's most unhinged track, with wildly filtered drums that thrash desperately about. It sounds like music for punching mirrors; it moves like someone trying to escape his own shadow. True to the corporeal bent of Anderson's album, it locates emotion not in the mind but in the muscles.","Joey Anderson's take on house and techno is at once chaotic and elegant, and fluid above all.

Kneedelus,Kneebody and Daedelus,by: Ron Hart,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1fb9d034d5c69bf4ad5/1:1/w_160/3db0ce3e.jpg,2015-11-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21240-kneedelus/,Brainfeeder,"Under his Flying Lotus codename, Steven Ellison continues to push his distinctive strain of abstract hip-hop into the direction paved by his Great Aunt Alice and Great Uncle John. You could hear the family history coursing through the interstellar spaces he explored with his cousin Ravi on 2010's Cosmogramma and that Herbie Hancock jam on last year's You're Dead!. But Ellison's advancement of creative jazz has been more crucial as curator of the Brainfeeder label, which he founded in 2008 as an outlet for himself and his buddies down at Low End Theory in Los Angeles. Kamasi Washington's The Epic hinted at FlyLo's A&R prowess, and Kneedelus puts an exclamation point on the imprint's new direction. The relationship between exploratory, Grammy-nominated funk-jazz outfit Kneebody and pioneering Cali beat scientist Daedelus (born Alfred Darlington) goes back almost a decade, evidenced by remixes on Bandcamp and a stage collaboration at the Jazz à Vienne Festival in 2009. Kneebody saxophonist Ben Wendel and Darlington are high school friends, while Darlington and Flying Lotus go back to 1983, Ellison's debut, and Darlington's indelible remix of the title track. What all of this six-degrees business adds up to is this supernova of a record, rounded out by Adam Benjamin on keyboard, Shane Endsley on treated trumpet, bassist Kaveh Rastegar, and drummer Nate Wood. As a collaborative unit, the friendship between the parties undoubtedly lends itself to the fluidity of these 10 original compositions. In some cases, as on tracks like the rugged ""The Hole"" and the hypnotic ""Move"", you can't really even tell where Kneebody ends and Daedelus begins. Darlington's deft rhythmic impulses come to the fore on ""Drum Battle"", but in other moments, the invincible horn section of Kneebody runs the show. On ""Loops"", Endsley's trumpet is cat-like and cool, as the group takes the scrambled-signal breakbeat Daedelus delivers to the snapping point around the horn's calm center like a hurricane eye. On ""Platforming"", meanwhile, Wendel's fantastic Art Pepper-esque tenor work is transformed into a wild, distorted-violin sound. Elsewhere, its Benjamin who is leading the charge on the seven-minute *Mwandishi-*flavored space-out ""Thought Not"", and the haunting processed upright piano he plays on ""Not Love"". Yet its when Kneebody and Daedelus fuse that Kneedelus achieves its potential. And perhaps no other track really embodies that idea more than ""Home"", the album's deep modal center that simmers together Tubby dub, TNT-era Tortoise, and Lalo Schifrin. It's no matter of happenstance the cover of Kneedelus is a shameless emulation of the design format of another game-changing jazz record label, ECM. This album exists in a very similar atmosphere to some of Manfred Eicher's bolder production moves throughout the last 40-odd years (dig that Jack DeJohnette box set for proof). And above all, it's a vision offering one last reminder before the year is out that Brainfeeder is very serious about its place in the jazz world.","Kneedelus is a collaboration between the Cali beat scientist Daedelus and the Grammy nominated funk-jazz outfit Kneebody. It's a powerful fusion of abstract hip-hop and modern jazz, and at its highest points you can't really even tell where Kneebody ends and Daedelus begins.

Side by Side EP,Natalie Prass,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2309d034d5c69bf4b27/1:1/w_160/0905fed8.jpg,2015-11-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21275-natalie-prass-side-by-side-ep/,Spacebomb,"Let me be the first to formally apologize for accidentally contributing to the execrable proliferation of analyses that Natalie Prass sounds like ""a Disney princess."" This writer was in attendance for a show where she took a moment to defend herself from the claim, which was followed by a not-sober fellow yelling out an unprintable word and the name of this website, a moment that made at least one person in the vicinity feel very uncomfortable. You can understand how she would take it as a backhanded compliment: There's something unavoidably infantilizing about the suggestion that your voice resembles a fictional cartoon monarch's, even if Snow White could really sing. It makes her sound so… formal, too, and while Prass makes music inspired by classic artists like Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick, she's no traditionalist. Covers of modern musicians like Janet Jackson and Ryan Adams have snuck their way into her sets, and she even popped up on the AV Club last month to turn the gory chug of Slayer's ""Raining Blood"" into an inside-voice delight. Side by Side shows that playful side, comprising two live cuts of songs from her self-titled solo debut, as well as covers of Grimes, Anita Baker, and Simon & Garfunkel, artists whose only obvious connection is ""singers that Natalie Prass decided to cover on her new EP."" Her take on Baker's ""Caught Up in the Rapture"" does away with those awesomely '80s gated drums and sparkling filter sweeps, instead pushing the tempo and adding guitar for something a little more lively. On the original, Baker welcomes the listener with open arms through some magical doorway, where the evening of a lifetime awaits. Prass sings from a more present place, like she's three beers into a muggy summer night at a Nashville bar. She makes the gentle folk-rock of ""Sound of Silence"" a little more lively, nailing those melodies with her graceful, nimble voice. ""REALiTi"" is done as a straight up ragtime jaunt, and if her press release commentary on the cover (""[Grimes is] probably going to say 'what is this jazz shit' and hate it"") is maybe a little too accurately self-deprecating, she at least commits. The live versions of ""My Baby Don't Understand Me"" and ""Christy"" strip away the dense orchestral instrumentation and let a Wurlitzer piano do the driving. The arrangements are cleaner, and show her mastery over negative space. One knock on the self-titled record was that Prass sometimes sounded secondary to the orchestra, but here the same can't be said. My favorite moment on the original LP was at the end of ""My Baby Don't Understand Me"", where the repeated refrain of ""our love is a long goodbye"" built to a grand climax. On the live take, she lets the groove ride a few seconds longer, transforming the swelling romance into something steamier. Similarly, the nighttime vibe of the unadorned ""Christy"" precludes all future Disney princess comparisons, as she lets the lonesomeness of the lyrics (""Why does it have to be that she can take the hand of anyone she meets?/ Still, the only one she sees belongs to me"") really sink in. In this, Side by Side does what a good EP should—it reminds us of what she's skilled at, while showing off some other strengths. There's even something like a mission statement to her music in the title, and the song it's taken from: ""When I feel the magic of you/ The feeling's always new."" It's an old sentiment, and the lyric belongs to another artist, but Prass makes it hers.","Side by Side shows Natalie Prass' playful side, comprising two live cuts of songs from her self-titled solo debut, as well as covers of Grimes, Anita Baker, and Simon & Garfunkel.

25,Adele,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2039d034d5c69bf4ae1/1:1/w_160/ce5f4d31.png,2015-11-23 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21246-25/,XL,"Adele is only 27 years old, still young by any sensible metric, but much of 25, her third album, concerns itself with the passage of time: the inevitable accumulation of both years and vantages. It’s as if she knows intimately the nauseating experience of waking up one morning, surveying a half-lived life, and thinking, ""Oops."" She never adopts a schoolmarm’s consternation (and she is entitled to some authority, having sold a boggling 30 million copies of her last record, 2011’s 21), but she is nevertheless cautionary, encouraging her listeners to do better, act faster, stop being such a bunch of clowns. Get up and get over, friend, she seems to be saying—you are a grown person now. Or: ""We both know we ain’t kids no more,"" which is how she puts it on ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover)"", a song co-written by Max Martin, the 44-year-old Swedish super-producer who has now penned almost as many number one singles as Lennon and McCartney. Stack ‘em up, and all of Martin’s songs follow a particular formula: they’re prickly, quick-moving affairs that braid the precision of Swedish pop like ABBA with the more groove-oriented rhythms of American R&B. To that end, Martin is as exacting of a songwriter as I’ve ever heard: like he did with the tracks he made for Taylor Swift (""Shake It Off"", ""Blank Space"", ""Style"") and Katy Perry (""I Kissed a Girl"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Roar""), he relies on some enigmatic internal cadence, clipping syllables like a hiccuping poet, taking a tiny scalpel to his melodies. He keeps his lines pointy and balanced. ""Send-my-love/ To-your-new/ Luh-uh-ver."" The results are like encountering a person with perfectly symmetrical features—both instantly appealing and deeply, existentially unsettling. The song opens with carefully plucked acoustic guitar, and when the chorus comes in it’s as if someone yanked the curtains up on a dark room. Lyrically, Adele leans on a familiar kind of outrage, reckoning with a lover who broke every promise he ever made to her. There's unrequited love, but then there’s love that changes shape; if you’re unlucky enough to be on the receiving end of that transaction—made unwilling witness to the mysterious, alchemical shift in which devotion suddenly thins, sours—true understanding is impossible, a fool’s errand. This is the love that Adele sings of, the kind where there’s nothing left to do but resign: ""I’m giving you up, I’m forgiving it all."" Nurturing grudges is a young woman’s game. Almost every song on 25 addresses heartache in one form or another. ""Send My Love"" is anomalous in its confidence; more often, Adele sounds excruciatingly aware of her own blunders and bereavements, and the ways in which time has made them indelible. Sometimes, Adele herself is the agent of grief, like on ""Hello"", in which she attempts to reach an ex-lover on her flip-phone. Surely, on some level, Adele knows the message she’s so hungry to deliver—""I’m sorry/ For breaking your heart""—is not the kind of sentiment that’s going to yield her much more than a slowly raised middle finger (the indignation of the recently forsaken is vast, merciless). She is arguably more desperate to reach an earlier iteration of herself, to correct something, quiet some panic. Other times she is a victim of loss. In the piano ballad ""When We Were Young"", which was co-written with Tobias Jesso Jr., she sings: ""Let me photograph you in this light/ In case it is the last time/ That we might be exactly like we were/ Before we realized."" The instrumentation swells, quiets. The precise nature of that realization is not named, but of course it doesn’t need to be, or not explicitly (as Joan Didion wrote, in 1967, ""It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends.""). The song itself is a kind of homage to the booming, soft-focus singer-songwriters who dominated AM radio in the 1970s (Barbra Streisand, Shirley Bassey), and Adele’s vocal performance is astonishing, full of vigor and beauty. Still: the cumulative effect is sometimes as treacly as the heavily frosted sheet cake being slid onto the buffet table in the carpeted banquet hall where this song will be blasting, on a loop, for all of eternity. Even your most adorable aunt—the one who loves a Yankee Candle—will eventually drain her flute of sparkling wine, lean forward, and be like, ""Dog, this shit is corny."" Taken as a whole document, it is truly staggering how many of these songs—all of them, as far as I can tell—address the foibles of romantic love. It’s not so much that Adele’s lyrics are platitudinous (although they often are), it’s that the album’s prevailing sentiment eventually becomes wearying. In his book The Song Machine, John Seabrook interviews Bonnie McKee, the 31-year-old songwriter behind some of Katy Perry’s bigger hits and a frequent collaborator of Martin’s; McKee offers a pat, sorry-dude response to the question of lyrical uniformity in contemporary pop. ""Most people still just want to hear about love and partying,"" is what she tells Seabrook. A shrug—a ""Hey, it’s not us, it’s you! You dummies are the ones who want that!""—is implied. Perhaps that is what people want: Adele is presently on track to break N*Sync's record, held since 2000, of 2.24 million copies sold in the first week of release (on Friday, more than 900,000 people downloaded 25 from the iTunes store alone). And perhaps these songs are trifles, foregone conclusions that, instead of facilitating or inviting a deepening, allow for just one outcome: a peaceable head-bob, a wistful smile. They are one-way, dead-end roads, emotional shortcuts to wells of loss and contrition. But regardless of how one might feel about the spiritual utility of pop music, Adele’s instincts as a singer remain unmatched; she is, inarguably, the greatest vocalist of her generation, an artist who instinctively understands timbre and pitch, when to let some air in. It does not seem unfair to ask that dynamism of her songs, too.","Adele is still young by any sensible metric, but much of 25, her third album, concerns itself with the passage of time: the inevitable accumulation of both years and vantages.

City of Brides,En,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f39d034d5c69bf4ac9/1:1/w_160/dc9f5d3b.jpg,2015-11-20 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21233-city-of-brides/,Students of Decay,"In their five years of making music as En, Maxwell August Croy and James Devane have built a career imbuing drone music with innocence and wonder—a little glimmer of light from the depths of a well. A co-president of the beloved, minimalist-focused Root Strata label, Croy devotes much of his time to building a sophisticated, wonderfully weird roster of artists (Grouper, the Alps, and Driphouse have all issued LPs on the label): but he's also earned a reputation as a gifted electroacoustic auteur. Devane, meanwhile, comes from a guitar background, tempered by a love for the digital greats (as his acoustic cover of Aphex Twin's ""Rhubarb"" attests). The duo’s latest, City of Brides, is their most cohesive—and perhaps paradoxically, sonically varied—statement to date. Establishing a sense of momentum when nothing moves is one of the biggest challenges in drone music. On City of Brides, Croy and Devane supply propulsion through juxtaposition: not just between the organic and the artificial, but also between the serious and the playful. For every period of restraint—the two-part, vaguely erotic shadow play of ""Songs for Diminished Lovemaking"", for instance—there’s a burst of playfulness to balance it. On the buoyant ""Mendocino Nature Rave"", the duo ventriloquize their motherboards to reproduce the sounds of dolphins, bats, and other wildlife, while ""Hall of Mirrors"" sounds like a thrilling, grim game of Peek-A-Boo, constantly threatened by melodramatic synth swoops. There are no samples to speak of on City of Brides; every sound we hear is built from scratch. Each song is a crystalline Russian doll, a stylistic experiment in layering sounds both comforting and caustic. ""Blonde Is Back"" is the most magnificent, its warm swathes of synths simultaneously soothing and suffocating. The experience of listening to it isn’t that far off from being smothered by a fleece blanket. The diversity of the instruments here helps distinguish City of Brides from peers like Pete Swanson and Oren Ambarchi, or influencers like La Monte Young. On ""Mark of the Slav"", En use a koto to create a foggy soundscape before drifting out into the horizon. In addition to honoring its reputation for graceful precision, En challenge the koto’s inherent solemnity by way of energetic arrangements that render it assertive, even abrasive; its shattered-glass-strums break the reverent murmur of ""Secret Samba"". Indeed, one could make a strong case for Croy’s playing as City of Brides’ secret weapon: a valuable source of energy on an extensive, occasionally exhausting album. If you’re not a fan of drone, City of Brides probably won’t turn you into an acolyte. The LP gets off to a sluggish, vaguely narcotic start with ""Blades"" and ""Dead Ringer"", two relatively straightforward ambient pieces that lack the standout quirks of later tracks. Those looking for a more leaden approach may walk away disappointed as well; Devane’s guitars never reach the intensity of, say, Sunn O))). Nevertheless, there are plenty of secrets refracted through City of Brides' glassine spaces—and peering through such a globally-inspired prism is arguably as compelling as any seismic axe riff.","In their five years of making music as En, Maxwell August Croy and James Devane have built a career imbuing drone music with innocence and wonder.

Dark Sky Island,Enya,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f79d034d5c69bf4ace/1:1/w_160/b5a67258.png,2015-11-20 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21237-dark-sky-island/,Warner Bros.,"It can be difficult to differentiate between Enya records. Her early work still feels only slightly displaced from 4AD and ambient music; though Enya has never been comfortable identifying her music as ""new age,"" it shares new age's fixations on geology and infinity, which also appear in the music of contemporary acts, from Oneohtrix Point Never to Mark McGuire. But as her career advanced her songwriting and the architecture of her albums solidified into a kind of extreme aesthetic discipline, and her songs began to melt inextricably into each other. Dark Sky Island is her first album in five years, since 2008's Christmas-themed collection ...And Winter Came. I can say with some confidence that it's her best record since 1995's The Memory of Trees, but I'm not certain if that means anything to anyone, including myself. Her albums generate a very specific environment, one which envelops the listener regardless of the quality of her individual songs. Enya's music is primarily about distance: between minutes, between people, between stars. Her songs stretch accordingly, synthesizers advancing and receding within them like shadows. Sometimes her music seems to move with the velocity of a glacier. Drums are employed sparingly. Either her vocal is the rhythmic engine of the songs (as in ""Orinoco Flow"", or on this album, ""Echoes in Rain"") or the rhythm is organized into arpeggios that sound like crystal, and which are often generated from a Roland Juno 60 synthesizer. There are also sudden clusters of sampled timpani in her music, but they provide shape to her songs more than they provide any animation. The way she constructs her music out of samples gives her otherwise warm and amniotic compositions a kind of Arctic and alien dimension. Her songs feel sharper on Dark Sky Island than they have in years. Its textures are glassier; the individual sampled string hits on ""Echoes in Rain"" sound like arthritic branches sprouting from a frozen earth. The ballads are heartbreaking. ""I Could Never Say Goodbye"" and ""So I Could Find My Way"" describe an incredible distance that can't be collapsed; in the case of ""So I Could Find My Way"", that distance is the vastness between life and death. (She wrote it about her producer Nicky Ryan's mother.) Elsewhere she (somewhat invisibly) experiments; in ""Sancta Maria"" a synthesizer collides gently against more classical instruments in a way that seems to clarify each. She sings several interstellar ballads in Loxian, a language her lyricist Roma Ryan invented, though the language is mainly experienced on record as a blur of vowels. (These ""experiments"" of course merge seamlessly with the rest of her work; they're composed of the same glossy surfaces and drift through identical rhythms.) Her first two albums, Enya and Watermark, are much more digressive and rhythmically diverse than her later work, including Dark Sky Island; for every gentle, shapeless ballad, there would be exercises in more precise, classical forms, or a song would unfold into a more distracted rhythm. Most of her songs since have been subject to a merciless symmetry. She drifts somewhat out of her aesthetic on Dark Sky Island's ""Even in the Shadows"", which pulses like an artery from the double bass playing of Eddie Lee; as a result, it's one of the best songs on the record. But it matters little. Though her approach has calcified, the environments generated by her records are still singular, a gentle, untroubled, indefinite ambience that is very soothing to inhabit. It's like being embraced by the air.","Dark Sky Island is Enya's first album in five years, and it's her best since 1995's The Memory of Trees.

Hard Hold,Jaala,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b24fc0084474cd0c1f59/1:1/w_160/f4d59bbd.jpg,2015-11-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21300-hard-hold/,Wondercore Island,"The debut album by Melbourne four-piece Jaala constantly shifts between time signatures, but it's not a virtuoso showcase. The band's guitarist, singer, and songwriter Cosima Jaala has said that she would struggle to identify any tempo—with the exception of 4/4, which, in her words, can ""go fuck a dead donkey."" Instead, the record's rushing, halting feel is her attempt to reflect life's complex rhythms. It's complemented by an unusual but brilliant pop palette that splutters with the chaotic energy of a Jackson Pollock. The interplay between guitarists Jaala and Nic Lam, bassist Loretta Wilde, and drummer Maria Moles recalls Thrill Jockey's '90s Chicago set, splashy as Tortoise and richly mellow as the Sea and Cake. ""Lowlands"" ambles around a crooked bass line; ""Order"" has a splayed ska-punk lilt that evokes Clash ballads. Jaala sings with a jazzy, muscular intonation and a chalky squeak in her throat that recalls a punkier Amy Winehouse or Jeff Buckley, and also owes a debt to the skittish incantations of Life Without Buildings' Sue Tompkins. When she screams, as she often does, it's not with rage, but roller coaster joy. Considering how rampant the pace is—and Jaala's predilection for ""brain-melting shit""—Hard Hold is often remarkably soothing, yet always surprising. Jaala's lyrics are just as playful as her delivery, full of twists and wonderful imagery. They often deal with the ties that bind humans—love, obsession, violence—and she's just as interested in stretching the bonds of language. On ""Hard Hold"", she wrings the endless potential of a single syllable. ""It's hard, a heart to a heart/ Too hard to unfold this hold with you,"" she sings, as if massaging out her own heartbreak, working agility back into her ticker's knotted muscle. ""If sharing is a bowl of soup, then you drunk it dry,"" she tells her ex before she proclaims her newly discovered strength, a moment heralded by the song's buoyant lope bursting into a frenzied thrash. Swaying between downbeat and more anxious passages, ""Salt Shaker"" captures Jaala's relief and guilt at leaving her humdrum seaside hometown. She licks salt off her hand to remind herself of the waves, and observes: ""Those happy-holy-heinous houses/ They spread out and out for mileses."" She's a distinct voice, and a versatile one, too: ""Ticket"" is a serrated tirade against an ex who used her, full of ugly screams and jagged riffs. But then comes closer ""Hymn"", a tender devotional where the band's edges soften to glimmer like sea ripples reflected on a cave wall. H**ard Hold is a clever record that rarely foregrounds that fact—perhaps because it was recorded in a week, it hangs onto a scampering, impromptu quality that only adds to its appeal. While they sound nothing alike, Jaala's debut has a similar sense of fluid, approachable experimentation to a record like Bitte Orca: the kind of bright weirdness that seems to illuminate a whole new set of colors.","The Melbourne band Jaala has a rushing, halting feel to their debut album, reflecting the complex rhythms of life.

Shadow of a Doubt,Freddie Gibbs,by: Max Mertens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22f9d034d5c69bf4b23/1:1/w_160/5cab5b9a.jpg,2015-11-20 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21274-shadow-of-a-doubt/,ESGN,"Freddie Gibbs doesn’t believe in resting on his laurels. After dropping last year’s Piñata with Madlib at the helm — the rapper’s most commercially and critically successful project to date — he could have taken some well-deserved time off. Instead, he toured non-stop and played festivals, put out two EPs The Tonite Show with the Worlds Freshest and Pronto, and last but not least, became a father. Now with little advance notice, and a raised middle finger to Q4 release schedules and anyone foolish enough to be making their best-of year-end lists early, the pride of Gary, Ind. is back with his third full-length studio album. A quick scan of the credits reveals the biggest difference between Shadow of a Doubt and his last LP—instead of one singular producer, there’s over a dozen wide-ranging names contributing beats here from Canadian hitmaker Boi-1da to 808 Mafia’s Tarentino. While the final result is less cohesive, and could benefit from trimming two or three songs, there’s no denying Gibbs’ versatility. If there’s any question as to whether or not acclaim has mellowed the man who frequently refers to himself as both ""Gangsta Gibbs"" and ""Freddie Corleone"", look no further than the two tracks that bookend the record. The sparse, atmospheric ""Rearview"", which opens with a ""Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport"" P.A., sees the rapper offer up a bullet point summary of his career to date before dismissing would-be copycats with trademark precision. In contrast, ""Cold Ass Nigga"" sees Gibbs with two feet on the gas, with frequent Kanye West collaborator Mike Dean providing a suitably urgent, glitchy trap beat. It’s nothing like anything else in Gibbs’ vast catalogue (its closest spiritual companion might be ""Old English"", his 2014 track with A$AP Ferg and Young Thug) and it’s proof that the 33 year old is still more than willing to push himself out of his sonic comfort zone. His lyrics capture the pursuit of the American dream like a Scorsese screenplay (drugs, sex, and all-too-frequent bloodshed included). He’s hardly the first artist to incorporate a sample from ""The Wire"" into a song, but he’s one of few able to do so without it coming off cliché or rote (Boi-1da and Frank Dukes’ sinister piano loops greatly help). Another highlight is the understated, introspective ""Insecurities"" produced by Dukes and Montreal’s Kaytranada (who teamed up with the rapper this year for the menacing one-off ""My Dope House""). As for the record’s handful of guest spots, Gibbs has picked a mix of newcomers and veterans who complement but never overshadow him. Rising Miami-via-Toronto emcee Tory Lanez contributes a bleary-eyed hook to dealers’ anthem ""Mexico""; elsewhere, L.A. R&B singer-songwriter Dana Williams propels ""McDuck"". On ""Extradite"", the Roots’ Black Thought’s politically charged verse is sharply juxtaposed with Mikhail’s bright, jazz-influenced production, which eventually gives way to dialogue taken from a fiery speech on Ferguson by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Then there’s ""10 Times"", featuring Gucci Mane floating over the beat like plumes of blunt smoke (perhaps Gibbs’ own ""Freddie Kane OG"" strain), before West Coast veteran E-40 swoops in to gleefully extol the virtues of a woman ""thicker than a buttermilk biscuit."" On the outro of ""McDuck"", we hear an excerpt from an interview he did with Snoop Dogg this past summer discussing Gibbs’ background. ""You just sound like you not from nowhere,"" says Snoop to which the rapper replies, ""I created that sound."" The cover artwork of Shadow of a Doubt might depict Gibbs’ face half-cloaked in darkness, but his roots and aspirations have never been clearer.","After dropping last year’s Piñata with Madlib and two subsequent EPs, Freddie Gibbs is back with his third full-length studio album.

Church in These Streets,Jeezy,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1805e6ef95969322134/1:1/w_160/98fb4639.jpg,2015-11-20 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21164-church-in-these-streets/,Def Jam,"Jeezy does not traffic in nuance. He dropped the ‘Young’ out of his name when he realized he wasn't young. The hooks to his biggest songs are so blunt they skirt deadpan humor—""my president is black, my Lambo is blue"" works in a shockingly efficient manner, a mission statement that unpacked a hell of a lot at the right time in history in just two lines. He’s envisioned himself (on album covers at least) as a mafia don, Malcolm X, a patriot draped in the flag. His trademark grimacing snowman logo is as identifiable as a corporate brand. Fresh off the release of last year’s Seen It All: The Autobiography, he's releasing Church in These Streets, and they are both as literal as their album titles. In his latest venture, Jeezy is a preacher, the wise, older veteran of an Atlanta rap scene that is currently worlds away from his grim motivational seminars. Church in These Streets doesn’t completely deliver on its compelling premise—a ""reborn"" Jeezy, half-conscious but still the self-proclaimed ""God in these streets."" There are some moments that strike this note, especially the spoken-word interludes that broadly touch on social issues like privatized prisons, police brutality, and even the toll of drug dealing on the lives of the hustlers and the buyers (especially striking on a record with a song called ""Hustlaz Holiday""). But they do just feel like moments, a snapshot of a project Jeezy is unable to make. After a few years of toiling in major-label purgatory, Jeezy’s new persona (and it is a ""persona,"" not a guiding aesthetic principle) is good for a few effective, if perhaps obvious, metaphors and symbols. The song titles, just like the album title, give it all away: ""Lost Souls"", ""Holy Water"", ""God"", ""Forgive Me"". He deserves credit for turning a new album around in just a year that’s influenced by his feelings and thoughts on the current political climate, but it feels workmanlike and too deliberate to hold weight. It is conspicuously light on guests, probably by design, but Jeezy’s voice can wear during sustained listens, and when Janelle Monáe shows up on the light, totally un-Jeezy-like single ""Sweet Life"", she’s anonymous. The vibe of the music seems to suggest that Jeezy wants to bring the dank and spacey stuff that Young Thug and Future work with into his playground, but grounded in his declarative, raspy voice. It's minimal, exciting stuff, the kind of creative pivot he executed so well just a few years ago overseeing CTE. ""Gold Bottles"" has a weak hook but features typically baroque production from London on da Track. ""God"" works that same apocalyptic tone of so many 808 Mafia productions: It’s a good song until you realize it’s essentially a redux of Future’s ""Sh!t"" from a few years ago. ""Just Win"" is another highlight, riding a mournful horn sample that recalls socially aware blaxploitation movies and their rich scores, specifically Willie Hutch and the soundtrack for The Mack. It also samples Les Brown, a motivational speaker, and the song's dynamic nails the highs and the lows of this record—it clearly wants to be a meaningful, contemplative record, but it mostly reduces his action-hero slogans to blander political ones. The best Jeezy music often exploited how far he could go with memorable ad libs and punchlines, a triumphant kind of simplicity. Here that gets muted to muddied results.","On his latest venture, Church in These Streets, Jeezy is a preacher, the wise, older veteran of the Atlanta rap scene.

Both were interested in doing nervy hip-hop that rendered personal neuroses into allusive, bittersweet comedy (and vice-versa). They know each other now as transplanted Angelenos with deep mutual respect, a faithful cult fanbase, and a creativity-stoking environment of collective support—but those neuroses can still be hard to shake. They keep finding successful ways to exorcise those frustrations, cracking jokes and facades at the same time. Naturally, they'd have a lot to ricochet off each other, something that sporadic teamups only hinted at. Time & Materials gives that dynamic a shot over the course of 26 short minutes, proving more than anything that there's more depth still left unexplored. The album's recorded under the name Cavanaugh, and the setting of this brief-but-deep album is intriguing, in a J.G. Ballard-via-The Coup kind of way: the inhabitants and social structures of a Florida mixed-income project featuring units for both luxury condos and subsidized housing tenants. ""Mike and Dave"" are resident handymen who schlep from residence to residence, glimpsing other people's lives while doing what they can to keep the same systems functioning for the rich and the broke alike. And in the process, they channel the residents' class-war conflicts into their own combative moods, fueling their own stress over money, relationships, and an uncertain future that keeps them from being the assertive successes they want to be. Time & Materials tackles sociological themes that would be sledgehammer-obvious in less-nuanced hands. But the duo draws you in by skimping on or misdirecting details. Serengeti disappears deeper into his lyrical role than Mike does—understandable from an MC who's been known to do half a live set in the guise of a cranky, bellowing 50-year-old. But for his first full-length production job, Mike sets a tone as raw-nerved and abrasively contemplative as the concept demands. A soupy drone on ""Typecast"" evokes the stress and sweat of the escape-seeking protagonists, including guest turns by P.O.S., Busdriver, and Future Islands' Sam Herring in his purposefully-awkward rap alter ego Hemlock Ernst. The creaking sludge of opening track ""Zorak"" underscores the TV-casualty free association of the lyrics. The big drawback of the production's distorted, synthwave-on-codeine atmosphere is that it threatens to muffle the rewind-demanding intricacies of both MCs—Serengeti's motormouthed turns of run-on worldbuilding in particular get trickier to grasp. It's also not always clear whether the characters Mike and Serengeti inhabit are the maintenance guys or the people they cross paths with and intrude on by necessity. Of course, the larger question is whether they're really inhabiting or observing outside characters at all—""I"" heavily outnumbers ""you"" and ""they"" in the whole narrative pronoun department, and the fraying seams of their own mind states stand out no matter who's being profiled.","David Cohn, aka Serengeti, and Open Mike Eagle have recorded a brief-but-deep hip-hop album under the name Cavanaugh. On it, ""Mike and Dave"" are resident handymen who schlep from residence to residence in a Florida mixed-income project, glimpsing other people's lives while doing what they can to keep the same systems functioning for the rich and the broke alike.

Rave Cave 2 EP,Andrew Hung,by: Sarah Sahim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b179b1335d7bf169a2ab/1:1/w_160/a09a6253.jpg,2015-11-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21159-rave-cave-2-ep/,self-released,"Andrew Hung’s piercingly electronic Rave Cave 2 is an ambitious and personal autobiographical effort. The initial two tracks are named after places in Hung’s life—""Ashill"" which Hung lists as his residence on Bandcamp, is a bright and inviting opening number. ""Gladstone Park Gang"" is a shout out to a park in North London, and the title itself is reminiscent of a key pastime among bored British youth: hanging out in a drab park, smoking weed, and drinking disgustingly cheap cider. The second installment of his debut solo venture, Rave Cave 2 interweaves themes from the original but stands strong on its own, and is in fact denser and richer overall. ""Ashill"" forgoes the syncopated swing of Rave Cave’s opener, ""Fables"", but still embodies that cheeriness. Though the choppy and sharp melody initially seems out of joint with the accompanying smooth, heady synth bass, the more repetitive it becomes, the more it settles in. Throughout this EP, Hung emulates the juxtaposing elements found in the nature of youth, a time in life when everything is confusing and you have to navigate a path through conflicting options. ""Repetition vs Time"" summons a childlike wonder and calm, with an intentionally cheesy chorus and boom-bap beats invoking nostalgia for playing keyboards in high school music class. Towards the latter end, the song is more reminiscent of video game menu music than anything else, but perhaps this is intentional. Hung’s littering of 8-bit grace notes is ultimately refreshing, and an apt ode to his work as one half of Fuck Buttons. ""That thing you want won’t make you happy"" is distinctly melancholic in comparison to the rest of the record. It carries the melody of a more somber '90s boy band ballad, and closes with finger-picked acoustic guitar tinged with subtle reverb. ""Star Ferry Dub"" immediately starts off as a pounding antithesis to the previous song. It’s heavy on the ears and on the heart, flashing a raw hedonism seldom found in the Rave Cave series. The song rings in the musical themes evident throughout the EP—we are reintroduced to the 8-bit ornamentation of ""Repetition vs Time"" and that thumping arpeggiated bass echoing ""Ashill"", but this time the ghosts of these tracks are more lingering and intense. There’s so much going on at once that it’s hard to pin down, but the complexities and wide sonic scape don’t sound excessive or sloppily piled on top of one another. They’re seamless, intricate, and intoxicating. Then, the imperfect cadence fades and stutters into oblivion, leaving the listener aching for more. Andrew Hung’s story isn’t over yet.","Andrew Hung’s piercingly electronic Rave Cave 2 is an ambitious and autobiographical effort.

Agitations,Lotic,by: Jonathan Patrick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2325e6ef95969322251/1:1/w_160/7024dcdc.jpg,2015-11-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21277-agitations/,Janus,"The 30-minute mixtape Agitations finds producer Lotic (aka J'Kerian Morgan) at his least accessible, most grating, and perhaps not coincidentally, his most ambitious and stirring. ""Agitations was born out of the frustrations that come with touring... and feeling increasingly out of touch with club culture and with the music industry in general,"" Morgan said in preface to his latest release. Accordingly, the music distances itself from the cyclical payoffs and rhythmic underpinnings of the dance floor. This is miles away from anything that could be considered ""club culture."" There’s something acutely alien about the tracks Morgan constructs, as if the producer is dealing in a musical language that's yet to fully emerge. Throughout Agitations, Lotic's signature spidery sound design is subjected to further mangling via a series of violent jump-cuts and jarring bursts of noise. The arrangements treat sounds and themes like raw materials in need of repurposing: Each unit is contorted, smashed, and remade, either splintering into abstraction or writhing in glitchy tumult. Yet, for all the mixtape’s disorienting ruptures and serrated edges, Agitations, much like 2014's Damsel in Distress and this year’s Heterocetera EP, again reveals Lotic as a sly, playful producer. On Heterocetera, Lotic sampled the ballroom standard ""The Ha Dance"" by Masters at Work, reshaping it radically, and he alludes to this same sample again here in the opening moments of *""*Carried"". This version sounds pared-down and pixelated, a mutation of a mutation, and it's a microcosm of Agitations' tendency to tease out strange turns in familiar currencies. Agitations might not be conventional dance music, but it remains both fiercely visceral and highly visual. It lacks Damsel in Distress' mastery of cultural memory, and Heterocetera's propulsive push-and-pull, but more than makes up for it in raw dynamism; a dogged, thrilling futurism hinged on brute energy, angularity, and unremitting disquiet. Moving in dense, unstable clusters, the mixtape can be taken as a celebration of frustration, liberation, and chaos, a means for Morgan to work through the restlessness and anxiety he's faced of late. For an artist who's consistently latched onto and forged a style as imaginative as any in the electronic underground, Agitations shows Lotic pushing still further ahead.","Agitations finds Lotic at his least accessible, most grating, and perhaps not coincidentally, his most ambitious and stirring.

Hexadic II,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b513d197565213a661/1:1/w_160/85133bfc.png,2015-11-19 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21189-hexadic-ii/,Drag City,"Several years ago, after tiring of the predictable patterns he sensed himself settling into as a guitar player, Ben Chasny of Six Organs of Admittance decided to design a theoretical framework that would force his hands into different positions. Chasny distributed a deck of poker cards in a circular array of sets of six, corresponding to the notes of the guitar. The relative positions of the cards gave Chasny a ""tonal field"" in which to operate, as well as a set of notes from which to pick, some indication of time and tempo, and lyrical rules for the songs themselves. Though Chasny describes it as a ""caveman"" appropriation of similar constructs by Anthony Braxton and John Cage, it is involved and elaborate enough to prompt a book, The Hexadic System, published by Drag City this year. And February's Hexadic, his public debut with the system, felt like an attempt to declare its formidable nature. Showcasing the scope of the system felt as important as the songs. Unapologetically loud and aggressive, with more than a whiff of hardline Japanese psych, it was an extreme indoctrination into a new approach. Recorded with a fully loaded quartet, the largely instrumental Hexadic was not for the faint of heart or those accustomed to Chasny’s softer side. For Hexadic II, though, Chasny used the same results of the system to create new solo versions of the songs. He swapped the electric for the acoustic, added soft murmurs of harmonium and electronics and strings, and sang on almost all of the songs. The output gives the Hexadic System a new patina of accessibility. On the penultimate track ""Vile Hell"", Chasny jumps between notes at unexpected angles, sounding like Derek Bailey in a windstorm, before he stops playing altogether. He lets a faint, luminous drone linger until it spills over into ""Poor Guild"", the record’s gorgeous finale. Violinist Jen Gelineau matches the drone’s tone, and Chasny picks his way through it. In a keening falsetto, he offers a series of elliptical, evocative phrases—""tiny excess/ eye maligned/ depict, transfix."" It is the most purely pretty moment in Chasny’s enormous catalogue, the sight of an early bloom, opening slowly after an arduous winter. The nine tracks on Hexadic II follow the same order as their Hexadic counterparts, and careful, comparative listening does reveal analogous aspects. It’s more rewarding, though, to consider the differences, or to take the sets as entirely separate products of the same process. The disparity shows just how far Chasny may be able to take an idea still in its early stages of execution. Where ""Wax Chance"" was a diabolical, noise-soaked dirge, ""Exultation Wave"" is an exquisite gallop, with multiple guitar lines and multi-tracked vocals suggesting the density of the earlier work without trying to match it. Likewise, the two-minutes of no-wave roar from ""Maximum Hexadic"" unfurl here into eight minutes of circular picking and ghastly vocals for ""Anyone’s Dawn"". Chasny’s playing invokes the same Middle Eastern influences that Sir Richard Bishop has often conjured, while his singing recalls the fragile coo of Richard Youngs. What was shocking is now sublime. In that way, the Hexadic System feels like a prism for Chasny, able to draw different elements of his influences and approach based on the input and circumstances. The results are novel and approachable, a combination that enables Chasny to transcend the examples of Cage and Braxton, at least in execution. Despite the complexity of the system that produced Hexadic II, the songs and sounds measure up to the setup itself.","After tiring of the patterns he sensed himself settling into as a guitar player, Ben Chasny designed a theoretical framework that forced his hands into different positions. February's loud, aggressive Hexadic, his public debut with the system, felt like an attempt to declare its formidable nature.

Junun,Shye Ben TzurJonny GreenwoodThe Rajasthan Express,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d45e6ef959693221bc/1:1/w_160/77ae3de7.jpg,2015-11-19 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21213-junun/,Nonesuch,"There are a lot of creative forces to keep track of on Junun. Receiving top billing is the Israeli singer and composer, Shye Ben Tzur, who wrote the songs. Then there's his backing band: the 19 performers, hailing from distinct Indian-music traditions, who form the Rajasthan Express. And you've also got Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood contributing rhythm guitar, bass, keyboards, and drum-programming to the arrangements. Still, aside from the album's complex backstory and multilingual lyrics (written, variously, in Hebrew, Hindi, and Urdu), Junun is readily approachable on its own. When Aamir Bhiyani’s rhythmically crisp trumpet peals out over programmed and acoustic percussion during the first minute of the album's opener and title track, Junun establishes its celebratory side. (Instrumental virtuosity and rhythmic drive: check and check, respectively.) Then the singer comes in, delivering an attractive setting of Sufi mystic poetry. (Warmly humanistic vibe: check.) The song could easily coast from this point. But once a tempo downshift hits, midway through, the assembled performers sound even more exultant. (Are you dancing yet? I was.) It's the wealth of smart musical touches that make Ben Tzur's songs feel so emotionally legible. The bowed strings of ""Hu"" have a vulnerable quality that contrasts winningly with the song’s more full-throated vocal exclamations, while Ben Tzur’s breathy flute playing complements Greenwood’s tinny digital programming on the opening of ""Kalandar"". And the gradual acceleration of a vocal-driven number like ""Eloah"" also contributes to the album’s impressive range of textures. ""Chala Vahi Des"" starts out with melancholic vocals delivered by Afshana Khan and Razia Sultan, before throttling into a harmonium-and-drums groove. In the song’s final section, Greenwood’s surprisingly funky bass playing enters into a dialog with the vocalists and drums. Also making an appearance, during the chorus of the triple-meter tune ""Allah Elohim"", are the ghostly, sliding tones of the ondes Martenot—an early electronic-keyboard instrument that is one of Greenwood’s favorites. (He's used it on Kid A, Hail to the Thief, as well as in his score for There Will Be Blood.) Given the prominence of his guitar on the same track, ""Allah Elohim"" is one of the rare moments on Junun that sounds directly influenced by Greenwood's other work. Concerning Greenwood's mostly background role: the sight of a famous British pop musician collaborating with lesser-known artists from another hemisphere can easily prompt charges of exploitative appropriation. But since Greenwood’s latest releases on Nonesuch have all focused on his work as a composer of film scores and classical music, the pop-world conversation about cultural tourism doesn’t seem all that helpful here. A better reference point would be the tradition of modern composers looking to escape the ""Eastern"" and ""Western"" category trap. In his 2015 memoir Words Without Music, American composer Philip Glass recalled how ""it was very common in the 1960s for Western musicians, even composers, to be completely ignorant of global, or world, music."" Glass, for his part, famously followed up his studies of the Western canon (at Juilliard and in Paris) by traveling to India, where he eventually worked for Ravi Shankar. Other composers associated with the minimalist movement, such as La Monte Young and Terry Riley, spent decades investigating Hindustani raga with Pandit Pran Nath. As a post-minimalist himself, Greenwood is a natural heir to that history. And so after happening upon a composer like Ben Tzur, he’s apt to decide to ""discover more about him."" What Greenwood found was a composer splitting his time between the Middle East and India, who has managed to develop a unique fusion form that is constructed from several traditions—including Bollywood-style brass exuberance, the devotional Qawwali music of Sufi Islam, and bowed-string instruments associated with the Manganiar community. The result is a mix that includes folk feel and studied arrangements. Naturally, with Greenwood's participation comes that of longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, who succeeds in presenting this detailed music with precision. While Greenwood's presence guarantees a certain level of interest, the newsiest takeaways from this album involve the skill of Ben Tzur and the musicians of the Rajasthan Express. The ensemble’s playing and the leader's compositions make Junun an easy stretch—though, crucially, not a condescending one—for listeners otherwise unfamiliar with the great variety of methods often obscured by ""world music"" market-speak.","It might seem curious that Radiohead guitarist and composer Jonny Greenwood ended up collaborating with Shye Ben Tzur and the Rajasthan Express. But they make exultant and warmly human music together. Greenwood's role is subdued even when the riotous music is not.

Jodorowsky’s Dune OST,Kurt Stenzel,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1fcea9e61561daa686a/1:1/w_160/3662c6d4.jpg,2015-11-18 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21241-jodorowskys-dune-ost/,Light in the Attic,"In 1974, surrealist filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky was tapped to direct his adaptation of Frank Herbert's monumental sci-fi novel Dune. The film was set to star David Carradine, Gloria Swanson, Mick Jagger, Orson Welles, Salvador Dalí, and Amanda Lear. Meanwhile, after the producers considered none other than Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pink Floyd was slated to compose along with contributions from the French prog-rock outfit Magma. Jodorowsky was given a lavish budget but the film didn't make it past its intensive pre-production stage. As Frank Pavich's 2013 documentary Jodorowsky's Dune illustrates, Jodorowsky and his production team put a great deal of effort into storyboarding and design, with an eye for detail that would've made Stanley Kubrick blush. As it turns out, the great irony of Jodorowsky's career is that he made his most widely-felt impact with a film he never even began shooting. To this day, his work on Dune continues to reflect in popular cinema and culture. In a sense, his version of Dune died giving birth to the genre-defining films that emerged in its wake. Alien, for example, was written by Dan O'Bannon and of course bore the unmistakable design aesthetic of Swiss painter H.R. Giger—both of whom had been brought in for Jodorowsky's production. This backstory, of course, frames Kurt Stenzel's score to Pavich's documentary and vice-versa. So many things could have gone wrong here had Stenzel attempted to encompass the pretense and grandeur of the subject at hand. ""We need to try,"" he writes in the liner notes—the implication being that we as the audience should put forth our best effort both to imagine the film Jodorowsky envisioned and to honor the scale of what he was aiming to accomplish. But Stenzel's score—which consists mainly of a bunch of analog synths that he sequenced and mixed in real time (with no additional digital sequencing)—actually requires little effort from listeners. Given the psychedelic quality of Jodorowsky's most well-known films, El Topo and The Holy Mountain, it's no surprise that in the documentary the maverick Chilean director talks about wanting to mimic the effects of LSD with Dune. But his goals didn't stop there. Jodorowsky breathlessly describes how his film was to serve as a ""prophet""—not as a prophecy, but as a living, breathing entity with a consciousness of its own. ""For me,"" he declares on camera, ""Dune will be the coming of a God. An artistic and cinematographic God."" To Stenzel's credit, although he does fall prey to a bit of reverence—most notably in passages that feature audio samples of Jodorowsky waxing poetic on what moviemaking means to him—the music doesn't strive to be anywhere near as lofty as that. Stenzel is wise to go for a more discreet, at times even whimsical, tone that supports the documentary's easygoing, storytelling structure. It's too bad that Stenzel, when he does opt to use Jodorowsky monologues, doesn't get more creative with them by chopping them up or subjecting them to effects, but the samples occur rarely and end up being incidental to the score's overall flavor anyway. Charmingly, the liner notes include a list of all the synth gear Stenzel used, just in case you're interested in geeking-out. But that would be missing the point. Stenzel's score doesn't stand out so much for the tools he used to create it as much as for the choices he made while using those tools. Pavich instructed Stenzel to go for a ""Tangerine Dream-type feel,"" and as such the predictable path would have been to mimic the wheezing, primitive synthesizer sounds that define sci-fi cinema of the '60s and '70s—sounds that now feel quaint at best and moldy at worst. Had Stenzel emulated the audacious bleeting style of, say, early Moog pioneer Richard Teitelbaum, Emerson Lake & Palmer, or any number of artists from the period, he would have artificially encased this music in a temporal ambience it doesn't actually require in order to engage your attention. Ultimately, not unlike the French electronic duo Air, Stenzel has too much creative inspiration to settle for being a stylist, and though he openly references the past, he lands with both feet firmly anchored in the present. Pavich's documentary more or less consists of a string of interviews undercut with shots of old photos and storyboard drawings. Clearly then, Stenzel's job was to keep the music moving along to match whatever pace Pavich set as appropriate for the audience's patience threshold. Stenzel shifts quickly but gracefully from one motif to the next, weaving sounds in and out like a choreographer who prefers to stay offstage while guiding each ""dancer""—each new instrument, melody, textural element, or structural change—into the fray on cue. By turns dramatic, spaced-out, otherworldly, entrancing, stately, ominous, hopeful, playful, and chatty, most of the tracks on Jodorowsky's Dune run about a minute long and manage to cover more than one mood before they run that course. Taken as a whole, they stream by yet never feel rushed, and Stenzel establishes his dual knack for patience and economy very early on. In what is perhaps this album's defining moment, a high-pitched synth line wails and echoes in a vast empty space. Stenzel gives it a character and shape not unlike those celestial bodies that appear to us via deep-space photography as giant, colorful plumes. The lone synth line segues into a live drumset, the first appearance of organic instruments and room ambience on the whole album. The drums don't last long, and soon they too meld into vaguely Middle Eastern-sounding chants before the voices grow more distressed. Then, a snarling, heavily filtered electric guitar riff that recalls Tool's ""Forty-Six & 2"" makes its entrance before flaring out as quickly as it came. One might expect these elements to step on each other's toes. But, as with just about every other sound that leads up to this passage, Stenzel creates a sensation of smooth sailing, even as he radically alters the scenery every few minutes. On Jodorowsky’s Dune, Stenzel takes you across topographic oceans that never rock the boat.","Frank Pavich's 2013 documentary Jodorowsky's Dune tells the story of surrealist filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky and his ill-fated 1974 adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel Dune set to star Mick Jagger, Orson Welles, and Salvador Dalí.

4 Walls,f(x),by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b23d13d197565213a734/1:1/w_160/68a802d0.jpg,2015-11-18 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21285-4-walls/,S.M.,"Over the last couple of years, f(x) have become one of the few K-pop groups with real international appeal and a sizable fan base in the States. The group's sophomore album, 2013’s Pink Tape, was a pop collage of ambitious sounds and ideas that tinkered with K-pop formulas, and it still stands as one of the best records the genre has ever produced. Last year’s Red Light offered a decidedly edgier synthpop sound that leaned more toward the club, though it didn’t quite meet the standard set by its predecessor. And during the promo for Red Light, group member Sulli, an actress and star for the conglomerate S.M. Entertainment, was noticeably absent from scheduled media events. After talk of mental exhaustion and a temporary f(x) hiatus, Sulli officially withdrew from the group in August, leaving K-pop’s most consistent act in a state of flux. 4 Walls is f(x)'s fourth album and first with four members—hence the name—and it lands right where Pink Tape and Red Light intersect, creating a sleek electropop fun-house filled with an eclectic group of generation-spanning pop singles that fit together as a long-playing piece. It’s also the first K-pop comeback to fully acknowledge a lineup change—going as far as incorporating it into the album's marketing and lyrics—but it doesn't change much about the group’s sound. This is a superficial rebirth; though the album’s lead single and title track has veiled references to changing and becoming new, f(x)’s synthpop bounce remains steadfast and uncompromised. And though Sulli was undoubtedly a standout among the group, her departure allows others to grab the spotlight: Now, not only does rapper Amber have the opportunity to rap more, she also gets the chance to use her alto range to flesh out harmonies and bring greater balance to records like ""Rude Love"", an ambitious, hook-heavy tune that rivals the group's most infectious songs. Many tracks on 4 Walls are sourced through Jam Factory, a music publisher that uses American musicians to create lyrics and melodies for Asian markets. The company’s strength lies in penning sounds without borders, and some of 4 Walls’ strongest collaborations involve producer LDN Noise, who creates pop songs with bridges that function as hooks and transitions that overlap to keep songs stimulating. Album closer ""When I’m Alone"", meanwhile, was originally co-written by Carly Rae Jepsen for her recent E•MO•TION album. But the real X-factor is longtime f(x) collaborator, writer, and K-pop superproducer Kenzie, who wrote two of the album's most curious songs: ""Papi"" and ""Cash Me Out"". A Berklee School of Music grad, Kenzie navigates the cultural divide better than anyone. Listening to any K-pop record (or any foreign language record, really) can prove to be a challenging experience for casual listeners simply due to the added communication barrier. You can also lose some key information in translation—even when you know what's being said, there's a layer of context missing. Still, just like any other type of music, a listener has the opportunity to fill in some of that context on their own; stripping Korean of its code is no different than reinterpreting a really dense English lyric. 4 Walls is even more accessible because f(x) songs tend to have a lot of Western cues: Many of the melodies recall songs from the American pop canon and, as with many K-pop songs, there are English lyrics spliced in throughout (at one point, Amber raps, ""I was low key/ That’s the old me/ Now there’s Top 10 honeys tryna phone me""). Western pop fans don’t need to be heavily invested in the K-pop world to get the appeal of f(x)’s music, and 4 Walls is an enjoyable listen even for those not looking to broach the language gap. Korean is a beautiful language with long multi-syllabic words that unspool in clumps and it carries American-stylized pop melodies fluently, breaking up long vowel sounds to fit into sonic phrases. There are few better introductions to K-pop than f(x), and 4 Walls is a strong introduction to f(x) 2.0.","After losing a member, one of K-pop’s most consistent and internationally appealing groups returns as a quartet for their fourth album. Casual listeners don’t need to be heavily invested in the K-pop world to get the appeal of f(x)’s music, and 4 Walls is an enjoyable listen even for those not looking to broach the language gap.

The Incredible True Story,Logic,by: Julian Kimble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d85e6ef959693221bf/1:1/w_160/83c648cb.jpg,2015-11-18 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21216-the-incredible-true-story/,Def Jam,"New artists face intimidating challenges after signing to major labels. For starters, creating a debut that not only sees the light of day, but is successful enough to warrant a follow-up. In certain cases, that first album is everything they’ve been waiting to say for years, but the second album is the bigger test, as it proves that the artist has something to say beyond the cathartic release of emotions heard on their debut effort. For instance, Logic’s 2014 debut, Under Pressure, was a detailed account of his chaotic Gaithersburg, Md. origin layered with his method of coping with stress while trying to escape the situation before it consumed him. It was honest and, on occasion, impressive. The announcement of his second collection, The Incredible True Story, generated questions about how Logic could follow something as intricate and personal as Under Pressure. Where could he go? The answer: outer space. Under Pressure was evidence of Logic’s attention to specifics, which he remains committed to on The Incredible True Story. You may have noticed him often wearing a NASA flight jacket leading up the album’s release, similar to a movie director wearing a t-shirt or hat emblazoned with the name of his latest film. On The Incredible True Story, he assumes the role of screenwriter and director, claiming to have written a script for the album. It’s set 100 years in the future, as the two narrators, Thomas and Kai, search for a planet named Paradise following Earth’s destruction. (Thalia, who served as the Midnight Marauders-inspired virtual guide on Under Pressure, returns as the computer for the ship driven by the narrators. Thankfully, she’s still more Siri than HAL 9000.) During their journey, the duo revisit the past through Logic’s music. Because Logic’s catalog serves as an artifact in the album’s narrative, the early placement of ""Fade Away"" is calculated. Over a dreamy sample reminiscent of a doo-wop song, Logic reflects on death’s inevitability: everyone dies eventually, so strive to create something that lives on after you. ""Upgrade"" maintains the futuristic theme (The Fifth Element allusions and all) as Logic explains how success has altered both his day-to-day existence and his perspective. Despite being set in the future, the album takes time to dip into the past. On ""Young Jesus"", Logic and guest Big Lenbo trade verses over producer 6ix’s recreation of '90s hip-hop ambiance. Its highest points come on the second and third verses, where Logic hands the song off to Big Lenbo like they’re performing live and sharing a mic. Logic’s introspective thoughts match the mellow calm of ""Innermission"", as he longs for the ability to revisit certain moments just to dwell in them again. It’s a moment of clarity most folks arrive at as they get older: you’ll never be present in your memories again. This is another constant theme on The Incredible True Story—Logic’s evolution under the spotlight. ""City of Stars"" finds him at his most sincere. Once Logic’s harmonizing breaks, his and 6ix's production becomes more aggressive as Logic unloads his frustrations with hip-hop, including the fixation on the biracial MC’s appearance. ""I didn’t talk about my race on the whole first album/ But black versus white bullshit was still the outcome,"" he rhymes, clearly exasperated. He then takes aim at critics, amateur and professional, who chide Drake for harping on ""money and bitches"" yet praise 2Pac for doing the same. Logic is at his best when getting shit off his chest, but even in the midst of these brazen admissions, there are still missteps. From its off-kilter drag to his deployment of boast-riddled yells in the place of bars, ""I Am the Greatest"" reeks of Drake’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late. Recycled flows and rhyme schemes are common in this era of hip-hop, but there’s a fine line between homage and imitation. Furthermore, while Logic has proven himself to be a talented MC who respects hip-hop culture and puts obvious effort into his work, there’s very little on The Incredible True Story that's worth constant replays. The music is enjoyable and Logic’s ambition is evident, but the final product just doesn’t attach itself to the memory. The Incredible True Story is a pleasant voyage to Paradise orchestrated by an artist who’s earned the approval of legends from Rick Rubin to Big Daddy Kane. Logic has the tools to create music that has longevity, but has yet to unlock the characteristics that truly set him apart. If he’s able to tap into that, his subsequent releases will have the impact he aspires for.","On The Incredible True Story, the Gaithersburg, Md. rapper Logic assumes the role of screenwriter and director, claiming to have written a script for the album.

Nothing,Kode9,by: Britt Julious,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e1c0084474cd0c1ea9/1:1/w_160/37c96023.jpg,2015-11-18 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21221-nothing/,Hyperdub,"Kode9, also known as Hyperdub label head Steve Goodman, always creates multilayered tracks that sound built from another era or planet entirely. From his work driving the early dubstep scene to the formidable rise and influence of Hyperdub, Goodman’s vision is one that is singular in its devotion to the connective tissues of electronic and dance music genres. In Kode9’s music (and littered throughout the Hyperdub roster) is a harmonious bridge between styles. His music is not without history and ideas, and Goodman openly embraces it. The most complicated forms of techno and footwork are built simply, from the ground up, and on Nothing, we hear the simplicity of each component and how it all comes together to make the music that we love. ""I’ve always tried to be open to the idea of music as transversal, as impersonal – like a cloud, or a virus that passes through populations,"" Goodman told The Guardian. ""It might start with an individual producer, but once it’s out in the world – as an entity that’s inhabiting, parasiting, using human bodies as hosts – somehow it attains a collective intelligence all of its own."" Consider the unnerving pull of a synth that sounds like a dying insect working in tandem with piano on ""Vacuum Packed"". The track builds into footwork-light with hyper-paced rhythms and a cutting beat that is maybe the record’s most danceable moment. ""Void"" is a slow-burning and dubby wonder that contains empty moments where his former musical partner Spaceape, who died in 2014, was originally intended to vocalize. ""Holo"" is the record's brightest and most enjoyable moment, built on airy samples and a spastic beat that is difficult to forget. Nothing leaves you awash in the sounds of the everyday: The static of the television not turned entirely turned off, the lull of old appliances stumbling to stay on after years of wear and tear. There is a precision and effort laced in his two previous albums, 2006’s Memories of the Future and 2011’s Black Sun, that clearly mark a singular producer’s craftsmanship. But on his latest work, this point feels more eloquent from start to finish. Goodman described this record as one about zeroes and about ""nothing."" In that same interview with the Guardian, Goodman said, “If replication and distribution costs are tending towards zero, this is one of the most important engines in the transformation of the music industry. We don’t know where it’s heading. ‘Nothing’ was like a little encryption key that enabled me to finish the album."" A quick glance at song titles confirms this trend, at least stylistically. There is ""Zero Point Energy"" and ""Notel"". There is ""Void"" and ""Zero Work"". And there is the album closer, ""Nothing Lasts Forever"", a nearly 11-minute journey through the noise of silence, a kind of John Cage tribute for the new millennium. Awash in static and the sporadic, indescribable clanging of the day-to-day, the track helps define the work as a whole in a clearer way than the songs before it. If, as Goodman notes, things are tending toward ""zero,"" then this track is the literal manifestation of this idea. Still, there is value in the zero and value in ""Nothing Lasts Forever"". In the absence of music, in the zero, there is still presence, still sound, still something to hear (and even enjoy).","Kode9 delivers a very sad, very compelling stare into the void with Nothing. Perhaps his most compelling work, it starts from scratch, sometimes building to footwork but often bleeding into something spare and serene. Fully crafted in the wake of his music partner Spaceape's death, there are moments of memory and beauty woven into this varied, unique album.

Mutant,Arca,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f09d034d5c69bf4ac3/1:1/w_160/39d465c8.jpg,2015-11-18 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21231-arca-mutant/,Mute,"Though his music sometimes exhibits the romantic sweep of chamber music and can be marked with skittering beats, Venezuela-born producer Alejandro Ghersi’s work as Arca is defined above all by its fluidity and flexibility. You can hear conventional musicality inside of his tracks—melodies, chord changes—but rather than being fixed on paper, they are always in flux. Individual notes twitch and vibrate, refusing to stay with a single pitch; rapidly shifting clusters hint at proper chords without ever quite committing to them; tempos speed up and slow down according to whims rather than the grid of a timeline. Arca’s deeply organic machine music is defined by Ghersi’s ability to find grace in imperfection. Ghersi has come a long way in a short time, his career the sort of underground/mainstream hybrid that could only happen in the digital era, when producers rapidly move from sharing home-recorded beats online to working with stars. Though his music has varied greatly, you’ve always been able to hear his voice inside of it. The first music heard from Ghersi was a series of three low-profile releases in 2012 that made small waves among electronic music heads but were little heard outside of that circle. But among that group was someone working on Kanye West’s 2013 album Yeezus, and Arca wound up contributing to four tracks, including ""Blood on the Leaves"" and ""I’m in It"". That same year, he also produced for FKA twigs, helping to create a futuristic pop that was simultaneously dense and spare and defined by its elusiveness. Xen, Arca’s 2014 full-length debut, expanded Ghersi’s range further, sounding like a bent version of modern classical music crumpled into a ball with a post-dubstep beat tape. Music created for a fashion show  in Italy earlier this year spoke further to Ghersi’s ability to move between genres, scenes, and high/low art boundaries, and his continued collaboration with artist Jesse Kanda on the visual aspects of his work make Arca a project with a rare thematic integrity. He’s developing quickly but building on a clear foundation. If Aphex Twin took the playful communal energy of early-'90s rave and turned it to highly personal art, and producers of the early '00s like Fennesz and Tim Hecker showed how emerging software could be used to create new worlds, Arca is making the abstract electronic music of our current moment, music for an idea of humanity that exists outside of binaries. ""Xen is a genderless being,"" he told The Guardian last year. ""It’s about resisting labels and integrating different sides of ourselves."" Accordingly, Arca tracks are never one fixed thing: Conventional beauty is swirled together with ugliness, aggressiveness exists alongside serenity, chaos and form fail to cancel each other out. Mutant is an album of contrasts, and Ghersi has an uncanny ability to let extremes interact with each other to create something new. The 20 tracks here stretch for over an hour, but lines between them are unclear, and when heard at once the record can seem like one long suite, treating us to an array of sounds and moods. You can imagine ""Vanity"" as a piano solo, so pretty and memorable are the central melodic motifs, but Ghersi’s production on the track is essentially a series of controlled explosions, the sound of a song breaking into a million pieces and re-assembling itself. ""Alive""’s drones are positively cavernous, sounding like a memory of an ancient civilization bubbling up through a hole in the earth, and he breaks up the static drift with splattering breaks that jolt the song at irregular intervals. The repeated vocal loop on ""Umbilical"" is one of the few sounds on the record connected to life on planet Earth, but it’s mixed in with some of the album’s harshest and coldest electronics. As the tracks tick off and you lose track of how far into the album you actually are, the clarity of Ghersi’s vision comes into focus. The broken-ness of the music takes on an empowering energy, as oblong fragments bind together into gorgeously weird shapes and dynamic shifts that shouldn’t make sense feel perfectly logical. Compared to Xen, Mutant feels less composed and less indebted to classical music. With many tracks on the former album you could squint a little bit and imagine them being performed by a daring new music ensemble, à la Aphex Twin with Alarm Will Sound. But Mutant leans toward soundscape, avoiding proper songs. There are moments in the back half, particularly on ""Enveloped"", where beats crop up and you can imagine them being used to back a pop production of some kind, but even here the warped instrumental patch used for the melody is too strange and otherworldly for an artist that has ever been on the radio. It’s not an easy listen; this is glorious music that sounds like a living thing, and it can be hard to connect the album to anything outside of itself. Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí said that the straight line belongs to man and the curved to God; on Mutant, Ghersi turns a fixation on porousness and instability into a kind of spiritual pursuit.","Though his music sometimes exhibits the romantic sweep of chamber music and can be marked with skittering beats, Venezuela-born producer Alejandro Ghersi’s work as Arca is defined above all by its fluidity and flexibility. Mutant builds on his 2014 album Xen to create a hypnotic and eveloping world.

amERICa,Wreckless Eric,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15ec0084474cd0c1dd4/1:1/w_160/06efb32d.jpg,2015-11-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21141-america/,Fire,"""Several Shades of Green"", the opener on Wreckless Eric’s amERICa, is flush with memories of ""the hit parade,"" feckless backing musicians, and silly jackets recommended by magazine stylists. The music—a spare backbeat and bass guitar lollygag, busied by skittish piano runs and a modest choral section—belies the ragged, bemused delivery of an artist reflecting on his time as a journeyman power-pop artist on Stiff Records in the late 1970s. ""If I’d known then, what I know now,"" goes the chorus—but it’s a tease. He stops and snickers at the temptation. That nimble maneuver—to reminisce, but jettison nostalgia—makes it a great opener for amERICa, an album rooted in classicist rock gestures but fixated on the contemporary United States. Wreckless Eric, born Eric Goulden, wrote a lot of songs about the music industry. ""Take the Cash (K.A.S.H.)"", for instance, urged artists to get paid up front. And peers such as Nick Lowe memorably looked at the era’s intersection of fandom and commerce in songs such as ""I Love My Label"" and ""Rollers Show"", too. But Goulden’s return to the show business theme—which, perhaps because it seemed crass in the wake of punk, faded from rock lyricism forever and today thrives in rap—acknowledges the chasm of time between then and now. With distance, he gains lucidity. It’s the same with the Englishman’s observations of the United States, which are dappled in telling detail and really rather astute. ""White Bread"", for instance, looks at the normalized delusions of a Middle America gun nut. On the rustic ""Sysco Trucks"", Goulden hovers over the wholesale food business: remote diners, kitchens, and markets all stocked with the same goods. There’s a critique implied, if not of capitalism at large then at least of monopoly and its subtly unsettling consequences for common cuisine. As he lightly notes, ""Everything we’re eating comes from somewhere."" The slaphappy typography ""amERICa"" is a bad indicator of Goulden’s tone; he’s mistily allusive, often playful, but never ham-fisted. Wreckless Eric recorded amERICa at home in upstate New York. He played many of the instruments himself. The palm-muted guitars and roaring refrains of his old work remain, but the record is more reserved and instilled with zany, fanciful flourishes. Goulden rarely grasps for big, beaming hooks. Instead, reverse reverb and spectral keys temper his creaky, pliable voice. And that blurred, homespun atmosphere makes amERICa sound modern; it puts him in league with bedroom revivalists such as Home Blitz, who ply weirder, less commercially aspirant versions of Wreckless Eric’s classic power-pop sound. Many artists of Wreckless Eric’s era and tradition have imitators, but few of yesteryear’s outliers can catch up with their descendants, let alone best them. amERICa is that rare record. Goulden is grownup, with all of the stereotypical benefits: an air of wisdom, emotional texture, and, perhaps most cliché of all, a seasoned voice. And yet, amERICa isn’t complacent or satisfied; Wreckless Eric anatomizes his surroundings with the wide-eyed thrill of discovery. His American flyover reveals simmering cultural disturbances and essential beauty alike—a late capitalist hellscape beneath ""Bobbie Gentry’s Mississippi skies.""","Wreckless Eric, born Eric Goulden, is a cult power-pop artist who got his start on Stiff Records in the late 1970s.

Nef the Pharaoh EP,Nef the Pharaoh,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2115e6ef95969322224/1:1/w_160/ac983405.jpg,2015-11-17 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21255-nef-the-pharaoh-ep/,Sick Wid It,"The odds tend to permanently be stacked against San Francisco-area rap artists, exportability-wise. Even the undisputed legends of the area have never become true household names outside of their home state—Too $hort, E-40, and Mac Dre. It’s a disheartening trend, but it’s easy to theorize about why the pattern has continued for decades. In general, Bay artists tend to like staying independent and favoring sometimes-indigestible levels of prolificacy over carefully curated releases. They also build off of their region’s existing musical traditions — sticking to their corner rather than trying to reinvent the sound of the genre. There always seems to be a gold standard of slapper already in mind—for well over a decade, it’s hinged on a handclap snare, a thin kick beating out Morse code, and a foghorn bass lick—and targeted at all times. Charismatic 20-year-old Vallejo up-and-comer Nef the Pharaoh also holds these truths to be self-evident, and basically fits the usual bill of a regional Bay star. The young rapper gained momentum mostly through creatively covering classic beats—a swaggy flip of Nas’ ""Oochie Wally""—and delivering crisp neighborhood pride anthems: Last year’s muted ""Bitch I’m From Vallejo"" turned the heads of local hero Cousin Fik and his mentor and labelhead E-40. Nef’s first release for 40’s Sick Wid It Records is also full of stylistic references and hat-tips, though—perhaps surprisingly for a Bay MC—mostly to idols from far outside San Francisco. Quotes from classic '90s Cash Money Records singles structured his January single ""Big Tymin’"", and the influence of this kind of music weighs heavily on the entire EP. ""Boss Me"" is based around a sing-songy bounce cadence, and Nef recycles Juvenile’s ""Ha"" line construction on his Auto-Tune-riddled twerking ode ""Meantime"". Nef is contributing to what seems to be a mini-trend in post-hyphy rap toward turn-of-the-millenium Southern music these days: His tourmate, collaborator, and Heartbreak Gang sideman Kool John regularly bites Hot Boys flows (his most recent single with Joe Moses interpolates 2002 Big Tymers hit ""Get Your Roll On""), L.A. affiliate Problem notably interpolated Master P and Young Bleed, and Juvenile himself hopped on the popular remix to fellow HBKer Iamsu!’s strip club anthem ""100 Grand"". If Kool John likes to play the Juve or Mannie role, the less laconic Nef favors Wayne. Just when the likeness starts to become eerie, Nef backs off and switches hats, always with an overtly comic, lightly ironic timing, like he’s carrying off an elaborately plotted series of pranks. His verses pit in-and-out-of-phase, cartoonish rambling (à la his mentor and labelhead E-40) against lilting but controlled double-time. Snap-jumps between simpering bad boy posturing in his high range (""Trips to Rome, shrimps and calzones/ I’m always outta range, I’ma text you when I get home""), a more intimidating low purr, and a diplomatic, Drake-ian midrange (see introspective closer ""Come Pick Me Up"") give his verses a character-driven quality that's almost Jim Carrey-esque. Luckily, this isn't a When Nature Calls scenario; Nef’s sensibility isn't exhausting. The rapper can embody the obnoxious neighborhood bully, the smoothest game-spitter in school, and a conscientious father in one song all without spoiling the mood, or upstaging the beat. The flow and intonation shifts as Nef pans between scenes: after-shift rendezvous with strippers, hustling rituals encrypted in dense slang, and more bald-faced, confessional anecdotes. He tends to pick simple governing metaphors and pushes them to logical but satisfying conclusions—in the marimba-studded nu-G-funk strut ""Michael Jackson"", most effectively, he uses an extended King of Pop metaphor to forge an elaborate tribute to designer shoe shopping. This six-song EP does not provide a definitive answer on whether Nef is just an effective conduit for great party songs, or if he’s got a voice that’s resonant enough for a full career of albums and features. It’s a bunch of stabs in promising directions—a more ambitious extension of his earlier YouTube drops and his #RichBy25 mixtape. Success is ensured on the EP by the neighborhood heroes he’s got supporting him: rising talent June on Da Beat, G-Funk wizard and indispensible area talent scout DJ Fresh, and P-Lo, HBK’s more baroque answer to DJ Mustard. Even in the Bay—which, from Mac Dre to Shady Nate to Husalah, has birthed an untold amount of slickness—charm as strong and effortless as Nef’s doesn’t come along everyday. He may slide into other people’s flows so well that you lose track of him for a moment, but the style and grace with which he ducks and weaves between them imbues everything he does with personality. His brand of unfailingly zany energy has characterized the best hip-hop of his region for decades, and Nef’s never been ashamed to acknowledge it (""Mac motherfucking Dre lives in me,"" he claims at the beginning of last year’s ""M.A.C.""). He’s pretty good at making anything sound cool, and maybe even cleverer than it is. See his song-stealing verse on DJ Mustard's ""You Know It"" from earlier this year, which closes out with: ""Money on my mind like a headband/ Fucking with my ‘fetti, you a dead man/ Shoot him in his chest, watch his head split/ Every day I make a band and never play the instrument."" What he has that many of his local peers don’t is a consistent ear for hooks, a willingness to play the field stylistically without outpacing himself, and a precision of purpose. ""In the land of the lost, I’m the nigga to win,"" he claims on ""Mobbin"". With industry cosigns, a ""Big Tymin’"" remix from Cali-stars-turned-national-influencers Ty Dolla $ign and YG (included here) and a national tour with the latter under his belt, Nef has a rare entry point for success beyond Solano County. If this EP is any indication, he may also have the pop prowess and adaptability to make the most of it.","The charismatic 20-year-old Bay Area rapper Nef the Pharaoh gained momentum mostly through creatively covering classic beats and delivering crisp neighborhood pride anthems.

The Miraculous,Anna von Hausswolff,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1545e6ef959693220ea/1:1/w_160/9deb35c1.jpg,2015-11-17 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21135-the-miraculous/,City SlangOther Music,"Growing up in Gothenburg, Sweden, the Swedish singer and multi-instrumentalist Anna von Hausswolff occasionally retreated—as so many kids do—to her own alternate dimension. Like all fanciful realms, this hallowed spot, deemed ""the miraculous place"", honed the young von Hausswolff’s imagination like a gym for the mind. ""The border between fantasy and reality was so blurred,"" she recently told the Quietus. As the former monarch of the woods across the street from my elementary school, I can attest to this sensation: there’s something about self-created folklore that sharpens the spirit like no other exercise can, and one could argue that such myths lay at the heart of not just childhood, but human experience as a whole. To craft her third full-length LP—so named for her special place—von Hausswolff made a pilgrimage to the city of Piteå, home to the Acusticum Pipe Organ. One of the largest instruments of its kind in that region, it is equipped with 9,000 pipes, built-in percussion (including vibraphone and glockenspiel), recording/looping tools, and nefarious sounds produced by submerging the pipes halfway underwater. If von Hausswolff’s wanderlust is the soul of The Miraculous, then the Acusticum is its gothic, frequently grotesque heart, its mechanical pulse tempered by the organic approach of the musician's four-piece backing band. Consider The Miraculous’ universe a carnal Camelot, not far removed from the fucked-up mythologies of Angela Carter or George R.R. Martin. There’s no Ren-Faire tackiness, though; rather, the LP bridges high fantasy with human emotion, as the opening line of ""The Hope Only of Empty Men"" attests: ""I think I see a knight/ I’m gonna fuck him for a while."" Considering the religious contexts in which we’re used to hearing the organ, such lines seem downright heretical, and that’s exactly the point: The Miraculous transforms an instrument regarded by many as one of the stuffiest in music into a lusty, lustrous marvel. For instance, the Swans-reminiscent highlight ""Come Wander With Me / Deliverance"" pits the puritanical pipes against a pair of droning guitars and an aqueous wail created through the aforementioned pipe-submerging method. It’s a battle that ends with a noise-ridden reunion, the marriage of sacred and profane. There’s darkness embedded within the songs’ dynamics as well; as Von Hausswolff lets out an ascendant wail at the start of ""Evocation"", the pipes swell up around her like the nightmarish offspring of a THX sound test, imbuing the musician's corporeal angst with divine strength. There’s nothing wrong with a good glacial pace, but Von Hausswolff’s slowly unfurling arrangements, as well as her reliance on the organ as the primary rhythmic vehicle, occasionally make the record tough sledding. The album’s meandering latter half proves dull: ""En Ensam Vandrare"" and the title track drift along like flotsam on a lazy river, doing little to command the listener’s attention. Like most stories, The Miraculous take a few retellings for its ultimate magic—invigorating contrasts, medieval madness, and von Hausswolff’s role as foul-mouthed, fantastical raconteure—to sink in. Nevertheless, this is a dimension worth thorough investigation.","For her third album, the Swedish singer and multi-instrumentalist Anna von Hausswolff made a pilgrimage to the city of Piteå, home to the Acusticum Pipe Organ.

Making Time,Jamie Woon,by: Britt Julious,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17e13d197565213a617/1:1/w_160/c1915314.jpg,2015-11-17 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21163-making-time/,PolydorPMR,"A classic singer-songwriter never goes out of style. The soulful and enigmatic crooner Jamie Woon rediscovered this in the four long years between his charming-but-uneven debut album, Mirrorwriting, and the release of his second, Making Time. Rising with a fresh crop of UK-based, slightly experimental vocalists and collaborators in the London bass music scene (think Jessie Ware, James Blake, and Sampha), Woon’s debut produced sophisticated music that ultimately failed to catch on as strongly as his contemporaries. Like many artists in his position, Woon could have become a victim of the time, a footnote to a rising scene. But Woon took the opportunity to realign with his musical origins. In a 2011 interview with BBC, Woon said ""At the heart of what I do is R&B; it’s groove-based vocal-led music."" On Mirrorwriting that ""R&B"" was partially obscured in production atmospherics, but Making Time exhibits a renewed focus. The album sounds loose and organic, revealing layers of precision in the production and recording on repeated listens. Inspired by D'Angelo’s Voodoo, Woon was interested in recording with a live band in the room for Making Time, a far cry from the electronic-roots of his debut. ""My starting point was that I wanted to hear a funky rhythm section,"" Woon offered to Pharrell Williams in an interview on Beats 1. Mirrorwriting was distinguished in part by collaborations with revolutionary musician and producer Will Bevan (otherwise known as Burial), but Making Time reduces songs to their core elements: a perfect harmony, strong melodies, and a crooning voice that is unlike any other. Woon's vocals are rare and stunning, the kind of sound that washes over its listeners, and no synths or heavy-handed production is needed to make that effect possible. The instruments here play supporting roles. ""Movement"" transforms halfway through its length into a groovy, throwback jam, and the slinky, snake-like bass guitar cocoons Woon’s voice without overpowering it. Later the horns gradually stomp in. Their sound is elastic and ominous, pushing and pulling against the light fluidity of Woon’s ad-libs. And on ""Sharpness"", the album’s lead single, the bass pops in and out of the song just as much as the steady drums. The result shouldn’t surprise, but still does. Channeling pieces of piano jazz and folk as well as R&B, Making Time feels philosophically similar to Jessie Ware’s restrained 2014 sophomore effort, Tough Love. Many described the work as ""adult contemporary""—an insult, if not entirely untrue. But that sort of designation fails to engage with the work at hand, lumping it all together. And while it never hit as hard as ""Running"" on Ware’s debut, songs like ""Kind Of … Sometimes … Maybe"" and ""Champagne Kisses"" offered surprises brimming underneath the surface. It’s smart music that doesn’t beat you over the head with its intelligence. If Woon’s last album was an attempt to incorporate the contemporary sounds he favored at the time, this current album is a testament to the strength of traditional music composition: simple guitars, slinky bass lines, and sophisticated songwriting. Woon has, from the start, been his strongest when he lets his voice say everything that’s necessary. This might come across as traditionalist, but that is OK. With songs this good, little else needs to be said.","The soulful and enigmatic UK singer Jamie Woon brought the textures of the post-dubstep UK bass scene into his sophisticated debut Mirrorwriting. It got lost in the clamor around peers like Jessie Ware and James Blake. Now, on Making Time, he's pared away his music to focus on his stunning voice.

Purpose,Justin Bieber,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b206b1335d7bf169a38e/1:1/w_160/3a201c88.jpg,2015-11-17 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21248-purpose/,Def Jam,"Purpose is less an album than a deliberate act of repositioning. As much as 2012's Believe was intended as Justin Bieber's micro-adjustment into adulthood, the advance singles for Purpose, ""What Do You Mean?"" and ""Sorry"", are his first hits without any traces of teen-pop. They're designed much in the spirit of ""Where Are Ü Now"", his single with Skrillex and Diplo from earlier this year, where Bieber's voice fluctuated through animated throbs. Produced, respectively, by MdL and Skrillex (who contributes six productions to the record), ""What Do You Mean?"" and ""Sorry"" are vivid tropical house tracks that sound like sunlight drifting down through palm fronds. Bieber's voice often resembles a breath contorted inexpressively through notes; here, he lets it weightlessly fall through textures. They are his best performances to date, allowing him to flex a rhythmic playfulness without communicating an iota of legible emotion. Purpose doesn't particularly follow up on the advances suggested by his previous release, the 2013 R&B experiment Journals. That record was Bieber's first attempt at casting himself as an adult, but its efforts, alternately curious and anonymous, went largely unnoticed. For its part, Purpose mostly suggests that Bieber's idea of ""adulthood"" is the ability to convey pettiness without emotional intelligence. On new single ""Love Yourself"", an Ed Sheeran co-write that also functions as a gentle kiss-off, Bieber sings ""If you like the way you look that much/ Baby, you should go and love yourself."" Lyrically it's needlessly mean, neither funny nor clever, and it doesn't do much to justify the severity of its perspective. The songs on Purpose have a similarly inanimate feeling; they seem to radiate more than they move. ""No Sense"" feels oddly hookless and almost willfully ugly, and when Travis Scott surfaces toward the end of the track, he registers as just another cold texture. Nothing here has the captivating, lopsided construction of Journals' ""Confident"". ""No Pressure"", featuring Big Sean, comes close with its shimmering, processed acoustic guitars—though the song might have appeared lighter and more nimble in the hands of someone like Usher. In general, vagueness, indecision, and faint befuddlement suit Bieber best. ""The Feeling"", produced by Skrillex, describes a liminal, unstable state (""Am I in love or am I in love with the feeling?""), and the track fittingly seems to slip in and out of focus. Halsey, who released one of the worst singles of the year with ""New Americana"", proves an ideal counterweight to Bieber, and together the two effortlessly convey the gentle intensity of a crush. At these moments, when Bieber is allowed to remain a lithe and fluttery element zippering in and out of a canvas, he sounds most comfortable. But when Bieber is required to slow down and emote, he sounds adenoidal and aggressively blank. ""Life Is Worth Living"", a piano ballad in which every chord seems indifferently faxed in, is one of the many songs on which Bieber struggles to justify himself to the public. ""My reputation's on the line, so I'm working on a better me,"" he sings. As much as this record is part of his long campaign of rehabilitation, he struggles to convey a remotely sympathetic perspective. His similes tend to get terrestrial when he's talking about himself: ""It's like you're stuck on a treadmill/ Running in the same place."" On the title track, he sings, ""Look at all the promises I've kept,"" as if gesturing to a PowerPoint presentation. The second half of the album is monochromatic and depressing, especially as it runs out to 20 tracks in certain versions. (Two of the bonus tracks, ""Been You"" and ""Get Used to It"", are pneumatic, funky disco pop tracks that sound only slightly removed from this year's Jason Derulo album; they're better than nearly anything on the album proper.) Near the end of the album is ""Children"", an embarrassing and overwrought attempt at social consciousness. It might be an attempt at writing his own ""Man in the Mirror"", an outward gaze among so many shallow inward ones. ""What about the children?"" he asks meaninglessly. ""Who's got the heart?"" The question hangs uneasily.","The advance singles for Justin Bieber’s Purpose showcased his best performances to date while hinting at a successful transition beyond teen pop. And yet, the full record too often comes off like a redemptive PowerPoint presentation while suggesting that the singer’s idea of ""adulthood"" involves the ability to convey pettiness without emotional intelligence.

Parallelogram,Various Artists,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae51c0084474cd0c189f/1:1/w_160/27da581d.jpg,2015-11-16 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20588-parallelogram/,Three Lobed,"Three Lobed Recordings operates from the brightly lit basement of a one-floor midcentury home in a quiet subdivision of modest ranches outside of Greensboro, the third largest city in North Carolina. When the label issued its first vinyl box set in conjunction with its 10th anniversary in 2011, Cory Rayborn—Three Lobed’s owner, a lawyer by day—joked of the operation’s at-home modesty by way of a sales pitch. “In this case,” he wrote of his staff, “‘we’ means one human and three feline assistants.” Since the release of that collection, the excellent Not the Spaces You Know, but Between Them, Three Lobed has continued unabated with its curatorial quest through the weird annals of experimental American folk, drone, and rock. The pace has been methodical, with four or so albums a year, but the execution masterful. In that span, Three Lobed has served as a syndicate for some of the world’s best, relatively young solo guitarists—Chuck Johnson, William Tyler, Sir Richard Bishop, and Tom Carter. There’s been shambling, snarling folk-rock from Wooden Wand, impish permutations of folk and metal from Horseback. Three Lobed issued one of the decade’s most transfixing drone records—On Jones Beach, a bagpipe-anchored collaboration between members of the Necks and Sonic Youth—in 2012, followed by two essential collections from Bardo Pond, the free Philadelphia spirits that prompted Rayborn to launch Three Lobed in the first place. For an imprint so smitten with noisy records, Three Lobed’s actual signal-to-noise ratio remains nearly perfect. Still, four years and all those accomplishments later, Three Lobed’s operations remain minimal, with Rayborn and his cats working away in the basement after-hours. The small scale seems by now a point of pride, a way to show that the persistent dedication of one person can help shape an entire scene. Indeed, such modesty and minimalism offer significant returns for the roster of Parallelogram, Three Lobed’s second vinyl set and a collection of 10 acts so strong it would feel like a fever dream for most any avant imprint. Bardo Pond splits a full-length with Yo La Tengo, Six Organs of Admittance one with William Tyler. Transatlantic and trans-generational kindred spirits Michael Chapman and Hiss Golden Messenger face off, while Kurt Vile and Steve Gunn back one another up on sides of their own. And for the five-record set’s white-hot point of dissonance and bedlam, Thurston Moore and John Moloney duel as the duo Caught on Tape while Chris Corsano, Alan Bishop and Bill Orcutt crash, clatter and grind as a trio. Parallelogram presents a constellation of explorers, separately ferrying the same enthusiasm and openness that have animated Three Lobed’s very catalog. Almost every act here has experience with a much larger label. In Sonic Youth, of course, Thurston Moore made major waves by moving to a major label a quarter-century ago, while Michael Chapman issued Rainmaker on Harvest Records during the company’s first year, the same year they issued Pink Floyd’s Ummagumma. Four have deals on Matador, two on Merge, one on Drag City and so on. Some of these bands may sell more records in a week of touring than Rayborn sells of all his releases combined in a year. But these five splits are available only in an edition of about 950 LPs. Through the label, they’re offered only as a buy-them-all bundle, though stores and the bands themselves will be able to sell individual titles. Coupled with those low numbers and a relatively high barrier to entry, Three Lobed’s low-key status and individual-driven aesthetic seem to have made each act comfortable, or free and clear to try something different out of their typical spotlight. As William Tyler, who continues his recent streak of austere wonder with his two contributions here, put it in an early interview about Parallelogram, “I pretty much say yes to anything Cory suggests. He is a number one ace dude, like a Yogi Berra-type figure in the subterranean rock scene.” Everyone on Parallelogram seems to respond to that same why-not directive. Yo La Tengo, for instance, shows a piece of their collectively complex musical mind rarely seen in a recording studio; their “Electric Eye” is a fierce 20-minute improvisation, with stalled signals, scraping guitars, and muffled, murmured vocals fighting against a militantly loping rhythm. Its counterpart is Bardo Pond’s “Screen for a Catch (Fur Bearing Eyes)”, a sidelong beauty that seems to funnel almost every strength of their catalogue into one arcing collage. They move from bleary-eyed stoner drift to howling-guitar psychedelia, from seraphic harmonies to acoustic-slide tangents, closing with a high-and-mighty jam that fades into the middle distance. It’s like a patchwork homage to a label that exists only because they do. And just two months after releasing the biggest album of his career, Kurt Vile pounds the piano keys through Randy Newman’s “Pretty Boy”, a song that’s a bar fight waiting to happen. You can almost picture Vile, a tumbler of brown liquor in his hand, singing it this way at a bar after a show, offering it as send-up to casual new fans who might have quaked his perpetual mellow. And when he digs into heartland country for a cover of John Prine’s gleefully apologetic “Way Back Then”, he sounds carefree, temporarily leaving behind his cool for a moment as an earnest balladeer. Steve Gunn adds guitar to that cover, and Vile returns the favor for Gunn’s faithful and steely-eyed cover of Nico’s “60/40.” More intriguing, though, is “Spring Garden”, a 10-minute fantasy featuring Gunn, Vile and harpist Mary Lattimore on piano. In the last few years, Gunn has morphed from a guitarist issuing long-form, dexterous instrumentals through Three Lobed to a proper singer-songwriter and bandleader. But just a few months ahead of his own big Matador debut, Gunn attempts to reconcile both past and present with this extended beauty. The trio delights in seemingly infinite refractions of a riff without distracting from Gunn’s soft-focus hook. As the title suggests, Rayborn intended these pairings to highlight interesting, perhaps overlooked similarities between sets of artists he treasures. And that approach works. Hearing Six Organs of Admittance and William Tyler on the same LP, for example, you notice how well both manage density, or the lack thereof, as a discrete aspect of dynamics. Tyler’s stunning “Southern Living” begins as a bucolic duet for acoustic guitar and sighing slide. But he slowly lets the notes hang until the space can handle no more sound, until it all blurs into a messy web he then must pull apart. Likewise, in the gorgeously distorted “Lsha”, Chasny piles layers into the mix—his ghostly vocals and rapid fretwork, broken keyboards and whirring synthesizers—until it merges into one signal. He then drifts from the din, arriving at chords so soft and pretty they sound like bedside whispers. But the ultimate takeaway of Parallelogram might be the tension among all these acts, not their similarities. Compare the guitar elegance of Tyler or Chapman, especially on the latter’s stunning “Stockport Monday (Homage Tom Rush)”, to the six-string aggression of Moore. Here, he takes a familiar riff—in this case, the pinging theme of his “Ono Soul”—and twists, turns and tackles it in every way he can. Feedback and static, squeals and divebombs: Moore searches for new ways to destroy his own melody. Usually so solemn, Hiss Golden Messenger seems to bask in the springtime sun during a delicate, groove-heavy take on J.J. Cale’s blushing “Wish I Had Not Said That”. He adds a lightness of soul at which the original only hinted. Corsano, Bishop, and Orcutt, on the other hand, torture Jack Bruce’s soft-rock flop “Politician”, turning its creepy come-on into an off-putting, oft-hilarious fuck-you. The cumulative effect of all these lines—parallel, perpendicular, divergent—is one of sheer wonder. There was a time not to long ago—when it became clear that most every act, no matter how large or small, could release their own records online—that people questioned what role, if any, labels might play in music’s future. Why would someone need an imprint if they could simply convince friends and fans to share a file or link? In many cases, that has come to fruition, allowing for the emergence of trends that might have been bypassed by the old, slow system. But labels aren’t just big businesses. They are, as in the case of Three Lobed, people with a long-standing dedication to a sound they want to push into the world. And their involvement in those scenes can help connect dots or create ideas, turning strange potential scenarios into five-record box sets that create new contexts for familiar acts. More than curation or tastemaking or filtering, the usual quasi-canards invoked for label survival, their real source of staying power might be their ability to invest in, understand, and help evolve a niche. For the last 15 years, that’s what Three Lobed has done. Parallelogram is a trove of evidence, fit for a label too big for a suburban basement.","Three Lobed Recordings' second vinyl box set features full-length splits between Bardo Pond and Yo La Tengo, Six Organs of Admittance and William Tyler, Michael Chapman and Hiss Golden Messenger, Kurt Vile and Steve Gunn, and Thurston Moore and John Moloney and Chris Corsano, Alan Bishop, and Bill Orcutt. Despite the title, the ultimate takeaway of Parallelogram might be the tension among all these acts, not their similarities.

Know It All,Alessia Cara,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b204ea9e61561daa6877/1:1/w_160/43322b97.jpg,2015-11-16 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21247-know-it-all/,Def Jam,"Alessia Cara has become a star very quickly. Her coming out party, which came in the form of the loner anthem “Here,” exposed a receptive world to a soulful R&B sound. Cara’s lament about a less-than-enjoyable party made her a poster child for Introvert Nation at a time when shyness—thanks to writers like Susan Cain and various digital media outlets — has been recast as an identity unto itself. Def Jam, Cara’s label, soon released more of her songs, several of them country-tinged pop that recall artists like Taylor Swift and Haim. In Cara’s case, that sound tends to go hand in hand with bland, vaguely “rebellious” lyrics. In the pop songs on her Four Pink Walls EP—including the potential megahits “Seventeen” and “I’m Yours”—Cara’s appealing personality is sometimes hard to unearth from under the layers of pop gloss that have been poured on top of her. But the EP seems to have been what the label was looking for, at least as evidenced by the fact that its five songs have been transposed onto the front of Cara’s debut album, Know-It-All, in the same order, with very few changes made. The speed at which Cara is being groomed and prompted to put out new releases feels distasteful if sadly not unfamiliar, something like an AAU prospect being coaxed to go pro before he’s entirely ready. In many ways, though, Cara is ready. Her winning personality shines in recent public appearances (watch her slay “Here” on “Late Night on Seth Meyers”), and her voice, with its warmth and character, can transform a so-so song into something far more compelling. She’s able to mine an otherwise simple ballad like “Stone,” from the second half of Know-It-All, as if it were a rich emotional deposit, bringing pathos even to a bland line like, “I think I think too much.” Though “Stone” is the only song that explicitly features Sebastian Kole, he contributed plenty as one of the album’s producers and a co-writer. Kole, who has been in the factory songwriting system for a little while now also makes his own music. Two things jump out at a first-time listener: his gorgeous voice and painful earnestness. That helps explain why he’s helped construct such compelling vocal showcases for Cara, but also why her punchiness has been overtaken by something more cuddly. (“Wild Things,” which transforms Cara’s grousing into a lame children’s book reference is the most obvious example.) A Times profile of Cara from May reveals something of Kole’s approach. As a songwriting exercise, he compelled Cara to write confessionals as if they were meant for no one but her — and then email them to him. The sound of those emails may well be reflected in the soppy ballad “Stars.” “I need you, baby I need to, let down my guard, and give you my scars/ Open up my heart and we could be stars,” she sings. It’s easy to see how this form of diaristic writing could be confused with the honesty that made “Here” such a winner. But writing from the heart does not automatically imbue lyrics with depth. Never is it more apparent that the factory approach is not allowing Cara to fulfill her potential than on “Scars To Your Beautiful.” The first verse is so arresting that I’m tempted to just quote it in full. It’s about a woman who deeply wishes to be beautiful and feels that she isn’t. The verse ends on a showstopping, deeply upsetting line: “She tries to cover up her pain, and cut her woes away/ Cause covergirls don’t cry after their face is made."" It is frustrating, though sadly inevitable given Know-It-All’s tendencies, that the chorus then reverts to uplifting pablum. The hook forces itself not only to redeem the devastation of the verse, but to do so cloyingly, without any kind of subtlety or empathy for the subject it rendered so well. The industry has always wanted its pop stars to be all things to all people, and it’s easier to be kind and inspiring than it is to write songs that can be difficult to hear. But generality is the enemy of good songwriting, which, on some level, Cara clearly knows. She urged her label to release “Here” as a debut single and thankfully they listened. As she gets older, her voice should get stronger, on her own songs, and in fighting to get the right ones made.","Alessia Cara's debut album improbably features her debut EP in its entirety. It also does not feature a lot of great songs, despite her truly arresting voice. But the seeds are there for the future if she (or her label) let her rawer instincts breathe.

Skid Row,James Ferraro,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e7c0084474cd0c1eb1/1:1/w_160/51a0e4f3.jpg,2015-11-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21225-skid-row/,Break World,"Even before the ongoing coast-to-coast exodus, Los Angeles has always held a mythic allure to New Yorkers. To a nearly surreal extent, every meaningful aspect of living in New York is inverted there, like some kind of Gulliver's Travels opposite-land paradise–a place of endless cars and infinite residential square footage, where generalized anxiety is something to be worked on rather than bragged about and people seem to enjoy going to bed at a reasonable hour. Despite all the breathless endorsements from transplants that swear that they've never felt so good before, L.A. does have a substantial dark side–a populace dealing with PTSD after years of gang violence compounded by police violence, the reactionary paranoia wafting in from Orange County, its ongoing ecological disaster. It's a place where you can stand in the window of a multimillion dollar loft downtown and gaze out over an ephemeral shanty town that blooms and evaporates daily, cocktail in hand, feeling like nothing so much as a sci-fi villain. After producing a convincingly jittery, grimy portrait of late-Bloomberg New York on 2013's NYC, Hell 3:00 AM, James Ferraro has accomplished a similar likeness of his adopted hometown Los Angeles with its follow-up, Skid Row. It comes as no surprise that his L.A. album is short on sunshine and mellow vibes, and long on looming existential dread. There's not much of New L.A. in his portrait, no bohemian Brooklyn expats chillaxing in a pleasant new climate. Ferraro's L.A. is a dystopian vision stitched together from its drought-stricken everyone's-a-reality-show present and the bad old '90s, where the riots, the OJ trial, and the LAPD's corrupt culture blurred together to cast an ominous shadow on the city's carefully cultivated image. His urban pessimism remains undulled–as does his passion for oppressively ugly recording techniques–but Ferraro's switched up some of his musical approach. While Hell 3:00 AM sounded like a nightmare version of contemporary R&B, Skid Row does something similar with L.A.'s native funk styles, which have recently been revived in less bleak ways by the likes of Flying Lotus and Kendrick Lamar. Ferraro's take on funk strips away all of its organic sensuality and joy, leaving a creepy husk that's still fascinating to inspect. ""White Bronco"", which kicks off the record after one of the computer-generated spoken word introductions that have become something of a Ferraro trademark–this one featuring a pair babbling about gated communities and ""burning Priuses on the highway"" and conducting a transaction for an iced latte–slows a slow-jam groove down even slower until it sounds eerily narcotized and its minimalist synth bass riff takes on a menacing aspect. Ferraro's monotone listing of facts from the Nicole Brown Simpson murder trial mixed in with samples of TV news surrounding the Rodney King beating conflate the two sensational acts of violence like someone who's either heavily intoxicated or just suffered a head injury. At the two-thirds point of the song, Ferraro hits a vocal lick that sounds like Snoop's ""'G' Thang"" flow, and it feels like some kind of sick punchline. Ferraro's freer with hooks on Skid Row than he was on Hell 3:00 AM, and there are songs like ""Thrash Escalate"" and ""Rhinestones"" that sound like they could slap if they were sped up a few percent. He might be starting to come to terms with his innate pop talents, or it could just be a new tactic of dispensing hints of traditional pop pleasures into the gloom to keep his audience off balance. Skid Row isn't really about those singular moments though, or about walking away from it with a hook stuck in your head. They're just elements in a solidly built cohesive whole that feels like a J.G. Ballard novel filtered through late-night Ableton sessions, and a worthy addition to the long line of punk albums about Los Angeles that render it as a city built on fantasy with a nihilistic streak that runs to its core.","After producing a convincingly jittery, grimy portrait of late-Bloomberg New York on 2013’s NYC, Hell 3:00 AM, experimental producer/composer James Ferraro has accomplished a similar likeness of his adopted hometown Los Angeles with Skid Row.

Hell EP,The Pains of Being Pure at Heart,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b212c0084474cd0c1ef2/1:1/w_160/892f910b.jpg,2015-11-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21261-hell-ep/,Painbow,"For all the instant good will they stockpiled with their woozily sincere take on ’80s and ’90s indie-pop, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart have always invited doubts that they were, at their core, little more than gifted impressionists. Mostly they’ve let any criticisms about their originality bounce right off of them. Instead of trying to prove themselves more than the sum of their record collections, they’ve simply continued showing off how vast those record collections are. 2011’s Belong expanded on their debut’s C86 jangle with blood-rushing alternative rock, while last year’s understated Days of Abandon took an even deeper tour through the Hall of Semi-Obscure UK College Rock than their debut did. That tour continues on their new Hell EP. It’s one of the band’s most low-stakes releases yet: an original song, which band leader Kip Berman first posted as a demo along with several songs that didn’t make the cut for Days of Abandon, and two quick covers. In hindsight, he might have done well to find room for Hell's title track on Days of Abandon; its chipper spirit would have helped lighten an album that sometimes begged for a pick-me-up. Like nearly every Pains of Being Pure at Heart track, it’s obsessively specific in its influences, with a sticky disco groove that nods to Orange Juice and the puppy-dog giddiness of an early Close Lobsters single. Even Berman's vocals feel like an homage; he sings in a warbled sigh that sounds a lot like Pete Shelley. Given how openly the band has always embraced their influences, it’s surprising they haven’t recorded more covers—Berman often seems to be channeling other artists’ voices and accents anyway, so it’s not much of a leap to sing their words, too. Each of Hell’s covers serve as a statement of taste. One celebrates one of the quintessential overlooked British guitar-pop bands Felt’s “Ballad of the Band”, while the other reclaims a familiar if underappreciated hit, James’ “Laid”, a treasure of a song that lost much of its cache when the American Pie franchise claimed it as its own. Both are too faithful to offer any real surprises, and the band’s last album already owed so much to Felt that their “Ballad of the Band” almost feels redundant. “Laid” delivers more of a kick. Their version doesn’t quite capture the orgasmic glee of James’ original, but it features a game lead vocal turn from A Sunny Day in Glasgow singer Jen Goma, who’s been moonlighting with Pains since their recent lineup shakeup. Unlike Berman, she’s not afraid to leave her own stamp on her cover, and she punctuates the song’s most biting line with just the right amount of a punk snarl: “Dye my eyes and call me pretttttttty.” Pains’ debut album introduced a band that had not only clearly mastered their influences, but seemed on the brink of doing something truly new with them. Six years later, it’s now clear they have no interest in that; Berman is too reverentially devoted to his muses to risk bastardizing them. When a band’s output is this consistently pleasant, it's petty to complain too much about originality, but Hell is the group’s second overly safe release in a row, and it’s hard not to wish they’d start taking a few more chances. This band is talented enough to be aiming much higher.","Pains of Being Pure at Heart's 2009 debut introduced a band that had not only mastered their influences, but seemed on the brink of doing something truly new with them. On their new Hell EP, which features an original and quick covers of Felt and James, it's clear they have no real interest in that.

Free TC,Ty Dolla $ign,by: Rebecca Haithcoat,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd913d197565213a355/1:1/w_160/074e65ed.jpg,2015-11-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20916-free-tc/,Atlantic,"There is a song on Ty Dolla $ign's first mixtape, Hou$e on the Hill, that wouldn't be out of place in a Los Angeles Philharmonic pops concert. On the track, an orchestral sample dances under the near-onomatopoeic effect of Ty's ""up and down, up and down, up and down-down-down"" chant. The song's title? ""Stripper Pole"". Ty has honed this musically refined yet lyrically raunchy aesthetic for years, from his Raw & Bangin*'* tapes to his breakout single ""My Cabana"", to the louche Beach House series to last month's made-in-a-day Airplane Mode. It's a balancing act very few have mastered—and Ty bows to or has recruited anyone who has here—but he does it on a hoverboard while texting two or 10 girls. To be sure, it helps that his musical gifts are many: he writes hooks that lodge in your head for weeks and he arranges four-part harmonies like an R&B George Martin. His molasses-dipped voice never misses a note even when it darts up into falsetto. He's stoked about sweeping orchestrations, '80s smooth jazz sax solos, and acoustic songs with Babyface. His confidence is why he flies when he swings for the fences on his new album, Free TC. On its dazzling highlight, ""Miracle/Wherever"", TC, the album's incarcerated namesake and Ty's younger brother, sings a vibrato-heavy hymn of perseverance over a prison phone. Midway through, Ty joins in. After putting God first and damning the haters with the conviction of a newly born-again Christian, he begins to pray. Musically, the shift is exquisite. But what's truly special is Ty's porcelain, Prince-like falsetto. Over dirty 808s and a stirring chord progression, his pristine voice pops out of the ether singing about—what else?—lying with a woman in the, uh, biblical sense. Ty said he spent $60,000 of his own money on the Benjamin Wright Orchestra. If all that bought was the final 20 seconds of ""Wherever"", he should consider it money well spent. Predecessors who've climbed that Lucite-heel littered stairway to heaven before Ty are thanked outright. On ""Blasé"", the best song currently in radio rotation, Ty sings, ""I think I'm Nate Dogg."" Obviously. Love notes like ""When I See Ya"" sound ripped right from Nate's notebook. Another standout, ""Credit"", features Sevyn Streeter and recalls ""Be Careful"", R. Kelly's collaboration with Sparkle. Kellz actually makes an appearance on the sleek and glittery ""Actress"", which sounds far more like Hollywood than the Valley. ""Straight Up"", the album's sexiest song, samples Patrice Rushen's quiet storm classic, ""Settle for My Love"" and finds Jagged Edge downgrading their classic proposal from the altar to the bar. Ty's up to his old ""how many hoes?"" tricks on Free TC, too, even if a woman is responsible for writing ""Horses in the Stable"". You can credit both his fireside manner and his forthright delivery—there is no fine print in a Ty Dolla $ign song—for the fact that plenty of women will still slip into his silk sheet-covered waterbed despite his warnings.","No one does baroque filth like Ty Dolla $ign. Free TC is an R&B epic of wanton bedroom jams, filled to the brim with charming grossness, actual prayers, and E-40.

Animal Nature,Escort,by: Ilana Kaplan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22dc0084474cd0c1f22/1:1/w_160/bf561c83.jpg,2015-11-13 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21273-animal-nature/,self-released,"On their second studio record Animal Nature, Escort’s leaders Dan Balis and Eugene Cho continue the Studio 54-esque party that began with their 2011 self-titled debut. Back in the early 2000s, Balis and Cho met at Vassar College and began making house singles as a duo. Years later, they added vocalist Adeline Michèle, and a 17-piece live band to the mix at their shows. Animal Nature isn’t a huge departure from their debut; the production is cleaner, and there’s a bit less funk in the mix. This is a more polished, less-DIY affair than 2011’s debut, something you can see even in the cover artwork: on their self-titled, Michèle goofed off in a parking lot, but 2015 Escort seems to have found its brand identity, and it looks alluring in neon. On Animal Nature’s ten new songs and nine remixes, Escort finds its footing in a post-disco phase.  Title track ""Animal Nature"" doesn’t disprove the many allusions to Daft Punk the band has gotten over the years, but it also brings to mind parallels to LCD Soundsystem’s ""Get Innocuous!"" The lyrics don’t make sense—""Stand up, stand up bang your drum, we are the barbarians""Michèlechants throughout ""Barbarians"" like a Vietnam War song—but they don’t have to, because the production quality remains at the forefront for Escort. A cohesive, well-produced R&B-infused disco album is no easy or small feat, but Escort keep their focus sharp and momentum pumping, with the full band lending weight and warmth to the perfect period synths. They’ve moved from funk disco into a late ‘70s disco/early ‘80s synth phase, blurring genre lines.They throw in a few welcome curveballs: covering St. Vincent’s Annie Clark is an ambitious gambit, but Michèle’s penchant for theatrical singing over scattered chiptune beats fit right in with Clark’s aesthetic on ""Actor Out of Work.""  It keeps the brittle, plasticine quality of the original while scaling it up for club dancefloors. These moments are welcome, as there isn’t always  a ton to distinguish them from other, similar acts working in the always-crowded ‘70s-saturated house and disco music field. By the end of Animal Nature, Escort proves it’s gotten craftier and has found a bit more clarity, and they hit a nostalgic sweet spot that will never grow old.","The NYC disco-house revival group Escort return with their sophomore effort.

Alone In The Universe,Jeff Lynne’s ELO,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2239d034d5c69bf4b10/1:1/w_160/d0058360.jpg,2015-11-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21266-alone-in-the-universe/,Columbia,"ELO has been largely dormant since they released their thirteenth album in 2001. And yet, their music continues to find new listeners, whether through compilations, car commercials, soundtrack placements, or G+ copies of Eldorado in used record bins. On one hand, the band ought to have aged about as well as Emerson Lake & Palmer or Styx, which is to say, not very well. ELO’s best albums— A New World Record and Discovery in particular—are prime examples of the excesses of the '70s, with all the pomp and studio wankery of the most ambitious prog rock imaginable. And yet, Lynne deployed those techniques in service of songs that had all the exuberance and abandon of early rock 'n' roll. If he was making big statements, then they typically amounted to ""I really want tonight to last forever / I really wanna be with you."" Given their propensity for cosmic imagery (have you seen their web site?), the title of their latest album sounds all the more wistful, as though the absence of alien life is the saddest thing Lynne could ever imagine. That particular melancholy informs first single and album opener ""When I Was a Boy"", which may sound slight but is animated by the kind of nostalgia often found in country songs. ""Radio waves kept me company in those beautiful days when there was no money,"" Lynne sings, as though flipping through old photo albums. ""When I was a boy, I had a dream."" He’s still no wordsmith, but there’s something bracing about his directness; any lyrical pretensions would ruin the reverie. On the other hand, you have something like ""Dirty to the Bone"". With its florid harps and thrumming drums, it’s an upbeat pop song in tone and tempo. But the lyrics are mean-spirited to a near-comical degree, as Lynne describes one of those she-devils who seem to exist only in old rock songs: ""She’ll mess you up, she’ll move around… she’ll deceive you till the cows come home."" That kind of cartoony straw-woman writing abounded in the '70s, but the casual misogyny, not to mention such threadbare cliché, feels profoundly out of place now. Alone in the Universe fares best when Lynne is more generous, when he can contrast the downcast sentiments of the lyrics with the effervescence of the music. After a rocky side 1, side 2 picks up considerably, thanks to light-speed ""Ain’t It a Drag"" and the zero-gravity ""I’m Leaving You."" Lynne may be a maximalist, but he makes every element count. He still has a good ear for simple but driving rhythm sections, and most of these songs use an acoustic strum to augment the beat and warm the track—a familiar, but still effective, technique. Likewise, the sympathetic backing vocals on ""All My Life"" underscore the yearning in the songs, making the simplicity of the lyrics (""I’m so glad I found you, just want to be around you"") sound all the sweeter. Alone in the Universe doesn’t simply unearth that classic ELO sound like some ancient artifact. Instead, it gently updates those elements to 2015, the year Lynne celebrates his 68th birthday and his 52nd year in the music business. These songs sound precarious, both musically and emotionally. Partly that is due to age and the slight quaver in Lynne’s vocals, which aren’t quite as robust as they used to be. Partly it is due to technology. Lynne has always used to the studio to define his band’s entire identity, and the difference between then and now is the difference between the air-brushed UFO on A New World Record and the CGI saucer on Alone in the Universe. There’s a gauzy thinness to the sound, an inescapable two-dimensionality that occasionally hinders Lynne’s mission. Still, this is a fine addition to their catalog, perhaps not as consistent as 2001’s Zoom but much better than these late-career revival albums tend to sound.","ELO has been dormant since 2001.

Norberg/Apondalifa,Tim Hecker,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d9c0084474cd0c1e9f/1:1/w_160/ad31892c.jpg,2015-11-13 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21217-norbergapondalifa/,Room40,"You can debate exactly when Tim Hecker became a master of his chosen musical form, but there's little doubt that he did at some point—at least as early as 2006's Harmony in Ultraviolet —and hasn't let go since. The variances between his works may seem incremental, but line them all up and the amount of raw material he's turned to gold is remarkable. This kind of mastery means there are no minor releases in his discography, at least in terms of quality. Even the two records collected here—the 2007 live CD Norberg and the 2010 7-inch Apondalifa, both made in limited quantities to coincide with Australian tours—reach levels of interest and intensity below which Hecker seems incapable of falling. How exactly Norberg/Apondalifa fits in his stellar discography is a trickier question. Most reviews of Hecker's records compare them to their predecessors, with good reason; his oeuvre forms an internal dialogue wherein individual albums reflect, react to, and play off of each other. But even though ""Norberg"" and ""Apondalifa"" reflect the headspace Hecker was in when Hecker made, they feel isolated, meant to stand alone. And where many Hecker albums have had specific focus—on a theme, or a working method, or a mood—these two pieces are more like simple displays of creative strength. Of the pair, ""Norberg"" is more comprehensive, a seamless 20-minute piece in which Hecker surfs around the sonic map without deviating far from his initial path. At times he flirts with aggressive noise; in other places he gets so beatific it's like he's meditating. But for most of ""Norberg"", Hecker skates in the tantalizing space between those poles, hinting at both without dropping off into either. When the piece ends in applause from the crowd, it's almost shocking, because—as in much of Hecker's work—you feel like you've spent the last 20 minutes inside of his head. Perhaps because it's shorter, the 9-minute ""Apondalifa"" is more single-minded, hewing to one discernible range of mood. But Hecker can blow up even the tiniest dots into widening vistas, a feat he accomplishes here by varying textures rather than his tones. So even as the track feels relentless, it also spreads out into phasing guitar chords, low-end rumbles, and slow waves of drone that circle a solid core. As important as those details are, in a way they're also irrelevant, because Hecker's touch and control are so deft they could transform any coal into diamonds. That's the ultimate value of Norberg/Apondalifa, a sharp reminder that Tim Hecker has had it all figured out for a while now.","Many albums by electronic producer and composer Tim Hecker have had specific focus—on a theme, or a working method, or a mood.

Cool Uncle,Cool Uncle,by: Ernest Wilkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22bc0084474cd0c1f1c/1:1/w_160/1d672fda.jpg,2015-11-13 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21271-cool-uncle/,Fresh Young MindsEMPIRE,"After a chance connection via a Facebook message, Grammy-winning producer Jack Splash (Kendrick Lamar, John Legend, Jennifer Hudson) has teamed up with none other than Bobby Caldwell - yes, that Bobby Caldwell, the one with the 1978 classic ""What You Won't Do For Love"" has been sampled on approximately 21.9% of all hip-hop songs ever released—and the result is a smash, taking equal parts funk, pop, smooth jazz, and yacht rock, (!) laying it all down on a solid retro-R&B framework. The group winks at the project's inherent adult-contempo cheese-factor with their moniker, but really, this is is the best freshest, and funkiest adult-contempo cheese imaginable. The best thing about Cool Uncle is the fact that both participants don't strain to sound new. Instead, they lean into their respective strengths. Given Splash's resume as a producer and arranger of R&B sounds (as well as his frontman work for funk group Plantlife) there's a ton of groove on this album, interspersed with horns (the saxophone on the Mayer Hawthorne-featured ""Game Over"" is a highlight) and a bassist that does yeoman's work. The project is off-kilter and odd in appealing ways: On ""My Beloved"" Caldwell executes what has to be the first vampire lovesong by way of a week-long bender in Ibiza and sticks the landing. And his voice hasn't aged a day since the '70s. The record is bursting with features, and most everyone carries their weight. Jessie Ware (on album standout ""Breakaway"") and former '80s-pop-star (""Let's Hear It For The Boy"")-turned gospel-artist Deniece Williams (""Breaking Up"") both contribute passionate performances whereas Cee-Lo (on ""Mercy"") kind of fades into the background. Mayer Hawthorne, whose blue-eyed soul vocals tend to waver somewhere between ""convincing"" and ""nah"", sounds as smooth and appealing as he ever has on ""Game Over"". This release, coupled with solid 2015 output from acts like The Foreign Exchange, Dawn Richard, Estelle, Kelela and others, serve as a solid reminder that R&B is big and vital enough right now these days to contain multitudes: Soundcloud divas, alt-R&B weirdos, returning legends like Janet, pubescent lotharios, minimalist bleep-bloop-ass whisper-singers, and beyond. Being an R&B fan right now means never having to settle for one kind of record, or one sound. When one year gives you so many different options, a fun record that doesn't take itself seriously like Cool Uncle feels like icing.","Cool Uncle is the result of a chance meeting between Grammy-winning producer Jack Splash and underrated smooth jazz kingpin Bobby Caldwell. Their record takes equal parts funk, pop, smooth jazz, and yacht rock, laying it all down on a solid retro-R&B framework.

People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,A Tribe Called Quest,by: kris ex,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1dbea9e61561daa682e/1:1/w_160/d9cc81e5.jpeg,2015-11-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21218-peoples-instinctive-travels-and-the-paths-of-rhythm/,LegacyLegacy,"Approaching A Tribe Called Quest's seminal debut in 2015 is a loaded venture. The Queens, N.Y. trio (and sometimes ""y"" quartet, counting Jarobi) is one of the most revered acts in hip-hop—and with good reason. As part of the Afrocentric and innovative Native Tongues collective—which included De La Soul,  Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, Black Sheep, and others—they created and refined a template for '90s hip-hop that was street-astute, worldly, and more inspirational than aspirational. Even without the Native Tongues' legacy, Tribe's heritage is not a light one. There's no stretch in saying that, without A Tribe Called Quest, the biggest rap artists of this year—Drake, Future, and Kendrick Lamar—would not exist as they do. Drake would not be Drake without Kanye West's 808s and Heartbreak; Kanye would not be Kanye without his Tribe influences. Without Tribe, the Dungeon Family—birthplace of Outkast, Goodie Mob, and Future—arguably does not exist. And the improvisational looseness of Kendrick's opus is unthinkable without the innumerable branches of jazz and hip-hop sprouting from Tribe's experimentation, which differed significantly from the cooler jazz-sample leanings of Stetsasonic and Gang Starr. There's no Mos Def, no J. Cole, no Common, no J Dilla, no Digable Planets, no Neptunes, and no Clipse as we know them. Tribe is that important. And this album—the first ever to receive a perfect ""5 Mic"" rating from The Source magazine—is where it all began. Arriving a year after De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising, People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm showed Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Jarobi to be whimsical yet grounded in reality. They weren't heady, hermetic, and puzzling like De La; in comparison to 3 Feet High's astounding range and informative sound collages, People's Instinctive Travels was clean and focused. Where De La went wide musically, Tribe went deep; where De La was deep and dense lyrically, Tribe went wide and abstract. That both projects managed to do all they were able to do and remain fun is one of the great wonders of hip-hop's first golden age. Encountered now, in 2015,  A People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm feels like a palette cleanser. Considered with Kendrick Lamar's layered and angsty self-examination on To Pimp A Butterfly, the blunting and numbing escapist bounce of Future's DS2, and Drake's bombastic and moody mythological affirmations from If You're Reading This It's Too Late, it's an album that's largely focused outside of itself and its creators. There are three added cuts for this reissue—remixes by Pharrell, J. Cole, and CeeLo—that are passable and melodic but unneeded. Tribe's music needs no updating, even when it sticks out like a sore thumb, because that's exactly what it did in 1990. ""I Left My Wallet In El Segundo"", with its eight-bar flip of the Chamber Brothers' ""Funky"" and Wes Anderson-like narrative, is sparse and simple. But it more than stands up, thanks in no small part to Bob Power's remastering, which makes everything sound fuller and crisper and which uses the empty space between the newly clarified sounds to create groove and warmth. On a fresh listen, the reason ""Bonita Applebum"" (powered largely by a generous  sample of  Ramp's ""Daylight"") is still considered one the best loved songs hip-hop has ever produced becomes clear—musically it's sunny and spry, capturing blushes of virgin courtship. It's objectifying, but respectful; cocksure but awkward; flattering and freaky: Q-Tip praises his desired's ""elaborate eyes,"" promises to ""kiss you where some brothers won't"" and offers that, ""So far, I hope you like rap songs."" The rhymes here are at once conversational and repressed, the topics concurrently large and small. Diet is tackled on ""Ham 'N' Eggs"" with Tip and Phife rhyming in tandem, ""A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?/ Some veggie links and some fish that stinks/ Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house/ Smelled like she conjured up a mouse. "" Sexual fidelity and STD's are dealt with on ""Pubic Enemy"" via ""Old King Cole"" who ""wore the crown but not the jimmy hat"" until one day ""the fair maiden in the royal bedroom/ Caught the king scratching."" Sex and safe sex were at the forefront of Q-Tip's mind—props (women) are referred to often, and the most important thing about retrieving his wallet from El Segundo seems to be reclaiming his ""props' numbers"" and condoms, or ""jimmy hats."" The group is marked for their social consciousness, but not merely because of their awareness, but their ability to wax simultaneously about politics and art. On ""Push It Along"", Tip traverses police brutality, community unity, and rap dreams in a few bars, managing to be an approachable advocate for responsibility without seeming didactic: ""The pigs are wearing blue/ And in a year or two/  We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe / What we gonna do? Save me and my brothers?/ Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers?/ Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule rap/ We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?"" The lyrics are 25 years old. But were they released today they'd seem right on time, while being out of place—because all these many years later People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm is more than a nostalgia artifact. It's a worthy listen, not because of what it was, but because of what it is.","A Tribe Called Quest's seminal debut is an album that's largely focused outside of itself and its creators.

Bottom of the Morning,Pinkish Black,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ecc0084474cd0c1d27/1:1/w_160/707aa72a.jpg,2015-11-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21276-bottom-of-the-morning/,Relapse,"On the same October day Pinkish Black released their third and best LP to date through Relapse Records, the label also issued the final recordings of the members' earlier act, a process stalled for five years by tragedy. Pinkish Black's anchors—the theatric singer and florid keyboardist Daron Beck and athletic drummer Jon Teague—formed The Great Tyrant a decade ago with bassist Tommy Atkins. A young, exploratory and vaguely metallic outfit interested in doom and goth, industrial and krautrock, The Great Tyrant was working on The Trouble with Being Born when Atkins killed himself in 2010. Beck and Teague scrapped the sessions and started a new band, taking the color of the blood-splattered walls where Atkins had died—that is, pinkish-black—as a lurid tribute to the missing member. It's fitting, then, that The Great Tyrant emptied its archives on the same day Pinkish Black offered its latest, greatest work to date, Bottom of the Morning. As a duo, Beck and Teague have finally found the sound and strength for which they've long searched. Fighting through a half-decade of despair, the results on Bottom of the Morning almost feel heroic. Pinkish Black's previous two albums were hesitant and uncertain, as though Teague and Beck were trying to define their shared aesthetic while teasing out a new duo chemistry, too. Their fine 2012 debut packed in some excellent ideas and alluring sounds, but the band—particularly Teague's voice—was obscured in effects. Though more forthright, the subsequent Razed to the Ground found the duo again trying to do too much, as they moved from slow-motion dirges to extravagant, pulse-pounding doom. But Bottom of the Morning is, at last, the first unified, unabashed Pinkish Black album. These songs are unveiled, a message that's as clear with the hook-heavy, march-like opener ""Brown Rainbow"" as it is with the beautifully brutal instrumental closer ""The Master is Away"". On these seven tracks, Beck and Teague amplify the grandiosity, directness and intensity of what they do. The keyboards can be as rich as a Tangerine Dream or Goblin record, the melodies as creepy and contagious as John Carpenter. And Teague emerges as a powerhouse capable of summoning John Bonham, Klaus Dinger and Billy Cobham. But the real coup here comes through Beck's voice. Even on The Great Tyrant's LPs, especially the now-unearthed The Trouble with Being Born, it was clear how capable he was, though he wasn't yet quite in command of his talent. Here, however, his mix of near-monastic chants, witchy incantations and operatic verses—now, not crowded by manipulation or undercut with noise—serves as the record's compulsory core. You lean in close to hear what he's saying. It should come as little surprise that a band named for a friend's suicide embraces dark lyrics. Indeed, these songs approach the nihilistic. ""Special Dark"" is little more than a string of negative participles and adjectives—""withered, fractured … bleaker, starker""—intoned in a dour murmur over blown-out bass and busy drums. At the start of ""Bottom of the Morning"", Beck whispers and sings about wasting life and wasting time; at track's end, he howls about endless cycles of false promises and futile attempts at self-improvement. ""Everyday's the same again,"" he sings, his voice stentorian but graceful, like a latter-day Scott Walker. ""Everyday it's growing thin."" Since Atkins' death in 2010, they've survived the death of several family members and severe sickness; the weight and worry of the world are central to these songs. But somehow, those qualities are boons, not burdens. Despite all the despair and misanthropy written into these words, these songs often feel like conquests. The album itself is triumphant, like a survivalist manifesto offered at the close of a markedly tough spell. Behind the grim declarations of ""Bottom of the Morning"", for instance, the twinkle of the organ, the groove of the left hand's bassline and the dance of the drums suggest Miles Davis' On the Corner, perhaps even Weather Report. And though ""Burn My Body"" is as lyrically macabre as the title implies, bright synthesizer arpeggios and the back-and-forth motion of the drums offer the relief and release endemic to the narrator's final request. As the song ends, the synthesizers and drums intimate a skyward ascension, a last will finally honored. On Bottom of the Morning, Beck and Teague have effectively stepped beyond the ghosts of the past, landing in a present where the results are now as compelling as the backstory.","Formed after the suicide of the bassist from their previous group, Texas duo Pinkish Black have emerged with their grimmest and most triumphant album yet. Despite all the despair and misanthropy written into these words, these songs often feel like conquests.

Ilimaq,Glenn KotcheJohn Luther Adams,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c8b1335d7bf169a32f/1:1/w_160/e64fc828.jpg,2015-11-12 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21205-ilimaq/,Cantaloupe,"Until recently, composer John Luther Adams and Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche would both have been regarded as unlikely draws in the world of classical music programming. During his years in Alaska—far away from the postgraduate-composition academy—Adams specialized in minimalist-influenced works that tended to avoid the driving pulse that made minimalism popular with a wide audience. For his part, Kotche spent a lot of time touring with Jeff Tweedy. But things can change quickly (especially for a genre with such a long tradition). For Adams, the reversal of fortune came with the mania surrounding his 2014 Pulitzer Prize-winning piece Become Ocean: a symphony-length orchestral approximation of maritime ebb and flow. Though Ocean didn’t represent an overhaul of Adams’s aesthetic, it brought his environmentalist’s appreciation for the natural world to a new conceptual height. (The title also gave uninitiated listeners a hint regarding what to expect from his serene-then-raging compositions.) Meantime, Kotche's 2014 classical album Adventureland felt distinguished—even in an active time for indie artists looking to prove their conservatory chops. (The drummer also performed brilliantly on composer Missy Mazzoli's album Vespers for a New Dark Age.) In the aftermath of his Pulitzer win, Adams has been easier to spot. He’s since moved to New York, where his pieces are programmed at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. Next year, Adams will be the ""composer in residence"" at Knoxville’s Big Ears Festival—the all-genres-welcome avant-bash that also presents Wolf Eyes and Yo La Tengo. Given this, it’s hardly surprising to find Kotche participating in a recording of Adams’s percussion-driven work, Ilimaq. That title, which is Inuit for ""spirit journey,"" isn’t kidding around. Scored for three different ""stations"" of percussion instruments that the drummer moves between, during a performance, this recorded version also tosses in field recordings of nature, ambient accompaniment, and some live-electronic processing of Kotche’s playing. If that sounds like a busy experience, it can be—but only when experienced as a whole. There’s a superficial stasis that masks much of the development here; if you dive into the 48-minute work expecting an instant hit of obvious Pulitzer-genius, you might find yourself initially underwhelmed. The twelve-minute opening movement ""Descent"" sounds at first like one long bass drum roll—hurtling forward for a bit, decelerating, then pushing ahead once more. But its closing section presents odd groupings of notes for Kotche to navigate as Adams’s electronic environment undergoes subtle variations. The following movement, ""Under the Ice"", delights in a teasing ambiguity created by the blend of field recordings, electronics, and Kotche’s gentle cymbal work. The cumulative effect is so hypnotic and meditative that when clear, descending pairs of notes appear in ""The Sunken Gamelan"", they hit with the force of power chords. ""Untune the Sky"" brings everything from the composition’s first half hour together for a rite that finds Kotche wailing on an expanded kit, and it’s here where the drummer’s technique is the most impressive. After that apex of clamor, ""Ascension"" provides a calming coda of high-pitch drones. As a suggestive mirror-image of the piece’s opening ""Descent,"" it’s satisfying and logical—though the chief virtue of this piece is Adams’s slow-motion way of arriving at grander, less predictable change.","Composer John Luther Adams and Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche collaborate on a recording of Luther Adams' roiling percussion work Ilimaq. Luther Adams won a Pulitzer last year for Become Ocean, while Kotche has made some serious inroads into modern classical, and the two outsiders find a lot in common here.

Indie 500,Talib Kweli9th Wonder,by: Mosi Reeves,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d6ea9e61561daa6826/1:1/w_160/aa115bd2.jpg,2015-11-12 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21215-indie-500/,JavottiJamla,"On the first track of Indie 500, a song inspired by Pete Seeger's civil rights anthem ""Which Side Are You On"", Talib Kweli raps, ""Celebrities be making money off the powerless/ Their silence in the silent in the face of injustice is just cowardice."" He distances himself from the celebrity straw man, but he could easily be viewed as one of them. He's a public figure who visits eateries on Anthony Bourdain's ""No Reservations"", debates politics with Bill Maher, and engages in public arguments like the one he had with CNN's Don Lemon. He's recorded hit albums like Eardrum, which peaked at No. 2 in 2007. And his 2002 song ""Get By"" is one of the best rap songs of the millennium, a perfect distillation of his working-class striver's aesthetic. Perhaps Kweli affects modesty to emphasize his commitment to the community, and to the political and social issues that affect us. But let's face it: He's not exactly an unknown Prisoner of Conscious. Kweli's collaboration with 9th Wonder, Indie 500, is all about commitment, whether he's criticizing gentrification practices on ""Every Ghetto"" or memorializing fallen heroes Pimp C, J Dilla, and Roc Raida on ""Great Day in the Morning"". The album title appears to be repurposed from the Indie 5000 parties that briefly flourished in '90s New York during the Rawkus/Fondle 'Em years. Sadly, there are no appearances by Moodswingaz and the Juggaknots here. But Jessica Care Moore, whose name will ring familiar to Nuyorican Poets Café fans, and whose Black Tea: The Legend of Jessi James was released on Kweli's Javotti Media imprint, delivers a strident declaration of her self-worth on ""These Waters"". Another Javotti artist, the Brazilian-born rapper Niko Is, doesn't stand out as sharply, but he lands some nice lines. ""Motherfuckers scared to speak out, so they tweet out,"" he claims on ""These Waters"". Occasionally, Indie 500 loses focus. Kweli excels at the activist raps, and although his cipher with Problem and Bad Lucc on ""Pay Ya Dues"" lacks competitive tension, it's a nice display of the trio's lyrical skills. His humble-brags on ""Lo Fi"" about how ""Promoters will walk me right to a table and be, like, this is your spread,"" however, seem perfunctory. He doesn't come off as insincere, but it's not his lane. Indie 500 is intended as a statement of self-determination from two artists with superior track records. But its execution feels rushed. The track sequencing could be better. Kweli appears on all but three Indie 500 tracks, and overall, the compilation doesn't sound like a concise effort. The production, handled by members of 9th Wonder's Soul Council, often relies on conventional drum arrangements and loop-chopping techniques. There's considerable prowess, however, to be found in Khrysis' contributions. ""Technicolor Easels"", which is a Niko Is solo showcase, is bathed in synthesizer ice. ""Understand"", where Kweli raps alongside Brother Ali and Planet Asia, has an easygoing piano stride. In spite of its flaws, Indie 500 features two can't-miss moments. ""Bangers"" opens with a brief lecture from 9th Wonder, who notes how golden age rap spurred youth to enroll at black colleges, and dryly notes, ""In 1988 to 1993, black college enrollment went up 46 percent."" MK Asante captures the vibe nicely when he says, ""Live from the flames of Baltimore."" Then there's Rapsody, who is part of 9th Wonder's Jamla imprint and appears on three tracks here. In the past, she struggled to get noticed for albums like The Idea of Beautiful and She Got Game, at least until a feature on Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly brought her some long overdue attention. On ""Life Ahead of Me"", she candidly addresses sexism in the rap industry: ""If I had a penis your penis would be hard as a brick is/ Saying I'm a king on some rap shit/ But my gender got 'em tender/ I recognize y'all lies."" Rapsody argues that if she were a man, she'd be widely regarded as one of the most talented rappers today, and she might be right.","Talib Kweli's collaboration with 9th Wonder, Indie 500, takes its title from the Indie 5000 parties that briefly flourished in '90s New York during the Rawkus/Fondle 'Em years.

Riot Boi,Le1f,by: Andy Emitt,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12d5e6ef959693220a8/1:1/w_160/51d568b6.jpg,2015-11-12 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21109-riot-boi/,XLTerrible,"Queer rap is this era's Riot Grrrl—a ""genre"" as much as a cultural movement of previously muted voices—and while Hole translated Riot Grrrl into noise within the grasp of Entertainment Weekly's attention, queer rap still awaits its pop culture avatar. Le1f has long seemed poised to cross-over into the mainstream, and he could still become that pop burglar—but not with his debut album Riot Boi. Although lead single ""Koi"" may sound like a strategic aim at a buzzworthy radio single comparable to the FM accessibility of Le1f's breakthrough track ""Wut,"" Riot Boi is most immediately an album about not being seen. ""I'm wonder like Stevie, like Stevie you won't see me,"" he raps on standout ""Swirl."" If Le1f's career has thus far been about breaking glass ceilings as a queer black rapper, then Riot Boi shows us a trailblazer sitting down among these cracked shards of glass, reckoning with what it means to have come first. Riot Boi's early cuts capitalize on production polish that moves beyond the underground grittiness of Le1f's first mixtape Dark York and the simpler sound of his Hey EP. Opener ""Hi"" succeeds from pure hype, the constant background greetings of a robofemme ""Hi!"" reminding us that this is a long-anticipated debut—while concluding lines ""I'm feelin' like such a new being"" promise a newly matured artist. On ""Rage"",  Le1f offers the promise ""It's lit/ Now, let's rage"", but what follows is less ""rage"" than swagger-laced annoyance, as on ""Grace, Alek or Naomi,"" where Le1f spits ""I'm the faggot they stan or they don't understand it/ I run with the posse and I band with the bandits."" This sass saturates ""Swirl,"" which enlists Junglepussy and House of LaDosha to assert the black partner as the erotic powerbroker in interracial trysts—reversing the white gaze. On the track, Le1f reclaims black exoticism with lines like ""I'm a dark-skin nigga on TV."" Riot Boi thus begins with Le1f navigating his own breakthrough, his point of view oddly retrospective for a debut album—evidencing the new hype economy of the internet, where a star can be made before ever being born. Le1f's self-reckoning also involves returning to familiar sounds that unfortunately feel like regression rather than mastery. Album midpoint ""Koi,"" alongside ""Umami / Water,"" only recall how much better this kind of aqua shtick worked for Azealia Banks' Fantasea or even for Le1f's own 2012 tracks ""Bubbles"" and ""My Ooozy."" ""Water"" is built on a melodic riff of what sounds like an electric guitar wet-dreaming of a sitar, Le1f's East-Fucks-West aesthetic at its best. It's the album's most compelling sound, but nevertheless its water witch-hop aesthetic (shared with ""Koi"") diverts the innovative ideas from Riot Boi's early highlights. Riot Boi delivers what its title promises--a transgression of pop cultural limitations—most clearly in the final three tracks, socially-conscious slow jams with far more overt political messages than Le1f's usual banger-obscured radicalism. This makes for the cringe-worthy ""Tell,"" an admonition to down-low closet cases to come out, but Le1f's political lucidity also allows for the stunning ""Taxi."" The song speaks about sexual economies of racialized desire but doubles as a commentary on the way mainstream audiences ""pass"" Le1f ""like taxis do."" But, he sings, ""I don't care, whatever, it's cool/  Roll the window up on 'em""—making it clear that, whatever crossover potential the album falls short of, Le1f is more than content to remain a riot boi.","If Le1f's career has thus far been about breaking glass ceilings as a queer black rapper, then Riot Boi shows us a trailblazer sitting down atop these cracked shards of glass, reckoning with what it means to have come first.

Montage of Heck: The Home Recordings,Kurt Cobain,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17513d197565213a608/1:1/w_160/62982a97.JPG,2015-11-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21157-montage-of-heck-the-home-recordings/,Interscope,"Watching Brett Morgen’s 2015 documentary Montage of Heck, assembled from Kurt Cobain’s own journals, home-taped monologues, and family home videos, you felt a profound sense of intimacy, even violation. Eavesdropping on Cobain has been a lurid national pastime for nearly 20 years now, from 2003's Journals to the scraps collected on the With the Lights Out box, but Morgen took us closer than even the most brazen imagined we should be allowed to go: Courtney and Kurt, naked and bantering in the bathroom on home video about who gets to play the Reading Festival that year (Courtney, pregnant with Frances, complains jokingly about having to stay home and “get big and fat”). Cobain, nodding off and holding his toddler. Footage of the three band members, teenagers, thrashing around in an Aberdeen shack, watched by two profoundly bored audience members. The very idea that this footage exists, and that we might be given such unfettered access to it, lends the film an uneasy voyeuristic charge. Montage of Heck: The Home Recordings carries the same unsavory aftertaste as the film, with none of its attendant illuminations. The scraps here were dredged by Morgen and used to wallpaper the film, and he’s rounded them out with some home recordings that didn’t make the movie. Home tapes by iconic artists are a tricky business. They can be revelatory, but they always carry a question: Did we learn enough to justify the intrusion? In the context of the film, the audio was an essential part of the film’s sometimes-unclean sense of immersion. Divorced from the images, the sounds on these tapes are little more than lint emptied out of the last pocket of a life. ""Kurt’s brain was always on,” his sister Kim says early in the film, and Home Recordings sounds exactly like that: What a brain is like when it is on, but not necessarily thinking anything. It’s not like listening to Kurt Cobain’s music; it is like submerging yourself in (what you imagine to be) his mind, with all of the bored fidgets, silly voices, jokes made to oneself, and half-hearted guitar strums this implies. In the film, his first girlfriend Tracy Marander recalls that while Cobain was living with her, he was unemployed and would watch television for hours, strumming his guitar abstractedly. You can imagine that a few of these tracks were recorded in similar states. “Burn the Rain” could have been a song he never finished, or it could just be a blurry version of a bunch of different songs he would eventually write, something he committed to tape and never thought about a second time. This hits upon the main issue with releasing Cobain's home-tapes: As King Buzzo of the Melvins noted of this film, Cobain was ""a master of jerking your chain."" These tracks mostly feel like an antic mind entertaining itself, and to enshrine them in this way is mystifying. Consider: There’s a track called “Beans” here, and it’s a minute and 20 seconds of Cobain thumbing two notes and singing about eating beans in a shrieking cartoon voice. There’s another called “Rehash” that consists of him hollering silly songwriter words—“rehash,” “chorus,” “solo”—as he plays some power chords. There are brief audio clips of him playing with sped-up and slowed-down voices. The few early demos—""Sappy"", or ""Frances Farmer"", strummed and mumbled as he worked out the song's skeleton—are so inchoate that lavishing any kind of attention on them feels perverse. They serve to remind us that ephemera provide mute testimony of a life’s existence, but say little about its meaning. There is a precedent for this sort of release, especially with artists who died young with a slim catalog: 2007’s Family Tree gathered together all of the home recordings of Nick Drake, an artist with a similar predilection for committing all his guitar fumbling to tape and even to recording emotionally revealing monologues. Montage of Heck is like a shaggier version of Family Tree, a voyeuristic document that attempts to plop you down in the living room of a dead hero, and it leaves you with a similar hollow feeling. Cobain fan sites have complained that the Home Recordings crosses the line into exploitation, but this line was crossed years ago, and has been obliterated and trampled many times since. The Home Recordings marks the point where that exploitation enters the absurd. It’s a sad bookend to a captivating film, and an ignoble use of a trove of material. Its purpose isn’t to give us any new music, but to give us one last grasp at his fading spirit. For most people, this is the last phase of a breakup, or of grief—when you smell the t-shirt, and register sadly that the essence is gone.","This collection, an audio companion to Brett Morgen’s acclaimed documentary Montage of Heck, assembles half-songs, collages, and spoken word material from Kurt Cobain's home recordings.

One,Kate Boy,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20bea9e61561daa6881/1:1/w_160/2bb677bf.jpg,2015-11-11 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21252-one/,IslandFictionIAMSOUND,"When it came out three years ago, Kate Boy's ""Northern Lights"" joined a new, growing class of Knife-wielding groups. Purity Ring, Chvrches, and Niki and the Dove all made debuts that year that recast the Swedish duo's roiling, synth-heavy formula into new electropop oddities. But the strutting ""Northern Lights"" stood out for a number of reasons: Those teeming, plasticized synth melodies; that widescreen, euphoric chorus; the promise that ""everything we touch turns to gold"" that on repeat listens sounded more and more like a threat. In spite of singer Kate Akhurst's voice bearing a borderline-scary similarity to Karin Dreijer Andersson, Kate Boy's music remained irresistible, dressing up Silent Shout's pressurized gloom in vivid, maximalist clothes. Kate Boy's long-gestating debut, One, continues to hit those same targets, for better and for worse. It includes ""Northern Lights"" and three other tracks culled from an EP quietly released earlier this year, and none of the album's new offerings stray from those songs' well-established blueprint. Kate Boy loves pounding synths and a good shout-along chorus, and so every song on One has both, a technique that is as exhausting as often as it is potent. On ""Lion for Real"", Akhurst's cries of ""It's adrenaline that you're traveling"" are matched in force by the synthetic drums that rally behind her like a militia, an explosion of sound that practically demands you to move. ""Burn"" is similarly gratifying, in a slower, more consuming way, Akhurst stretching her vowels out in a pained howl that sounds like an alternate universe in which Fever Ray was making Billboard-charting singles. Nothing on One really feels as immediate as ""Northern Lights"", but Akhurst's ability to grab you by the throat with each chorus and the trio's playful use of texture—the descending wash of glassy synths at the end of ""Human Engine"", the '80s-indebted guitar line that slinks through ""Higher""—make One an easy, undemanding, and ultimately unsurprising listen. This speaks to Kate Boy's credentials: Australian-born Akhurst has been working as a songwriter since the age of 16 and spent time in L.A. penning songs for Disney star Ashley Tisdale and ""Glee"" actor Charice in the early 2010s before migrating to Sweden, where she met Markus Dextegen and Oskar Sikow Engström and formed Kate Boy (Engström has since been replaced by Hampus Nordgren). But where the group excels at assembling all the bones of a good pop song, One's lyrical content is broad even by those same standards. Platitudes like ""It doesn't have to be this way/ We're different, still the same/ Move your mind to a higher state"" are vague and don't manage to express much nuance beyond ""we're all human, get it together."" ""Self Control"" reaches a bit further, girding its narrator's insecurities as self-defense and providing an interesting counterpoint to the bright, jagged sounds Kate Boy likes to plays around with. On ""Human Engine"", they even shoot for a bit of self-awareness: ""We like the word 'dynamic'/ We like to use it a lot."" Still, those moments are fleeting; sometimes the group even resort to baffling, tech-referencing word salad, as on ""In Your Eyes"": ""Activate emotion waves, oppression down/ Activate the open changes flowing out."" But maybe Kate Boy's sleekly designed songs aren't meant to be ingested with so much scrutiny. They're aiming for the same big, emotional targets as those aforementioned electropop peers here, with enough brooding style to make it distinct. Besides, the group has admitted that they're painting with broad strokes, saying in an interview last month that their main goal is to create ""something that we can all feel empowered singing together."" There are enough dance-ready, skyward hooks on One to render that mission accomplished. Perhaps next time they'll have something worthwhile to say.","When Kate Boy debuted with the song ""Northern Lights"" three years ago, they joined a group of synth-pop oddities enraptured by the Knife. Their long-gestating debut hits the same targets as that song: Kate Boy love pounding synths and a good shout-along chorus, and so every song on One has both, a technique that is exhausting as often as it is potent.

"Ork Records: New York, New York",Various Artists,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c513d197565213a679/1:1/w_160/8f2d6f8f.jpg,2015-11-11 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21203-ork-records-new-york-new-york/,Numero Group,"Founded in 1975 to release ""Little Johnny Jewel"", the debut single by Television, Ork Records had a brief but influential five-year run. The brainchild of West Coast weirdo Terry Ork and art school dropout Charles Ball, the label was blessed with a number of big firsts. Ork released not just the first Television single, but also the first music from poet and punk rock originator Richard Hell and the first singles by Memphis-based musician Alex Chilton following the dissolution of Big Star. This in addition to great power pop by Chris Stamey as well as new wave groups like Marbles, Student Teachers, and the Revelons. Compiled by Numero Group, the lavishly packaged and thoroughly researched Ork Records: New York, New York collects the label's complete 13-single catalog along with a number of related releases that never made it to shelves during the label's existence. Among these are a scrapped single by New Jersey's the Feelies and a sidelined 7"" by the rock critic Lester Bangs that ultimately saw daylight via Spy Records, an imprint run by John Cale. In 2015, nostalgia for late '70s New York City can feel oppressive, given its documentation in an endless stream of record reissues, memoirs, films, and biographies. If you grew up during the '90s, your entire cultural coming-of-age might have been spent surfing successive waves of the city's punk-era remembrance—from ""Saturday Night Live"" reruns to Julian Schnabel's Basquiat biopic, the Strokes to LCD Soundsystem. But New York, New York is a significant artifact. The music and photographs capture the formative moments of punk and new wave, before those genres had been thoroughly defined. It's a glimpse at iconic personalities in a moment of vulnerability, before they were fully hatched and before anybody cared. By contemporary standards, these songs might not register as wild or controversial. In the context of the '70s—a time of slick pop and bluesy choogle—Ork's artists were from another planet. The first sound on Television's ""Little Johnny Jewel"" is not a squeal of feedback or an expertly rehearsed riff, but the thin and elastic tone of Tom Verlaine's guitar plugged directly into the mixing board. Hell's ""(I Belong to The) Blank Generation"" is a bizarre throwback of a different kind—a skewed and slanted remake of the Rod McKuen's jazzy 1959 novelty song ""The Beat Generation"" that was a far cry from the buzz saw tones and pop minimalism of the Ramones. Listening back now, the music is familiar because these sounds have become so deeply embedded in the DNA of today's indie rock. Chris Stamey's ""The Summer Sun"" is nostalgia-tinged bubblegum pop, buoyed by jangling acoustic guitars and backing ""oohs/ahhs."" Chilton's singles are charmingly stoned and discombobulated proto-slacker rock. A one-off studio project, Prix delivers the pained power pop that Ork probably wanted from Chilton, but the singer was then unwilling to deliver. Others offer slightly fudged takes on the more established downtown bands. The Erasers' clean guitar tones and slanted melodies recall Television. The Student Teachers' stripped down and hookly ""Channel 13"" is not too far afield from Blondie, whose keyboardist, Jimmy Destri, produced the band's single. These bands weren't necessarily biting a successful style, just taking cues from their peers. Bangs' ""Let It Blurt"" is an outlier, in that it is terrible. The music—a Beefheart-inspired and Quine-penned backing track—isn't the problem. It's the singing. Bangs slurs and blubbers about the details of a break-up. The details are ugly and unflattering. If Television's music attempted ecstatic transcendence, ""Let It Blurt"" represents the opposite end of the spectrum—earthly woe, gracelessness, the sadness and confusion of lonely dudes. Perhaps this was the intent, though. For what it's worth, the critic seems aware that both the song and his lyrics are absurd. A California counterculture type lured east by Andy Warhol's Factory scene, Ork met Verlaine and Hell when the latter was a clerk at Cinemabilia, a Greenwich Village film memorabilia shop that he managed. He took an active interest in their musical pursuits, set them up with guitarist Richard Lloyd, and when they formed Television, Ork became the band's first manager. In 1975, when the group—by that point in its official, Hell-less lineup—recorded a few 4-track demos, Ork agreed to press a single. The record did well enough to warrant a second release, Richard Hell's first two songs with the Voidoids. Because Ork was a good scenester but a poor businessman, Ball came on to help professionalize the operation. Initially, Ork's mission was to capture a local scene that had grown up around CBGBs but over time there wasn't much incentive to keep going. The bands were not popular and there was little hope of financial reward. It was hard for bands to get booked outside of New York, even regionally. In the liner notes, the Feelies' Dave Weckerman explains that there was only one new wave-tolerant venue west of the Hudson. Many of Ork's artists were not particularly fond of their singles on the imprint. At the time, Television's Richard Lloyd told interviewers that he hated ""Little Johnny Jewel""—""It worked primarily as a demo,"" Hell said of his single, ""I can't stand to hear it."" But the lack of polish is what makes many of these recordings compelling. On Marquee Moon, Television sounded immaculate and artful. Here, the band is sloppy and primitive, but also unconventional and free. On their debut album, Crazy Rhythms, the Feelies sounded tense and jittery, but Ork's version of ""Fa Cé La"" is fast and blisteringly loud. Eventually, the money ran out and Ork folded in 1979. Ball would go on to found the influential no wave label, Lust/Unlust and Ork left both New York and the music business, returning to the West Coast. Both have since passed on (Ork in 2004, Ball in 2012). When the label fizzled, punk and new wave were still very much underground. Of the bands that populated the CBGBs scene, only Blondie and Talking Heads had found anything resembling national success. For all the talk of doom and gloom in today's post-Internet music world, some comfort can be taken in the fact that, even when people were still buying records, Ork's prospects seemed equally grim. The label's biggest hit sold 6,000 units, but, according to the set's liner notes, most releases were lucky to sell a third of that. If you're running an independent record label today, those numbers might not be that far out of reach. In Ork's case, the label wasn't ultimately a lark or a waste of money—the music was heard. These singles diffused out into the world and found their way into the hands of weirdos in far-flung locales. When promoting Hell's single in 1976, Ork ran advertisements with the singer's phone number and suggested that people, ""Call Hell."" ""I called him,"" Minutemen bassist Mike Watt told author Michael Azzerad in the book, Our Band Could Be Your Life. ""I said, 'Is this Hell?' And he said, 'Yeah.' And I got scared and I hung up."" That accessibility stuck with Watt, though. ""That, to me, was punk.""","Founded in 1975 to release ""Little Johnny Jewel"", the debut single by Television, Ork Records had a brief but influential five-year run. This lavishly packaged and thoroughly researched boxed set captures the formative moments of punk and new wave, before those genres had been thoroughly defined.

MMM,Puff Daddy,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b22cea9e61561daa68b3/1:1/w_160/7a9765cc.jpg,2015-11-11 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21272-mmm/,EpicBad Boy,"When an artist—especially an established one—releases a ""mixtape,"" it's typically an album in all senses but the price tag.  And free music is never a bad thing; it keeps news cycles busy and 7-Zip installed on your computer. But why did Puff Daddy release MMM as a mixtape? At 44 minutes and containing at least three great songs, with a concept to boot (MMM tangentially tells a story loosely based on the movie Paid in Full), it has enough weight and heft that it could have served as a direct sequel to Diddy Dirty Money's enduring 2010 album Last Train to Paris. Instead, it lives in a low-stakes no-man's-land between Mixtape and Album (despite being free on Datpiff, it was somehow released in an ""Edited"" version), eliciting slight confusion. MMM has been publicly hyped since at least this summer, but from the first track, Puff Daddy is already shouting out his ""real"" album No Way Out 2, ostensibly forthcoming sometime soon. What follows is 13 tracks of sometimes great, sometimes anonymous music. Obviously an abundance of free ""good enough"" albums is a First World Problem to the nth degree, but the glut of them this year in rap is symptomatic of over-consumption by the listeners.  Shouldn't we be thrilled Puff has, in effect, finally followed up Last Train to Paris? Is it churlish to complain about free music? But the fact remains, if you subtract three filler tracks and a song not credited to Puff (closer ""Blow a Check"", by Zoey Dollaz) what you have are nine new Diddy songs that add up to ""OK."" However, to stress: MMM is not bad. Its concept provides a coherence that keeps the album interesting even when suffering through an interminable Wiz Khalifa guest verse. After the intro, an ominous, low-end rattling Chromatics sample breathes life into the album on the second track, ""Harlem"", a thrilling moment that establishes Puff Daddy's spin of his home neighborhood as a strange, almost dystopian urban setting, which is befitting a sample most closely associated with Drive and that movie's vision of seedy, night-time Los Angeles. True to Puff form, MMM does a great job of gathering veteran New York voices and pulling decent performances from them. Between his frequent toasts to Biggie and the appearance of 2/3 of the Lox, Lil' Kim, and DJ Brucie B, MMM qualifies as something of a throwback late-'90s New York album: the whole crew (including several new voices) trade verses with Puff, including the Lil' Kim-assisted ""Auction"", one of MMM's brightest highlights, constructed on a bombastic sample recalling the best, most classically-maximalist Diddy productions, somewhere between No Way Out and Press Play. The best song here is ""You Could Be My Lover"" featuring Ty Dolla $ign and Gizzle, which prominently samples Cody Chesnutt's ""Boylife in America"", cleverly and subtly drawing a connect between two generations of off-kilter, non-traditional R&B artists. It's a springy, sprightly track, stunning in its warm analog simplicity and also for bursting out of the album's brooding, synth-heavy palette. It also in some ways recalls the giddy highs of Last Train to Paris, which a half-decade ago pretty much perfected a potent and prescient mix of blunt romanticism and inspired, indelible production, and a knack for getting the right guest verse, the right hook, the right tone at the same time—just ask Jeremih, or revisit Trey Songz's overlooked 2014 record Trigga. The song also contains what ultimately redeems MMM—Puff Daddy's fountain-of-youth charm. On ""Help Me"", he says ""young nigga told me I'm old, I said 'old and rich.'"" From someone else, this line doesn't add up to much, but from Puff, it banks its charm on his reputation as a no-apologies capitalist. On ""Workin'"" he says, ""if you see us in the club with Ciroc by the tub we workin',"" then right after that ""in the DJ booth like an independent group like 'look at this record we workin'"". That is the appeal of Puff Daddy right there—the personable opportunist that recalls American, Gatsby-ian myths of self-made success, and then his obsessive love of music. He's ""old"" now, but to many still the guy in a shiny suit somewhere. Puff released MMM as a mixtape because he loves making and releasing obsessively fussed-over music as much as keeping his stock high. He still commands attention from hip-hop heads and the casual music fan alike. That's worth something.","Puff Daddy released this themed mixtape in advance of his upcoming No Way Out 2, but this project has enough weight to serve as a follow-up to his enduring 2010 album Diddy Dirty Money.

Fit Me In EP,Frankie Cosmos,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20fc0084474cd0c1eea/1:1/w_160/cd360095.jpg,2015-11-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21254-fit-me-in-ep/,Bayonet,"Frankie Cosmos (aka Greta Kline) writes songs that are as close to one gets to a pure hybrid of pop and poetry. Her acknowledgment of Frank O'Hara as a significant influence makes a good deal of sense; like O'Hara, her work is both personal and abstract, economical, and infused with humanity, ""between two persons"" rather than a communication between listener and artist. For those concerned with Kline's overtly twee aesthetic, worried that an overdose of saccharine will blot out any other subtle flavoring, her work contains self-deprecation and displacement in good countermeasure. The balance of sweet and salty feels not just purposeful but realistic. Fit Me In, a compact and efficient EP portending a more fleshed-out full-band LP in 2016, is an experiment in what Kline's songwriting would sound like given nearly all electronic instrumentation. A collaboration with frequent musical partner Aaron Maine of Porches, Fit Me In is more in line with Kline's prolific home recordings than a full indie pop record like Zentropy (opener ""Korean Food"" appeared first on 2013's self-released Daddy Cool). Drum machine and synth-heavy, this is true bedroom pop—so intimate as to show the rumpled coverlet and the minute, ancient, nearly unnoticeable stains on the carpet. As is Kline's wont, these songs are little glimpses into her fully realized universe, less verse-chorus-verse pop confections than open-ended, contemporary poetic constructions that don't stop where the recording ends. Like poetry, they require reading and interpretation and us to be engaged as listeners, in communication with Cosmos; art that exists ""between two persons"" requires dialogue. ""Young"" in particular is arch and sly, a response to media commentary that would seek to cast Kline as a fresh-faced ingenue, a character in a box rather than a real, complicated young woman. ""I heard about being young/ But I'm not sure how it's done.../ Something about fun,"" she sings. You can interpret me, she seems to be saying, and I'll interpret you right back. In ""O Contest Winner"", she boasts ""No need for a retest/ I know I'm a genius,"" tongue firmly in cheek, again pushing against others' expectations of her and her work. Such bragging is usually the province of hip-hop, and to hear it in delicate indie pop context could feel self-conscious or appropriative, but in Kline's subtle delivery it sounds both sincere and welcome, both a refutation of the idea that female artists must always minimize their senses of self-worth and an awareness of the sheer absurdity of any declaration of ego. ""Korean Food"" and ""Sand"" are both tender etchings of the everyday nature of real love, a theme Kline excels at exploring; her version of love is not grand or epic, not forced into any particular narrative arc. She finds love in moment-to-moment minutiae, in the smallest pleasures and least valued rituals, without weighting those moments too heavily: ""And touch all the books outside the Strand/ Their oldest pages soft like sand."" There's a reason we're captivated as a society by well-written diaries—at their best, sketches of others' lives as they live them allow us chances to slow down, to connect and to understand one another that we rarely encounter in a highly relational world. Greta Kline is a master at the art of the musical diary—never confessional in a way that feels exploitative and lurid, but tender, intimate, and real nonetheless. We're fortunate she keeps letting us into her world in this way.","Fit Me In is a compact and efficient EP that offers a glimpse of Frankie Cosmos' work with all-electronic instrumentation.

EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE,Rustie,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20db1335d7bf169a399/1:1/w_160/c30447c3.jpg,2015-11-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21253-evenifudontbelieve/,Warp,"It's strange to think that Rustie's debut album came out only four years ago; so much has changed since in its wake. When Glass Swords appeared, in the fall of 2011, it was measured primarily against dubstep's yardstick, praised in part for how far it had stretched the limits of that form. Nobody talks about dubstep any more. These days, as far as swaggering, hard-knuckled electronic music goes, trap rules the roost—thanks in no small part to Glass Swords, which along with Hudson Mohawke and AraabMuzik proved that Southern rap beats plus needle-nosed synths could make for an even more invigorating rave soundtrack than dubstep did. Glass Swords wasn't just a dubstep or trap album, of course; part of its genius was the way that it spun so many sounds and ideas into a bright, high-energy electro-funk whose central contradiction—brittle in sound, pliant in structure—turned out to be visionary. (Rustie deserves some credit for dreaming up the sound that SOPHIE and PC Music would run with: Without ""Hover Traps"", there'd be no ""Lemonade"" or ""Hard"".) Perhaps that inventiveness is why it took the Glasgow producer nearly three years to come up with a follow-up: last year's Green Language, a mixed bag that balanced his giddy hyper-funk instrumentals with relatively standard-issue trap. Distancing himself from that album, Rustie now complains that it was ""too A&Red,"" his vision compromised by managers and outside influences. And just a little more than a year after that album, he's back with a new one, the surprise release EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE, and it represents a hard left turn back towards Rustie's carefully tended turf. There is no doubting who is in control of his vision this time around. There are no cloud-rap forays, no ballads, no grime MCs, no features at all—well, not unless you count the five songs credited ""(feat. Rustie),"" in which the producer sings and plays guitar (not that you would necessarily know it from listening to the songs). Tongue-in-cheek though the gesture may be, the funny thing about the distinction is how little difference is detectable between the songs ""featuring"" Rustie and those that are just by him. Both incorporate vocal chops frothed to high heaven, like towering Everests of Cool Whip; both are topped by soaring, tremolo-shaken synth leads; and both are driven forward by churning rhythms that split the difference between hardstyle's 160-BPM kicks and trap's lumbering syncopations. It is a rawer, scrappier record than either of his prior LPs, and the way he flips the bird at conventional notions of fidelity is almost punk. The high end often has the crinkly cellophane quality of low-bitrate MP3s, and there's so much information being stuffed into the treble register that it occasionally registers as buzz. His drums are plenty forceful—his kicks and snares, in particular, sound like they've been pushed deeply into the red and then run through even more distortion, just for fun—but it lacks the sub-bass of most trap, preferring to muster all its energies for a mid-range wallop that thumps you in the sternum. The rolling toms of ""Big Catzzz"" sounds like he's recorded them off Fury Road with his iPhone. If his sonics are idiosyncratic, his structures are less so. A typical track consists of a minute-long introduction, 30 seconds of the main theme, a minute of pullback, a 30-second return to the main theme, and, finally, a tidy denouement and fadeout. Everything in the song—the rolling drums, the looped voices, the smeared synths, the crescendos of white noise—leads up to that big hit of adrenaline. What's even more striking is how similar the main themes sound, once you subtract all the surrounding flotsam and jetsam. If you placed the album's biggest hooks side by side, it'd sound like one song, uniform in mood, instrumentation, and tone color. Is that a problem? It all depends upon your tolerance. If the idea of mixing Pop Rocks in your breakfast Mountain Dew sounds good to you (or if, like Rustie, you listen to happy hardcore to go to sleep), then EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE will be right up your alley. For the rest of us, there are some genuine thrills (sorry, thrillz) here: ""First Mythz"", with its dolphin clicks and bullet-riddled hi-hats; the calmer ""Atlantean Airship"", which sounds like Glass Swords-era Rustie curdled by acidic distortion. ""Peace Upzzz"" is one of the few songs that actually refuses a big payoff: It's all crescendo and no climax, and better for it. For those who aren't fully on board with Rustie's aesthetic, exhaustion sets in quickly, and the slope of diminishing returns is steep. And that's probably just fine with him, because this is a one-man rollercoaster, from the ""features"" to the credits (""Written by Rustie/ Produced by Rustie/ Extra vocals by Rustie/ Guitar by Rustie/ Art direction by Rustie/ Photography by Rustie""). There is zero daylight between the artist and his vision, as he pounds tirelessly away at one very specific idea. It is less an album than a set of 15 variations upon a single theme. It is the Rustiest album possible, and you have to respect that kind of doggedness.","The Glasgow producer Rustie surprise-released EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE, his third full-length, last week. It is a rawer, scrappier record than either of his prior LPs, and the way he flips the bird at conventional notions of fidelity is almost punk.

True Will,White Widows Pact,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2075e6ef95969322213/1:1/w_160/4c6558a9.jpg,2015-11-10 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21249-true-will/,New Damage,"It's hard to imagine a time when hardcore and metal were separated by fierce, mutually exclusive tribal codes. At an early point in the development of hardcore, to have long hair and a leather jacket at certain shows came with a genuine risk of physical injury. But even hardcore flagships like Sick of It All, Agnostic Front, the Crumbsuckers, and the Cro-Mags put out albums that leaned towards metal, while other hardcore pioneers like D.R.I., Suicidal Tendencies, Corrosion of Conformity, and Prong all eventually transitioned fully into metal bands. Despite these intertwined histories, though, it's easy to see why the division persists between these two camps: in general, metal encourages you to get carried away—be it by ""Dungeons & Dragons"" fantasy, exaggerated horror, Satan, or intellectual musing—while hardcore calls for you to keep your feet planted firmly on the ground. Hardcore bands also tend to fixate on their street credibility, to the point that their music functions as an incessant pledge of allegiance, which can be oppressive if you have no interest in relating to dogma of the lifestyle. True Will, the debut album from White Widows Pact, allows us to imagine a world where this division never existed. Citing Madball, Obituary, and Crowbar as its three primary influences, the Brooklyn quintet consciously tips its cap to the mid-'80s/early-'90s heyday of three different scenes—New York hardcore, Florida death metal, and southern sludge, respectively. In so doing, White Widows Pact reminds us that metal and hardcore were always perfectly suited for mating with each other and that, in fact, the two forms share the same DNA. Of course, it's not like this is revelation in 2015. It's been over 25 years since Brutal Truth strode into the same tangle of sub-genres, eventually taking an Edward Scissorhands approach and carving them into new shapes. Countless bands have done the same, with varying degrees of creative innovation. Take even a quick glance at the Victory Records or Century Media catalog and you'll never run out of mosh breakdowns from bands fusing death metal with hardcore. Listening to True Will, though, it's obvious that White Widows Pact isn't trying to invent anything new. It's more like the band took scoops of three different ice cream varieties, let them melt in the same dish for a bit, and stirred them up into one uniform flavor. Toward the beginning of the track ""Thirteen Years of War"", for example, White Widows Pact is able to infuse a palm-muted, death metal-style chug with the intangible—but unmistakable—urban swagger of hardcore. It's a subtle coloration, and it's hard to pinpoint how White Widows Pact does it, but every musical element on this album bears the distinct mark of a contrasting style. On the other hand, White Widows Pact's guitar solos hint at an awareness of scales gleaned from listening to King Diamond records, a musicality that most hardcore bands shun. In blending these styles together until the lumps are smoothed out, the band gives True Will a seamless quality. And because the album presents itself without pretense, frontman David Castillo's lyrics cut that much deeper. On opening track ""Landlord"", Castillo (the co-owner of Brooklyn venue Saint Vitus Bar) rails against the owner of his tenement-slum apartment—a conventional enough target for hardcore-grade retaliation, but Castillo adds considerable dimension by casting the villain of the song as a clergyman. Where Castillo follows the aggrieved, me-against-the-world hardcore model, he leans towards ambiguity where the majority of his peers would spell things out in the most obvious ways. The veteran narrator of ""Thirteen Years of War"", for example, harbors anger at a man in a suit. Castillo never elaborates on who that man is, or how literal he's being when he sings that the man ""lives next door."" With the music clanging away at full force, the songs become that much more powerful for what Castillo doesn't say.","True Will, the debut album from White Widows Pact, allows us to imagine a world where the division between metal and hardcore never existed. While this isn't a new move, the band has a seamless approach that allows the two genres to darken and inflect the other.

Seems Unfair,Trust Fund,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b3c0084474cd0c1e5f/1:1/w_160/9ae0f04b.jpg,2015-11-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21188-seems-unfair/,Turnstile,"Trust Fund is essentially Bristol-based songwriter Ellis Jones, whose records and tours are rounded out by a rotating cast of musician friends from around the UK. Seems Unfair is his second album of 2015. Back in February, Jones released Trust Fund's debut No One's Coming for Us, which he broke down in a track-by-track feature with unusually transparent remarks on his inspirations. He says, ""I wanted this song to sound like Radiator Hospital"" about three different tracks, and then repeats that line about Swearin', Mount Eerie, Tony Molina, Waxahatchee, the Field Mice, Weezer, and Elliott Smith. Some bands bristle when asked about their influences, as if disclosing them will reveal the shocking truth that they are not original to the world. Jones often frets about people continuing to refer to Trust Fund as a DIY outfit since he signed to Welsh indie Turnstile and received a small advance to make Seems Unfair in a studio rather than his bedroom. Although he's hardly breached intervention-worthy excess, his openness about his artistic debts reads as a very deliberate way of keeping the audience-facing aspect of the DIY ethos foregrounded: this is what made me do this; no form of inspiration is too new to be legitimate. Even without the handy birdspotters' guide, Seems Unfair makes its references overt: It's an indie rock record with the bright, shaggy-dog qualities of early Superchunk, and it often recalls early Los Campesinos! minus the hyperactive streak. You could isolate patches that sound like Pavement or Dinosaur Jr., too, but Seems Unfair is much more distinct than its predecessor, thanks in part to the precise production of MJ from Hookworms. Jones' extremely polarizing voice also helps matters (in a way): He sings in a chalky adenoidal tone that cuts through its surrounds like wax through watercolor. Hooks only occasionally pierced the fog of Trust Fund's debut; here, strange and beautiful boy-girl harmonies cut through the careening fuzz, giving extra shape to these songs. There are folky vocal touches in the breakdown of ""4th August"" and on the title track, where the band cuts through Jones' hushed words with formal choral chants. That song's enjoyably odd beginnings are wasted on a generic, puppyish end, although other tracks on Seems Unfair bring an almost prog sensibility to indie pop: ""Scared II"" starts full tilt, hangs a while in a highly strung, one-note guitar barrage, and ends on a triumphal cascade of vocals interlaced with a careening solo. The relentlessly peppy pace carries along Jones' lyrics, which are as guileless as his approach to interviews. He writes about immediate fears but also the fear of change, often with a similarly simple pathos to Waxahatchee's Katie Crutchfield. ""Michal's Plan"" outlines someone's failed intentions to swim every day; instead, their bathing suit is ""wet and festering in a Tesco bag at the foot of [their] bed."" Seems Unfair is full of characters who seem to struggle with everyday minutiae, but Jones throws a magnifying glass on what may seem to more worldly observers like small stakes. Supermarkets crop up a lot in his lyrics, their shiny floors the sites of emotional reconciliation (""Big Asda"") and the stages for great triumphs: ""Baby, we walk like dreamers do/ Skating through the Free-From to world foods,"" Jones sings on ""Dreamers"". Sometimes his plainspoken quality is too much. The driving ""Scared II"" is about Jones' fear of his partner dying: ""Do a wee, brush my teeth, and you'll be gone forever,"" he sings. Twee is a worn-out, gendered term that's best retired, but Jones' self-effacing use of the word ""wee"" kind of makes you long for a good shower of territorial pissings. Maybe it's intentional though: Toward the end of the song, he asks his reluctant lover if they ""still want to freeze my verrucas?"" It's not appetizing, but then Trust Fund are at their best when they throw in a soured note or stall the pace just as a song threatens to get too comforting. Their tussle between coziness and dissonance betrays a surfeit of ambitious ideas, which isn't often a problem with modern indie rock acolytes.","Trust Fund's sophomore album Seems Unfair is an indie rock record with the bright, shaggy-dog qualities of early Superchunk, and it often recalls early Los Campesinos! minus the hyperactive streak.

Know How to Carry a Whip,Corrections House,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1cb13d197565213a685/1:1/w_160/a55a549f.jpg,2015-11-10 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21207-know-how-to-carry-a-whip/,Neurot,"Two years ago, Neurosis founder Scott Kelly, Eyehategod frontman Mike IX Williams, producer Sanford Parker, and underground metal's most prominent saxophonist Bruce Lamont formed Corrections House, a sort of supergroup that turned out to be defined as much by its intentionally haphazard improv streak as its members' heavy reputations. The music they produced combined easy-to-predict elements—like Kelly's churning, doomy guitars and Williams' Burroughsian spoken-word rant-poems—with surprising ones, like the industrial streak provided by Parker's electronic beats. Despite its seat-of-the-pants beginnings, the group's found equilibrium, and on their second studio album, they're chasing down new ideas with a new confidence. Know How to Carry a Whip brings the electro-industrial elements to the forefront and also pushes into their most unexpected terrain yet—songs with distinct pop structures and even catchy melodies. While it isn't going to spoil the group's esoteric reputation, Whip's a record that you could feel comfortable passing along to casual heavy music fans. In its first half, the album has headbangable beats, grinding Sabbath-y guitars, and actual hooks. The opener, ""Crossing My One Good Finger"", might be the catchiest cut any member of the band has ever been involved with, with Neubauten-inspired drums, thunderous guitars, and a fist-pumping chorus (even if the lyrics seem to be about suffocating on toxic fumes). You could actually dance to ""White Man's Gonna Lose"", as long as Williams' unhinged nihilism doesn't crush your buzz. All of the catchy and danceable parts are covered in layers of sonic grime, expertly rendered by Parker, one of the world's leading experts at making records sound really bad in a really good way. They are also shot through with the searing misery that only Williams can really bring to a song. As a group, they remain obsessed with destruction and decay; fans looking for more of the nightmare poetry readings that defined Last City Zero should be perversely pleased by tracks like ""I Was Never Good at Meth"" that frame Williams' feverish, imagistic stanzas in washes of junkyard noise. Last City Zero positioned Corrections House as one of the more interesting participants in the industrial music resurgence, and Know How to Carry a Whip places them in the lead. Feral and unrelentingly hostile, it's a ragged-edged, rusty shank plunged deep into the ribs of the modern day. Anyone whose formative years as a music fan involved Skinny Puppy or the Wax Trax! label at its peak will feel right at home.","Corrections House is a sort of supergroup of underground metal: Neurosis founder Scott Kelly, Eyehategod frontman Mike IX Williams, producer Sanford Parker, and saxophonist Bruce Lamont.

Myths 001: Collaborative Recordings,Connan MockasinDevonté Hynes,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2249d034d5c69bf4b13/1:1/w_160/8fdb91c9.jpg,2015-11-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21267-myths-001-collaborative-recordings/,Mexican Summer,"Myths 001 is the first of a planned series of collaborative EPs on Mexican Summer intended to pair ""mutual admirers and kindred spirits,"" and the label will be hard pressed to find spirits more kindred than the two it landed for this inaugural installment. On his 2013 breakthrough as Blood Orange, Cupid Deluxe, Devonté Hynes conjured vapory, psychedelic R&B that played like a bizarro soundtrack to water-warped VHS recordings of early Cinemax After Dark broadcasts—the same aesthetic New Zealand's Connan Mockasin shot for on his own LP from that year, Carmel. Like this year's No Life for Me from Wavves and Cloud Nothings, the EP gathers two like minds whose tastes and skill sets overlap so fully that partnering them almost seems redundant. There's enough variation in how Hynes and Mockasin approach their leftfield pop to create some interesting contrasts, though. Hynes is the more polished and more versatile of the pair, an industry songwriter-for-hire who, for all his iconoclastic tendencies, has long been tempted by Top 40's allure. Mockasin's recent process has been more hermetic: He recorded Carmel entirely alone in a hotel room in a foreign city, and next to the open-armed vulnerability of Cupid Deluxe, it sounds rogueish and distant. Mockasin doesn't necessarily shy from heartfelt expressions, but he often cloaks them behind a smirk. So the two make good foils, and Myths 001 is never more amusing than when it plays Hynes' sincerity against Mockasin's oddball falsetto. The duo recorded the EP in Texas over about a week during the Marfa Myths festival this spring with little planning, but all that feels rushed is its 11-minute runtime. The production is nearly as luscious as Cupid Deluxe, all soft-rock decadence and red-light ambiance, and two of its three tracks, while not quite knockouts, are distinctively peculiar. ""La Fat Fur"" opens the EP with a gust of trembling post-punk, imagining what Wire might have sounded like if they'd gone through a Prince phase in the '80s. ""Feelin' Lovely"" similarly has some fun scribbling across genre boundaries, piling bluesy riffs and jazz-fusion keyboards and saxophones over an unusually funky quiet storm groove, playing like a funhouse homage to Marvin Gaye's Midnight Love. The slow-burn closer ""Big Distant Crush"" could use a little bit of that eccentricity. It's the EP's most earnest number, but also its most meandering, five minutes of aimless heartache that can't help but feel like an attempt to pad an otherwise skimpy EP. There's enough here to demonstrate that Hynes and Mockasin have some chemistry, but not enough to fully show it off. This is probably to be expected from an EP whipped up from scratch in just a week, but whichever artists end up on Myths 002 might do well to consider reserving a few extra days in the studio in case they hit it off.","Myths 001 is the first of a planned series of collaborative EPs on Mexican Summer intended to pair ""mutual admirers and kindred spirits.""

Art Angels,Grimes,by: Jessica Hopper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b220c0084474cd0c1f04/1:1/w_160/59ef246f.jpg,2015-11-10 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21264-art-angels/,4AD,"""I'll never be your dream girl,"" sings Claire Boucher on ""Butterfly"", the final song on Art Angels, her most audacious album to date. Perhaps she's just being coy, because for many she is exactly that. In the age of the female pop auteur, Boucher's work as Grimes is a glorious addition to the canon, someone who beckons us to the dancefloor with big ideas and bigger beats, and resists simplistic notions of who she can be on a record or a stage. Art Angels is a gilded coffin nail to outmoded sexist arguments that women in pop are constructed products, a mere frame for male producers' talents—that because their music is immaculate, they are somehow not authentic. These 14 tracks are evidence of Boucher's labor and an articulation of a pop vision that is incontrovertibly hers, inviting the wider world in. Grimes shows that Boucher is the ultimate fangirl study: a D.I.Y. musician whose love of Mariah, Katy Perry, and K-pop has expanded her palette, driven by her fascination with the possibilities of the synthetic and unreal, and ultimately given wings to Art Angels. Here, she closes the gap between the pop she's idolized and the pop she is capable of. Boucher has claimed that the record has two halves, and indeed, the songs line up most easily into beginning- and end-of-the-night dancefloor jams. The former is exemplified by the bright, anxious ""Kill V. Maim"", with its mocking cheerleader chant over blown-out beats and Boucher working both ends of her register in a propulsive celebration of vocal fry. Same for ""Flesh Without Blood"", which is the sweetest fuck-off of 2015, one that highlights that there is much more to Boucher's voice than Visions ever had a chance to reveal. The song is Boucher eating the lunch that Miley packed, may it be #blessed with infinite stadium-EDM remixes. Post-Art Angels, it's hard to imagine anyone will reject a Boucher-penned cut: This is an album, but it's also a resume, and someone who made ""California"" could certainly be making crossover hits for any marquee Nashville name, while ""Easily"" suggests that Kesha co-writes should be in Boucher's future. The late-night closers and their arrangements are where Boucher shows her mastery and discipline as a producer. ""Realiti"", ""Venus Fly"" with Janelle Monáe, and ""Butterfly"" give her a new set of peers: Sure, she's there with collaborator Monáe and Annie Clark as an auteur, but purely as a pop producer she's as deft and clever as anyone we consider a master of Top 40 craft—be it Greg Kurstin or Diplo. The songs are graced with small details: curious skeets of beats, buried samples that only appear once, toxically cute '90s pop guitar. The songs build in unexpected ways, but explode and gratify in the way we hope pop always will. ""Butterfly"" is a let-tonight-last-forever mutant bruiser with roiling sub-bass, the chorus's side-chained pulse making it like an uncanny valley version of Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". All of this might seem as if Boucher has fashioned a whole-cloth reinvention and is gunning for the Top 40, but neither of these things feel true. Art Angels is a natural progression from Visions; if you strained out some of the processing and murk of the latter, you would find these structures lurking. Boucher's voice is recognizable and familiar, but it's bigger and has more range and depth than on ""Oblivion"". This album foregrounds her, samples her, piles tracks of her half a dozen high to form melodies and countermelodies. One of the most notable and striking differences between Art Angels and its Top 40 kin is that these are not love songs. The album is an epic holiday buffet of tendentious feminist fuck-off, with second helpings for anonymous commenters and music industry blood-suckers. Her conflicted, vertiginous relationship with the fast fame that followed Visions seems to have led her to a place of DGAF liberation. Some songs, like ""Kill V. Maim"", course with a thrilling rage, even a casual misandry. (""I'm only a man/ I do what I can,"" she sings on the hook). Yet, what's most exciting within Art Angels is the sheer will and fearlessness of Boucher's fight to be heard and seen on her own terms. She's not a human Tumblr, as we called her (somewhat humiliatingly) in 2012; she's a human zeitgeist, redrawing all the binaries and boundaries by which we define pop music and forcing us to come along.","Art Angels is Claire Boucher's fourth record as Grimes and her most audacious yet: a gilded coffin nail to outmoded arguments that women in pop are mere frames for male producers' talents.

Vertigo,The Necks,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15013d197565213a5dc/1:1/w_160/7c9201d7.jpg,2015-11-09 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21133-vertigo/,ReRNorthern SpyFish of Milk,"The Necks have developed a near-mythic status. For a quarter century, they've been building hour-long piano/drums/bass pieces that overflow with the tension of contrasts—beauty versus bedlam, melody versus discord, momentum versus inertia. Live, the Sydney trio do it off the cuff, shaping tiny themes with familiar tools into improvised monoliths. Though the Necks draft more concrete plans for their records, they wield that same sense of wonder when they’re composing. At their best, the group’s albums sound meticulous but feel extemporaneous, like synchronized exhalations from a group whose chemistry suggests rock'n'roll’s best songwriting tandems. Made by just three musicians of ostensibly modest avant-garde-scene means, the Necks’ sets and records possess the same gripping power as a sitcom or documentary that might have cost millions of dollars and dozens of people to craft. The largely acoustic answer to New Zealand’s electric the Dead C, the Necks make miracles of efficiency and magnetism. Vertigo is the Necks’ 18th album and second for the New York label Northern Spy, the group’s first stable American home. Like many of its predecessors, Vertigo runs as one uninterrupted track, with 44 minutes roughly split between two interwoven movements. It does, however, break from the past by increasing the role of roaring electric guitar (played by drummer Tony Buck) and wafting-and-hiccupping synthesizers and electronic accessories (played by pianist Chris Abrahams). These additions largely shape a drone that fluctuates throughout the album and serves as a springboard for the group’s convulsive repartee. The exact nature of the sustained tone changes: Vertigo begins, for instance, with the growl of Lloyd Swanton’s bowed bass and dense sheets of piano runs. Near the halfway point, though, it’s a high-pitched synthesizer purr, countered by a Wurlitzer organ whose every chord dissipates into space. Swanton emerges from the impasse with steady, resonant bass sweeps, briefly conjuring the spirit of Tony Conrad’s microtonal masterpieces. And just before track’s end, an organ, bass, and Buck’s scraped drums cohere into a gigantic sigh, so slow and resonant it suggests plate tectonics. But these interlocking phases are only the undercarriage of Vertigo, the framework upon which the Necks’ usual, brilliant instrumental interplay moves. When Abrahams inlays beautifully ascending melodies inside Buck’s percussive din early on, the effect is magical. And when Buck divides Swanton’s long, bagpipe-like tones with a stuttering, trip-hop rhythm, you listen in anticipation, trying to foretell what might happen next, only to be surprised by the Naked City-style ruptures Buck soon bangs out. This is the Necks at their finest, playing group games of chutes and ladders and delighting in their instrumental ideas like they’re dancing. But Vertigo does stumble slightly through its rather obvious series of arcs: An opening swell cedes to a comedown that sends the members out into space, only to reconvene a quarter-hour later. This back-and-forth motion defines much of Vertigo and, by record’s end, it gets a bit tedious. And, in part because of the underpinning drone around which the trio works, the Necks are busier and more restless here than in the past, sometimes moving as if trapped inside a pinball machine. The Necks typically make elliptical music, where restraint and suggestion power tension and momentum. Their last album, 2013’s Open, epitomized that. Vertigo, on the other hand, could do more with less—of, say, the tawdry horror-show electronics so prominent near the 12-minute mark or the shock-and-awe noise that populates the back half. The concept of working over and alongside a drone congests the Necks’ customary grace. The Necks have always confounded easy taxonomy. Their piano-trio semblance has often shoehorned them into jazz circles, though their pronounced lack of swing and structure has infamously confounded critics in those circles. And though there seems to be a natural spot for the Necks in experimental spaces, their presentation—three middle-aged men playing expensive acoustic instruments, often in esteemed concert halls—can make them a strange fit for the underground crowd. Their love of extended pieces and clattering crescendos even suggests a place in post-rock, though their music is often too incidental and illusory for the templates that term implies. With its part-time, eerie John Carpenter glow and sudden noise-rock spasms, Vertigo only renders the Necks as more vexing and unidentifiable. Though the Necks occasionally slip into predictability across this session, Vertigo epitomizes their career-long unpredictability, or their ability to start at one point and arrive somewhere entirely unexpected. Vertigo is a minor Necks record, destined to stand forever in the shadow of the 2013 opus Open. But, after a quarter century, the trio’s explorations still sound as ecstatic as they do limitless. That, at least, is another minor miracle.","For a quarter-century, the Necks have developed a near-mythic status for building hour-long piano/drums/bass pieces that overflow with the tension of contrasts.

And while it's the lynchpin of fellow UK producer Paul Woolford's work under the alias Special Request, it never sounds like an exercise in revisiting those old sounds. Perhaps Woolford's sensibilities come from approaching 40 and experiencing British rave culture firsthand. As he put it in an old interview, Woolford instead seeks to revel in ""a false memory"" in broadcasting tracks over an FM channel and then sampling the results as if it's his very own pirate radio station. Being coy, playful, or evocative doesn't much factor into the nine tracks gathered up as Modern Warfare EPs 1-3. Much like fellow labelmate Zomby, Woolford released these EPs simultaneously on the XL Recordings imprint this week. And while both Zomby and Woolford posit them as ""DJ tools,"" meaning they're for smashing dancefloors rather than home listening, the latter's end results are far more invigorating. One wouldn't soon mistake his rave/breakbeat/pirate radio-infused tracks for mawkishness, as he keeps the edges rough, the drive relentless, and the breaks concussive. Truth in advertising, Modern Warfare is a dancefloor weapon. Putting the title track first feels slightly off, only in the sense that slowing down frantic breakbeats to house tempos doesn't do much for the relatively brief track. ""Amnesia"" treads a similar path, the snares feeling sluggish at 126 BPM. And when Woolford peels away the bass wobbles until it's just a piano line and a female voice bloodlessly saying ""Come together/ We'll make it work,"" it smacks of the sort of soulless vocal house currently filling up innumerable Mixcloud and YouTube playlists. But after those early missteps, Woolford finally locks in on ""Reset It"". Even with its faux pirate DJ shout-out and hokey backspin effects, the track transcends with a heady mix of adrenaline and ecstasy. The spare-but-brutal ""Damage"" builds from a nasty hi-hat pattern and soulful plea, each increasing in urgency and dub effects, suggesting a rubble-strewn landscape. Highlight ""Take Me"" finally approaches the velocity of old-school breakbeat but with a techno twist. These are peak-hour tracks meant for elevating a packed club to the next level and it almost feels like a crime to review them on an office stereo. Despite the ambient opening, ""Peak Dub"" repurposes the ""Amen break"" for the millionth time with little to distinguish it, though that break fares far better in the context of ""Tractor Beam"", finding more snares and woozy noises to helix around it. While not the same immersive album listen as Woolford's Soul Music album from two years back, Modern Warfare's incredibly high peaks double as incendiary bombs and guilty pleasures.","Paul Woolford's work under the alias Special Request harks back to UK '90s pirate radio and early rave culture.

Basement Hysteria,PC Worship,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b160b1335d7bf169a287/1:1/w_160/9043bafb.png,2015-11-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21142-basement-hysteria/,Northern Spy,"The cover of PC Worship’s Basement Hysteria features concentric circles. They appear to be in motion, rippled by an unseen hand. The imagery evokes Peter Saville’s iconic cover for Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures, another picture of linear stability disrupted. For the New York ensemble PC Worship—led by Justin Frye, who’s credited with the cover art—the uncannily destabilized image aptly introduces a full-length fixated on repetition, but with none of its usual comforting familiarity. Instead, Basement Hysteria restates riffs until listeners reach a dissociative threshold, a kind of aural vertigo. If that sounds something like a tenet of minimalist composition, it’s no coincidence. The members of PC Worship seem like self-taught students of 20th-century avant-garde. The shifting lineup, which Frye has helmed since the late 2000s, incorporates circuit bending, tape manipulation, harsh noise, and field recordings. Their songs do not sound intended for replication. There’s too much improvisation, especially in the braying brass caterwaul, and the home recordings welcome environmental intrusions. And yet, last year’s Social Rust indicated a subtle departure. Still saturated with queasy dissonance, its songs hewed closer to conventional lengths and structures. PC Worship’s latest, however, makes no such concessions. Basement Hysteria features four songs at over a half hour. The ostensible single, in so far as it was posted ahead of the release date, exceeds 13 minutes. Vital signs like that register less like an album or an EP and more like a statement: If Social Rust flirted with the common indie rock narrative about experimentalism capitulating to accessibility then Basement Hysteria is a harsh rebuff. It’s bristly, difficult, and unaccommodating. Here, rock'n'roll is a pirated vessel, steered unhurriedly toward doom. Indeed, Basement Hysteria begins with a song called ""Done"". It’s easy to mistake the horns for a wailing baby. Some pundit babbles on a muddled radio or television. Piano—a detuned, unenthused clang—serves as the dreary pulse of this urban soundscape, but the rest of the album takes place underground. ""Where am I/ Where am I/ I’m in my head when I should be outside,"" Frye groans later in the song, his delivery by that time a weary echo of the sluggish drumbeat. The title track, perhaps the only rudderless inclusion, sounds like little more than one-handed drumming and tuning peg abuse. On ""Social Fiction"", however, PC Worship compellingly recalls tour-mates Naomi Punk; both bands know the value of a slow, syncopated pummel. Only, Frye’s group textures leaden might with total scree. The tracks conclude unceremoniously, with a coughing fit, or protracted instrumental decay. Resolution is for pop, or songs intended for an audience; part of *Basement Hysteria’*s appeal is an illusion: listeners are among the privileged few who get invited deep down below. And it’s convincing. A centerpiece of sorts, ""My Lens"" is a procession of seemingly discrete sections. High tones wail siren-like before a morose, spare passage of acoustic guitar and murmured poetics. It best conveys the simmering mania of Basement Hysteria, where obsession induces befuddlement and simple things grow unnatural features under prolonged examination.","The New York noise ensemble PC Worship's Basement Hysteria is fixated on repetition, but with none of its usual comforting familiarity. The album is bristly, difficult, and unaccommodating. On it, rock'n'roll is a pirated vessel, steered unhurriedly toward doom.

Vulnicura Strings,Björk,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1f2c0084474cd0c1ec4/1:1/w_160/100105a8.jpg,2015-11-09 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21232-vulnicura-strings/,self-released,"As a remix evangelist, Björk has always celebrated the mutable quality of her work. ""To me it goes all the way back to being in the Sugarcubes and Kukl before,"" she told Britain's Independent. She described how Iceland's half-arsed indie scene was suddenly electrified by the arrival of acid house: ""Going to all those first raves, it was really obvious that there wasn't really one correct way of doing a song."" That notion reached a peak on 2011's Biophilia, where, if the mood struck, Björk could have dispatched endless revisions of the record to the corresponding app (which always sounded more like a Synecdoche, New York-style nightmare than a healthy creative impulse). At home, her audience could tinker with the music at will. Even though its predecessor was rooted in ideas around organic matter and mutation, this year's Vulnicura felt more like a living process than any of Björk's previous records. The tracklist was a linear path through the collapse of her 13-year relationship, and its devastating fallout. The liner notes dated the songs according to their distance from the emotional chasm at its center, embodied by the 10-minute ""Black Lake"". Its length reflected the difficult process of trying to articulate and move on from abstract, muddled pain, she explained, and her elongated vowels seemed to massage out that meaning. Vulnicura Strings takes the record back to the very beginning of the process, where Björk threw herself into writing complex arrangements for strings as a way of coping after the split. The addition of subtly powerful beats added to the record's sense of rupture, evoking an arrhythmic heart and blowing circuits that left darkness in their sputtering wake. Removing them should result in a rawer incarnation of Vulnicura, but this sounds more like a suturing. The original's broken-ness is gone, in its place an undisturbed tragic whole. Although some listeners may have found the electronic instrumentation distracting, *Vulnicura Strings—*a remake of the album using only strings, and jettisoning electronics—isn't necessarily an easier listen. It's more intense for the sense of space, which enhances Björk's cavernous, anguished vowels and sometimes accusatory tone. The ensemble's queasy, acidic qualities also stand out. These aren't always the original recordings, but closer mic'd takes, a subtle difference that gives the record a slightly uncanny quality, aided by the rearranged tracklist. The vast, trembling edifice of ""Atom Dance"" is stunning in isolation, while the spaces in ""Black Lake"" seem to linger even longer, with a kind of awkward tranquility. The lyrics are stripped out of ""Family"" in favor of highlighting its two piercing, frantic crescendos. A lot of these songs didn't have hooks, per se, to start with. They expanded and contracted with a kind of cosmic swarm, the percussion providing a delicate skeleton. Loose as it was, without that punctuation, Vulnicura Strings can feel a little formless. A second version of ""Black Lake"" was performed in Krakow, Poland, on the world's only viola organista, an instrument designed by Leonardo da Vinci but not built until after his death. On a technical level, it's intriguing: a friction belt vibrates individual strings, which are selected by pressing keys on a keyboard. But as a listening experience, it's a bit arduous. The instrument has a rasping, atonal quality, and the spaces in the song drone on forever without offering much. It's unlikely that Vulnicura Strings will replace anyone's original copy of the record—its existence feels more symbolic than anything else. Last week, NASA observed the supermassive black hole Markarian 335 emitting energy for the first time. ""This will help us understand how supermassive black holes power some of the brightest objects in the universe,"" said astrophysicist Dan Wilkins. For Björk to return to the disintegration of her family once again and make something new from it, however successful it is, is further proof of the life that can be found in destruction.","Vulnicura Strings is a remake of Björk's album from earlier this year that uses only strings as accompaniment, jettisoning the electronic elements. Even without the jagged beats, it isn't an easier listen.

Garden of Delete,Oneohtrix Point Never,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12cc0084474cd0c1d88/1:1/w_160/753fb3c9.jpg,2015-11-09 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21108-garden-of-delete/,Warp,"""Frameworks of taste rely on dumb and great things to exist in concert with one another,"" Daniel Lopatin wrote earlier this year in an essay about the easy-listening saxophonist Kenny G. Reflecting on his own work as Oneohtrix Point Never, he noted, ""I tolerate dumb things sometimes in a kitschy way, but mostly in a sort of zen way, wherein stuff is suspended in a myopic ooze of raw nowness that is beautiful and gross at the same time."" Ooze seeps from every pore of his new album, Garden of Delete: It is slathered all over the video for ""Sticky Drama"", and it erupts from the pustules of the adolescent humanoid alien, Ezra, who is the album's hero. The project spills over the limits of the album format, too, into rivulets of related texts—an array of videos, blogs, and Twitter accounts packed with surrealist Easter eggs that enhance the experience of the music in unusual ways. Ooze is formless, yet this album is deeply invested in questions of form. What invests music with value? Who creates hierarchical systems of taste? (I don't think it's a coincidence that the album title, abbreviated, alludes to the Supreme Being.) The way Garden of Delete makes us question the assumptions behind all of our high/low binaries is part of its brilliance. OPN's music is generally understood to exist somewhere between nostalgia and irony, its vaporwave fantasias and unlikely redemptions of '80s schlock-meisters like Chris DeBurgh suggestive of late-night trips down YouTube rabbit holes. But we're not in ""Chrome Country"" any more. Garden of Delete is unlike anything that Lopatin has done, in terms of technique, mood, or scope. It is denser than his previous albums, by several orders of magnitude. It is more varied, and it is funnier—scarier, too. So much beauty is crosscut with so much ugliness, and so much sincerity interwoven with so many deeply nested layers of kitsch, that the album carries with it a serious risk of whiplash, and that's as true on the 15th listen as on the first. The album's base notes will be familiar from his previous work; they consist of cool, frictionless pads, airy choral presets, and, especially, synthesized sounds that mimic acoustic instruments and revel in their own plasticity, like the tinny player piano of ""Sticky Drama"", or the jazz guitar noodling of ""I Bite Through It"". This time out, he ventures even deeper into the uncanny valley separating ""real"" sounds from mimetic ones. The references pile up in enormous slag heaps, and a few in particular stand out: the growls, chugging guitars, and blast beats of death metal; the flanged riffs of nu metal; and the garish synth stabs and grotesque vocal processing of contemporary commercial electronic music. Two years ago, after a bout of touring, he told Pitchfork, ""I feel like I better understand the tropes and guises of EDM now,"" and you can hear that familiarity at various points in Garden of Delete. That's not to say the album is a collection of big-room bangers. But certain techniques common on the Electric Daisy circuit have wormed their way into the music: Elastic trance riffs, vertiginous glissandi that zip upward like space elevators, and, especially, the highly processed and contoured voices of which Skrillex is so fond. Nothing in G.o.D. follows the usual Pavlovian dictates of mainstream rave: There are builds and drops, but they're always deployed in ways that throw the listener off balance. Instead of EDM's predictable roller coaster, he's constructed something more like Monument Valley's non-Euclidean architecture, where 2D and 3D spaces collapse into one another, and trapdoors open at the turn of a hidden dial. Garden of Delete is the first OPN album to come with a lyric sheet—no, really—which is nice, because the processed and distorted-to-hell ""singing"" on the album is mostly indecipherable. But even as a novelty, the lyrics sheet helps tease out the loose, extra-musical narrative developed across a range of apocrypha that orbit the album: a cryptic PDF of a crumpled sheet of paper in which Lopatin recounts, in the manner of a Joseph Conrad introduction, his encounter with a humanoid alien who gave him the USB containing the album's files; a Blogspot account for said alien (with posts dated as far back as 1994) stuffed with aesthetic theory, jokes, flyers for prog-rockers Rush, and musings on a style called ""hypergrunge""; a website for the (invented) hypergrunge band Kaoss Edge; a host of (active) Twitter accounts for all these characters; and various mind-bending videos. (Various phone numbers referenced are, alas, red herrings; one is for Spotify's support line, another the Winthrop, Mass., police department.) This may all seem, from the outside, like so much masturbatory energy spillage, but dig deep enough, and they all become part of the larger work. When, in an interview, Ezra asks Lopatin what hypergrunge represents to him, Lopatin answers, ""It's nihilist/formalist. Kaoss/Edge."" You couldn't ask for a more succinct summary of his music's underlying principles. None of this would matter if the music weren't absolutely gripping—strange, moving, hilarious, sometimes pushing the limits of good taste, but always in a way that makes you want to hear more. It is more songful than anything Lopatin has done. In ""Freaky Eyes"", minimalist organs give way to high-pitched voices in the style of Jack Ü; ""Ezra"" flits between the synth arpeggios of Rustie or Hudson Mohawke, Korn's nu-metal chug, and Japanese ambient; formally, it just kind of writhes in place, neither rising nor falling. ""SDFK"" interrupts graceful bells and strings with a crushing death-metal interlude that abruptly falls silent. And if Trevor Horn ever produced Slayer, it might sound something like ""Sticky Drama"". Your favorites will probably change over time, but the apocalyptic trance of ""I Bite Through It"" is a good candidate for the album's highlight, the vantage point from which all the surrounding chaos begins to make sense. It all clicked for me one Sunday morning in the pre-dawn stillness of the city. Returning from seeing off a family member at the airport at an ungodly hour, I listened to G.o.D. on headphones for the duration of the ride back to the city center. Descending from the bus, I found myself standing in front of a Hard Rock Cafe where two enormous video screens flashed senselessly away above the sidewalk, their pixelated images moving almost in time with the album's throbbing synthesizers. As Lopatin's textures stretched and spasmed in my ears, artificial light poured out onto the empty street in ungainly bursts, like tiny droplets of the ongoing heat death of the universe. It was garish and gorgeous all at once, a vision of capitalism at its tackiest accompanied by a soundtrack at once cutting and strangely empathic, and for several minutes I just stood there, transfixed by the raw, oozing nowness of it all.","Garden of Delete is unlike anything that Daniel Lopatin has done, in terms of technique, mood, or scope. It is denser than his previous albums, by several orders of magnitude. It is more varied, and it is funnier—scarier, too.

Dealer,Foxing,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b8c0084474cd0c1e67/1:1/w_160/10ad1c08.jpg,2015-11-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21191-dealer/,Triple Crown,"The Albatross became a self-fulfilling prophecy for Foxing. While the St. Louis band's relentless touring enabled the slow-build success of their debut, the aching opening track on Dealer recounts the effect of Conor Murphy having to repeat ugly truths about himself night after night for the better part of two years: ""I am caught up in the guilt/ Making a living off of drowning."" Though Dealer is an artistic triumph and a significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor. And that's why, from its very first second, Murphy sounds drained over the prospect of doing it all over again—Dealer is not an easy listen. It sounds like it was very difficult to make, and reliving it is going to be even harder. It's in Foxing's nature to welcome a challenge. Of all the leading figures in the Fest-centered post-emo world, they made the most demanding, unique and self-assured debut. It certainly earned the genre tag—silvery guitar figures streaked and twinkled like tiny Explosions in the Sky, while Murphy's keening vocals delivered confrontational and caustic lyrics with spasmodic, burst-and-bloom dynamics. To paraphrase the slow-motion self-evisceration of ""Rory"" (think the Wrens' ""This Is Not What You Had Planned"" stretched to four minutes), he ripped his heart out while it was still beating and shoved it directly in your face. But Foxing are more interested in a renaissance than a ""revival"", and they mirror the adaptive and forward-thinking qualities of their scene, creating a new voice for familiar sentiments: There was certainly hints of Cap'n Jazz on Albatross, but also actual jazz, as well as Sufjan Stevens' baroque Americana and touches of avant-garde R&B. The Albatross darted fitfully and stretched out in all directions, while Dealer pulls all of Foxing's influences inward. Inverting his typical role of making burly post-rock bands sound delicate, producer Matt Bayles (Isis, Caspian) boosts Foxing's fragility—Dealer is constructed like an expensive timepiece where you can see every exacting movement behind a thick, glossy lacquer. Murphy's much-improved vocals negotiate the curvature of ""Weave""'s mournful melody and the band's syncopated sway—imagine what the Chicago late-'90s post-rock scene could've accomplished if they hooked up with the guys downstate in Urbana-Champaign. While there were short instrumental interludes on The Albatross, ""Winding Cloth"" is a full-on string orchestration, offering four minutes to absorb the shellshocked war reportage of ""Indica"" before segueing into the heavy-hearted poetry of ""Redwoods"". Foxing are willing to delay gratification or even deny it entirely if the song requires it, and on Dealer, it often does. When Murphy and bassist/co-songwriter Josh Coll take on universal topics like sex, religion and war, they're framed through discomforting personal experiences: ""The Magdalene"" is the most dour song about losing one's virginity since ""Sic Transit Gloria…Glory Fades"", drawing on strict Catholic upbringings that instilled what Coll described as ""the internal fear that spirits are in the room witnessing 'sin' in action"": ""Mother of God on the rosary/ Is she here with us?/ Does she want what she sees?"" The guilt carries on to the present day as Murphy becomes choked by the supposedly no-strings hook-ups in ""Night Channels"" and ""Glass Coughs"". Both build up from spare, plaintive introductions to restrained screams and contained, brassy cacophony—Murphy allows you to feel every pang and writhe of guilt, but catharsis is scant. There's none whatsoever on ""Indica"", which recounts Coll's time as a soldier in Afghanistan. Few, if any, indie rock bands have access to this kind of firsthand experience, but that alone isn't enough to ensure it avoids ""Rooster"" or ""Support our Troops OH!"" overstatement on either end. Aside from a brief clatter of field snares, there's little but a single, clean guitar and Murphy's voice catatonic from both PTSD and self-medication: ""Could I give back the sounds of their children's screams?/ Let go of what I've seen?"" Dealer isn't a narrative, but both his civilian and Coll's soldier could share the exhaustion of closer ""Three on a Match""—""For what we did, my love, I'm sorry...the Lord won't let me in/ I'm survived by the weight of my own sins."" The devil and God aren't raging inside of Murphy and Coll anymore—Dealer is the arduous post-war reconstruction.","Dealer is an artistic triumph for the St. Louis band Foxing. A significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor.

Late Knight Special,Kirk Knight,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14eea9e61561daa6768/1:1/w_160/34eed685.jpg,2015-11-06 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21132-late-knight-special/,CinematicPro Era,"Brooklyn rapper Kirk Knight begins his debut album Late Knight Special quite boldly, with a sample from Sun Ra's Space Is the Place sci-fi film. For Knight, Ra's otherworldly musings are irrelevant: He picks the sample because Madlib uses the same audio clip to end Madvillainy's absurdist ""Shadows of Tomorrow"". Knight's connection to the 2004 classic ends there: His narrative-driven lyrics don't resemble MF DOOM's post-modern syllabic wordplay in the slightest. But by leading with an obvious and familiar sample, he indicates to the listener where his hip-hop allegiances lie. Unlike fellow Pro Era member Joey Bada$$, Knight doesn't try to compete with his more accomplished forebears. At its best and its worst, Late Knight Special is an unassuming project. That opening track, ""Start Running"", encapsulates much of its successes and shortcomings. Knight flows smoothly and competently, but hardly any notable lines emerge, and he spends much of the song simply telling the listener that he is rapping, which doesn't work without artful twists of wordplay. It's the song's production—Knight's forte—that makes ""Start Running"" worthwhile: The light hi-hats allude to boom bap, but Knight manages to avoid copycat '90s-worship. Throughout the album, Knight shows that although he's learned from the past, he's not living in it. The more daring Knight gets with his production, the more interesting Late Knight Special becomes. When he cranks up the bass and ventures into the minor key, he gets more intense on the microphone and sharpens his focus. ""Brokeland"", for example, very much recalls Wu-Tang Clan's ""C.R.E.A.M."", complete with a send-off from Knight that ""everybody know that money is the root of all evil."" The song is also built on an obscure Italian harpsichord sample of which RZA would surely be proud. Knight's lyrics focus on concrete details: ""With the Hammer pants, I keep security cards in my sneakers."" The tales from the block—which have the potential for honesty and insight—suit Knight well. During a mid-album suite of poppier love songs (""One Knight"", ""Scorpio"", and ""Down""), Knight makes the hooks his focus. He actually has quite a knack for choruses and half-sings most of them himself. The accompanying bars, however, fail to register. As the album comes to a close with a series of deeper, more ponderous songs, the earworm hooks disappear and the beats remain relaxed, leaving Knight to hold attention with his bars. Ultimately, his Chicago guests Mick Jenkins and Noname Gypsy end up making as much, if not more, of an impression. On ""Dead Friends"", for instance, which also features Thundercat on bass, Knight meanders his way into a story about an older friend who had taken him under his wing; he later finds out secondhand that the friend died. It's a thoughtful sentiment, but lacks urgency. Noname, on the same track, jumps in with biblical, Billie Holiday, and Yeezus allusions in her first two lines. Kirk Knight's rapping career is very much nascent. Before this debut, his biggest look as a rapper was probably his guest verse on Joey's 2013 ""Amethyst Rockstar"". It's as a producer where Knight's had plenty of opportunities to excel. He's got credits on legitimately popular songs, such as Joey's ""Big Dusty"". This imbalance shows through on Late Knight Special, for better and for worse. The whole thing sounds crisp and determined, but he hasn't yet showed us why he deserves to be center stage of his own productions yet.","Kirk Knight is a member of Joey Bada$$' Pro Era crew. His debut has some of the Pro Era reference points (Madvillainy, Wu-Tang) but Knight shows that although he's learned from the past, he's not living in it.

Astral Weeks / His Band and the Street Choir,Van Morrison,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10bb1335d7bf169a1f6/1:1/w_160/a57fcc14.jpg,2015-11-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21092-astral-weeks-his-band-and-the-street-choir/,Warner Bros.Warner Bros.,"Van Morrison released Astral Weeks in November 1968, not even 18 months after cracking the Billboard Top 10 with ""Brown Eyed Girl"". Much of the ebullience of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" derives from its AM-radio friendly arrangement, a sound encouraged by Bert Berns, the head of Van's label Bang. Berns was determined to get the record on the charts because that's where the money was, so the single sounded peppier than its lyric, a disconnect Morrison later noted. An undercurrent of melancholy desire runs through ""Brown Eyed Girl""—Van pines for a moment as it's passing—and Astral Weeks brings that yearning to the forefront as it ventures into the slipstream of memories, dreams, and regret. Generalized longing—for a lover or a friend, for a certain time or place, for a younger version of yourself—is one of the defining elements of Astral Weeks, an album where spirituality, mysticism, and death intertwine on a vast expanding plane. It is youthful and old, the first flowering of expanded consciousness, one not yet tarnished by either tragedy or cynicism but impeded by an encroaching sense of mortality. Death flows through the album but doom doesn't cloud each moment. Rather, this music comes from the perspective of a young man realizing everything he has will erode, an awareness arriving while the wonder of life has yet to fade. Morrison doesn't dwell upon such sadness so much as he brushes upon them, a sensibility mirrored in his open-ended songs—compositions that largely evade traditional structure in favor of a boundless ballad, one stripped of story but following an interior emotional narrative. There's reason why both its creator and admirers so often call Astral Weeks poetry: it has its own internal language. Other singer/songwriters wound up using Astral Weeks as a primary text, either discovering their own voice in its viaducts or wallowing in its detours, but nobody has approached its soft, untethered spirituality, not even Van Morrison himself. In a way, Morrison's occasional disregard for the record helped fuel its cult, suggesting he tapped into a vein that frightened even him (this is a common thread among cult albums, where audiences choose to live eternally within a few dark months of an artist's life; see also Big Star's Third or Weezer's Pinkerton). Certainly, Astral Weeks seems to exist in a separate dimension from the rest of Van Morrison's catalog, its supple, soft-focus jazz-folk lacking the deeper R&B grooves of so many of his records, while its songs are often absent on compilations (tellingly, there's not a single song from it on the artist-endorsed 2007 compilation, Still on Top—The Greatest Hits). All of which underscores its separateness, playing into the myths that Astral Weeks is a record out of time and place. But even this, the most mystical album in the classic rock canon, has prosaic beginnings. Although it gives the illusion that it was written as a piece, several of its songs were composed years earlier (""Ballerina"" dates from 1966, when Them recorded a prescient version of Dylan's ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue""), with Morrison recording two of the songs—""Beside You"" and ""Madame George""—for Bang Records during a day-long 1967 session designed to deliver all 36 songs he owed the label. This patchwork assemblage wasn't an accident. Part of the condition for Morrison's departure from the imprint dictated that he record two Bang-era songs for his Warner debut and, if Morrison released a single in 1968, half of the copyright would belong to Berns' publishing company. Morrison had radio-friendly material at the ready—""Domino"", the lead single from the subsequent His Band and the Street Choir, was kicking around in '68—but he deliberately saved these songs for a later date, choosing contemplative compositions that were frankly uncommercial. Critics and Morrison himself would occasionally lament the album's lack of promotion but that underselling seems a deliberate tactic: there were no singles by design and both the artist and Warner would benefit financially if the hits arrived somewhere down the road. Hence, Astral Weeks is a bit of conventional artist building by Warner, a label known for being artist-friendly. Where Bang sought to shoehorn Morrison into the confines of AM radio, Warner's Mo Ostin and Joe Smith indulged their new signing, teaming him with producer Lewis Merenstein, who recruited a band of jazz players led by bassist Richard Davis, a veteran of out sessions by Andrew Hill (he played on every one of the pianist's pivotal mid-'60s Blue Note titles) and Eric Dolphy, but also straighter sessions by Brother Jack McDuff and Lou Donaldson. Modern Jazz Quartet drummer Connie Kay came next, along with guitarist Jay Berliner and vibraphonist/percussionist Warren Smith Jr., both veterans of sessions with Charles Mingus, and the group simply followed the lead of Morrison, who was playing the songs while sequestered in his separate booth. Three days—just two longer than the Bang copyright dump—was all that was needed to finish the record, with four songs completed the first day of the session. Morrison later told NPR in 2009 ""That was that performance on those days"" and, in a way, that's all that needs to be said about the record: it is musicians, previously unknown to each other, discovering a shared vernacular, stumbling upon something transcendent that no party attempted to conjure again. Astral Weeks is defined by Morrison's transient collaborations, not only between the musicians in the studio but producer Merenstein. So distinct is its atmosphere, it's easy to assume this is the work of a lone auteur who crafted the compositions and arrangements, but Merenstein is the one who sequenced the album, imposing the designations ""In the Beginning"" and ""Afterwards"" to the two sides, thereby strengthening the illusion that this is a song cycle. He's also the one who directed the orchestrations and chose to clip ""Slim Slow Slider"" so the album shudders to a halt, the dream coming to a conclusion with a start. The long-rumored complete version of ""Slim Slow Slider"" is one of four bonus tracks added to Warner's new remastered and expanded reissue of Astral Weeks; the other three include a longer version of ""Ballerina"" and alternate takes on ""Beside You"" and ""Madame George"", the latter with no orchestration and heavy vibes, offering a muted variation on the original. ""Slim Slow Slider"" does feel different in its lengthier incarnation, where it now glides to a gentler conclusion with Morrison trading lines with John Payne's saxophone, an effect that lends a slightly hopeful edge to an otherwise harrowing song. Perhaps this is closer to the author's intent—when Morrison performed Astral Weeks live at the Hollywood Bowl in 2009 he inserted the song in the middle of the set, softening its impact—or perhaps not; as Van says, either album is nothing more than a snapshot of a moment, the way those songs were performed on that day by that singer. This essential ephemera means this longer version of ""Slim Slow Slider"", along with its companion alternate takes, are mere grace notes to an album that ultimately can not be illuminated, only experienced. His Band and the Street Choir, the other Van Morrison album receiving an expanded treatment in this inaugural series of deluxe reissues, stands as something of a counter to the heady Astral Weeks: it is all about the rough and tumble joy of living. Delivered almost immediately after the breakthrough of Moondance—that record came out in January 1970, His Band arrived in November of that year—His Band and the Street Choir is the first of Morrison's albums where the production is credited entirely to the man himself. He elbowed Merenstein aside during the recording of Moondance when the producer sought to bring in the Astral Weeks band for a second round—the veteran retained an executive producer credit—and Morrison labored over that album, recording for three months and work-shopping material in the studio. **His Band and the Street Choir bore a similarly lengthy creative process but the album gives an illusion of buoyant immediacy thanks in no small part to its heavy R&B kick. Where Moondance traded in jazz—even its liveliest moment was named after a Duke Ellington song—His Band and the Street Choir relied on soul and gospel, using folk almost as an accent. ""I'll Be Your Lover, Too"" and ""Virgo Clowns"" almost offer respites from the raucous rhythms of ""Domino"", ""Blue Money"", and ""Call Me Up in Dreamland"", songs that sound joyous no matter what their topic (and, in the case of the two singles, they're likely about separation and nude modeling, not exactly rousing topics). When Morrison claimed Astral Weeks sounded ""samey"" in latter-day interviews, he had a point: it was variations on a theme, whereas His Band and the Street Choir shoehorns celebration, sweet melancholy, and reflection into 12 songs. Perhaps this doesn't make for a spiritually transcendent record but it is an album of sustenance, providing sustained pleasures for times of joy and sorrow.","Two of Van Morrison's essential early albums have been given deluxe reissues, with unreleased takes and alternate versions. Astral Weeks remains a singular item in his catalog, and indeed in pop music as a whole. His Band and the Street Choir stands as something of a counter, a record all about the rough and tumble joy of living.

Slime Season 2,Young Thug,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b21ec0084474cd0c1f01/1:1/w_160/48d167b4.png,2015-11-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21262-slime-season-2/,self-released,"Slime Season 2 is Young Thug’s third full-length release in seven months, rounding out a productive streak as formidable as any of his peers'. We already knew he was rap’s most wildly creative stylist: a rogue alchemist of undiscovered melodies, an electrostatic bonding agent for new metaphors. Still, until now, it remained unclear whether he could broaden the scope of his talents beyond a song-by-song basis, channeling the constant spray of ideas into something built to last. Slime Season 2 edges further in that direction, a more carefully constructed work than its predecessor in every sense. And in small but significant bursts, it’s the first of his releases to begin to flesh out a real idea of Jeffrey Williams beyond the blinding veneer of experimentation. This is the sound of 2015’s most dazzling bar-for-bar rapper hitting his stride. It’s a noticeable improvement over September’s Slime Season, but not because Thug’s rapping is evolving at that speed. Both projects are culled from archives of work presumably stretching back at least a year; there is almost no hint of chronology among these tracks. But where SS1 felt rambling and uneven, there is a clear sense of purpose to SS2, applying the cohesion of Barter 6 to SS1’s pop promise. His engineer Alex Tumay executive produced the project, and Thug benefits greatly from an editor: SS2 is nearly an hour and a half long, but it flows. The mood is woozy and nocturnal, Thug’s adlibs serving as his own echo in some damp subterranean cave. The production roster ranges from Atlanta’s most wanted (Metro Boomin, Southside, London On Da Track) to lesser-known collaborator Goose and—out of nowhere—Fool’s Gold blogwave holdover Treasure Fingers, but all of their contributions blend into the tape’s murky cool. Thug's lyrics are studded with the glorious non sequiturs you expect: baffling asteroids of one-liners, orbiting in isolation, that either mean nothing or hint at vast cosmological secrets. (""I look good as your dad on a Friday,"" from ""Thief in the Night"", is probably the former; ""A wise man told me nothing,"" from tape standout ""Raw (Might Just)"", is unquestionably the latter.) But SS2’s most exciting developments are the rare moments Thug lowers his guard and focuses inward—something that’s only happened in glimpses until now. He darts between flashes of nostalgia, frank meditations on faithfulness and jealousy, nuggets of formative family history: ""My nephew saw his daddy sent out home to the sky,"" he recalls on the queasy, wobbling ""Beast"". But the moment that’s burned into my skull comes in the first verse of ""Never Made Love"", a Rich Homie Quan duet left over from the Rich Gang era. Quan brings pathos to the hook and gets out of the way: The song's main attraction is Thug’s sincere and complicated grappling with defensive detachment that taps into a well of long-buried family trauma. With it comes perhaps the most vulnerable and mystically cogent mini-narrative of his entire catalog, one I can’t help but quote in full: ""My lookout man was my right-hand man, but he was wrong, though/ Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor’s porch/ And it was her/ She had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent/ She had the same exact face as my brother’s nurse/ And he in a hearse/ I never looked at it for what it’s worth."" It’s pure poetry. Critics have called Thug’s music surrealist, but SS2 presents him instead as a storyteller in the magical realist tradition, drawing glimmers of nonplussed fascination out of the rational world. Within this context, his habit for working in small-scale, occasionally disjointed bursts, recording each line spontaneously, makes perfect sense. His thoughts fracture and wander down unpredictable paths, forcing us to draw connections in non-linear ways. At its core, magical realism suggests that the ultimate mystery in a logical world is man himself; its soft mysticism is a roundabout path to the heart. Above even the muddy, waterlogged sonics, the unifying thread here is intimacy. SS2 has Thug more transparent on love, trust, and heartbreak than ever before: ""She Notice"" and ""Hey, I"" stand out above the rest, unguarded and earnest and complicated as ever. He cheats, he stumbles, and then he attempts to deconstruct his own behavior, tracing the tangled roots of how 2015 rap’s greatest enigma came to be. Nearing the end of a landmark year, we still talk about Thug as a mystery: as transcending language, or as the ultimate triumph of style over substance. But the last thing we hear on SS2, closing out a chopped and screwed version of previously leaked ballad ""Love Me Forever"", is a hopeful yelp: ""And I just wanna be loved!"" It doesn’t get clearer, or more human, than that.","Slime Season 2 is Young Thug’s third full-length release in seven months. And in small but significant bursts, it’s the first of his releases to begin to flesh out a real idea of Jeffrey Williams beyond the blinding veneer of experimentation. This is the sound of 2015’s most dazzling bar-for-bar rapper hitting his stride.

AMY: The Original Soundtrack,Amy Winehouse,by: Jia Tolentino,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d513d197565213a692/1:1/w_160/737377d3.jpg,2015-11-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21214-amy-the-original-soundtrack/,Island,"There are several ways one might construct a soundtrack for AMY, the compassionate and horrifying Amy Winehouse documentary chronicling her brief, doomed arc through superstardom. The obvious choice would be to make the soundtrack 100% Amy, whether through covers (the tactic of the soundtrack for the Nina Simone documentary What Happened, Miss Simone?) or through Winehouse's own voice. But in the AMY: The Original Soundtrack, Amy Winehouse is actually outnumbered: her 11 B-sides are broken up evenly by 11 snippets of film score, with the balance tipped by one exceedingly unnecessary trip-hop track, originally released in 1995. This is not for lack of material. Winehouse began her public singing career at age 16 with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, performing and recording regularly for the next decade until her death. She's already had one posthumous compilation album (2011's poorly named, respectability-minded Lioness: Hidden Treasures), but if the tracks available on YouTube are any indication—let alone the unreleased professional recordings that her still-active fanbase lists and obsesses over on message boards—there are plenty of demos, live versions, and discarded mixes left. AMY: The Original Soundtrack, however, contains only one true ""new"" recording. ""We're Still Friends"", performed live at the Union Chapel in 2006, shows Winehouse on the cusp between her peak and downfall; the recording is precise and elegant, and she wears her strung-out voice like a crown. The rest of the soundtrack is a mix of album cuts and live recordings, compiled primarily as signposts for the documentary's plot. There is no raw audio on the soundtrack whatsoever; it's much glossier than the film itself, which heavily relies on rough footage and successfully illuminates Winehouse outside her press narrative as a result. In AMY, it's arresting to watch her so unguarded, putting her makeup on in a bar bathroom before a gig, giving a tour of her apartment in character as a haughty maid. Her talent flames into incandescence and out of it; her flesh shrinks into bone. She's frequently captured singing in the film, from ""Happy Birthday"" at a friend's house to that gruesome final show in Belgrade, where she was essentially walking dead. The collage is forceful, and in context you barely notice that the film is scored at all. The soundtrack, then, serves as your reminder. Antonio Pinto, who wrote the music for both City of God and City of Men, even has the opening track. It's a minimal, mournful minute of piano. ""This is sad, remember,"" the song says. ""What's about to happen is very, very solemn."" But could there be anything that requires saying less? Presumably, the instrumental interludes are meant to give her tragic arc some breathing room, like asterisks that break up a story. But one of the best things about the AMY documentary is that its pacing feels so natural—invisibly punishing, just like life. The effect of this soundtrack is exactly the opposite. The power of her voice is undercut by the regular intrusion of the film score, which doesn't reference her musically in palette or instrumentation. As a result, the album feels like a powerful hand clasping a limp one. Winehouse had an essential personal relentlessness, which her audience reflected back at her, and the soundtrack to a movie that climaxes at her death has no right to hide or diminish that. Everyone already knew that Winehouse was a genius vocalist. To its credit, this collection highlights her sardonic writing, choosing songs where she translated her life cuttingly, always with a twist. She was happy to project her true self outward just enough to disguise it as a persona; she was stuck on the same themes of self-aggrandizement and self-diminishment, and she was almost supernaturally ahead of the story. As her pianist says in the documentary, she ""needed music like a person, and would die for it""—and she was ready to, and did. ""Rehab"" was a distraction by way of being right on the nose; her many admissions (""It's not just my pride, it's just 'til these tears have dried"") made us complicit. Back to Black uses depression as a euphemism for heroin in the title. Even ""Tears Dry on Their Own"", her black-swan sequel to ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", contains a withdrawal metaphor. The latter is reproduced in its original album version on AMY, which is fine, because what does a rarity mean in the age of YouTube, anyway? What could be new, in this context, when the star in question was hounded to death by demons so public we all saw her crack pipe and paparazzi so relentless that they slept outside her house? This soundtrack album doesn't even seem aware of those questions, and like any album bearing Amy Winehouse's name from 2011 onwards, it's a diminishment—this time severe.","AMY was a compassionate and horrifying Amy Winehouse documentary chronicling her brief, doomed arc through superstardom. The soundtrack is a mix of album cuts and live material, and it fails to capture the frightening intensity that Winehouse projected or to tell a new version of her story.

Sprained Ankle,Julien Baker,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b21d13d197565213a6ff/1:1/w_160/aa57068e.jpg,2015-11-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21260-sprained-ankle/,6131,"If Julien Baker wasn't cracking something close to a smile on the cover of Sprained Ankle, I wouldn't be certain that it was meant for public consumption. Much of the album was written in isolation—after Baker left Memphis for Middle Tennessee State University, she worked on these songs in a soundproof booth within the campus music building. It was recorded in Richmond's Spacebomb Studios, a destination du jour that birthed lusciously orchestrated countrypolitan records from Matthew E. White and Natalie Prass this year, but these one-mic and one-take songs could have easily been tracked in an MTSU bathroom. Listening to it can occasionally feel like a violation of her privacy. This voyeuristic appeal plays a minor role in distinguishing Sprained Ankle, though. More important is how Baker operates in existential ultimatums—life or death, hope or despair, oblivion or epiphany. It cuts through the bullshit rather than piling onto it, and its clarity and honesty has instantly helped Baker reach across aisles. She recently opened for Touché Amoré, a post-hardcore band of blazing intensity and extreme devotees that was previously on 6131 Records and more indicative of the music on Baker's label. By the end of November, she'll be joining the tasteful-indie double bill of EL VY and Wye Oak. Sprained Ankle is a solo, singer-songwriter album, but very little of it would be considered ""folky."" She professes David Bazan, mewithoutYou's Aaron Weiss, and Ben Gibbard as idols, but her guitar playing bears more of their influence than their vocals. She's a minimalist, playing bassy clusters of melodic thirds, flicking silvery harmonics, palm-muting chords. It's gorgeously recorded and yet, there's still the suggestion that these might've been demos—the scant overdubs of drums or harmonized vocals just drive home how lonely Baker is, that she may have meant these to eventually be full-band arrangements one day. There are traces of other current acts in her sound—the album title is inspired by a lyric (""Sprinter learning to wait/ Marathon runner, my ankles are sprained"") that instantly brings up the similarly ecclesiastical bloodletting of fellow Tennessean Torres, while her thick, close-harmonizing recalls Sharon Van Etten.  But considering her formative listening experiences and punk roots, by the time she reaches the high notes over an aggressively strummed, stock descending chord pattern in ""Everybody Does"", her most apt comparison might be Dashboard Confessional. Before Chris Carrabba became a caricature of himself and an avatar for emo-as-a-Halloween-costume, there really wasn't much else like him for the hardcore kids. Baker has the same kind of magnetism to get lines like, ""I am so good at hurting myself"", sung by a crowd of young acolytes. Baker's metaphors can also be similarly excessive and clunky at times (""I know I am a pile of filthy wreckage you will wish you never touched""). Obviously, these songs are about resilience, but Baker acknowledges her willingness to wallow in despair. ""Good News"" plays on the double meaning of hysterical: ""It's not easy when what you think of me is so important/ And I know it shouldn't be so important...I'm only screaming at myself in public/ I know I shouldn't act this way in public."" Later, she asks to be swallowed and smothered by the parking lot as you drive away, an echo of Morrissey's operatic curtain call during the 190-proof melodrama of ""I Know It's Over"". And like Moz, Baker isn't without a sense of humor about herself. ""Wish I could write songs about anything other than death"" isn't the sort of thing you say unless you're self-aware. But it is important for people to see someone struggle through some serious shit to get to that point, and if you prefer redemption songs to sound as raw as they feel, Sprained Ankle could bring you to your knees.","Sprained Ankle is a solo, singer-songwriter album, but very little of it would be considered ""folky.""

Amor Supremo,Carla Morrison,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ffb1335d7bf169a383/1:1/w_160/3ec93d98.png,2015-11-05 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21243-amor-supremo/,Cosmica,"A towering standout on Carla Morrison’s new album, *Amor Supremo, ""*No Vuelvo Jamás"" is a pining anthem that opens with the Mexican singer-songwriter delivering a cascade of wordless syllables that sound less like a human voice than a wind instrument. Her overture is punctuated by an emphatic drumbeat and ominous piano chords, then an electric guitar crashes down around her. Yet, she remains unfazed by the commotion, as she half-whispers lyrics about losing herself in lovelorn madness (""locura desmedida"") and succumbing to a yearning that hurt worse (""más dolor"") than physical wounds. Morrison’s voice wavers and twirls, suggesting a less forceful Florence Welch or a more grounded Jeff Buckley. This is pop music with a healthy sense of grandeur. The song itself is one long, careful, patient crescendo, and by the halfway point, it seems to have reached its climax. But then something unexpected happens: Rather than let the momentum subside, Morrison and her band coast on that cresting wave for several more minutes, maintaining that tension without sacrificing any nuance in her vocals or resorting to ostentatious melodrama. It’s a big moment on an album full of big moments—on an album that is, in fact, all about big moments. These wounded love songs evoke great wellings of despair and desire, amplifying and ennobling those emotions in a way that ought to be comprehensible and relatable even to those listeners who don’t speak Spanish. A native of the Baja California region of Mexico, Morrison has been a central figure in the extremely tight-knit and defiantly independent Mexican pop community for just six years, releasing a steady stream of EPs and LPs and winning two Latin Grammys for her 2012 album Déjenme Llorar. Although she has recorded with a range of Mexican artists—including the singer-songwriter Natalia LaFourcade, the Monterrey band Kinky, and Tijuana producer Alejandro Jiménez, better known as Jandro—Morrison may be best known to American listeners from her cameo on Calexico’s Edge of the Sun earlier this year or from the 2012 documentary Hecho en México, about the Mexican indie scene. Both showcased her distinctive vocals, but neither suggested Morrison was capable of something as impressive as Amor Supremo. In fact, nothing in her catalog sounds anything like this album. Her previous work has generally adhered to acoustic instruments and mixed new rock and pop sounds with older Mexican bolero and ballad traditions. With each subsequent release, however, Morrison has grown bolder and more adventurous, and the title of her 2013 EP—Jugando en Serio—sums up her approach perfectly. That sense of playing seriously culminates on Amor Supremo. As she explained to Billboard in September, she recorded the album over eight months in a house near the beach in Playas de Tijuana, ""where we could hear the ocean all day."" There she worked with producers Jandro and Demian Jiménez as well as a rotating group of musicians to find a new sound—one rooted in Mexico but embracing international trends and ideas. First single ""Un Beso"", released in September, heralded a dramatic change and introduced the elements that color Amor Supremo: the disembodied drums, the shimmery synths, the cathedral organ, and the stabs of Lynchian guitar. What’s remarkable is how much mileage she gets from these few instruments. They provide the foundation for every song, but there’s always a twist, always some new combination that prevents the music from becoming repetitive or tired: the Middle Eastern strings on ""Cercanía"", the prismatic synth theme on ""Mi Secreto"", the weightless rhythms of ""Tú Atacas"", even the crackle of guitar on ""Azúcar Morena"", which sounds like a fuse being lit. Even when the production becomes gauzy and blurred around the edges, it’s usually to emphasize the emotional specificity of her vocals, which are forceful but not overpowering, wounded yet strong, pleading but never whiny. Even the way she sings a simple word like ""tí"" can stop you short. Morrison commands these songs, cuts across the language barrier, makes you understand something beyond the words. And the words are important here. In shedding her old musical palette, she embraces trends and traditions that sound more international in scope, and these songs draw from a range of influences, including American soul and European pop. And yet, she continues to sing exclusively in Spanish, even when an English-language album might have more commercial potential. It’s a crucial decision, one that implies there are certain emotions and ideas—certain big moments—that are specific to Mexico and expressible only in her native language, whether it’s the particular sugar she tastes on her lover’s skin (""Azúcar Morena es tu piel"") or a personal struggle she knows she must overcome (""Esta lucha es solo contra mi""). All moments are big moments, and that epiphany makes Amor Supremo one of the most rewarding and genuinely moving pop albums of 2015.","The wounded love songs on the Mexican singer-songwriter Carla Morrison’s new album, Amor Supremo, evoke great wellings of despair and desire. Featuring a grand sound that includes disembodied drums, shimmery synths, cathedral organs, Middle Eastern strings, Lynchian guitar, and her distinctive vocals, it's one of the most genuinely moving pop records of 2015.

Delirium,Ellie Goulding,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19f5e6ef95969322164/1:1/w_160/77627082.jpg,2015-11-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21180-delirium/,InterscopeCherrytree,"Making a full-blown pop record like Delirium isn't a stretch for Ellie Goulding—she's seen booming, bright-eyed singles like ""Lights"" and ""Anything Could Happen"" become Top 20 hits, after all. Even when she was making low-key electro-pop, Goulding’s music has always played heavily with a high drama beyond reality. She’s good at selling stories, constructing big ""us against the world"" tracks for fans who want songs that play like fairy tales and battle cries like some dancefloor-ready Natasha Khan. But after flirting with indie dance, then Calvin Harris and Starsmith-produced EDM, Goulding is adding some Swedes to her arsenal for Delirium: Max Martin, Carl Falk, and Peter Svensson, to be specific. And Goulding, who went from being famous only in the UK to performing at the White House, very much deserves at this point in her career to have a third record fit with all the big pop trimmings. While Halcyon was a dark collection that flitted between club-ready synth-pop and soulful, orchestral ballads, Delirium dives head first into the former with confidence. At times, the record exists in the same '80s-pop wannabe universe as Carly Rae Jepsen’s E•MO•TION or Taylor Swift’s 1989, with gushing vocals and Moroder-kissed synths on tracks like ""Codes"" and her Fifty Shades of Grey song ""Love Me Like You Do"". Elsewhere, she inches back to her dance music roots on the sultry house-leaning ""Don’t Need Nobody"" and the marriage of a scratchy acoustic loop with techno on ""Devotion"". But while the best tracks here are the ones that transcend and build on pop trends, a few others merely copy them. ""Keep on Dancin’"" is a more minimalist sibling to Adam Lambert’s Martin-produced hit ""Ghost Town"" and while ""Something in the Way You Move"" might be a mighty fine song in a vacuum, Selena Gomez has already done it with ""Me & the Rhythm"". The bubbly, ""I’m sticking to you like glue"" doo-wop of ""Around U"" feels particularly out of place among Delirium’s darker, deeper tones, playing like a better fit for Meghan Trainor than Goulding. Still, even when the songs here evoke other hits, they’re still bangers in their own right. And Goulding’s signature vibrato and energy make even the more trend-chasing songs on the album fully hers. Her voice is fullest in the jangly ballad ""Lost and Found"", where she keeps her straightforward vocals at the forefront. ""We got other things we can do with our,"" she sings flirtatiously in the verses of ""Codes"", stopping for a beat, before drawing out ""tiiime"" into a high-pitched lilt, but she moves into a punchy, shouting sing-song for the chorus. Aside from a little well-done sass (""You were talking deep, like it was mad love to you/ You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos"") on the album’s single ""On My Mind"", there’s an adult sophistication to Delirium. Nobody’s shaking off haters, bemoaning that same old love, or asking that you don’t tell your mother that you, uh, made out with someone? Granted, Delirium is fun, but the mood is upfront, Goulding’s romantic propositions more realistic demands than adolescent, yearning questions. A track like ""Codes"" might be dressed up in sexy language but the sentiment is clear: can we please put a label on this? ""When love’s not playing out like the movies/ It doesn’t mean it’s falling apart/ Don’t panic,"" she assures on the stand-out ""Don’t Panic"", whose musical-box quality makes it sound like a polished Lights-era throwback. Delirium manages to be a cool, dramatic pop album that rarely hyperbolizes what love is all about. And might I remind you that this is the person who wrote ""Burn"". Delirium grounds Ellie Goulding’s penchant for spectacle in tightly-written pop songs. Her evocative storytelling and ability to craft great dance music is all here, but repackaged as something more emotionally tangible, ditching feel-good EDM lyrical logic for realness. And while these songs can sometimes evoke other major players in her genre, she makes Max Martin’s signatures feel personal, making a mature pop record that feels like a natural progression.","After flirting with indie dance, then Calvin Harris and Starsmith-produced EDM, singer Ellie Goulding takes a strong turn toward club-ready synth-pop.

The Things We Do to Find People Who Feel Like Us,Beach Slang,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b4c0084474cd0c1cca/1:1/w_160/02e4b4c4.jpg,2015-11-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21053-the-things-we-do-to-find-people-who-feel-like-us/,Polyvinyl,"A few stats on Beach Slang’s glorious and galvanizing debut album: in less than a half hour, it provides 10 righteous bursts of punk rock boosterism. All of them speak of being fucked up, being a fuck-up, or some combination of both. In seven of those songs, James Alex sings the word ""alive,"" in three others, he sings ""young,"" and there's one song called ""Young and Alive"". Eight mention some kind of amplification—either turning yourself or the radio up. Oh, and the title is The Things We Do to Find People Who Feel Like Us, which sums it all up: some people get drunk and unite with other weirdos to listen to rock music as loud as possible because for them there's no better way to feel young and alive. It’s the most passionate batch of love songs you’re liable to hear in 2015, and they’re all about a specifically anthemic form of punk rock. No band shows more belief in it as an agent of social change, but Beach Slang's is the apolitical kind where the right song can unshackle you from self-doubt and pity to get you out of the house and be a part of the world—go meet somebody, go to show that makes you forget about all of your very real problems. Its societal dynamics and terminology are anachronistic and a cynic could view them as willfully naive—the punks and cops are at odds throughout, but it’s mostly over noise ordinance and open container complaints. For a record bursting with love for its audience, The Things We Do to Find People Who Feel Like Us is divisive by design. If you expect or demand rock bands to create some kind of distance from their work—via irony, cleverness, a desire to look cool—you are one of them and you won’t make it to the first time Alex commands you to pump up the volume on ""Throwaways"". But if you’ve been impatiently waiting for someone to break through the year of self-conscious indie rock, ""I Break Guitars"" and ""Ride the Wild Haze"" make you feel like you're part of Alex's ""us."" The album actually delivers on the title's promise and there’s really no other band trying to fill this crucial role right now, at least until Japandroids break their silence. James Alex is 40, significantly older than the other three members of Beach Slang and about 15 years removed from his previous band’s disintegration. He doesn’t hide this fact, and it serves as the basis for The Things We Do’s centerpiece and outlier. ""Too young to die, too late to die young,"" Alex sighs with superhuman earnestness over capoed acoustic guitar (and, since this is the ballad, cue the strings and pianos). It’s a lament from a guy who didn’t live fast or gloriously burn out when he had the chance, and feels like the proverbial old guy at the club even when he’s not at the club. Shoutalong, agenda-free punk rock is aggressively pushed to the margins on all levels in 2015, written off as the kind of music people are expected to outgrow. But what if this is the thing that still does it for you? Well, then you’re one of Alex's us and your options are to either hide in your records and disengage from the stream of life or celebrate this music that saved your life by adding to it or honoring its intent. Originally appearing as a raw solo cut on a Philly-based benefit compilation, ""Too Late to Die Young"" was written after Beach Slang’s completely unexpected success and, as usual, there’s an utter lack of artifice and a confrontational vulnerability as Alex looks at the gathering crowd and realizes, ""I swear right now, I’m alright."" Thirty seconds earlier, he admits having been ready to give up and not 30 seconds later, he’s shouting, ""The basement is alive and loud/ We’re alright now"" on a song called ""I Break Guitars"". This is Alex and Beach Slang’s triumph, but he makes sure it’s big enough for all of us to share.","No band shows more belief in punk rock as an agent of social change, but Beach Slang's punk is the apolitical kind where the right song can unshackle you from self-doubt and pity to get you out of the house and be a part of the world. Their shout-along full-length debut delivers on the promise of their early EPs.

The Cutting Edge 1965-1966: The Bootleg Series Volume 12,Bob Dylan,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19d5e6ef95969322160/1:1/w_160/2647dba4.jpg,2015-11-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21178-the-cutting-edge-1965-1966-the-bootleg-series-volume-12/,ColumbiaLegacy,"After 2013's Another Self Portrait, and given the continued brilliance of Dylan's bootleg series in general, you start to get the idea that Bob Dylan has alternate versions of damn near every album in his career in the hopper. The Cutting Edge, gathering music Dylan recorded over 14 months in 1965 and 1966, for the albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde, does not dispel this notion. The set exists in several editions (2xCD highlights, ultra-limited 18xCD complete, and this set, the deluxe 6xCD edition) and could conceivably be mined to assemble two or three alternate versions of each of those three albums. Pick a random deep cut like Highway 61's ""It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry"", and it appears here in four versions, three of them complete. The five versions of Blonde on Blonde's ""Visions of Johanna"" total 33 minutes. No fewer than 20 of the tracks are given over to ""Like a Rolling Stone"", including the various rehearsals, alternate versions, false starts, and tracks highlighting the stems containing individual instruments from the master take. So The Cutting Edge is the last word on obsessive studio documentation designed for rabid superfans. But it also happens to contain an almost unbelievable amount of great music that, broken into more digestible portions, any Bob Dylan fan can appreciate. During the period covered by this compilation—the transitional, acoustic-leaning folk-rock of Bringing It All Back Home, the gnarled blues-rock of Highway 61, and the Americana fusion of Blonde on Blonde, enabled by producer Bob Johnston and his Nashville session pros—Dylan recorded in a way that has become rare in the era of unlimited tracks and non-destructive editing: He got a band of musicians in a room and recorded live. In a 1985 interview with Bill Flanagan (who also happens to contribute an essay to this set), Dylan claimed, ""I don't think I knew you could do an overdub until 1978."" That approach partially explains why this massive trove exists in the first place. With the recent Led Zeppelin reissue sets, we were left mostly with early and alternate mixes as bonuses because the masters were carefully constructed in the studio from fragments. With Bruce Springsteen's ongoing archival series, he's been liberal about recording new instruments and even vocals in the present day to fill in blanks. But Dylan's alternate versions could more accurately be called alternate performances, meaning each one is unique. And given the way he refined and re-worked songs during this period—trying them with just voice and acoustic, adding a full band, changing tempos, time signatures, and lyrics—the different versions can be sharply different in mood and effect. ""She's Your Lover Now"", a song recorded during the Blonde on Blonde sessions but not included on that album, is a good case study in what makes this set fascinating. It wasn't included because Dylan was never able to record it properly—it's a complicated song, with some unusual changes and held notes, and he and his band were never able to get through it without mistakes. Eventually Dylan grew frustrated and moved on. But it's easily one of the best songs Dylan had written to that point, meaning it's one of the best songs he's ever written period, an alternately hilarious and pained story of a guy, his ex-girlfriend, and her new boyfriend encountering each other at a party. The title refrain basically amounts to Dylan saying ""You deal with it—she's your problem now,"" and his disdain for the new guy reinforces how much it still hurts, and how he thinks this dude isn't anywhere nearly enough for her (""And you—just what do you do anyway?""). Songs this rich were coming fast and hard for Dylan during this period, and ""She's Your Lover Now"" is so powerful it's almost a shock to the system when it breaks down after six minutes, a bum note and everyone stops playing, and you are reminded that they were living inside this song and the famously oblique ""wild mercury sound"" Dylan hoped to conjure at the exact same moment. One of the main points of Greil Marcus' book on ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is that the song could have been many things, but what it was owed a lot to chance. Dylan recorded it many times but one take turned out to be the take, and the slight variations in phrasing altered how it was heard forevermore. That quality, of all the possible worlds these new versions suggest, animates the set. What if ""Like a Rolling Stone"" had been a slow waltz? What if ""Leopard-Skin-Pillbox-Hat"" was filled with goofy sound effects? What if ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" had been released in its full band version? (The recording of the latter ends hilariously when Dylan cuts it short and says ""The drumming is driving me mad! I'm going out of my brain."") Some of the differences were subtle and some weren't, but the way this music has been pored over in the years since, none are insignificant. These two years are Dylan at his wildest. He revolutionized popular music lyrics during this period, bringing in surrealism and romanticism as channeled by the Beats and making it work in a pop context. One of the things he inherited from the Beats was a belief in spontaneous writing and trying to take lyrics more as dictation. Which is not to say he didn't revise—he did, and often. But it's always been a mistake to put too much emphasis on the details of these words and what they might ""mean."" Sometimes they were selected because a turn of phrase was funny, or because Dylan couldn't think of a better rhyme, or sometimes simply because that's what came out. Later on in his writing, he'd have discipline, but this is what he sounded like when he was free. The structures of these lyrics probably owe something to Dylan's rumored drug experimentation during this period, specifically with marijuana and amphetimines. People on speed use a lot of words and cram them into spaces too small to contain them; they follow digressions and join phrases and ideas that needn't necessarily be joined; the desire to make illogical connections leads, on the one hand, to paranoia—you start to see things that aren't there. But if these tendencies can be channeled just so, they can lead to new structures. ""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken"" goes one of my favorite lines in ""Tombstone Blues"" (heard here in a complete alternate take and another partial version). Nouns and adjectives get chopped up and mixed together, the collisions of language leading to Gertrude Stein-like moments where you can feel your brain being rewired. All of which is to say that the idea of ""Dylanology"" in the classic sense of decoding these lyrics to undercover what they might ""mean""—Who is Mr. Jones? Where is ""Desolation Row"", what the hell are those jewels and binoculars doing hanging from the head of the mule???—is missing the important point: During this period, language itself was a playground for Dylan. The Cutting Edge is music of the present, but not the '60s present, an eternal present; the songs are about observation and they exist in a place where it's always now, in sound and word. The music here conjures a feeling of acceleration that couldn't continue—Dylan's songs couldn't get any knottier or more surreal. The album after this one, John Wesley Harding, released in 1968 after Dylan's mysterious motorcycle accident (The Basement Tapes were recorded in between, but not released until 1975), found him heading in the complete opposite direction, stripping everything to the bone and writing with shocking economy and clarity. If everything up until this point had a certain logic to it, the hotshot young folk singer who is growing immensely with each year turns to rock'n'roll, after 1967 Dylan would be impossible to get a handle on. He had many brilliant records ahead of him, but he started to understand the precise value of theater and artifice. Here he was too wild and moving too fast to even figure out how that might work; he was a trickster, as witnessed in his infamous press conferences, but nothing was channeled into a specific direction: It was all blasting outward, in every direction, all at once.","The Cutting Edge gathers music Dylan recorded over 14 months for the albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde. These two years are Dylan at his wildest: Later on, he'd have discipline, but this is what he sounded like when he was free.

The Source,Ted Hearne,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14dea9e61561daa6764/1:1/w_160/2273f465.jpg,2015-11-04 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21131-the-source/,New Amsterdam,"More than a few of the vicious old debates in ""new classical"" music have been settled. In 2015, a composer isn’t obliged to choose melodic minimalism over atonal complexity, or vice versa. If she wants to write something that ""addresses the times,"" there’s no set aesthetic to follow. Execution is what the community of listeners has (generally) pledged to judge. You can hear this relatively new, pan-stylistic freedom quite clearly in the music of Ted Hearne. As a political animal, he’s a liberal populist; as a composer, he’s a fan of preexisting texts and musical maximalism. His 2010 protest song-cycle Katrina Ballads set real life excerpts from an American tragedy—think of George W. Bush’s famous assessment ""Brownie you’re doing a heck of a job""—to a richly textured musical backdrop that blended jazz and classical vocal approaches with aggrieved electric guitar and frenetic chamber scoring. In 2013, Hearne provided Erykah Badu with well-judged orchestrations of songs from New Amerykah: Part One (4th World War), which Badu performed live with the Brooklyn Philharmonic. (We’re still waiting for a proper studio recording of those.) With this album, Hearne gives us a distillation of an experimental stage work about Chelsea Manning (and WikiLeaks) that was presented in 2014 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Composing once again atop found texts—including logs of Manning’s chats and leaked government documents that were selected and edited by the novelist Mark Doten—Hearne’s latest project gives us some of the composer’s most intriguing music yet. In the song ""s/as boy/as a boy"", Hearne scores one of Manning’s haunting pre-arrest concerns—""i wouldn’t mind going to prison for the rest of my life/ if it wasn’t for the possibility of having pictures of me.../ plastered all over the world press.../ as boy""—by way of a somber cello-and-guitar riff that is frequently interrupted by percussive slaps. (The discrete instrumental parts swirl together with an affecting unease, circa Manning’s line, ""I'm just kind of drifting now."") Another highlight is ""Julian in a Nutshell"", in which Doten creates lyrics from shards of questions delivered to Julian Assange by reporters. At first, Hearne pairs Doten’s documentary cut-up fragments with airy individual string and vocal lines. As the journalistic narrative is better established—demanding that Assange define himself as either a ""journalist"", an ""anarchist"", or the victim of a ""smear campaign""—the vocal lines settle into sunnier harmonies. It’s the sound of the press finding an angle, though Hearne’s subtly clattering orchestration isn’t as sold on the quality of the conversation. Inevitably, this audio-only version of The Source also omits some key aspects of the ""multimedia oratorio"", occasionally rendering an abstract production even more conceptually opaque. In director Daniel Fish’s filmed excerpts from the original staging, we can see that The Source originally included a chorus of silent observers that surrounded the audience, on video-projection screens. Looming large over the proceedings, that visual chorus adds a measure of ghostly gravity to the long chunks of leaked military cables that Hearne’s actors recite through vocal filters. These bureaucratic passages certainly deserve grimly robotic accompaniment. (Think of lyrics like: ""An IED detonation was reported by C co 1-327 INF to Task force SPARTAN, in the Salah Ad Din Province, Ad Dawr, vicinity. 38S LD 8930 1490."") But on the album version, these long stretches of war-euphemism can wear thin. Without the ability to conjure the silent witnesses on a recording, Hearne instead references the wider culture by inserting drops from pop songs. At best, these feel unnecessary. At worst, they’re distracting: Liz Phair’s ""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" isn’t contemporaneous with the WikiLeaks era, nor is its consideration of gender politics particularly relevant to Chelsea Manning’s worries about being misgendered while serving some future prison sentence. This version of The Source could have benefitted from some stronger editing, though when it connects, it can still resonate as some of the most expressive socially engaged music in recent memory—from any genre.","Did you know that one of Erykah Badu's collaborators made what could very rightly be called an opera about Chelsea Manning and WikiLeaks? Well, he did. Composer Ted Hearne's productions have tackled George W. Bush and Katrina and now the tale of Manning and what led to her 25-year prison sentence. A complex, beautiful piece of theater, Hearne has pushed to make The Source succeed as a piece of music.

Accidental Sky,White Out,by: Raymond Cummings,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1bb5e6ef9596932219b/1:1/w_160/1d60ce64.jpg,2015-11-04 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21193-accidental-sky/,Northern Spy,"Regardless of whoever is sitting in with multi-instrumentalists Lin Culbertson and Tom Surgal, the White Out modus operandi remains the same: daft, improvisatory pieces that spread like runaway kudzu or sputter like an overheated Datsun, often within a single song. The NYC-based duo have collaborated with Jim O’Rourke, Thurston Moore, and William Winant among others over the years, but Accidental Sky marks their first outing with Nels Cline, the inventive avant-garde guitarist who has been a member of Wilco since 2004. The result is the band’s most abbreviated LP-sized outing, clocking in at a 38-minute length so economical that the record seems to conclude almost before it’s even begun. Given Accidental Sky’s pointedly terrestrial vibe, this brevity proves instructive. Surgal, Culbertson, and Cline aren’t hot-wiring and joyriding across the skies in an interstellar jalopy here; they’re locked outside the hangar, desperately MacGyvering some means—any means—of ingress. By his lonesome, in combos, or with Wilco, Cline is an inventive, expressive player, but his communions with White Out tend toward the quarrelous and cerebral. Sky is at its best when it runs the risk of suffocation. ""Imperative"" opens as a hashed blues, then quickly descends into a dark brew of mini-riffs, topsy-turvy synth jags, and savage little drum rolls. Flutes flutters through ""Under a Void Moon"" besieged by clawed noise, distended guitar, and Dada-esque utterances. At moments, White Out can sound as lost in the weeds as some listeners may feel: Culbertson’s zig-zagged wails and the pair’s bells, whistles, and effects congeal into an unstable nucleus around which guests revolve, wildly. What’s most frustrating isn’t ultimately that Sky doesn’t make it beyond the stratosphere, but that some of these songs should go on longer; they need more space to stretch, breathe, expand into stranger, deeper realms. The album winds down with ""Soft Nameless Absolute"", where contemplative Cline chords are buried beneath several strains of jittery, mirroring synthesizers. There’s a generous, sunburst grandiosity to the song, which is so coherent that it seems to have wandered in from an album by a different band. Given the tendency to self-edit and considering how Cline’s guitar elbows gracefully out of the fray and ""Absolute"" drifts to a measured close all suggests that, artistically, White Out may be nearing the end of a well-trod path.","The NYC-based duo have collaborated with Jim O’Rourke, Thurston Moore, and William Winant, among others. Accidental Sky marks their first outing with Wilco's Nels Cline.

Music for Life Itself & The Interrupters,Joshua Abrams,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19b13d197565213a644/1:1/w_160/d23d6c4c.jpg,2015-11-04 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21177-music-for-life-itself-the-interrupters/,Eremite,"A well-regarded player in the Chicago jazz world, bassist and composer Joshua Abrams has spent the last several years recording expansive trance music with his band, Natural Information Society. That outfit’s records are driven by improvisation, though not necessarily in the form of individual solos. Instead, Abrams and his collaborators create hypnotic interlocking patterns, rhythms, and melodies that seem to spool forth endlessly without any single voice taking center stage. It is serene and peaceful music that relies on spontaneous invention, but also on restraint. It’s a sensibility that is carried over to Abrams’ other pursuits. In the past several years, the bassist has also established a reputation as a composer for film. Released digitally by Eremite Records, Music for Life Itself & The Interrupters collects two scores that Abrams composed for documentary filmmaker, Steve James—best known for his 1994 picture, Hoop Dreams—including the two features in the title as well as a two-minute piece written for the short, A Place Called Pluto. If you’re coming to this music having listened to Abrams’ work in Natural Information Society, one thing will be immediately noticeable: these compositions are a lot shorter. Working in the context of a film, there’s no room to sprawl and most of Abrams’ cues last barely more than a minute. It’s a very different kind of music making, but the results share certain qualities with the composer’s other outlet, mainly in that they often carefully balance ambience and melody. Released last year, Life Itself is an adaptation of film critic Roger Ebert’s memoir of the same name. Though the film includes interview footage shot during the final months of Ebert’s battle with cancer, the mood is not morose. Abrams’ score is mostly lighthearted, often taking stylistic inspiration from blues and '60s cool jazz. Much of it seems to capture spontaneous interplay. The central thread, ""Roger’s Theme"", finds a brass band trading riffs and ""Professional Enemies"" is largely a bass solo. For the film’s somber and reflective moments, Abrams’ arranges music that suggests a sense of peace—drones and light chords embellished with flourishes of trumpet and harp. This is followed by Abrams’ score for James’ 2011 film, The Interrupters, which tracks a group of anti-violence activists working with communities in Chicago. Commissioned a mere six weeks before the film's Sundance Film Festival premiere, it's the slightly less polished of the pair. However, with its focus on percussion and hip-hop rhythms, it’s probably the more enjoyable of the two to listen to outside of the context of the film. On both, Abrams’ benefits from the presence of great musicians, including drummer Hamid Drake, saxophonist Ari Brown, and guitarist Jeff Parker, who also performs in Tortoise. Watching the films, Abrams’ music is never intrusive. It enhances a scene, but never forces a mood. And while it’s probably not the first place you’d turn to experience his work, it provides an example of his stylistic reach and musical ability. Natural Information Society’s music thrives amid the extended zone-out, but listening to the music for The Interrupters, it’s surprising how malleable many of those sounds are—that, in miniature, the music can slot so naturally into somebody else’s story.","A well-regarded player in the Chicago jazz world, bassist and composer Joshua Abrams has also established a reputation as a composer for film.

II,Fuzz,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13eb1335d7bf169a24f/1:1/w_160/823c311d.jpg,2015-11-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21124-ii/,In the Red,"On an episode of ""WTF With Marc Maron"", Mikal Cronin spoke about the scene he, Ty Segall, and Charles Moothart came up in during high school. As he explained it, he would throw parties at his parents' house in Laguna Beach, and their small circle of musician friends would write songs and start bands specifically for the events. Different combinations of the same people were getting together and exploring different vibes. ""You guys still do that,"" Maron observed. And he's right. This year alone, Segall has been juggling several projects. His circle of friends and collaborators (Moothart, Meatbodies' Chad Ubovich, Wand's Cory Hanson, Thee Oh Sees' John Dwyer, and Cronin) all tend to have multiple irons in the fire. Those high school bands weren't focused on long-term sustainability; they were momentary sparks of creative energy. To this day, the best moment in the life of any new Segall project is the first spark. The introductory taste of new music from these bands offers the opportunity to parse how aesthetic and personnel differences define the music—to hear what separates it from prior work, what makes it exciting, and what the chances are that the project will outlive the confines of a 7"". Segall and Moothart's band Fuzz made a strong first impression with their debut 2012 single ""Fuzz's Fourth Dream"". It was a showcase for Moothart's guitar solo mastery, the band's stellar hook work, the effortless way they can slink into a groove, and Segall's ace drumming. With 2013's Fuzz, the proto-metal-worshipping power trio became a proven entity—a well-oiled machine with a few strong songs. The lineup now features Ubovich, and if you only take into account his impressive work as Meatbodies' frontman, it seems Fuzz have only become more powerful. Fuzz's second full-length, II, is a double album—a ballsy and potentially dangerous move for a band who operate best when their songs are kept tight. Their Fuzz track ""Loose Sutures"", for example, went a bit too loose and lost its momentum about halfway in. More than half of II's songs are over four minutes long, and the longest one of the bunch is the most disappointing of them all. The final 14-minute track, ""II"", is an obligatory instrumental sequel to Fuzz's instrumental closer ""One"". Where ""One"" ramps up the power and velocity of its central hook, ""II"" never quite figures out exactly where it's going. It changes course several times, and along the way, a question emerges—how much Fuzz is too much? It's a bum note to end on, but before they reach that final song, Fuzz knock out some undeniable high points in their discography. Ubovich's bass provides the perfect dour counterbalance to Segall's dulcet vocal on ""Let It Live"". There's a premium on heaviness, and ""Pollinate"" certainly delivers the thudding, crashing goods. And if Fuzz occasionally felt too spare, II is where they throw everything at the wall. All three men play synthesizers, and in a few well-placed moments, they've got string arrangements courtesy of Laena Geronimo. They often change pace—tempo, emphasis, texture—at the moment a song begins to feel stale. It also helps that they're the rare band where any of the three members could serve as the frontman. While Segall's voice is undeniably the most impressive, Moothart and Ubovich come across more gritty and grounded—perfect for songs about ""teeth twisting in the heatwave."" It's also refreshing to hear Fuzz bucking their former formula—their ""lead singers take turns"" approach goes out the window on ""Burning Wreath"", which features Segall and Moothart trading lines and briefly harmonizing. It's a small moment, but one that hints at how much this band are capable of when you consider how much talent they have between them. That's why it's disappointing when, around the album's third side, Fuzz's songs begin to feel anonymous—like they're retreading ground they'd already covered earlier in the album. Segall, Moothart, and Ubovich have done an impressive job of nailing this sound, and somewhere in the stoner rock sprawl, they have enough impressive moments and great songs for a truly strong album that's about half as long. They just don't do quite enough to differentiate their approach or justify the album's 67-minute run-time. There are definitely instances of them changing things up—""Red Flag"" is a two-minute punk song on an album that benefits from brief interstitials. Even considering all the high points and raw power, II falters under the weight of the band's ambition.","Fuzz is the proto-metal-worshipping power trio of Ty Segall, Charles Moothart, and Meatbodies' Chad Ubovich.

Loaded: Re-Loaded 45th Anniversary Edition,The Velvet Underground,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1dcea9e61561daa6831/1:1/w_160/65a50eb4.jpg,2015-11-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21220-loaded-re-loaded-45th-anniversary-edition/,AtlanticAtlantic,"Loaded is a perfect rock'n'roll record: 40 minutes long, five songs to a side, and not a single wasted note. Originally released in 1970, the Velvet Underground’s fourth album marked the moment where Lou Reed’s early gig as a Pickwick Records song doctor ceased to be an amusing footnote to the band’s story and became their governing principle. Loaded is the sort of proper album that feels like a greatest hits collection, with each track thoroughly inhabiting and mastering a dominant rock archetype: the hippy-dippy, harmony-rich singalong; the sneering, street walkin’ prowler; the cheeky honky-tonk throwback; the wedding slow-dance standard; the dirty blues grind; the lighter-waving, anthemic grand finale. Loaded remains the one Velvets album you can put on at a house party among mixed company without killing the vibe or sending people running for the door, and it contains the only song in their repertoire—""Sweet Jane""—that you have any hope of hearing on an oldies station today. But being a perfect rock'n'roll album is a very different thing than being a perfect Velvet Underground album. Part of what makes the Velvet Underground’s official discography so unique is that each of the four dramatically different albums they released between 1967 and 1970 could be considered their definitive statement, and yet each could also be considered the outlier. However, in the latter sense, that distance is amplified with Loaded, and not just because Moe Tucker—the pounding heartbeat of the band—sat out the sessions to tend to her pregnancy, necessitating a drumming-by-committee approach. When stacked against the dark, droning psychedelia of The Velvet Underground & Nico, the flesh-melting distortion of White Light/White Heat, and the disarming quietude of The Velvet Underground, there’s nothing overtly contrarian about Loaded. It’s the album that plays least into the myth of the Velvets as transgressive avant-rock outsiders and speaks most loudly to their reality, as a working band playing half-empty bars, desperate to deliver a hit to their antsy major label minders. That pressure was baked into the very title of the record, a directive from their Atlantic Records bosses to produce a record ""loaded"" with potential hit singles—and the band delivered on every count, except, of course, the sales part. In that respect, Loaded stands as one of rock’s first truly meta artifacts, prefiguring such label-baiting in-jokes as Neil Young’s Everybody’s Rockin’ rebuke to Geffen Records and Nirvana’s ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter"". This is, after all, a rock 'n'roll album that advertises its populist intent with a song about rock'n'roll called ""Rock & Roll"". Past provocations gave way to carefree kicks: ""Head Held High"" is ""I’m Waiting for the Man"" fresh out of rehab; ""Train Round the Bend"" is ""Sister Ray"" sent to the confession booth. But while Loaded may constitute a concerted effort to play by the rules, the Velvets come off like boarding school-bound delinquents who spend their class time stifling giggles and sneaking snarky notes. Whether answering the Beatles’ optimistic ""Here Comes the Sun"" with the withering ""Who Loves the Sun?"" or crashing the Byrds’ country-rock rodeo on ""Lonesome Cowboy Bill"", Loaded feels as much like a sardonic comment on pop’s ruling class as a bid to join its rarefied ranks. Atop the immortal riff of ""Sweet Jane"", Reed declares, ""me, I’m in a rock'n'roll band,"" before adding a ""huh""—and, after a million listens, it’s still hard to tell if it’s being delivered with a smirk or a shrug. Alas, all that contradictory tension proved emblematic of deeper fissures running through the band. As this six-disc box set expansion of Loaded makes clear, the Velvets’ most airtight album ironically bears telling signs of their unravelling. Compiling remastered stereo and mono versions of the album, demos, alternate mixes, outtakes, a surround-sound DVD album mix, and two live sets, Loaded: Re-Loaded 45th Anniversary Edition highlights the painstaking tweaks and tinkering that went into making a seemingly effortless rock'n'roll album. Like the previous box sets in the Velvets’ current reissue campaign, Re-Loaded is less about unearthing rare tracks (much of the bonus material here first surfaced on 1997’s Fully Loaded) than getting the story straight, and properly contextualizing the output of a band whose official albums have been overwhelmed by a continuous stream of posthumous live albums, rarities compilations, and bootlegs. In the case of Loaded, the stereo and mono mixes don’t exist merely to satisfy differing listener preferences, but to present conflicting visions for the album. The former contains the extended versions of ""Sweet Jane"" and ""New Age"" that were eventually pared down for the official November 1970 release, much to Reed’s chagrin; he had left the band shortly after recording was completed, effectively sealing the album’s doomed fate before it even hit stores. Tellingly, on Loaded, Reed already sounds like he’s handing the keys to the band over to bassist Doug Yule, who sings lead on four of the album’s 10 songs and plays much of the instrumentation. In contrast to John Cale, the band co-founder he replaced in 1968, Yule was never so much Reed’s foil as his eager understudy, with a more naturally melodic voice that buffed away Reed’s rough edges. But that’s no slight: Yule’s smooth-talker act yields the album’s most subversive moments, whether selling the bitter cynicism of ""Who Loves the Sun?"" as shiny, happy, ba-ba-da-ba pop, or playing the hotel bar-prowling hustler on ""New Age"" who sycophantically woos a faded movie star for a one-night stand only to cruelly discard her as ""over the hill."" And as the outtakes disc reveals, ""I Found a Reason"" could’ve easily wound up as a straight Dylan rip, before Yule’s angelic harmonies helped transform it into the most gorgeously celestial ballad in the Velvets’ canon. (Partially due to outstanding contractual commitments, Yule would soldier forth under the Velvet Underground name without any other original members for 1973’s largely forgotten Squeeze, an album unlikely to enjoy its own 45th-anniversary box set moment.) More than just a collection of song scraps, Re-Loaded’s demo stash lets us imagine how Loaded might’ve turned out without the hitmaking ambitions, from the rough-hewn takes of future Reed solo standards like ""Satellite of Love"" to the organ-swirled fantasia of ""Ocean"" (the most prog the Velvets ever got) to a molasses-slow version of ""Sweet Jane"" that anticipates the Cowboy Junkies’ codeined cover. Meanwhile, the first live disc—a remaster of Live at Max’s Kansas City—offers a glimpse of the arena-ready powerhouse the Velvets had become just prior to Reed’s exit. (The two sets that make up the show—one devoted to rockers, the other to ballads—were recorded by Factory regular Brigid Polk on August 23 1970, reportedly Reed’s last night fronting the band; the version included here omits two tracks from the 2004 double-disc reissue of the complete concert, presumably to make it fit on a single disc.) If Loaded is the closest the Velvets ever got to becoming the Rolling Stones, on Max’s Kansas City they practically turn into the Who, as Doug’s brother Billy propels ""I’m Waiting for the Man"" and ""Beginning to See the Light"" with thundering Moon-shot drum rolls. But the recording is ultimately a faded snapshot of a live act in peak form at a career nadir: from the infamous intrusion of Jim Carroll trying to score some Tuinal to the idle audience chit-chat about the movie Patton that overwhelms ""Candy Says"", the Velvets are rendered as mere background noise even for the few devotees who bothered to come out to their shows. The second concert included here—and of most interest to Velvets completists—predates the Max’s Kansas City show by a few months, but exudes an even greater degree of finality. Recorded by a fan on a reel-to-reel, the May 1970 set at Philadelphia’s Second Fret club sees Reed, Yule, and guitarist Sterling Morrison performing without a drummer (though Yule would hit the skins on a couple of songs). The stripped-down, slackened presentation greatly distinguishes it from other live Velvets documents of the era, while emphasizing certain subliminal textures, like the krautrock pulse running through ""Cool It Down"", or the tremolo wash on ""Train Round the Bend"" that essentially invents Spacemen 3 a good 12 years early. (There’s also a rare Reed-sung version of ""New Age"" with considerably different lyrics.) These curios aside, Live at Second Fret is the sort of moldy bootleg you probably only need to hear once, that is, if you can even make it all the way through—the recording has the fidelity of a pocket-dial. But the decaying, desolate presentation feels like an appropriate way to capture a band on the verge of disintegration. The set ends, as Loaded does, with ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin’"", and the two versions crystallize the album’s story in miniature: one is the grandiose statement of a band with chart-topping aspirations, the other is the lonesome sound of a band that ain’t got nothin’ at all.","Originally released in 1970, the Velvet Underground’s fourth album, Loaded, is a perfectly conceived rock'n'roll album. Like the previous box sets in the Velvets’ current reissue campaign, this expanded 6xCD Re-Loaded collection is less about unearthing rare tracks than getting the story straight.

Cocksure,Laura Stevenson,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c6ea9e61561daa6809/1:1/w_160/865f86bb.jpg,2015-11-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21204-cocksure/,Don Giovanni,"Though it wasn't as heavy as the brooding grunge it shared Modern Rock airwaves with at the time, the peppier alterna-pop of the '90s often cut just as deep. Acts like the Lemonheads, Juliana Hatfield, and Matthew Sweet disguised depressive sentiments in plain sight by pairing them with chiming guitars and tuneful fuzz—you could sing along to some of their songs for weeks before even noticing they might be a cry for help. So it's easy to see why Laura Stevenson looked to power pop's flannelled era for her fourth album, Cocksure. The New York singer-songwriter has never shied from self-effacing thoughts, and by dialing up the pop she gives herself even more cover to let her antipathy run wild. It's her most disaffected record yet, but it's so spirited you could easily mistake it for her happiest. Stevenson's '90s makeover represents a sharp course correction from her sleeper 2013 album Wheel. That record was a true singer-songwriter affair, rooted in folk-rock and country and highlighted by ornate ballads flushed with tasteful strings and horns. She clearly poured a lot of time into it. Cocksure, on the other hand, is as assured and impulsive as its title. Though it's bookended by two big, showy numbers that would have would have slotted seamlessly onto Wheel— ""Out With a Whimper"", a Rilo Kiley-sized emotional wallop, and the regal grand finale ""Tom Sawyer / You Know Where You Can Find Me""—the rest is driven by swift riffs and bubblegum hooks. Listeners who thought Stevenson's former Don Giovanni labelmate Waxahatchee might have done well to lighten Ivy Tripp with another ""Coast to Coast"" or two will find plenty of instant gratification on this one. Stevenson's old Bomb the Music Industry! bandmate Jeff Rosenstock rejoins her here in a producer role, which might partially account for some of Cocksure's punk moxie, but underneath the speedy tempos Stevenson is consumed by the same delicate subjects that have driven all of her solo records: emotional retreat, the nagging fear that she's squandered her youth, and the irrational disdain she feels for those who care enough to try to lift her from her funk. ""I'm fucking hideous and spiteful when I'm left to my devices,"" she lashes out on ""Jellyfish"", which juxtaposes the album's sweetest hook with its sourest image: Stevenson as a gelatinous blob sprawled flat on the couch, motionless and essentially dead to the world but with a stinger pointed at anybody who might dare to poke her. She doesn't need to be told it's an awful way to live; she knows. ""I'm wasting away my life and gifts on being a piece of shit,"" she concedes, if only so she doesn't have to hear somebody else say it. That all might make the album seem like a buzzkill, but it never is. One of the joys of the album is simply hearing her cycle through so many slight variations of '90s alternative, and how she always manages to find the right shade to counter her dour mood. ""Happier, Etc."" matches another plea to be left alone to slaphappy pop-punk. The exuberant guitars on ""Claustrophobe"" blast out of the same Kitty Pryde-postered garage as the Blue Album, while the jangly ""Life Is Long"" channels the great, underrated heroes of sad-sack '90s guitar-pop: the Gin Blossoms. That band may not be the hippest touchstone for a millennial songwriter, yet perhaps more than any other they embodied the same mantra that Stevenson wears so well on Cocksure: When life gives you lemons, sugar the fuck out of them.","On her fourth album Cocksure, Laura Stevenson disguises depressive sentiments in plain sight by pairing them with chiming guitars and tuneful fuzz. It's her most disaffected record yet, but it's so spirited you could easily mistake it for her happiest.

I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces,Wolf Eyes,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b8c0084474cd0c1cd2/1:1/w_160/41a60516.jpg,2015-11-03 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21056-i-am-a-problem-mind-in-pieces/,Third Man,"Wolf Eyes have always had a B-movie aura. They’re like the Roger Corman of underground music, churning out releases, inspiring other low-budget noise-auteurs, galvanizing scenes both locally in Michigan and globally in festivals and collaborations. Many of their blunt album titles have a schlock-horror feel: Slicer, Dread, Burned Mind, Human Animal. That feel is in the music too. At turns scary, funny, dramatic, and transfixing, Wolf Eyes’ morphing sound has one constant: creepy, thick tension. The trio’s B-movie game is in full effect on I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces, whose title sounds like either a pulpy confessional or a campy drug-education filmstrip. Song names feel like lost movies too: ""T.O.D.D."" as killer-robot sci-fi, ""Asbestos Youth"" as mean-streets teen flick, ""Cynthia Vortex AKA Trip Memory Illness"" as LSD-soaked journey into madness. Lyrics reference drowning heads, toxic thoughts, burning hairs, suffocation cages. If this album getting released the day before Halloween is a coincidence, it sure is a lucky one. Most importantly, the music on I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces contains all the ominous suspense of a classic horror movie. Each track oozes with eerie tones and seat-edge momentum, such that something terrifying seems to always lurk around the corner. The album even mimics the narrative arc of a thriller: the first few tracks gradually heighten the plot, until action explodes in the damaged-punk climax of ""Enemy Ladder"" and its tale of ""twisted lands of severed hands."" The denouement of ""Cynthia Vortex"" follows, ending with singer Nate Young’s chopped-up groans that evoke a victim’s final gasps of air. Though he’s an equal partner in sound-crime with bandmates John Olson and James Baljo, Young is the star of I Am a Problem’s cinematic tremors. His jaw-clenched snarls and subliminal seething get under your skin. Razor-like moans in ""Twister Nightfall"" curl sharply around a monster-march beat and Baljo’s guitar grind, while Olson’s creaky noises on ""T.O.D.D."" rhyme with Young’s yelps. Even on ""Enemy Ladder"", where frantic rhythms swirl into a cloud, Young's bark center things like the piercing eye of a pulsing storm. Beyond his own vocal dexterity, Young’s recent move toward more subdued music in his solo work (often under the name Regression) has steered Wolf Eyes to a place where small shifts can make huge ripples, and hypnosis is as powerful as confrontation. One of the best Regression albums is aptly titled Stay Asleep, and Young has developed a keen knack for sonically replicating nightmares—""I burn my dreams just to stay warm,"" he sings in ""T.O.D.D.""—and making gripping music from dark shadows and subtle motion. In fact, I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces may be too somnambulant for noise-hounding Wolf Eyes heads, or newcomers impatient for quicker cuts to the chase. You have to sit still a while and let the trio’s sonic images wash over you before their musical zombies rise from the dead to terrorize the stereo space. But give this album a fraction of the patience and attention that Wolf Eyes have put into it—effort on a par with their excellent previous effort, No Answer: Lower Floors—and you’ll be glad you stayed up late enough to see how it ends.","For close to two decades, the constantly morphing Michigan trio Wolf Eyes have churned out releases, inspired other low-budget noise-auteurs, and galvanized scenes both locally and globally. I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces, their first record for Jack White's Third Man imprint, oozes with eerie tones and seat-edge momentum.

Coke Zoo,French MontanaFetty Wap,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b20a13d197565213a6e7/1:1/w_160/da3ec403.jpg,2015-11-03 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21251-coke-zoo/,self-released,"Fetty Wap and French Montana are at different points in their careers. Both are northerners with cocaine-centric worldviews – French Montana comes from a rap outfit called Coke Boys and Fetty Wap's breakout single is called ""Trap Queen"" – but they don't share much else in common at the moment. Fetty's self-titled debut recently hit Number One on the Billboard 200 after a string of trap ballads became Top 10 hits, and French is in the process of trying to muster up some much-needed buzz after a commercial flop and a series of mixtapes that failed to stick. They are also two very different types of trappers: French is a materialist with tunnel vision and Fetty is a hopeless romantic penning Pyrex love poems. They go about dealing in different ways, but they traffic the same thing, and on their collaborative mixtape Coke Zoo they find common ground in cocaine rap's tropes—and in their shared penchant for hook-driven songs. Coke Zoo disproves any notion that Auto-Tune is the great equalizer. When Fetty uses it, his voice soars. When French uses, phrases flat-line. It can be jarring going from Fetty's voice, which is robust and full, to French's, which is flat and without depth. French hitches a ride on the Fetty bandwagon for many of his best contributions, but his approach to writing is far more elementary (On ""Freaky"": ""I'ma hit it like a dog/ Then I'ma pass it to my dog""), and it's Fetty's knack for melody that makes songs like ""Power"" so appealing. Many of the ideas and sounds on Coke Zoo feel like Fetty Wap b-sides and leftovers: ""Sometimes"" is a leaked Fetty Wap song from July (""I Wonder"") with a French verse tagged on. ""Angel"" once again showcases the stunning skill set of the trap balladeer (""And I make all this guap just to show you it's ours"") before French Montana sucks out all of the energy with lifeless vocals and a mood-breaking verse. On ""Gangsta Way"", a repurposed Chris Brown song with a French verse, he takes an otherwise solid record and stifles its momentum. It's weird that French Montana, who is one of the more  interesting characters in hip-hop, often writes such simple and boring raps, and on Coke Zoo,standing next to Fetty, he somehow seems even duller. There are some outliers. Unsurprisingly, French delivers his best performances on the French Montana songs, where he gets to operate in his own space without Fetty creeping over his shoulder. The Lil Durk-featuring ""See Me"" is French's strongest use of Auto-Tune on the tape over a trudging rhythm, sax, and piano chords. On ""Concentration"", he takes a minor piano riff (courtesy of the Mekanics and MIXX) and makes one of his signature repetitive, bass-heavy jams. But as the chanting Fetty Wap joint ""Damn Chainz"" proves, there isn't much French can do better than his trapping Jersey counterpart. Coke Zoo is an interesting experiment that showcases why the stocks of these two rappers seem to be headed in two different directions.","Fetty Wap and French Montana are very different types of rappers, but on their collaborative mixtape Coke Zoo they find common ground in cocaine rap's tropes—and in their shared penchant for hook-driven songs.

AQUARIA,Boots,by: Jia Tolentino,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15b13d197565213a5ea/1:1/w_160/343cf940.jpg,2015-11-03 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21139-aquaria/,Columbia,"The fact that you still can't mention Boots without also mentioning Beyoncé teaches two mournful lessons: 1) It's a mixed bag to start your career with a zeitgeist-definitive icon re-recording your best songs,  and 2) It's even harder when you struggle to find a distinctive voice on your own. Four-fifths of Beyoncé had Boots' stamp on it, and since then the artist and producer, whose real name is Jordan Asher, has been busy. He's brought his surly, gentle, unfurling darkness to a feature-heavy mixtape, a series of well-chosen collaborations—Run the Jewels and FKA twigs, most recently—and now a first album, Aquaria. It's hollowly explosive and impeccably engineered; it's a ball of static electricity, its aesthetic distinct. And nevertheless, Boots remains in his own shadow, his debut album eclipsed by his debut. As a musician, Boots has an ear for sweet melody and a percussive, subtle, muscular style. His instincts cleave to R&B easily, and innovate from inside the genre; you can hear this happy marriage clearly on ""Haunted,"" the Beyoncé meditation that was originally a Boots track called ""I'm Onto You."" Aquaria recalls that track's sound world directly: the instrumentation that rattles and slaps, the vocal line narrow. Aquaria itself is a rock album cumulatively – its soul is Mad Max and Jesus' Son, as if someone pushed Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead underwater and made them kiss – but Boots's primary instinct is genre agnosticism. This is an enormous benefit to the artists who work with him, but it's often a detriment when he's left alone. As a rule, Boots' instrumentals are much more persuasive and emotionally precise than his vocals. The slinky and rabble-rousing title track is a highlight, and not coincidentally because Angel Deradoorian is paired against a great, fat, delicate clap in the beat. ""I Run Roulette,"" another standout, is hard-edged pop that rides the contrast between the pitch-black riot that serves as the backdrop and the verses, which come very close to bubble-grunge. But Boots has an imprecise delivery as a vocalist. When he sings, or just as often sing-raps, you often forget what he's trying to say. Part of the difficulty lies in the lyrics. They're half-heartedly combative, noncommittally weird, full of half-clever neologisms: like the song title ""Oraclies,"" for ""oracle"" and ""lies."" On ""Bombs Away,"" Boots sings: ""All the wolves are famous/ Hide the rich and shameless/ Thirsty like an addict/ Hope is for the tragic/ Sell me down a new stream/ New world has new dream."" The same restless, idle soothsaying comes in on ""C.U.R.E.,"" a track that aches for a Run the Jewels guest verse (El-P is a co-producer on Aquaria) but, with Boots at the helm, sounds almost, truly, like Crazytown. There's a slightness in his voice that he doesn't use well; there's a melodic whimsy in his aesthetic that's best matched either with formidable guest charisma or else with his own production, its taut anxiety left unverbalized, slicing and revving away. As on WinterSpringSummerFall, snippets of melody are briefly mesmerizing here; on Aquaria, the old-fashioned slow-dance ballad ""Only"" is a beautiful lament. ""I am the only one alive,"" he sings, then switches: ""You are the only one alive."" Those are your options, solipsism or fixation; the album whirls between the two poles to occasionally claustrophobic effect. Each song confines you to a small set of characters: a bassline, a beat knocking, a squidge of sonic interference, a melody. For all of Boots' fluidity and technical proficience, his solo work seems hampered by his attachment to pop, which doesn't fit his elusive profile. Aquaria could explode live, with two drummers at Boots' back. But in speakers, the album feels just pop enough in intention that its pleasures seem noticeably absent; with a few strong exceptions, the album could be a folder of songs waiting for someone else to bring them to life. Boots has talent enough to make a star, or to elevate a star to a new realm. You wonder who his next one will be.","Aquaria is the full-length debut from the producer best known for his work with Beyoncé. It's hollowly explosive and impeccably engineered, but Boots remains in his own shadow, his own music eclipsed by his production work.

Elaenia,Floating Points,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12f13d197565213a5ae/1:1/w_160/6af0bda1.png,2015-11-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21110-floating-points-elaenia/,Luaka BopPluto,"The title track of Sam Shepherd's debut album as Floating Points was inspired by a dream: A migratory bird strays from its flock and is swallowed up by the forest, mimicking the way our atoms are absorbed into the fabric of the universe when we die (or so goes one theory, anyway). We might find ourselves ""reincarnated as a SIM card in Singapore, or as a beetle in Scotland,"" as Shepherd told Pitchfork recently. He recorded the song ""Elaenia"" the very next morning, and its improvised, fluid form mirrors the dream's holistic vision. Made with just a Fender Rhodes electric piano and a handful of arcane synthesizers, it bobs between gurgles and limpid, lyric melodies. At more than seven minutes long, it is the second-longest song on the album, and also the most spare— just a handful of chords, some rumble, and a lot of nuance. Like an ocean swell, it is simple on the surface but complex beneath, and the same could be said of Elaenia as a whole. Though comparatively short—just seven songs totaling some 43 minutes—Elaenia is rich and welcoming, balancing Shepherd's intelligence with intuition. Flitting between strange time signatures and simple pulses, it utilizes mostly analog synthesizers, pairing them with live instrumentation: electric bass, guitar, piano, live drums, and strings. It is as warm and fluid an ""electronic"" album as you will hear all year, and it has a timeless feel: There's no reason it could not have been written and recorded 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. For long-time fans of the UK producer, musician, and DJ, Elaenia feels both like a surprise and a logical extension of his previous singles and EPs. Rhythms are played, not looped or sampled; the album skirts the edges of the dancefloor, flitting between ambient miniatures and extended jams falling somewhere between post-rock and jazz fusion. But nothing here feels like a radical departure, which is a testament to Shepherd's gradual process of refinement. He is trained in neuroscience and epigenetics, but it would be just as easy to imagine him as a furniture builder who had spent the past six years working on a single desk. The underlying structure of his work has remained more or less constant for years, but with every recording, it gets a little smoother, a little more perfect, inching a little closer to its ideal form. Shepherd has cited Talk Talk as an inspiration, and you can hear the influence of albums like Laughing Stock on the porous fabric of Elaenia. It's a record best heard loud, because the quiet parts can be very quiet, and its spirit lies less in melodies or even moods than in tiny details. With the exception of the cosmic jazz-leaning ""Silhouettes (1,11,111)"", you're left less with hummable themes than with small, passing moments: the burnished gleam of a lone Rhodes key hit hard, a faint scrap of radio static, soft notes that cling to each other like burrs. In keeping with the transfiguration theme, the music seems to have no stable center at all. It moves like clouds in the sky, slowly and imperceptibly shape-shifting, and at any given moment, what's being played matters less than how we arrived at that point. The sense of an unbroken line is paramount, leading to the album's final thrill when it is suddenly yanked up at a 45-degree angle. In five minutes it goes from silence to jet-engine loud. Synthesizers snarl, the string section goes into overdrive, and the drum kit rolls on inexorably, explosion upon explosion. The song, ""Peroration Six"", is the only one where you feel Shepherd and company really letting loose.  It's a revelation and a rush, a full-on ""Fuck yeah!"" shouted into the coming storm. The last thing we hear sounds almost like a wrong note, and then it's all simply cut short. The silence is deafening; it feels like waking up from a very heavy dream.","The full-length debut from Sam Shepherd (aka Floating Points) is as warm and fluid an ""electronic"" album as you will hear all year, and it has a timeless feel: There's no reason it could not have been written and recorded 10, 20, or even 30 years ago.

Stop Suffering EP,Tropic of Cancer,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19a9d034d5c69bf4a50/1:1/w_160/5f88ef29.png,2015-11-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21176-stop-suffering-ep/,Blackest Ever Black,"Grief is a watery emotion, prone to slopping over the side of any container it occupies—and so it takes a project like Camella Lobo’s L.A.-based Tropic of Cancer, music that moves fluidly, to truly capture it. Stop Suffering, which Lobo recorded and self-produced with mixing and mastering from Joshua Eustis (ex-Telefon Tel Aviv), is her first major work since 2013’s glimmering Restless Idylls LP, and though it only comprises three tracks, the tracks are so finely crafted that it's a work worth returning to, playing again and again, and exploring within. It is a work about grief, yes, but a work wholly without self-pity, a work that urges slowly forward. It is a work about how grief ebbs eventually, with attention and time. Lobo is an expert in how nearly microscopic musical changes can have an enormous emotional effect, and the opening title track is a master class on this phenomenon. It's built on gauzy layers of synth-wash just a step or a half-step away from one another, and as Lobo introduces a layer or pulls one back the subtle movement causes the whole track to shiver, like a spider’s web trembling below the movement of tiny feet. Her timing has to be impeccable to achieve this, and it is. Her vocal melody also stays within a relatively small range for most of the song, functioning more as an additional instrumental/ambient layer—pushed back in the mix, hovering suspended in delay—than a traditional vocal line winding around and through the instrumentation. It is a dense song with a dark heart that only truly shows itself near the end of the track, but it never feels murky. ""I Woke Up and the Storm Was Over"" is more glacial in pace than the title track, but with a minimal heartbeat ticking at its core. It stretches luxuriously, like a cat's yawn, all choral synth and tidal sweep and percussive shoegaze bass, the sort that sounds like a big piano. On this one, Lobo’s vocals sit more atop the mix, more the focal point, more the driver. There is something in it that feels immensely, strangely hopeful. If the title track is slowly running water and ""I Woke Up and the Storm Was Over"" is the glacier formed as that water starts to freeze, the closing track, ""When the Dog Bites"", is its iced-over final form. Droning and sparse in comparison to the highly textural tracks before it, ""When the Dog Bites"" throws Lobo’s voice into final heavy relief. When the bass drum hits, it feels like a communication across a vast expanse. The entire record feels composed in the way a classical piece does: a tale of grief in three movements, a tale of the sick motion of heartbreak eventually becoming still and distant, if not forgotten, as one's own sense of self becomes more pronounced. It is a delicate and painful journey, and one worth taking at Lobo’s side.","Tropic of Cancer is the project of the L.A.-based singer and synth player Camella Lobo. Stop Suffering, which she recorded and self-produced, is a work about grief, but a work wholly without self-pity.

Yellow Tape Activities,Mozzy,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1715e6ef9596932211e/1:1/w_160/c203110c.jpg,2015-11-02 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21154-yellow-tape-activities/,Black Market Activities,"From blockbuster biopic Straight Outta Compton to the Game's latest throwback, Documentary 2, California hip-hop history is big business nowadays. YG adapted LA gangster rap tradition to a modern production palette on My Krazy Life, while Kendrick Lamar and Vince Staples deconstruct the genre’s tropes and ideologies. Yet far from Southern California's party-driven nostalgia and cerebral critique, a Sacramento-based underdog on a shoestring budget has exploded underground, offering a bleak, confrontational take on street rap that’s at once urgent and unsettling. Yellow Tape Activities is Mozzy's third solo full-length this year, and his snowballing fanbase suggests grim realism still speaks to present conditions. Although young, Mozzy didn't arrive overnight; he's been recording for half a decade. As far back as 2010 tape Mozzarella Fella, he displayed the skills of a gifted writer, latching onto vivid imagery: ""Pour the Patron in the Ocean Spray cran-grape/ I'm well-buttered like a Grand Slam pancake."" But over the past two years his style really snapped into focus, becoming leaner and more direct. Along with producer June on the Beat, he cultivated a sound defined mainly by narrative style rather than melody or sonic technique. And this focus is one perpetually shaped by violence—think of Chicago's drill scene, although Sacramento has a long history of its own brutal reality rap. Yet Mozzy takes his own path. His rapid evolution over the past few years reached an apotheosis with 2014's ""Next Body on You"", on which Mozzy’s disconcerting lyrics insistently pressure the listener into the role of a crew hitman: ""Next body on you, 'cause you don't never do it."" June's production, a canned loop that sounds like a forgotten arcade game theme, sounds worlds away from the booming maximalism of Lex Luger; the song's teeth are entirely lyrical, not musical, and this juxtaposition backlights Mozzy's unflinching audacity. His unprecedented directness makes murder less abstract, an absurdity transformed, seen through the more familiar lenses of peer pressure and shared burdens. Yellow Tape Activities lacks the immediate highs of previous Mozzy tapes Bladadah and Gangland Landscape, but the album retains the rare consistency for which the rapper is known. There are no Mozzy filler verses. Nothing here seems aimed at the pop charts, although Mozzy's gift for a potent chorus suggests this isn't far from his reach. Opener ""Property of the Ave"" epitomizes his gift for morbid hooks, tossing off sticky lyrics with unbothered ease: ""He ain't never bodied nobody on our behalf."" The darkness of his world is one brought to life by its unapologetic, almost ascetic discipline, focusing on a few major themes: loyalty, purposeless murder, and drug abuse. All are linked by an ever-present pain which can be spoken of in art but never expressed in reality. This comes through on the fatalism of ""Ain't Shit Happen"" (""You don't slide for your niggas like I do for mine/ Living on the borderline of suicide"") and the way he considers his mother's concern as just another threat (""I don't care about my life like my momma care""). These are strict parental-advisory raps. The very visual and ever-present violence is disturbing, an art form pressed to its limit. He pushes gangster rap tropes in your face, placing them in unexpected, discomforting formulations. That this remains gut-wrenching despite years of gangster cliches is one aspect of his artfulness; that we keep listening despite the shock is another. In part, this is owed to the musicality of his flow, the particular way in which he packs in syllables and slant rhymes in memorable patterns. The stitching is wholly unique and feels brand new. It's present in the density of his slang, which adapts nearby Bay Area terms and Chicago street slang but submerges them in a local dialect that takes time to decipher. Mozzy slides, slithers, wiggles; his illas will wolf on 'em, back door 'em, breathe on 'em; guns become drum sticks, chop stixx, yop sticks. This isn't simple decoration. Every verse is written with bar-to-bar purposefulness that leaves listeners hanging onto each line. Its as if his ideas were carved from cliche with a straight razor. Mozzy’s art is at once shockingly new and alarmingly bleak. Or really, the situations he describes are bleak, as Mozzy is an artist whose feet may still be intertwined with the world that shaped him. Rather than a glorification of violence, the unremitting effect of his music is ceaselessly dire—the upsetting vision of one man from Sacramento's tough Oak Park neighborhood.","As West Coast hip-hop renegotiates its past through party-driven nostalgia and cerebral critique, Sacramento underdog Mozzy offers a blunt style of gangster rap that feels shockingly new and alarmingly bleak.

Technomancer,Pictureplane,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17db1335d7bf169a2b2/1:1/w_160/089c7a85.png,2015-11-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21162-technomancer/,Anticon,"The world that these songs on exist in, as Pictureplane’s Travis Egedy sings to us, is a dead one (where, of course, people get it on in the ruins of a shopping mall). The arrangements on Technomancer frequently play like droning or piercing alarms, particularly on tracks like “Sick Machine” and “Death Condition,” the latter of which is laden with clunky, mechanical percussion that makes it sound like a vintage video game. Whereas Pictureplane’s 2011 record Thee Physical spun queer and cyborg theory into fuzzy house-inspired electronica, Technomancer plays like a soundtrack to a sci-fi dystopian film. It works well as a concept record about trying to break out of one’s oppressive urban regime, with Egedy weaving his whispery conspiracy theories into every track. But while Pictureplane’s signature ’90s-evoking female vocal samples might sing soulfully in the distance, the record feels drained of the energy his previous albums showcased. The common setting on Techomancer is slowmo, with most tracks favoring ethereal, romantic ’80s synths over the pumped up, choppy compositions on Thee Physical. Even the breakbeat intro on “Harsh Realm” cuts out a minute in, favoring a more chilled out, awkward see-saw synth progression before returning to the sound of the song’s start. The blaring airhorns and record scratching sounds on “Street Pressure” feel like they’re working against the soft, sultry melody Egedy builds on that song, like a jokey nod to traditional club music. All of this seems at odds with the sound Pictureplane has cultivated thus far. There’s a tame, almost downtempo vibe to a lot of this record that keeps it from beginning to end in a sluggish, not very dance-friendly territory. Technomancer is certainly Egedy’s most nicely produced output yet, with his voice coming through stronger than ever on a lot of these songs. “Crack all the windows downtown, it’s that new American noise,” he sings to a “renegade street trash” on the more traditional, radio-friendly pop track “Riot Porn.” But the noise of Technomancer just plays too comfortably. Technomancer is very high concept in its man vs. machine dystopian themes, but the darkwave-edged beats Egedy constructs, while bleak, don’t possess the same level of imagination. In seemingly trying to make more cinematic and visionary electronica he ends up making pretty lackluster, slow-burning pop. On Technomancer Egedy’s typically wire-frayed, wall-of-sound ’90s mixtape sound feels stripped into something more pedestrian rather than futuristic.","Technomancer is certainly Travis Egedy’s most nicely produced output yet, with his voice coming through stronger than ever. Yet its reach is not as big as its grand potential. Slowing down and going for a clean sound is a fine aesthetic choice, but the songs' final feeling is one of aiming at something and not quite making it.

[Cease & Desist] DIY! (Cult classics from the Post-Punk era 1978 - 82),Various Artists,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11fc0084474cd0c1d70/1:1/w_160/c1cf64da.jpg,2015-11-02 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21100-cease-desist-diy-cult-classics-from-the-post-punk-era-1978-82/,Optimo Music,"The British D.I.Y. scene that arose in the wake of punk had a weird relationship with mainstream pop, one that continues to this day: This compilation was originally supposed to be called Now That's What I Call DIY!, until Sony inspired its new name. The records compiled here by JD Twitch of the Scottish DJ duo Optimo weren't exactly a genre at the time, but they had an ideology in common. Punk rock's Pistols/Jam/Clash wave had made a lot of noise about overturning musical orthodoxy, but it was pretty much a single kind of noise. The D.I.Y. bands made it their business to overturn every received idea about songs and recordings: rehearsed harmoniousness, formal structures, polish of any kind. But they did like to dance, or at least bounce, and some of them liked tunes, too. None of the artists on [Cease & Desist] DIY! were ever, ever going to make it onto the charts--or so they figured at the time--but they wanted it to be known that they weren't rejecting pop values out of ignorance. If you were looking for these sorts of records fifteen or twenty years ago, when anybody other than collectors still had them, you'd paw through 7-inch bins from which the Buzzcocks and Young Marble Giants singles had already been nabbed. The sound came almost exclusively from England in the years of this compilation's subtitle. Its record sleeves were predominantly monochrome, or black and white and pink, although silkscreened artwork (as with the sole release by Sara Goes Pop, from which ""Sexy Terrorist"" is taken here) was also acceptable. Uneven Letraset type, or handwritten band names and song titles, are a good sign; so are record labels with names like Fuck Off Records and It's War Boys, and what-were-they-thinking band names. The Spunky Onions' ""How I Lost My Virginity"", for instance, comes from their ""split single"" with the Ghettoberries, who were of course the same group. Twitch's sequence bends the usual rules for scene compilations. It's not all obscure artists—Thomas Leer, whose electropop single ""Private Plane"" appears here, went on to be half of the super-slick new wave band Act. Instead of surveying as many bands as possible, it includes two different tracks by the cunningly named Distributors: ""TV Me,"" a sort of answer song to the Normal's ""T.V.O.D."", and a curdled dub piece called ""Never Never"". It even ventures a bit outside of its own time range: a 1984 album track by the 012 is gerrymandered in on the grounds that it was recorded in 1981. All of those turn out to be fine decisions on Twitch's part, because [Cease & Desist]  manages to pull together recordings by a bunch of desperately alienated artists into a remarkable, eye-opening and ingeniously sequenced album. It's arranged into four four-song suites (there's no CD version of the album, but there is a double LP), each with a distinct focus. The first side is four stone classics featuring piping-voiced women singers; three of its four bands are by splinter projects of the Homosexuals (whose 1978 ""Hearts In Exile"" single is a fountain from which a lot of this music springs). In particular, ""C'est Fab"", a 1982 single credited to Nancy Sesay and the Melodaires—a Homosexuals-related group never heard from before or since—justifies this compilation's existence all by itself. It's a struggle for supremacy between a rhythm section that's trying to play crisp, bouncy funk and musicians who are doing their utmost to derail it (a singer squeaking uncertainly and out of tune at the very top of her range, an out-of-control trumpeter streaking through the studio, a male chorus with comedy accents, somebody dropping in cascades of fist-hammered dub piano). Everybody ends up winning. That's followed by a set of tracks that use the materials of synth-pop to build weirder and more obsessive structures than the stuff that was starting to turn up on the charts. (The highlight there is Dorothy's ""Softness"", an uncanny, close-miked spoken piece whose backing band includes both Genesis P-Orridge and Alex Fergusson, shortly before they formed Psychic TV.) The album's third side begins with three pieces inspired by the messiest extremes of Jamaican dub--a huge influence on that generation of British musicians--and ends with a song that recalls dub more or less by accident: the slow, sneering 1978 single ""Violence Grows"", by a wobbly band of teenagers called ""Fatal"" Microbes, fronted by a monomaniacal-sounding then-14-year-old who went by the name Honey Bane. (By the end of 1981, she would have a legitimate UK Top 40 single of her own, ""Turn Me On Turn Me Off"".) The final suite of [Cease & Desist] highlights the D.I.Y. scene's connections to the punk rock sound and ethos that made it possible. In another compilation's context, actually, the Fakes' ""Look Out"" and the Prats' ""Disco Pope"" would just seem like ineptly performed punk songs, which arguably they were. But the genius of D.I.Y. was that it made any bug a feature: these records' aesthetic framed every off-key vocal or mangled rhythm as a rebellion against the boredom of sonic orthodoxy, and they are never for an instant boring.","Compiled by JD Twitch of the Scottish duo Optimo, *[*Cease and Desist] pulls together recordings by a bunch of desperately alienated British post-punk bands and one-offs into a remarkable, eye-opening and ingeniously sequenced album.

Return to the Moon,EL VY,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b17b5e6ef9596932212f/1:1/w_160/1f378784.jpg,2015-11-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21161-return-to-the-moon/,4AD,"It's probably unfair to compare EL VY, the new project from Matt Berninger (the National) and Brent Knopf (Ramona Falls, Menomena), to Berninger's main gig. The National have come to cast a surprisingly long shadow over indie rock: even if their booking at Barclays Center was more a case of ""huge in New York"" than ""huge in Oklahoma,"" the National have emerged as a big-tent indie mainstay because their widescreen melancholia has proven durable and difficult to emulate. EL VY provides our first look at Berninger divorced from that context and a clue toward deciphering how much of the National's appeal hinges on Berninger's GQuaalude musings and how much belongs to his band's gilded alt-rock. It's easy to say EL VY's first record, Return to the Moon, isn't a National album; it's more difficult to put a finger on what exactly it is. On lecherous lead single ""I'm the Man to Be"" he's still talking about his dick, the one he swung around so much on 2005 breakthrough Alligator. Elsewhere (""It's a Game"") he's comfortably forlorn, trading on elegant little phrases (""It's a game/ And I can't wait to see you"") like he did on 2013's Trouble Will Find Me. Knopf's jaunty and hectic keyboard-heavy arrangements are a little indistinct and, worse, noncommittal, unable to choose between glam (""I'm the Man to Be"") and lounge rock (""Paul Is Alive""), between lush folk (""No Time to Crank the Sun"") and boozy bluster (""Sad Case""). We get glimpses of how Berninger might fare as a Bryan Ferry-esque put-on—he has the wardrobe for it—or as Greg Dulli-indebted horndog, but only in the moments before Knopf's arrangements whisk him away. The particularly ill-fated opening trilogy—including ""I'm the Man to Be"", the title track, and ""Paul Is Alive""—reek of that fake-funky, post-Beck period when major labels gave odd, talented bands just enough rope to hang themselves; the results sound like Berninger and Knopf deemed Soul Coughing not haughty enough. There are cooing background vocals, dirty organs, harpsi- and power chords, but it all feels random, deployed only because something has to fill these spaces. Berninger, for all his magnetism, doesn't help matters. Absent his backing band's grandeur, his poet-laureate-of-the-upwardly-mobile-schtick cedes way to a clever misanthrope in need of an editor and an Advil. The album opens with the unforgettable and irredeemable line, ""I scratched a ticket with the leg of a cricket/ And I got triple Jesus,"" straight from the Tweedy School of Left-Leaning Refrigerator-Magnet Poetry. He's still name dropping other musicians—the Beatles, the Cramps, the Minutemen—but he puts too fine a point on things when, in the middle of ""Sleepin' Light"", he declares, ""Ain't no Leonard Cohen."" He's still funnier than he's given credit for (""You were supposed to bring me your brother's weed...this is heartbreaking!"") but he seems in on the joke less often. His haphazard proper nouns—""Silent Ivy Hotel"", ""Happiness, Missouri""—carry less import. Trouble Will Find Me was well-received, but there was a sense, even amongst National die-hards, that this was the last time the band, and Berninger, could coast on that particular sound. Return to the Moon is an unhappy departure, one that suggests that Berninger is as reliant on the National's luxe environments as they are on his all-the-wine sloganeering. And while there's nothing here that suggests Berninger and Knopf are truly incompatible, there's equally little evidence that Knopf's spirited arrangements are suited to Berninger's spotlight-gargling word soup. ""Return to the moon/ I'm dying,"" Berninger croons on the opening track. Yeah, man.","EL VY is the new project from Matt Berninger of the National and Brent Knopf of Ramona Falls and Menomena. Their debut offers a chance to hear Berninger  divorced from the context of his main gig, and the results are muddled and confused, unsure of a clear direction to take.

The Attic Tapes,John Renbourn,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1495e6ef959693220d3/1:1/w_160/6477cbc7.jpg,2015-10-28 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21128-the-attic-tapes/,Riverboat,"T**he Attic Tapes is a 20-song archival hodgepodge cobbled together from early recordings of the late British guitarist John Renbourn, who died in March. Renbourn sourced the core of the tracklist from a tape labeled ""1962"" that he discovered in the attic of fellow folk revivalist Mac MacLeod, pairing those few songs with various onstage collaborations from his salad days, before he and his guitar-sparring partner Bert Jansch and their band, Pentangle, helped redefine the scope of modern folk. Renbourn had yet to sign a record deal, so these takes are rough with their age and his youth. But the finale, a live duet with Davy Graham of ""Nobody Knows You When You’re Down Out"", is pristine, with the thin, lithe tone of the dual guitars rendered perfectly. Had Graham and a teenaged Renbourn somehow stolen into a proper studio back in 1962? Actually, their Clapton Unplugged-like take on the American standard comes from an onstage rendezvous several decades after the heyday of the British folk revival. As a memento, it is quite poignant. Not only did Graham serve as a de facto mentor to Renbourn, but the younger guitarist opens this set with a hurried version of ""Anji"", one of Graham’s trademark numbers. But as a set-closer, it’s a bit of a bore, the sound of two old friends romping through the blues for their own amusement but without much payoff. Alas, that makes it a fitting close for The Attic Tapes, a tedious if spirited set that lets us hear Renbourn learn where folk and blues had been rather than guide where it might go. It raises more questions about archival albums than it answers of Renbourn’s genesis. The Attic Tapes mostly confirms what we already know about Renbourn and, really, the bulk of his motley crew of fellow crooners and pickers: They loved the rawness and magnetism of American blues and folk music, and they tried the best they could to recast it in their own image. There are a few originals here, like the halting and smart blues reordering of ""Plainsong"" and the peppy ""Judy"". But mostly, Renbourn plainly shows his roots. He turns Blind Boy Fuller’s doting but vaguely threatening ""Little Woman You’re So Sweet"" into the sprightly ""Beth’s Blues"". Like most every other pasty kid with a piece of carved wood and some strings, he works his way through Blind Willie Johnson’s ""Lord I Just Can’t Keep From Crying"". He flits between the notes and lifts and leaps with his voice in a way that suggests he’s celebrating his own vulnerability, a young man not old enough to know how painful it all could get. Likewise, Renbourn’s take on ""Portland Town"", by itinerant and largely overlooked American banjoist Derroll Adams, seems to delight in tragic lyrics about bad marriages and dead children. And his cover of Jackson C. Frank’s perfect anthem, ""Blues Run the Game"", is overly emphatic, the verses brandished with unwarranted relish. It’s clear that Renbourn is an incredible guitarist, capable of making intricate patterns seem effortless even at such a young age. His jejune takes on these hard old songs suggest that he was, to date, simply an instrumentalist short on experience. If you’re worried that The Attic Tapes is an opportunistic ploy to profit from Renbourn’s recent death, like a youthful journal published without the deceased author’s consent, don’t: Renbourn seemed enthusiastic about this project, even penning playful and informative liner notes that trace his lineage and sources more clearly than the recordings themselves. According to Riverboat Records’ owners, Renbourn died the day before they would have sent him the final artwork; he never had a chance to dig deeper for exact dates on these sessions. Aside from its redundancy, though, the real worry with The Attic Tapes stems from the way it reflects reissue-and-archival culture at large. Though many labels interested in such work do essential excavations of forgotten sessions, albums and artists, there seems to be an increasing tendency to regard most anything that’s survived as a masterpiece—as though time transformed it like common carbon into a rare diamond. Everything presumed to be lost doesn’t need to be found. The situation seems doubly pronounced when the music involves an artist we already know—or, in the case of The Attic Tapes, a panoply of them. In some way, I wonder if our relatively new era of seemingly instant and infinite information about what our favorite singers had for breakfast or where they’re vacationing and with whom has made the salvage of such basement reels and attic tapes seem more paramount, as though we’re retroactively rebuilding as much of the past as we can. That’s an intriguing endeavor, but it doesn’t necessarily make for essential records. During his 50-year career, Renbourn contributed to several of those, from Bert and John and The Pentangle to The Black Balloon. This makeshift reliquary—perhaps the final release in which Renbourn had a hand—is not among them.","T**he Attic Tapes is a 20-song archival hodgepodge cobbled together from early recordings of the late British guitarist John Renbourn, who died in March.

We Are Not the First,Hieroglyphic BeingJ.I.T.U. Ahn-Sahm-Buhl,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b14a5e6ef959693220d6/1:1/w_160/4ab1a72c.jpg,2015-10-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21130-we-are-not-the-first/,Rvng Intl.,"When it comes to techno's outer limits, there are dabblers, there are explorers, and then there's Hieroglyphic Being. Few have ventured further out than Jamal Moss, a Chicago producer and DJ who also records as the Sun God, I.B.M. (Insane Black Man), and under various permutations of his main alias, like Hieroglyphic Being and the Configurative or Modular Me Trio. Moss' roots lie in drum machines and synths and four-to-the-floor rhythms, but he's equally interested in Sun Ra's Afrofuturist flights of fancy, and his music has been getting more and more free-form in recent years. On We Are Not the First, a top-notch group of collaborators—the J.I.T.U. Ahn-Sahm-Bul (or the Journey Into The Unexpected Ensemble; Moss loves his wordplay)—help him travel to some truly outerstellar reaches. Moss and his ensemble recorded the album during a week of sessions in New York, and while the lineup shifts slightly throughout, it consists mainly of Arkestra bandleader Marshall Allen on saxophone and keys; Elliott Levin, a longtime member of Cecil Taylor's ensembles, on flute and saxophone; and Shahzad Ismaily, a member of Marc Ribot's Ceramic Dog, on guitar. Ben Vida pitches in with modular synths on a few tracks, and Shelley Hirsch and Rafael Sanchez both contribute vocals—swooping, birdlike incantations and spoken-word, respectively. And then there's Greg Fox, the lightning-handed drummer for Liturgy, Zs, and Guardian Alien, who plays on eight of the album's 11 tracks, and whose contributions are the first indicator that we've left the limits of dance music far behind. A few tracks still feature Moss' trademark drum-machine chug. ""Cybernetics Is an Old Science"", strafed by echo-soaked clatter, sounds a lot like the kind of techno that Moss has been producing for the past two decades, just slathered in a three-way duel of squealing saxophones and modular synth. On ""Fuck the Ghetto / Think About Outer Space"", Moss' loping toms and hi-hats provide the frame for Sanchez' exhortation to choose space over subjection, to think one's way out of the ""ghetto of the mind."" ""Pussy Thumper"" rides atop hypnotic, hi-hat-heavy programming that flits between an andante 100 BPM and a dizzying double-time tempo, depending on how you hear it. And on the strutting ""Cimitière des Innocents"", Fox restricts himself to filling in the space around Moss' programming while synth and reeds run circles around each other. Elsewhere, though, Fox's liquid timekeeping sets the pace, and that's where the album really takes off. The title track is an 18-minute jam featuring Carter (flute, saxophone, trumpet), Ismaily (guitar), Vida (modular synth), and Fox along with Moss' synths and electronic drums. It is a pulsing, clanging din of chirp and squeal; it feels like eavesdropping upon a dozen conversations at once. The rhythm holds it together; it's chaotic, but it's also meditative, in the same way that being alone in a crowd can be meditative. For all its length, it doesn't really go anywhere; you just drop in and drift along, buoyed by its steady turbulence. We Are Not the First is an album deeply invested in the idea of evolution—of apes becoming upright and then heading offworld. But in its relationship to dance music as it's conventionally understood, the album is less an evolutionary step than a quantum leap into the unknown.","Chicago producer Jamal Moss has explored techno's outer limits for years, under various aliases. With his latest release as Hieroglyphic Being, he assembles a powerhouse group that includes Liturgy drummer Greg Fox and members of the Sun Ra Arkestra: Together, they travel to some truly interstellar reaches.

Torch of the Mystics,Sun City Girls,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19913d197565213a640/1:1/w_160/4fa92bea.jpg,2015-10-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21175-torch-of-the-mystics/,AbductionAbduction,"The arc of Sun City Girls’ 26-year history was long, but it bent toward chaos. Their music was an unpredictable pile-up of rock, pop, jazz, blues, psych, noise, improv, and many far-flung global sounds—with special love for the music of the Middle East—delivered as ballads, jams, rants, plays, and pranks. Their dual passions for playing whatever they felt like and confounding any audience who would listen dovetailed perfectly, such that even their biggest fans can cite Sun City Girls moments that they found baffling or even off-putting. This penchant for messiness helps explain why 1990’s Torch of the Mystics is Sun City Girls’ most famous and perhaps best-loved album. The most surprising aspect of this record is how well arranged and engaging the music is. Though the trio had roots in the Arizona hardcore scene of the early '80s, no one ever pegged them as purveyors of three chords and the truth, especially given the rambling releases that preceded Torch. But the three-chord riff that launches album opener ""Blue Mamba"" couldn't be more direct, and remains Sun City Girls’ biggest-ever earworm. Torch of the Mystics is replete with moments like that—nuggets of hypnotic tunefulness stretched into songs that feel as classic and well-worn as the dusty cassettes the band uncovered on their travels around the globe (later mined for compilations on bassist/singer Alan Bishop’s Sublime Frequencies label). You can actually whistle along to most of Torch’s songs—one even starts with Bishop whistling the melody for you—and even the farthest-out tunes have discernible shapes that quickly burn into memory. The most immediate images come from the guitar of Alan Bishop’s younger brother Rick. Earlier Sun City Girls albums hinted at his instrumental prowess, but it’s on full display on Torch of the Mystics. His playing isn’t about technical know-how or honed chops—though he clearly has both of those—but rather finding epiphanies in repetition. The curling chords of ""Esoterica of Abyssynia"" are so dizzying they seem to fold in on themselves, like a musical Möbius strip. Similar effects spin from the warped strings of ""Radar 1941"", which sounds like a water-logged surf tune that washed up from the other side of the planet. An equal counterpart to Rick’s guitar is the malleable voice of his sibling, Alan. The Bishops’ worldly travels clearly gave Alan an ear for all manner of singing styles, and on Torch he displays the vocal capabilities to match them. At times he sounds like he’s channeling ghosts of singers past, as in the worshipful warble of ""Space Prophet Dogon"" or the strikingly-beautiful scale-riding of ""The Shining Path"". The latter is a cover of Bolivian folk song ""Llorando se feu"", and Sun City Girls’ treatment is typical of their magical way with covers. It retains the stirring mood of the original while transposing it to a more mysterious, fantastical realm (in this case, one haunted by the Spaghetti Western scores of Bishop hero Ennio Morricone). Yet as breathtaking as his singing can be, some of Alan’s most moving vocal performances come when he yells, hums, and moans, reaching for a higher plane while simultaneously conveying pristine beauty. That pursuit is all over Torch of the Mystics, and a big part of what makes it great. It’s as much about the profundity of disorder as the clarity of structure. Though the latter may be more obvious on first listen, dig in deep and the trio’s love of surprise and confusion emerge loudly. Many tracks teeter on the edge of explosion, straddling the line between inspiration and insanity. Four of the songs were completely improvised, and all were recorded in single takes, but the album’s unity emerges from the band’s persistent vision. Torch of the Mystics finds a point at which chaos and order meet to become a third path—one that, in this thrilling and still-vital incarnation, only Sun City Girls could discover.","Torch of the Mystics is Sun City Girls’ best-loved album. It's replete with moments of hypnotic tunefulness stretched into songs that feel as classic and well-worn as the dusty cassettes the band uncovered on their travels around the globe. Long out of print, it's been resissued on CD and vinyl.

Teens of Style,Car Seat Headrest,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13d13d197565213a5c8/1:1/w_160/ef35505e.jpg,2015-10-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21121-teens-of-style/,Matador,"Will Toledo isn't old, but he's feeling his age. He's in debt; his friends are getting married; his hands are frozen; he's stuck in the city; and worst of all, his songs are starting to sound the same. The world is moving past him, blurring into formlessness, and his music as Car Seat Headrest is an attempt to slow down and make sense of the rush. Teens of Style is technically a compilation, comprising songs dating back to 2011 that were re-recorded for his Matador debut. (Teens of Denial, a planned 2016 release, will be his first Matador album of entirely new material.) You can hear the revised sound as a composite of the label's history: Guided by Voices' ear for cracked pop oddities, Belle and Sebastian's emotional directness, Yo La Tengo's intimate approach to jamming, Stephen Malkmus' ability to get wordy without forgetting to rock out. As a songwriter, Toledo is both present and detached, capable of living in a moment while floating above it. A self-summarization comes on the brawny ""Strangers"", when he deadpans a series of autobiographical quips: ""Car seat is a menace to the public,"" ""Car seat is a genetic stop sign,"" ""Car seat's nervous and the lights are bright."" On that song, we find out the young Toledo fell in love with Michael Stipe: ""I took lyrics out of context and thought, 'he must be speaking to me.'"" His confusion over purposefully abstract lyrics may have turned him into a literalist, someone endeavoring to explain every twist and turn of his interior state. His lyrics are rapaciously intelligent, with a knack for wry humor. Take a lyrical adjustment on the new recordings, for example, that reflects the shift in his life status: ""Times to Die"" swaps a couplet about sneaking his way to musical success into a meditation on the existence of a higher power, like God or (even better) Matador founder Chris Lombardi (""Got to have faith in the one above me/ Got to believe that Lombardi loves me""), who will help decide whether or not Toledo is destined to be a cult hero. Teens of Style has a noticeably jagged quality; unbelievably, it used to sound even DIY-ier. (The original versions can be found on Car Seat's Bandcamp.) The new recordings retain their rough edge, but there's luminescence in the production—the percussion is crisper, the guitars are brighter, and Toledo's singing is a lot more pronounced. The effect is an album that's bookish, but not sedentary. He sells abstruse metaphors and lyrical concepts with every ounce of himself, like failing to do so would mean the end of the world. In this way, he's a cousin of artists like Joanna Newsom, Bright Eyes, or Okkervil River, who never let their prodigious literary intelligence get in the way of crafting something you might actually enjoy listening to. To (sort of) quote Brandon Flowers: He's human and rocker. The existential despair of ""Something Soon"" is crystallized in a blown-out chorus, while he uses a hypnotic keyboard line to make the haunting ""Maud, You're Gone"" a prom song for moody kids. A spectral choir comes through a radio at the start of ""Sunburned Shirts"" before breaking into a scratchy pop gem, like George Harrison on anti-depressants (""I haven't looked at the sun for so long/ I forgot how much it hurt to""). Toledo's voice is weary, and carries a shred of desperation—he sounds like a third-generation cassette tape recording of Julian Casablancas (who, otherwise, is his complete opposite as a frontman). Earlier this month, I went to a Car Seat Headrest show held as part of the annual CMJ Music Marathon, where dozens of bands go to make their reputations. But Toledo began the set lying on the floor, with his microphone angled toward the ground, as the band launched into ""The Ending of Dramamine"", a 14-minute epic where he references Modest Mouse and sings about only thinking about himself. If you weren't standing right at the stage, you couldn't see him. The words flowed from the void, sung by someone so overwhelmed by the moment he would rather disappear. I couldn't absorb them all at once but what I remember is the crowd standing on their toes, edging their way forward, hoping to catch a glimpse. Then, he stood up.","Teens of Style is the Matador debut of Will Toledo, a young songwriter who blends the cracked pop oddity of Guided by Voices with the emotional directness of Belle and Sebastian. His lyrics are rapaciously intelligent and self-aware, but he never lets his prodigious literary intelligence get in the way of crafting enjoyably off-kilter, anthemic rock songs.

Gahdamn! EP,DRAM,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e9ea9e61561daa6849/1:1/w_160/ae910691.png,2015-10-28 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21226-gahdamn-ep/,AtlanticW.A.V.E. Recordings,"The Virginia singer/rapper D.R.A.M. positions himself as a larger-than-life character. On the cover of his new Gahdamn! EP he appears in comic-book form, standing several stories tall and smacking down a Godzilla-type creature. In the middle of the EP is a ""Redemption THEME"", which sounds like the music you would hear as Mario finally rescues Princess Peach after many unsuccessful tries in other castles. In this narrative, he's a righteous hero who exploded into the public consciousness with a song that sampled ""Super Mario World"", had Beyoncé dancing, and, directly or not, influenced Drake’s biggest hit since 2013. This triumphant storyline makes a lot of sense, but since D.R.A.M. has remained under the radar since, it’s a fair question to ask: Can he escape ""Cha Cha""? The Gahdamn! EP, much like this year’s previous #1 Epic Summer EP, isn't designed to answer questions. It's a fun, high-energy record that crisscrosses hip-hop, R&B, soul, electronic music, and even rock for about half an hour. Nothing is as immediate as ""Cha Cha"", but D.R.A.M. has other things up his sleeve. The remix of ""$"" replaces the original’s minimal piano and reverb with a bombastic horn section that builds around the earworm hook, ""this be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money."" It’s a swelling, giant moment that seems to fit squarely with the persona D.R.A.M. is selling and the company he’s keeping. However, he also goes some weird places. On ""Wit the Shits"", D.R.A.M. resembles no one more than Biz Markie, a punch-drunk presence on the mic who speak-raps his way around a song about doing drugs with a girl who also likes doing drugs. On the sweet, vintage-sounding R&B cut ""I’ll Be Back Again"" he toes a line between silliness and earnestness, singing the line ""I really be contemplating on coming inside of you,"" punctuated with a ""woo!"" He recalls (and maybe parodies) the lighthearted bluntness of the most honest ""baby-making"" soul songs. (""I really be contemplating on making new life with you"" is another great line here.) SZA gives voice to the implied female presence on the other end of the gorgeous ""Caretaker"", which originally appeared as an interlude on Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment’s Surf. This moment, expertly sequenced as the EP’s penultimate track, underlines the artist I think D.R.A.M. wants to be—an outsized musical omnivore who mixes Maxwell-style neo-soul with Too $hort-style frankness. He ends with the mission statement ""Okden"", expressing a wish to collaborate with Kendrick Lamar (""but it must be special""), touching on working with Rick Rubin, and managing a quick line about his appearnce: ""I step in places all dreaded like ‘he must be ghetto,’"" which is the closest we get to glimpsing the ""real"" D.R.A.M. outside of viral hits and the self-conscious weirdness. Gahdamn! is D.R.A.M.'s second release in the year that feels playful and low-stakes, and it would be nice if he made something that felt more... complete. But even when he doesn’t re-capture the madness of his biggest hit, he ignites a few other fires. Gahdamn! is a breezy sprint through many styles, demonstrating a multi-faceted artist putting all his influences in a basket, shaking them around, and seeing what comes out the other end.","The Virginia singer/rapper D.R.A.M. exploded into the public consciousness with ""Cha Cha"", a song that sampled ""Super Mario World"", had Beyoncé dancing, and influenced Drake’s ""Hotline Bling"".

Songs of Lament EP,Yautja,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16d9d034d5c69bf49fd/1:1/w_160/83aadae3.png,2015-10-27 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21151-songs-of-lament-ep/,Forcefield,"Technical progress is vital to metal's character. Metal bands have always pushed themselves to be faster, heavier, more challenging, and more musically dextrous than their predecessors. That said, it's still rare when an act genuinely succeeds at altering the meta-structure of the form. Anytime a Meshuggah or Dillinger Escape Plan comes along, you can bet dime-a-dozen imitators will cheapen the impact of their innovations. To make matters worse, today we're swarmed by retro-obsessed bands hell-bent on recreating the vibe and tone of, well, name any year and heavy metal subgenre. Not to mention that rampant sectarianism fosters a mentality where superficial differences between camps become paramount and crossing barriers becomes a transgression. Every now and again, though, a band comes along that sidesteps these conventions. With their debut album, last year's Songs of Descent, Nashville trio Yautja (named after the extraterrestrial creature from the Predator film series) reminds us that what we think of as metal today can be as boundless and mutable as the range that jazz had encompassed by 1970. A prog-minded act that combines grindcore and Amphetamine Reptile-era noise with the artier shades of hardcore and death metal, Yautja doesn't just stack hairpin turn after hairpin turn—an approach that was tired by technical death metal's mid-'90s peak. Instead, bassist Kayhan Vaziri, guitarist Shibby Poole, and drummer Tyler Coburn create a highly malleable, mercury-like alloy that changes shape with liquid ease yet retains the solidity of its structure. (The way their music moves, it might've been more fitting for these guys to name themselves after the villian in Terminator 2.) As its title suggests, the new EP Songs of Lament was crafted as a companion piece to the full-length, but there are some key distinctions. For starters, Lament leans closer to a grimier, more punkish production aesthetic. Meanwhile, because Yautja came out of the gate with a flair for tempo changes, the lean toward slower sections this time around doesn't seem drastic. With Songs of Lament, Yautja once again shows that, like the art of the fastball, sheer speed is most effective when a band can mix up its delivery and hit you from unexpected angles. Case in point: Songs of Lament closes with the nine minute-plus ""Crumbling"", which climaxes in a sludge/doom buildup where Poole and Vaziri churn out an ominous riff at a crawling tempo. When Coburn suddenly explodes into a flurry of fills, followed by a blast beat and a jazzy double-time figure on the ride cymbal, the song feels like it's taking off even as it trudges through muck. That one passage speaks volumes about Yautja's mindfulness when it comes pacing. In fact, one marked contrast between Lament and its predecessor is that the EP plays like an extended suite of music. As for subject matter, all three of Yautja's members write lyrics and supply vocals, with Vaziri doing the lion's share of the barking. And while the cutting lyrical content does linger at the irate end of the emotional spectrum, Yautja's nonpartisan musical approach lends the words a more sophisticated hue by default. Understandably, Songs of Lament doesn't accomplish as much as its full-length companion does in terms of furthering metal's evolution. Moreover, the new material is rendered somewhat two-dimensional by a mix that sounds flatter in comparison to Songs of Descent's full-fidelity production. Still, the new songs certainly show what this band is capable of when it makes subtle tweaks in its approach to structure. Indeed, Songs of Lament extends the pleasures of the debut while whetting the appetite for what new wrinkles Yautja might have in store the next time around.","The Nashville trio Yautja are a prog-minded band that combines grindcore and Amphetamine Reptile-era noise with the artier shades of hardcore and death metal. Their Songs Of Lament EP, a sort of companion to last year's Songs of Descent LP, plays like an extended suite.

Under the Same Sky,Basic Soul Unit,by: Christine Kakaire,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e4ea9e61561daa683d/1:1/w_160/2970b0de.jpg,2015-10-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21223-under-the-same-sky/,Dekmantel,"Anyone with an interest in left-of-center house or techno can find something impressive in the catalog of Stuart Li, aka Basic Soul Unit. It's a testament to Li's chameleonic nature that he has proven a seamless fit with the cult Japanese deep house imprint Mule Musiq; the UK bass driven techno label Nonplus Records; Berlin behemoth Ostgut Ton; and Jamal Moss' purposefully abstract Mathematics Recordings. Each of these labels has successfully staked out a patch of deep and slightly weird dance music territory, and Li's edgy-yet-accessible style has endeared him to the DJs who also reside there; he appeals to selectors of many stripes, as his productions consistently come to life when thundering down towards darkened dancefloors. It is Li's professionalism that ends up being the slight undoing of Under the Same Sky, his second artist album and debut release for Amsterdam tastemakers Dekmantel. This is the toughest-sounding version of Basic Soul Unit thus far, with walloping techno drums, old school breakbeats, and industrial percussion that replicates the grind of machinery and the scraping of metal on metal. However, he ends up drawing unwelcome attention to the downside of his talents. Li's sound is so tailored to the blast of monitor speakers and big club rigs that it bogs down under closer inspection, revealing pixelated weaknesses in the bigger picture. There are some exceptions where Li seems prepared to throw some dirt and grit into the mix, and it's always for the greater good. The slowly menacing ""Until the End Comes"" very suddenly inhabits all three dimensions, cleverly allowing a 90-second introduction of measured static and pillowy bass drum to then click into a full-bodied and richly textured version of itself. In a similar way, ""Restless in Thoughts"" works to makes disorientation seem balanced and appealing, circling around lopsided dubby loops and itchy percussive accents, and it glows with warmth. While lacking the qualities of those two tracks, ""Temptress"" and ""Without Fears"" will appeal to fans of Skudge and Levon Vincent, who aren't at all concerned with separating the swing of house from the gruff ruggedness of techno. Elsewhere on the album, Li is to be found mostly returning to the same sound palette. ""The Rift Between"", ""Unwavered"", and ""Landlocked"" may look to broken beats, classic techno, and electro, but they're all a little too bleak, too clean and undynamic. ""Fate in Hand"" may well be an attempt to alleviate some of the grayness toward the album's end, but its overbearing drums are too present to be enjoyable, and not textured enough to provide a good counterweight to the track's delicate and Detroit-indebted melody. Each track of Under the Same Sky will undoubtedly find a home in a record bag or set list somewhere, and rightly so, as there's really nothing fundamentally wrong with any of them. As an album, though, Under the Same Sky leaves you wanting more of a moody, immersive experience, and less of its clean surfaces and precise negative spaces.","Producer Stuart Li has been a source for left-of-center techno and house for years, for a variety of dance labels.

RIP Chrysalis,Eartheater,by: J. Edward Keyes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b29d034d5c69bf4a6f/1:1/w_160/a5a3550b.jpg,2015-10-27 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21187-rip-chrysalis/,Hausu Mountain,"Alexandra Drewchin has roughly 100 different voices, and she employs all of them to chilling effect on RIP Chrysalis, her second record as Eartheater. There’s the high, weeping one that turns up at the beginning of the icy psyh-Appalachia ballad ""Petal Head""; there’s the bamboo-brittle alto that crackles menacingly at the center of the rippling ""Wetware"". And then there are all the others, rendered almost inhuman with digital effects: baritone-low and groaning, solemn and choir-like, chattering and mechanized. She layers them several at a time, so that it often seems like she’s in conversation with herself: two Drewchins—one way up high, one way down low—share the melody on""“Humyn Hymn"", making lyrics like, ""Chemical computer syringe/ Memories are fading away/ Rolling off the side of the bed,"" seem like they’re written in code that only the two singers understand. It’s a fitting approach for a record which, as its title implies, deals with personal transformation; later in ""Hymn"", Drewchin sings, ""The more I look back, the more I want to look ahead,"" and she spends the bulk of the album deep-diving into herself, delivering haunting descriptions of the shapes and spirits she encounters along the way. Arriving just eight months after the first Eartheater record, Metalepsis, Chrysalis displays a startling new firmness and depth to Drewchin’s songwriting. Where her first record felt more deliberately synthetic, making ample use of synthesizers and electronics, on Chrysalis, Drewchin operates from a base of American folk music. Dry-board banjos and plucked acoustic guitars form the foundation of most of the songs, leaving plenty of room through which Drewchin winds her snaking voice. There are still plenty of synths, but on Chrysalis, they augment rather than dominate. It’s as if Drewchin had raided The Anthology of American Folk Music but only absorbed the songs about ghosts. The closest recent comparison would be Cat Power’s Moon Pix, but Drewchin’s songs are more expansive and more free-form, showing hints of her time spent in the psych outfit Guardian Alien. One of the reasons Chrysalis is so fascinating and absorbing is because Drewchin obliterates the notion of song structure, starting from something as time-honored as folk, but bashing down the walls and ceiling around it to create music that feels mystical and searching. As much as it’s about personal change, Chrysalis also seems to be about discovering new ways of songwriting, one that leaves the borders porous and the time elastic. A fiddle corkscrews at the opening of the title track before Drewchin’s banjo takes over; eventually, the background is filled with the sound of a ringing telephone and a fog of electronics, a bleary canvas of sound that Drewchin’s ethereal alto gradually floats across. She recites the lyrics of the creeping ""Wetware""—""Deprogramming false fundamental makeup""—as if she’s casting a spell, while synths pulse like an android heartbeat behind her. And she begins ""Mask Therapy"" by repeating the words ""identity crisis"" over rippling, mirage-like guitar, a rhythm track that sounds like a failing air compressor thudding beneath. Songs enter and fade at their own pace, like clouds ribboning out across the sky at dusk. The album’s title can be read two ways—the tearing of the chrysalis that allows new life, and the death of the same once that new life has begun. On ""Ecdysisyphus"", she flatly declares, ""There’s a first time for everything/ More like, everything is the first time."" At first, it seems empty—the equivalent of a dorm room stoner’s bug-eyed command to ""Think about it, man."" But after hearing the record that follows, it feels like a profound personal declaration. RIP Chrysalis is the sound of someone figuring themselves out in real time, making all of their distinct voices harmonize, and creating new musical forms to share their discoveries.","Alexandra Drewchin has roughly 100 different voices, and she employs all of them to chilling effect on RIP Chrysalis, her second record as Eartheater.

Muscle Up,Patrick Cowley,by: Barry Walters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13cea9e61561daa674c/1:1/w_160/8cc7e6e5.jpg,2015-10-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21120-muscle-up/,Dark Entries,"Like Arthur Russell, another cult hero whose status rose years after he died of AIDS, San Francisco’s Patrick Cowley was known during his short lifetime for left-of-center disco; with songs like ""Menergy"" and ""Megatron Man"", he was the prime architect of the uptempo electronic disco variant Hi-NRG, later popularized by hits like Dead or Alive’s ""You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"". Also like Russell, Cowley’s roots were avant-garde; where Russell's lineage came from experimental classical composers like Christian Wolff, Cowley drew inspiration from early Moog masters Tomita, Wendy Carlos, and Tangerine Dream. Unlike Russell, however, some of Cowley's work reached the mainstream: What Giorgio Moroder was to Donna Summer, Cowley was to LGBT pioneer Sylvester—the mustachioed background figure who contemporized a disco diva’s hot soul with cool technology. Yet unbeknownst to even most of his disco fans, Cowley also created synth compositions in the even-more-underground medium of gay porn. Muscle Up is the second of two releases compiling this work, spanning time spent as a student at the City College of San Francisco to the period shortly before his death in 1982, when he scored his final smashes with Sylvester, Paul Parker, Loverde, and other Bay Area acts. As with 2013's School Daze, it takes its name from a real 1980 porn film, released by L.A.'s Fox Studio, that Cowley soundtracked. The music here documents an important cultural shift: As Super 8 gave way to VHS, DVD, and digital, much of gay and straight porn music alike would be synth-centric. Like porn itself, electronic music references reality while signaling a fantastical break from it. For gay men born in the '50s like Cowley, synths suggested a refuge from repression, an escape hatch from a world where police entrapped, beat, and jailed them; where they lost their jobs or unwillingly severed family ties. This is one of the reasons why synth-disco milestones like Summer's ""I Feel Love""—a track Cowley further intensified in his legendary 15+ minute remix—resonated so strongly with gay dancers of its era: Synth music was dream/sci-fi music, and it competed with R&B at the bathhouses where its suspension of time and space heightened the otherworldliness of unlimited sexual expression central to pre-AIDS gay experience, as if every man-on-man encounter after Stonewall and before Plague was a trip to the moon. Appropriately, the first track of Muscle Up, ""Cat's Eye"", begins with a whooshing interplanetary-wind sound, and the ominous processional tom-toms that follow lets us know that sex is about to happen in the furtive way animals anticipate an earthquake. Cowley's keys ape ceremonial trumpets much like the pseudo-horn fanfare that opens Devo's Duty Now for the Future. That was 1979; this piece was allegedly recorded in '75. The recording is crude and there's a moment of cacophony when two martial drum patterns crossfade and collide, but even this accidental frisson suggests porn's glitchy, clandestine low-budget production values. As a former drummer who switched to synths (but plays everything here besides didgeridoo and a bit of bass), Cowley comprehended both discipline and exploration. There's little on Muscle Up that sounds robotic; ""5oz of Funk"" echoes the syncopated beat and bass from Patti Jo's ""Make Me Believe in You"". Only once do machines keep time, on a 1975 instrumental demo version of ""Somebody to Love Tonight"", a song that Cowley revisited four years later with Sylvester, yielding understated but profoundly aching results. Even at this stage, it's supremely sultry, simmering with desires then considered utterly vile beyond the San Francisco bubble. Today, the city's technology occupies a different kind of frontier, one often driven by motives not entirely artistic. And so it's instructive to hear what one guy then just blocks away from where Twitter now resides created with far cruder but perhaps more sensitive, pre-digital tools some 40 years ago. Rather than clean precision, he gets dirty invention, overheated homage. Instead of considered silences between notes, there's the strong suggestion of one man's impulsive sweat and spunk and stink. Cowley's interplanetary sex music is paradoxically earthy for the same reason his parallel cosmic club grooves were so righteous; because it reveled in freedoms long denied.","San Francisco’s Patrick Cowley produced left-of-center disco classics for Sylvester and others and pioneered the uptempo disco variant hi-NRG. He also composed all-synth soundtracks for gay porn films, which are collected here. Even with their primitive, glitchy programming, these synth pieces are supremely sultry, reveling in freedoms long denied.

Dillatronic,J Dilla,by: Mosi Reeves,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1749d034d5c69bf4a0a/1:1/w_160/f153af29.jpeg,2015-10-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21156-dillatronic/,Vintage Vibez Music Group,"During his brief lifetime, James ""J Dilla"" Yancey produced thousands of tracks. As Erykah Badu, who worked with him on her Mama's Gun album, once said during a RBMA lecture, Dilla made ""beats all day long."" He collected many of them onto CDs, and handed them out to friends and colleagues. These ""beat tapes"" had begun circulating across the Internet by the time he passed in 2006 at the age of 32. Dilla's work has since become fodder for dozens of compilations, posthumous ""collaborations"" like the 2013 album Sunset Blvd. with Frank Nitt and his brother Illa J, and unnecessary reissues like a ""badge-shaped"" Record Store Day 2015 version of his 2001 12-inch ""Fuck the Police"". The Yancey estate has also begun issuing his beats in raw form, without vocals. (Before, they were available as ""instrumental"" accompaniments to projects like Rebirth of Detroit, which paired Dilla's beats with newly recorded vocals by various rappers.) Last year's The King of Beats: Ma Dukes Collector's Box Set boasted some memorable packaging—it included four 10-inch records, a cassette, and a floppy disk formatted for an E-mu SP-1200 sampler keyboard—as well as an imposing $207.74 price tag. The King of Beats, as well as 2013's Lost Tapes Reels + More, and now Dillatronic are like sketchbooks from a widely recognized master of the art form. On the latter, each track bears the spartan title ""Dillatronic 01"", et cetera. According to its promotional materials, Dillatronic represents his ""electronic-influenced"" material, but that's a loose theme at best. There is nothing here as gloriously techno as ""Nothing Like This"" from the 2003 EP Ruff Draft, or the Kraftwerk homage ""B.B.E. (Big Booty Express)"" from his 2001 album as Jay Dee, Welcome 2 Detroit. If anything, many of these virtually unnamed and undated ""beats batches"" float along like the rudimentary, keyboards-and-bass-drums beats of late-'90s indie rap producers like Shawn J. Period and 88-Keys. Most have a running time of around two to three minutes, while a few last less than a minute. Yet in total, they bear traces of his superior instincts. There are echoes of better-known productions here: the penetrating synth keyboard of ""Dillatronic 10"" is reminiscent of ""E=MC2"" from The Shining, and track 35 unfolds a neo-soul guitar groove that evokes his work on Phat Kat's ""Dedication to the Suckers"". With its enchanting yet disembodied chorus of ""ooohs,"" ""14"" is like a distant cousin of Slum Village's ""Get Dis Money"". ""29"" whips a blaxploitation funk lick around a sample of M.O.P.'s ""Ante Up"", while a sample of Whodini's ""Escape (I Need a Break)"" girds the hallucinatory track 34. The latter is one of the more fully realized electronic instrumentals included here, but there are others, like the ""Tetris""-like effects on ""22"", and the ghostly electro on ""24"" that cruelly ends in 45 seconds. A few of these files suggest paths unexplored. ""05"", which only lasts a minute and three seconds, weds a bhangra-like melody to a drum kit. It's an avenue Dilla's close friend Madlib explored more fully on his Beat Konducta in India. ""31"" builds like a '70s horror cut (or perhaps a porno flick?) around an unnamed woman breathing ""No"" as a solitary keyboard sound throbs creepily. ""33"" weaves around a sped-up recording of a voices chirping as if out of The Wizard of Oz. Dilla's familiar techniques are evident, like his frequent use of air sirens and hard, slapping percussion. He speaks only once, near the end of the minute-and-three-second track ""39"". ""Yeah! Bounce with a nigga!"" he commands to us over loping bass and spacey keyboard effects. This might be a data dump of studio experiments, not a cohesive Donuts-like experience that casual listeners might crave. But admirers of this brilliantly inventive musician will find much to rhyme over, get inspired by, or simply bounce to on Dillatronic.","During his brief lifetime, James ""J Dilla"" Yancey produced thousands of tracks.

Sleepwalker,Long Beard,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c9b1335d7bf169a332/1:1/w_160/97064567.jpg,2015-10-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21206-sleepwalker/,Team Love,"Sleepwalker, the debut by New Brunswick's Long Beard, is a romantically restless record, but in an inward, idle way. Their reverb-laden dream-pop calls to mind Azure Ray, Yo La Tengo, and Galaxie 500, and it conceals an antsy yearning. ""You'd hide out for hours, dreaming of other rooms to lie in,"" lead singer Leslie Bear sings on ""Dream"". When Bear asks questions in her songs, as she often does, her inquiries seem more directed to the silence of her brain than to someone in front of her. ""If I ask politely, will you ask me the question of: who do you love?"" she sings on ""Porch"", repeating her question again and again. If there is a drama played out on Sleepwalker, it’s the sort being played out to a mirror, or a diary, or to a love interest’s face imagined in the ceiling above one’s bed. Sometimes the album meanders, shuffling around noncommittally before finding its footing. ""Turkeys"", ""Dream"", and ""Morning Ghost"" sound nearly made up on the spot, with their minimalist set-up of noodling electric guitars and pitter-patter percussion not quite synchronized. And on ""Moths"", Bear’s voice is obscured by scratchy, layered guitar and the watery echoes of her own already-breathy vocals. They sound like a band not trying to find their voice, but to project the one they have with confidence. Bear's voice is a literal manifestation of that hesitance: She’ll draw out words until they’re so high-pitched and thin that they seem to evaporate into the rest of the track mid-song, becoming hard to decipher. ""Alone in the dark, is it more alone, than alone in the light,"" she sings on ""Hates the Party"", every word spoken firmly as if they exist alone on the page, until ""light,"" heightened in her sing-song and suddenly like another instrument. Sleepwalker is a very cozy record, full of porch-sitting, moth-watching, sunset-watching. It even ends with a warped rendition of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"". Bear said in an interview that she ended up writing most of these songs ""very late when everyone else was asleep,"" which is exactly when you should be listening to this album. Sleepwalker doesn’t quite feel polished, or take many risks, but Long Beard is good at making the music that sounds best played in a lit bedroom, late at night, on a suburban street when everyone else is snoozing in their beds.","New Brunswick's Long Beard makes romantically restless dream pop with shades of Azure Ray and Galaxie 500.

Communion,Rabit,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fac0084474cd0c1d3b/1:1/w_160/39ec38c2.jpg,2015-10-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21081-communion/,Tri Angle,"Rabit (Eric Burton) is from Texas, and though his music has generally maintained a loose dialogue with UK grime, it has also increasingly nurtured its own identity. His early work found an uneasy midpoint between violence and grace: On 2013's Sun Showers EP, misty synths crept on cat feet, surrounded by jabbing, staccato rhythms. This year's Baptizm EP, his first for Tri Angle, amped up both his tendencies in equal measure, but on Communion the truce has broken, and all hell breaks loose. Communion is definitely not grime, even with the genre's telltale signifiers—bruised 808 kicks, broken-glass and gun-cock samples, lurching 140-BPM tempos. It's definitely not industrial, either, though it draws inspiration from the queasy frequencies of acts like Throbbing Gristle and Coil. It is violent music, and even though part of living in the 21st century entails being desensitized to all kinds of mediated awfulness, Communion feels genuinely unsettling: You emerge even after just a few minutes' worth of the album's unrelenting barrage of beats and palette of sampled shrapnel feeling dazed and punch-drunk. Needless to say, it is also thrilling, even when it leaves a sick pit in your stomach. The sullen melodies are studiously minor key, and with the exception of the occasional desolate spoken-word fragment (""The flesh covers the bone""; ""There aren't any people"") there are no vocals, just yelps of distress. In ""Fetal"", the listener swings to and fro as though lashed to a pendulum above a riot, between machine-gun rhythms and gibbering voices and a whinnying horse. These juxtapositions offer their own kind of enjoyment, but he's not afraid to fight against pleasure, either: ""Pandemic"" is plodding and heavy-footed, and its climactic machine-gun volley is so intense that it is no fun, but you suspect that's the point. It's not all brutal, exactly. The opening ""Advent"" features a sad synth melody reminiscent of the Cure's ""A Forest"", and ""Artemis"" toys with tentative vocal samples reminiscent of Laurie Anderson's ""O Superman"". ""Burnerz"" and ""Black Gates"" feel almost like traditional grime tunes, with their concussive kicks and synth stabs, and ""Trapped in This Body"" might be deconstructed drum'n'bass, with pitched-down sirens and beaten-up tech-step framed by radiophonic bleeps. These are welcome respites; if the album has a drawback, it's that the grim consistency of its palette and techniques leads many songs to blur together in your memory. Still, I'm guessing that is by design. Communion plays out like a kind of fever dream, a delirium of cold sweat and disturbing visions in which there are only brief moments of daylight before you're plunged back into the maelstrom once more.","Rabit is the producer Eric Burton.

Angels & Ghosts,Dave GahanSoulsavers,by: T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13a9d034d5c69bf49be/1:1/w_160/cf0d3c31.jpg,2015-10-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21119-angels-ghosts/,Columbia,"For nearly four decades now, Dave Gahan has been the predominant vocalist in Depeche Mode. As such, Gahan's voice has only grown stronger over the years—deeper, more controlled, and more iconic. During this time, that voice has mostly been employed in the service of someone else's songs, that person being Depeche Mode co-conspirator and the band's primary songwriter Martin Gore. It only makes sense that at some point—namely, around the time of 2005's Playing the Angel—that Gahan would want a more active role. Outside of the band, he would eventually release two solo albums—2003's Paper Monsters and 2007's Hourglass—and two collaborations with Soulsavers (aka British producer Rich Machin). Angels & Ghosts is Gahan's second full-length album with Soulsavers. Much like 2012's The Light the Dead See, the record offers an opportunity for Gahan to stretch his legs creatively and shake off some of the baggage that a band with a 35-year history like Depeche Mode invariably has to carry around. In doing so, Gahan and co. largely abandon heavy electronics in favor of something resembling blues rock and gospel-infused Americana, complete with churchy backup singers and quietly shaken tambourines. The album opens with ""Shine""—a kind of stomping, slide-guitar heavy slow burner in which Gahan imbues a ridiculous line like ""when you look around, it's so profound, what we can do"" with a kind of gravitas that only someone with his particular pipes can pull off, but it still feels like a lightweight version of Depeche Mode's ""I Feel You"". ""You Owe Me"" could be a distant cousin to Chris Isaak's ""Wicked Game""—all midnight hues and romantic yearning—while ""One Thing"" is the kind of piano-driven ballad that you could almost imagine popping up on a Depeche Mode record. ""Just lay down next to me,"" Gahan sings, ""We can watch those tasteless shows on our TV."" It's the kind of 'no one understands us and it's us against the world forever' track that Gahan has made a career out of perfectly articulating, but in the end the entire thing gets punched in the face by a chorus lyric so hackneyed that one wonder how on earth it actually made it onto the record: ""You just need one thing/ Love."" As a frontman, Gahan is a marvel of preening and grandstanding, which means that he actually shines on tracks that aren't afraid to get all messianic and pump up the melodrama. In that sense, the album's lead track, ""All of This and Nothing"" (despite also famously being the title of a Psychedelic Furs song and album) is perfect for him. The song is populated by black waters, heavy storms, and ghosts that hover continuously outside of windows, which means it's classic territory for Gahan. ""I'm all of this and nothing/ I'm the dirt beneath your feet/ I'm the sun that rises while you're sleeping/ I'm all you need"" he sings, sounding for the first time like the kind of equally doomed and exalted kind of character that he embodies so well. If there's something decidedly lacking on Angels & Ghosts, it's more of his famously gothy bravado. Gahan clearly has a predilection for casting himself as the tortured sinner (""One hand in my pocket/ One foot in the grave/ Standing here, waiting to be saved""), but the nine tracks here—packed full of twangy guitars and tastefully deployed string sections—reach for a kind of holy redemption that they don't ever actually earn. Angels & Ghosts isn't a bad record, but it's frustratingly tepid. Superfans will still find pleasure in hearing Gahan's voice tear through these songs. But at this point, a truly radical departure—or even some kind of insanely catastrophic creative failure—would be more interesting than another selection of songs half-heartedly playing around with tired blues and gospel motifs. One certainly can't fault Gahan for needing his own private creative outlet, but at this point just writing more flatly on-the-nose songs about sin and faith and redemption doesn't sound refreshing or the least bit fun, but instead like something you've already heard him tackle a million times already.","For nearly four decades now, Dave Gahan has been the predominant vocalist in Depeche Mode. Angels & Ghosts is Gahan's second full-length album with Soulsavers, and it largely abandons heavy electronics in favor of something resembling blues rock and gospel-infused Americana, complete with churchy backup singers and quietly shaken tambourines.

But the U.S. release this fall of Humaine, repackaged as a self-titled debut, marks her introduction to the American market: Some of the French lyrics were redone in English, accompanied by a couple of Anglophone bonus tracks. As with the French edition, the record starts with an unequivocal declaration of her arrival. ""I'm a man now,"" she sings in a bold voice on ""iT"", ""And there's nothing you can do to make me change my mind."" A few verses later, she offers up a line whose regal, gory quality seems worthy of Lorde or Kanye: ""I'll rule over all my dead impersonations."" Out of context, it sounds like a very 2015 pop move: burying past incarnations of yourself that the public never even witnessed and calling yourself king from the off, fueled by nothing but divine belief in your own selfhood. Letissier has the chops and charisma to pull off this role, too: ""iT"" has gorgeous minimal production—just a sputtering beat, tarnished synth glimmers, and canny employ of sprite-like backing vocals. Her expressive voice leads the lone melody, at first vulnerable and then rasping with defiance. But it's a feint: Letissier spends the next 11 songs pulling back from this grandstanding (which was inspired by her discarding her feminine identity as a teenager) to explore the nuances of her queer identity and what that means in private and public spheres. On the way, she comes out with some pin-sharp lyrics to rival collaborator Perfume Genius' ""no family is safe when I sashay,"" full of daring and vulnerable truths. ""Science Fiction"" unravels on spacey burbles that underpin the alienation she and her partner feel when out in public: ""They look at me when I stare at you... In this sea of eyes, every move's a coup."" Letissier reclaims the discrimination she experiences for not passing as a prescribed gender ideal on ""Half Ladies"", which moves between percussive gasps indebted to Michael Jackson and pared-back, angular funk: ""Every insult I hear back/ Darkens into a beauty mark."" That particular image seems to reference the source of her own liberation. A few years ago, beset by depression, Letissier ran away from college in Paris and crossed the Channel to London, where she was taken under the wing of three Soho drag artists. They heard her humming and encouraged her to make music, so she locked herself away for weeks, garrote-style, as she taught herself to write. Letissier named her act Christine and the Queens in tribute to her saviors, an act that also highlights her knack for self-mythologizing. At the end of Christine and the Queens, there is a second arrival, ""Here"", a work of unbroken tension hooked around disintegrating, crackling beats and an organ's glow. She sings, in French, ""I evolve in living trace."" The production of Christine and the Queens follows that mystical sense of becoming. Most of the songs are built from tapestries of microbeats that have an organic, sinewy feel, unfolding with the intricate flow of a centipede's spine. She often forms strong rhythms from a surprisingly delicate percussive backbone—""No Harm Is Done"" has a feather-light, trap-indebted beat that sounds as though it was sampled from recordings of magnesium fizzling across water. Tiny shifts in impact or intensity can have a massive effect: The simple beat that hardens halfway through ""Tilted"" adds a new level of confidence to Letissier's tale of a wonky but thriving relationship. It's a constellation of experience, the sense of a body being animated, twitching and jerking into existence. Letissier literally espouses the power of movement on ""Safe and Holy"", but the heavy beat and synth-scapes drown out the effect that flows naturally elsewhere. Letissier's melodic sensibility is as strong as her subtle percussion. ""Paradis Perdus"" is the work of a real pop scholar, an interpolation of Christophe's 1973 song ""Les Paradis Perdus"" and the chorus of Kanye West's ""Heartless"" that unites their common sense of loss over soft piano and a knocking beat. ""Jonathan"", Letissier's duet with Perfume Genius, confronts a lover whose internalized shame means that their relationship is only acknowledged by night. It's a song of immense grace, the funereal pace guided by exquisite synths and expanding strings. ""Can you walk with me in the daylight?"" Letissier asks, her head held high. Christine and the Queens is a beautiful, important negotiation of these liminal states at a time when the media is quick to bandy about the term ""post-gender"" as if the hard work is done. Her music is bold and fully formed, but Letissier unpeels the façade of outer confidence to shine a light on the way that queer identity requires constant negotiation, to deal with the world's often unforgiving gaze and the one that can come from within—on ""Safe and Holy"", she admits that her own eyes ""mock and judge"" her. It's empowering, bold, and vulnerable, and made for dancing. Chaleur Humaine translates as ""human warmth"", and the album makes good on that intimacy. You get the sense of Letissier guarding her own precious, burgeoning fire, and inviting listeners to share in its glow.","Christine and the Queens is the project of the French synth-pop auteur Héloïse Letissier. Her bold, empowering, and danceable 2014 debut Chaleur Humaine, which features a collaboration with Perfume Genius, has been repackaged as a self-titled debut for her introduction to the American market.

Bad Neighbor,MadlibM.E.D.Blu,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1729d034d5c69bf4a06/1:1/w_160/4a24be5f.jpg,2015-10-26 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21155-bad-neighbor/,BangYaHead!,"Madlib’s calling card is his ability to spin obscure funk into woozy rap instrumentals. With the lack of precision and attention to mood, they feel out of time and slightly off-kilter, and they fit perfectly with artists like Erykah Badu and Georgia Anne Muldrow. Recently though, it seems the Cali composer has reined himself in a bit: 2014’s Piñata had all the grit you'd expect from Madlib, but it was crisper and recessive, allowing more space for Freddie Gibbs' menacing, in-the-pocket flows. He further restrains his sound on Bad Neighbor, a collaborative LP with rappers M.E.D. and Blu. This is a light-hearted jaunt, with the rappers leaping from topic to topic, as if passing a blunt between verses. Don’t expect anything profound here. At its core, B**ad Neighbor is about three dudes and their friends, spitting verses over great beats without sweating structure. The producer fits well into this free-flowing group. He also feeds off seemingly random ideas, connecting dots between misplaced vocal clips and Afro-rock samples, and despite his talents he can be easy to take for granted. M.E.D. had a nice showing on 2004’s Madvillainy, the revered outing from MF DOOM and Madlib, but his output has been sparse from there. Blu has been incredibly prolific, but many of his releases are marred with improper mixing and unfocused rhymes, with as many standouts (Below the Heavens, Her Favorite Colo(u)r) as bricks, like Jesus. and the short-lived ucla. On their own, all of these guys are good but sometimes get overlooked. Bad Neighbor is their second release. In 2013, the trio put out The Burgundy EP, powered by the fluid single ""Burgundy Whip"". That song re-emerges near the end of Bad Neighbor, but it feels like an afterthought compared with the stronger, more vivid material around it. ""Peroxide"", featuring Dâm-Funk and DJ Rome, resembles ""Planet Rock""-era electro-funk, and the MCs bounce nimbly atop its darting synthetics. ""The Stroll"" flashes a bright, disorienting synth like a flood light, the beat so full of little noises it's like an event itself. Anderson .Paak, the grit-voiced singer/rapper who featured prominently on Dr. Dre's Compton and who recently dropped his own noteworthy EP, appears almost out of nowhere on Bad Neighbor track ""The Strip"", lending his strained voice to the proceedings. There are a few appearances like that, and they feel purposefully casual, allowing everyone to thrive on their own terms. On ""Finer Things"", Foreign Exchange frontman Phonte Coleman sings the hook and raps about adult romance. MF DOOM shows up on ""Knock Knock"" to offer his signature disconnected one-liners. Bad Neighbor whizzes by in a blunted haze, which might be an insult to another project, but it works well here, when the stakes are low and the mood is most important.","The second collaboration between M.E.D., Madlib, and Blu is a lighthearted jaunt, with the rappers leaping from topic to topic, as if passing a blunt between verses.

Cardinal,Philip Jeck,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a3b1335d7bf169a2f3/1:1/w_160/a40f9fe7.jpg,2015-10-23 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21183-cardinal/,Touch,"At their best, the records of experimental British composer and producer Philip Jeck can make you reimagine the way you hear the world. For most of his career, Jeck has used the record and the record player as both primary inspiration and chief instrument. He processes the static sounds archived on forgotten LPs, sampling and obfuscating the source material until it yields and blurs into new pieces. Though he uses little but effects pedals and processors to transmogrify the music, it can seem at times that Jeck physically warps the grooves themselves, turning concentric circles into Catherine wheels or paisley vectors or interconnected figure eights. If hip-hop’s architects sampled aging sounds to create their own modern world, Jeck uses many of the same tools to create an alternate, individual one that he then invites you to enter. Jeck had been at this for decades when, 13 years ago, he seemed to find an enviable stride. Released between 2002 and 2008, a triptych of records—Stoke, 7, and Sand—turned his tests into solo turntable symphonies, fully formed compositions meant to be inhabited and analyzed. Jeck merged the audio on the records with the essence of the records, creating new music that popped and cracked beneath the charm of vinyl antiquity. The process seemed to break linear time by giving a universe of lost voices and performances new life at once. You, the listener, went away with Jeck and his record-store finds for a pleasant spell. But on Cardinal, Jeck’s first new album in five years, that motion and those feelings have calcified a bit. The edges of his sources and samples have hardened, as though he’s confronting the harsh exigencies of the moment rather than escaping to the drift and peace of fantasy. The voices and instruments Jeck once built around slink into the background here, ceding instead to an unexpectedly discomfiting vision. Brittle dins and soft tones, beautiful drones and static shocks participate in a theater of revolving reality and intentional violence. Jeck indeed created Cardinal with turntables, a technique best heard here through the fractured loop that anchors ""Broke Up"" or the sunbaked wobble that defines ""The Station View"". These 13 tracks, however, often feel powered more by their accessories—""Casio keyboards, Ibanez bass guitar, Sony MiniDisc players, Ibanez and Zoom effects pedals, assorted percussion, a Behringer mixer,"" he lists—than the source records. There are jarring moments, as during the menacing ""Brief"" or the lurid ""Called In"", that suggest Jeck has suddenly slammed his palm against a distortion pedal, like some much younger noise lord gunning for the set’s climax. During ""Saint Pancras"", he seems to shake sleigh bells in the distance; pitted against the neon whirr of his electronics, the addition is strangely disconcerting, like a threat voiced from the lips of a longtime ally. That is the prevailing sentiment of Cardinal, an album where Jeck’s general sense of wonder slips toward dystopian bewilderment. The move makes for a more fragmented listen than expected from Jeck, whose albums are typically immersive and enchanting. Still, the transition comes with unlikely rewards. Rendered in short spans that overlap until they form casual rhythms, the hovering bass and shredded treble of the terrific, terrifying ""…bends the knee 1"" recall the successes of the Haxan Cloak’s Excavation. During ""Barrow in Furness (open thy hand wide)"", Jeck slowly mutates a simple carousel melody until it becomes a dense web of ghastly oscillations, a little like Prurient’s electro phase. Yes, those are surprising references for a British sexagenarian with highbrow bona fides, but again, Jeck’s music has always recast the established world in a singular image. Does it come as any mystery that, now more than ever, he would conjure a setting as or more odious than our own? Records are now in vogue in ways they’ve never been during Jeck's career. For decades, he repurposed a medium that seemed bound for obsolescence. At times, his use of the LP felt like a moral imperative, a valiant attempt to spin voices and ideas and forms that might be lost. But records, of course, have become such desirable commodities that it’s now difficult to have them made due to an overburdened market that once seemed destined for dismantling. It’s fitting, then, that this is one of the least turntable-centric albums of Jeck’s career, rendered so that you may be able to hear it all without guessing at the signal path at all. Rather than try to stake some here-first claim with vinyl or turn his past with it into new cachet or credibility, Jeck has used the turntable as a platform for exploring larger sounds and asking bigger questions. Cardinal is a break in his once clear direction, and it’s not his most cohesive album. But it is a logical and necessary leap for Jeck, who has always turned at oblique angles so as to reorder the sounds around him.","At their best, the records of experimental British composer and producer Philip Jeck can make you reimagine the way you hear the world.

Bizarster,Luke Vibert,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1beea9e61561daa6800/1:1/w_160/096b6cbd.jpg,2015-10-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21196-bizarster/,Planet Mu,"Thanks in part to a Trent Reznor co-sign, American electronica listeners were introduced to the peculiar talents of producer Luke Vibert in 1997 by Drum 'n' Bass for Papa. Released under his Plug alias, it wasn't his first album, but Vibert's caffeinated take on the still-underground dance form was given Interscope distribution. This meant that many stateside listeners were introduced to drum'n'bass via Vibert's goofy and furious rollercoaster tracks set to offbeat samples, like John Goodman's howling admonishment from Barton Fink: ""I'LL. SHOW. YOU. THE. LIFE. OF. THE. MIND."" Since then, Vibert has spun off aliases to match his productions, each one slotted to fit a particular genre. Wagon Christ signified the trippiest trip-hop, Amen Andrews made dizzying jungle, Kerrier District did filter disco. Albums under Vibert's proper name spread even further: Big Soup spanned breakbeat and downtempo, YosepH dipped into acid, while a compilation, Nuggets, found Vibert digging deep into library music. The lone constant throughout has been Vibert's corny humor, which comes up often on Bizarster, his first album for his peer Mike Paradinas' Planet Mu label in six years. ""Knockout"" flashes the tricky, skittering footwork of Paradinas and Aphex Twin, with left-field harp runs, analog synth bloops, and the requisite cheeky vocal sample (this one from Mike Tyson's Nintendo game ""Punch Out!!""). ""L Tronic"" uses the neon nightcrawler squiggle from Stone's ""Girl I Like the Way That You Move"", some more 8-bit bubbles, and an old hip-hop freestyle atop it. It's a formula that Vibert has done to death no matter the moniker: infectious drum programming, off-center synth melodies, and/or arcade game FX as the next layer, all topped off by vocal snippets from old records or old VHS movies. There's a soul sample, a railing preacher, and a howl to go with the crisp hi-hats and handclaps of ""Officer's Club"", a boast about ""[makin'] like the ghetto [to] blast ya"" sped up so as to move from menacing to cartoonish. Vocal lolz reach peak Vibert on ""I Can Phil It"", built from—as the punny title soon bears out—Phil Collins asking ""can you feel it?"" soon joined by the MC shout from the live version of Mr. Fingers' ""Can You Feel It?"", and all manner of ""feels"", piled up on a track that ultimately doesn't feel like much. In 2012, Vibert unearthed more of his Plug material, releasing it as Back on Time. Much like Bizarster, it's fun enough, but there's little to suggest it might not have been put to DAT in the late-'90s and dusted off nearly 20 years on, even though those jokey samples no longer land quite right. Strip the clever vocal snippets away from Vibert's productions and you're left with those choice drums and goofy melodies, but there's little beyond that to mind.","The Cornwallian drum'n'bass producer Luke Vibert has been deploying many of the same tricks for years, under his Plug alias among others: infectious drum programming, off-center synth melodies, and vocal snippets from old records or VHS movies. His latest, Bizarster, is fun enough, but there's little to suggest it might not have been put to DAT in the late-'90s and dusted off nearly 20 years on.

Deeper Than Sky,VHÖL,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1625e6ef95969322106/1:1/w_160/5006621a.jpg,2015-10-23 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21143-deeper-than-sky/,Profound Lore,"VHÖL are the ideal modern metal band—they fuse battle-tested forms of metal with impressive arrangements and a progressive fire that traditionalists and revivalists can't match. Their personel is bulletproof—John Cobbett and Sigrid Sheie hail from San Francisco's prog-power masters Hammers of Misfortune, Mike Scheidt is the vocalist and guitar player behind YOB, and Aesop Dekker is the black metal punker from Ludicra (where Cobbett also played) and Agalloch. All four involved have a rare, vital chemistry, and Deeper Than Sky keeps that fire alive while finding more ways to bend traditional metal formulas. This is the bar metal bands have less than two months to clear if they want to unseat them this year. One of the strongest tracks on their underrated self-titled debut was ""Arising"", which added a healthy dose of thrash, Thin Lizzy, and Rob Halford to VHÖL's alien version of black metal. Sky continues in this direction, with Cobbett focusing on the thrashier end of his playing. On opener ""The Desolate Damned"", he bends a conventional galloping rhythm just enough to render it strange. ""3 AM"" begins with 30 seconds of straightforward thrash, before VHÖL add choral screams and off-kilter soloing: In VHÖL's world, nothing can ever be simple. Scheidt is primarily known as a guitarist due to the popularity of YOB, but he continues to stick mostly to vocals here, and it suits the project. He sounds more liberated in VHÖL—there's life to his ""OOGHS!,"" his homages to Tom G. Warrior's signature grunts, and his death-thrash growls. The contrast between his rhythm and lead tones on the title track makes for a trippy thrash experience; VHÖL know how to disorient without obvious weed/space/psych/drugs signifiers. ""Red Chaos"" draws upon underrated Dallas thrashers Rigor Mortis, in particular their late guitarist Mike Scaccia, who also played in Ministry. Scaccia had an unrelenting rhythm hand that didn't sacrifice detail; Cobbett takes that same approach, creating soloing that isn't layered on so much as it protrudes through the rhythm. Sky's real gem, though, is ""Paino"", a d-beat piano instrumental. The idea seems gimmicky in the hands of lesser players, but Sheie and Dekker lock in with each other. Like in his other bands, Dekker provides just enough muscle to elevate Sheie while still making her the center of the song. There are big-bottomed rhythms and soloing that climaxes like the volcano George Lynch posed on for Dokken's ""Just Got Lucky"" video. Only metal could make this high-minded absurdity work; it's the intersection of straight-faced practice and boundless joy, and it's as much of a metal song as anything run through miles of Marshalls. Leave it to VHÖL to find another dimension to the ever-bountiful combination of hardcore and metal, where the cerebral and the primal stomp heads next to one another.","Featuring members of Hammers of Misfortune, YOB, and Agalloch, VHÖL are the ideal modern metal band, fusing battle-tested stylistic forms with impressive arrangements and a progressive fire that traditionalists and revivalists can't match.

Silver Bullets,The Chills,by: J. Edward Keyes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b6c0084474cd0c1ccf/1:1/w_160/2f278f70.jpg,2015-10-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21055-silver-bullets/,Fire,"If there is one characteristic that has defined the music of the New Zealand group the Chills over the course of their 35-year, on-and-off, up-and-down existence, it’s their ability to summon a kind of effortless beauty. Their best songs occur in soft focus, the vocals of frontman and sole consistent member Martin Phillipps hushed and controlled, his guitar lines sturdy and gleaming like gold thread. His best melodies arrive as easy a sigh—gliding steadily through the center of ""Satin Doll"", spinning through ""Tied Up in Chain"" between tumbling piano. Where their contemporaries in the New Zealand scene of the early '80s capitalized on shambling charm (the Clean) or loose, looping jangle-pop (the Bats), the Chills were gentler and—especially as their career progressed—more regal, the corners of their songs filled with almost baroque detail. They feel designed to soundtrack some storybook undersea kingdom, sumptuous and mystic. This is remarkable, considering the group’s history is shot through with turmoil and darkness. Founding drummer Martyn Bull succumbed to leukemia shortly after recording ""Pink Frost"", the haunting meditation on death for which the group is best known. Forever tipped as the breakout band from the Dunedin indie scene, they cycled through as many as 15 different lineups, releasing an endless string of singles and EPs for New Zealand’s storied Flying Nun label, but always seemed to collapse when they were finally hitting their stride. Case in point: they inked a deal with Warner Bros. in 1990 and scored a modest success with the smart and self-aware ""Heavenly Pop Hit"" from the utterly immaculate Submarine Bells but they failed to capitalize on the momentum. The intervening years delivered more EPs, compilations, and even a box set of rarities, but nothing like actual forward movement, And then there was the darkness surrounding Phillipps himself: After grappling with immobilizing depression in the late-'90s, he turned to heroin, and contracted hepatitis C after sharing a needle with a fellow user who carried the disease. So, it’s both a surprise and relief to hear Phillipps in full fighting form on the title track from Silver Bullets, the first Chills full-length in 19 years. The song—and the album that contains it—handily erases everything from 1990 forward and seems to pick up exactly where Submarine Bells left off: guitars wreathed in reverb, organs heaving, Phillipps’ voice, as quietly assured as ever—even if what he’s singing is tinged with militance. ""And if it’s true they kill a heinous vampire/ Charged with magic charm/ If forced to fight your evil empire/ We have the means to harm."" Much of Silver Bullets strikes this kind of oppositional stance, Phillipps positioning himself as a kind of kiwi pop Tom Joad, pushing back against larger forces that threaten to swallow the less-fortunate whole. Often, the political is personal: on the roaring ""I Can’t Help You"", Phillipps grapples with the knowledge that he’s done harm to others, working through his feelings as his guitar and a whistling keyboard turn somersaults in the foreground. On the elegiac ""Underwater Wasteland"", he uses environmental destruction as a metaphor for social Darwinism, describing plesiosaurs and sea serpents with a kind of awestruck wonder. The music that surrounds him is rich and whispering: guitars that spiral like paper streamers in a breeze, drums that seem smothered in feathers. Combining delicate grace with ornate detailing is no easy feat, but on Silver Bullets, Phillipps manages it again and again. But the album is not without its missteps. Phillipps’ songs are most effective when his enemies are faceless and generalized—it’s better suited to the album’s storybook mystique. The leaden bromide ""America Says Hello"" comes off like a conspiracy theorist’s 3 a.m. Facebook rant. Ditto ""Tomboy"", a song about a girl who’s picked on by her classmates whose graceful melody and good intentions are undone by Phillipps’ numbing repetition of the title. And ""Molten Gold"", a tumbling number about the healing power of love, feels rote compared to the richness that surrounds it. The album is best when it’s at its broadest, and it’s never more so than in the expansive, eight-minute ""Pyramids / When the Poor Can Reach the Moon"". It’s the most ambitious song in the group’s entire catalog, and one whose firm grasp of melody and dynamics more than justifies its length. The tension builds for a full five minutes, the rich getting richer and the poor getting smarter, until it arrives at its glorious, sun-drenched conclusion when, instead of violence and chaos, the gates to the mansion are flung open, guitars and pianos sparkle, the oppressed are liberated and, in Phillipps’ words, ""the poor can reach the moon."" The net effect is warm and rousing, speaking to the power of hope in the face of darkness. After three decades of near-misses and dark alleys, Phillipps has finally embraced his role as king of the underdogs. On Silver Bullets, he fights back the only way he knows how: with beauty.","If there is one characteristic that has defined the music of the New Zealand group the Chills over the course of their 35-year, on-and-off, up-and-down existence, it’s their ability to summon a kind of effortless beauty. Their first album in 19 years finds them doing what they do best.

There’s Nothing Wrong With Love,Built to Spill,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b111b1335d7bf169a1fe/1:1/w_160/28f146a8.jpg,2015-10-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21096-theres-nothing-wrong-with-love/,Sub PopUpSub PopUp,"It's May 1994 in Boise, Idaho—one month after the death of Kurt Cobain. Though this town is 500 miles southeast of Seattle, almost an eight-hour drive, that's not so far in this part of the country. You have your car, and everything is spread out, and you're always ready to cover ground when you need to. So despite the distance Boise could conceivably be considered part of the Pacific Northwest, if you stretch the definition a little bit, and the music scene there, such as it is, has some connections to its larger neighboring cities. There's a Boise band called Built to Spill led by Doug Martsch, who used to be in an indie rock band based in Seattle called Treepeople. Two of the stories in the Pacific Northwest rock scene in the '80s and early '90s are the ramshackle D.I.Y. scene surrounding K Records and of course grunge, which by this time had gone so far overground it was on its way to becoming a cliché. Martsch's songwriting has some parallels with the wide-eyed and playful perspective of indie pop, but his twee impulses are tempered by his epic guitar work, which is not connected to grunge proper but can be traced to one of the scene's influences, J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. Having made one album, 1993's Ultimate Alternative Wavers, Built to Spill return to Seattle to record their follow-up, There's Nothing Wrong With Love, the record that would change everything for the band. ""That was the last record when I was able to make music without thinking a lot of people would hear it,"" Martsch told SPIN in 1999. ""It makes a difference. I'd like to think it doesn't matter, but it does."" That relative anonymity, free from the nebulous expectations of what eventually became a sizable fan base, gave Martsch license to write his most personal album. There's Nothing Wrong With Love, newly reissued on vinyl after being out of print on the format for almost two decades, has come to define a certain strand of indie rock, leaving a cluster of threads picked up by Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, and many more. But beyond its influence, it captures a truly original songwriting voice at the exact moment he realized what he had to offer. It's the album as snow globe, a small place where interconnected stories happen and you can get a different perspective on them depending on your vantage point. Built to Spill had some great records ahead of them, but they would never make another album with this level of intimacy. There's Nothing Wrong With Love finds Martsch on the cusp of true adulthood (his first child was born around the time it was made, and his feelings around that are documented on ""Cleo""), but the past is close enough where he sees it with tremendous clarity. The songs highlight the tiny feelings and sensations that have no obvious consequences in the moment but somehow stay with you in every detail. And Martsch has a special talent for pinpointing the tossed-off moments that others might connect to. As a kid, I was excited to learn about the constellations— where they were supposed to be, how the dots were connected, the mythology they represented—but I quickly realized the only one I could make out was the Big Dipper. I spent 20-something years with that meaningless thought pinging in my head, and then I heard a song on this album that started with the words ""When I was little someone pointed out to me/ Some constellations but the Big Dipper's all I could see"" (""Big Dipper"") and suddenly this stray private thought became a shared experience, one wrapped inside an ultra-catchy power pop song. Nuggets like this, borne of Martsch's keen sense of introspection and emotional generosity, are the lifeblood of There's Nothing Wrong With Love. On ""In the Morning"" he explores the difficulty of enjoying the present moment when filled with anxiety about the future (""Today is flat beneath the weight of the next day, next day, next day, next day"") and how instinct takes over in moments of uncertainty. All the album's hyper-specific lyrical details—and there are many—check out. ""Seven Up I touched her thumb, she knew it was me"" (from ""Twin Falls"") might sound impossibly precious from another songwriter, but Martsch always leavens his sweetness with self-aware humor. ""My stepfather looks just like David Bowie/ But he hates David Bowie,"" goes a line in ""Distopian Dream Girl"", certainly the first time in pop music history that this particular thought has been expressed. Then he follows with ""I think Bowie's cool/ I think Lodger rules, my stepdad's a fool,"" showing just how in touch Martsch is with the feelings of adolescence, those years when you're floating through life, a bundle of nerves, and nothing quite makes sense. The music and arrangements on the album are every bit the match of the subject matter. Built to Spill showed only hints of the explosive rock machine they'd later become. Acoustic guitar features heavily, a cello saws away in the background, serving as a sort of Greek chorus tracking the emotional arc of a given song's characters. Once in a while, Martsch hits the stomp box and unleashes a noisy solo, the distortion dusting his effortless melodicism with longing. There's plenty of open space, and his voice is much cleaner than it would be later. The sequencing and editing is brilliant, from ""In the Morning""'s split-second pause after Martsch yells ""Stop!"" to the pause between ""Twin Falls"" and ""Some"" that makes them seem like one long song. It's a sound that is simultaneously tiny and huge, a keepsake tucked into a pocket that could at any moment magically become the size of a billboard. With its focus on childhood, the nature of existence, and the search for meaning, it's possible to hear There's Nothing Wrong With Love in the terms of ""What if there was another universe in my fingernail?""-style stoner dorm-room philosophy. But Martsch's open heart keeps you on his side. There's real beauty in the fumbling exploration he describes in ""Car"", a song filled with lines that crystallize what it's like to be an excited-but-frightened kid learning about life in fits and starts: ""You'll get the chance to take the world apart/ And figure out how it works."" Listening to this album in 2014, another line in the song, ""I want to see it when you get stoned on a cloudy breezy desert afternoon,"" kept bringing me back to the final scene in Richard Linklater's film Boyhood, when the main character we've watched grow through the years takes mushrooms and hikes through a canyon in West Texas, a landscape not unlike parts of Idaho. It reminded me that one reason young people do drugs is because they offer a second chance to see things for the first time. To borrow one last line from ""Car"", on this album Martsch remembered when he wanted to see ""movies of his dreams."" For the vast majority of us that wish is never fulfilled, but There's Nothing Wrong With Love is a celebration of the desire itself, the vulnerability that comes with allowing yourself to imagine possibility.","There’s Nothing Wrong With Love, newly reissued on vinyl after being out of print on the format for almost two decades, has come to define a certain strand of indie rock, leaving a cluster of threads picked up by Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, and many more.

Karamika,Karamika,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1d15e6ef959693221b7/1:1/w_160/6d15c402.png,2015-10-22 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21211-karamika/,ESP Institute,"In the mid-'70s, Brian Eno was so taken with the strange sounds emanating from Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius's studio in the rural village of Forst—both the duo music they made as Cluster as well as their trio with Michael Rother as Harmonia—that he traveled from England to Germany to record with them. The results of that meeting only came to light in the past few years (it's fully documented on the forthcoming Harmonia box set) but the meeting sprang to my mind while listening to Karamika. Karamika is a duo of British musician George Thompson (who does numerous remixes as Black Merlin), and Gordon Pohl, who's one half of Düsseldorf act Musiccargo. At times, their work together evokes the chilly sounds of early-'80s minimal wave and some of John Carpenter's analog synth soundtracks. But the snaking, immersive 12 tracks that comprise their debut often brings to mind the primitive, visceral early electronic music that Cluster themselves made back when they were still known as the woolly, circuit-bending band Kluster. Karamika's music is reactive in that sense, pulling away from the use of readily available software and computers to revisit an era when these electrical surges weren't so easily tamed and manageable. ""Ton 01"" begins with a slowly undulating sine wave and throb, and when the metronomic drumming enters it brings to mind Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter's first forays as Kraftwerk. As the track moves along, a noisy guitar appears, reminiscent of the one that worms through Neu!'s ""Hallogallo"", showing where early electronics grappled with rock instrumentation, each pushing the other into strange new realms. There's nothing especially novel about emulating the likes of Cluster, Kraftwerk, or Neu! in 2015 (nor would it have been back in 2005), but it's hard to get the parameters right. The exploratory spirit remains intact, but Karamika's resultant tracks feel more focused and they are judicious in adding new layers and noises to the initial framework so that it doesn't all collapse under the weight. More often than not, the deeper you travel into the pieces, the more mesmerizing they become. A sense of claustrophobia and dread lurks beneath the surface throughout. As ""Ton 04"" moves through its nine minutes, the throbs gather in density until they feel like a migraine. The cavernous clattering on ""Ton 07"" begins as an early experimental piece might. Disembodied voices appear on the album highlight ""Ton 9"", and at the peak of tension a child's laugh comes in, which has a horror-film effect, prickling the skin rather than breaking the tension. In that way, Karamika's homage to their German forefathers forgoes the utopian spirit of some of those albums. Instead, Thompson and Pohl hint at the isolating, disconnected present.","Karamika is a duo of British musician George Thompson (who does numerous remixes as Black Merlin) and Gordon Pohl, who's one half of Düsseldorf act Musiccargo.

International Blackjazz Society,Shining,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12ab1335d7bf169a224/1:1/w_160/813261dc.jpg,2015-10-22 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21106-international-blackjazz-society/,Spinefarm,"On their 2010 album Blackjazz, the Norwegian jazz/prog collective Shining absorbed metal into their aesthetic, and it seemed to focus them. On earlier records the band, organized around multi-instrumentalist Jørgen Munkeby, were more elusive, but Blackjazz was an album made entirely of jagged shapes, like the irregular, violent architecture of a cliffside. It feels aggressively assembled, as if its ideas of metal and jazz were less harmonized than magnetized together. The follow-up, 2013’s One One One, reduced them into an atomically unstable industrial rock band. While thrilling, the album could have the remoteness of a formal exercise. International Blackjazz Society sounds like a compression of these two approaches, but it evolves into something distinct as you listen. Unlike One One One, the songs here don’t simply accelerate until they expire. There’s more space in the arrangements, and the songs expand into the room they’re afforded. Some of this shift can be credited to new drummer Tobias Ørnes Andersen, who plays industrial music with more patience and tension than previous drummer and founding Shining member Torstein Lofthus. ""Thousand Eyes"" feels like stoner metal, of all things; the riff is a little more drunk than the band usually allows. ""House of Warship"" is free jazz, which is actually new territory for Shining; even their freest moments on previous records seemed premeditated, a kind of organized collapse. Whenever Munkeby plays saxophone on International Blackjazz Society the songs sound as if they’re sprouting fractals. Still, even as the band relaxes into new atmospheres there’s an extreme, ascetic discipline on display. The architecture of their music is modernist, a series of inelastic and inorganic shapes colliding with the velocity of a distant level of ""Tetris"". On International Blackjazz Society’s final track, ""Need"", you can feel this refined performance begin to rupture. It’s as unhinged as it is straightforward; as it acquires mass in the choruses it seems to list off the ground into some new, uncertain gravity. For all the blur and motion of their music, this hint of deeper chaos might be the album's most exciting moment.","On their 2010 album Blackjazz, the Norwegian jazz/prog collective Shining absorbed metal into their approach, and it yielded a hard, precise music that felt unlike previous jazz/metal fusions. Since then, they've only grown more cold and olympic, but on International Blackjazz Society they let a hint of exciting uncertainty creep in.

Howl,Rival Consoles,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e2ea9e61561daa683b/1:1/w_160/1d08a516.jpg,2015-10-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21222-howl/,Erased Tapes,"Ryan Lee West felt moved to a brief outburst back in August. The Leicester-born, London-based producer who makes music as Rival Consoles tweeted in protest of the ongoing boom of deep house, asking artists to quit contributing to the genre, currently in vogue. ""There's probably enough to last us till 2089,"" he wrote. West's ire makes sense, if only because the music he makes as Rival Consoles feels diametrically opposed to the luxuriant, lengthy bath evoked by deep house. West is a musical engineer in the mold of luminaries like Aphex Twin and relative newcomers like Dave Harrington, and the soundscapes he's constructed on his third LP, Howl, are spiky and imposing, too solid to sink into. The music is always shifting, so it's impossible to lose track of time while listening. You're always aware that any given composition is morphing, is in flux. Reams of electronic producers luxuriate in the safety of creating a comfortable atmosphere. But Howl is impossible to ignore, and hard to forget. That's partly because West so often feels comfortable disrupting his own patterns. ""Afterglow"" seems as if it's going to build on an early synth loop, but what at first seems like the track's foundation turns out to be its foyer: halfway in, and suddenly we're in an entirely new room, one that's louder, brighter, more expansive. Our understanding of his pieces broadens as they move through time, so that once they're nearly over we apprehend the entire structure as if by a drone camera hovering above. That vivid view is studded with allusions: the title track makes extraordinary reference to trains and tunnels, and at times the dusky track ""Pre"" recalls the snaking sounds of a film projector. West has said that he's a fan of ""sloppy things and rough things happening in music,"" but even the little blips and isotopes here feel as if they've been cast in concrete, accidents granted purpose. In contrast to the last two Rival Consoles LPs, Howl was largely forged from hardware (as opposed to digital technology), and the record's analogue origins would be obvious even if you knew nothing about its genesis. West is a labelmate of Nils Frahm and, this year alone, has toured with Clark and Nosaj Thing. He shares with all three the instincts of a classical composer*.* Howl's closer, ""Looming"", is a six-and-a-half-minute mini-epic that reflects the depth of emotion that West says he poured into Howl. But the catharsis it induces comes as much from the musician's restraint and sense of composure as anything else. What isn't there is as important as what is. West's grumbling about deep house might make him seem like a dinosaur. But he doesn't seem bothered by its existence; he's complaining about a surplus, and, like a true progressive, his momentary gripe stands as mere prelude to more concerted action. His music—rocky, spiky, warm, titanic—drives us to re-evaluate whether referring to someone as a dinosaur might not be quite as pejorative as we thought.","Reams of electronic producers luxuriate in the safety of creating a comfortable atmosphere.

Airplane Mode,Ty Dolla $ign,by: Israel Daramola,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1e55e6ef959693221db/1:1/w_160/3d079124.jpg,2015-10-22 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21224-airplane-mode/,self-released,"Ty Dolla $ign (born Tyrone Griffin, Jr.) has cultivated an aesthetic as grimy as it is sexy: His party songs feel sleazy, and his sex songs feel like they're happening in public. You could see glimpses of this direction from his beginnings as one half of the duo Ty & Kory, but it wasn’t until he went solo that he developed the persona that made him a star. He has the skill to make his woozy, grainy songs about parties and women seem so effortless that sometimes it looks like he’s not even trying, which is evident on his latest tape, Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode feels designed as an afterthought, a placeholder to keep Ty’s buzz afloat until his major label debut, Free TC, arrives. Yet it’s cohesive and engaging even when multiple songs cut out in the middle of verses. This is a purposely unfinished project, one that doesn’t reveal much about Ty that we don’t already know: ""I’m a pop a molly, pop a percocet, sippin' Actavis/ My momma mad at me, told me I spend too much money/ I’ve been buying bottles like sure, what, you only live once,"" he raps on ""Do Thangs"". He’s still caught up in a tidal wave of women, drugs, money, and never-ending parties. ""Back in the City"" and ""Money Ruin Friendships"" are satisfying records that showcase both Ty’s charming singing voice and his gift for making a DJ Mustard beat feel fresh again. But songs like ""No Fake Shit"" and ""All"" are more intriguing, because they hint at a larger ""there"" with Ty Dolla $ign. ""No Fake Shit"" is a deeply caring love song and ""All"" hints at the trappings and boredom of fame. More importantly, the latter ends with a voicemail from his brother TC, who is currently serving a life sentence. The brief moment gives the EP a hint of soul and signals that Ty might have something more to say to us. Airplane Mode isn't quite that place, though. There are two references to the EP title here, both telling: ""These days gotta keep my phone on airplane mode/ To dodge these hoes,"" Ty croons on the title track. The second comes from TC’s message from jail. In it, TC he acknowledges that Ty’s phone probably went straight to voicemail because it’s on airplane mode, as if this is a common occurrence. Airplane mode is the setting you put your electrical device in to completely disconnect it from the network. You can’t get text messages, phone calls, or access any apps needing the Internet and, at the risk of sounding precious, it is a bit of a metaphor for Ty Dolla $ign the persona. Disconnected from the outside world, yet still functioning in it, he’s garnered a steady buzz and made plenty of great songs by projecting a disaffected cool.","Airplane Mode is a purposely unfinished project, meant to tide us over until Ty Dolla $ign's major-label debut Free TC arrives.

Many Moons,Martin Courtney,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10aea9e61561daa66fa/1:1/w_160/df11bdef.jpg,2015-10-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21091-many-moons/,Domino,"Leave it to Martin Courtney to turn a solo album into a gesture of self-effacement. The singer/guitarist's New Jersey band Real Estate have spent the last six years elevating effortless indie pop into a deeply moving art form, and his fellow group members have routinely worked in side projects—bassist Alex Bleeker with his woolly'n'rootsy Freaks outfit, and guitarist Matt Mondanile with the watery dreamscapes of Ducktails. But Courtney's debut solo outing arrives with his own name pushed to the fore. And yet, Many Moons is hardly the work of a narcissistic singer/songwriter. (""I just couldn't come up with a band name,"" he recently shrugged.) Instead, the charmingly low-key album is an act of humility and, beyond that, quiet grace. Courtney's voice, like his name, is front and center here, markedly stripped of Real Estate's signature reverb. And rather than relying on his familiar turn-of-the-millennium indie rock touchstones, the singer inhabits winsome, lightly orchestrated '60s psych pop and '70s power pop (documented in a nicely complementary playlist). The album gains shape thanks to an enviably accomplished band that includes Real Estate keyboardist Matt Kallman, like-minded Jerseyite Julian Lynch, and Woods' Jarvis Taveniere, who produced. Plus, for a set that casually began as a stress-relief outlet ahead of Real Estate's 2014 album Atlas, Many Moons works as a remarkably cohesive album, meandering its way across themes of past and present to a state of aching clarity that's modest, but no less genuine for it. Once heard quasi-chanting about suburban suds, Courtney is now the lawnchair-Zen dad. The album’s title phrase occurs first amid a hodgepodge of images on the lushly jangling ""Vestiges"": ""Many moons for it to grow/ Phases they will come and they will go."" These are the musings of an artist often associated with nostalgia accepting the truism that what we really have left from yesterday is the same ol' never-ending flux. It's a concept he darts around on the equally fine ""Foto"", which finds Courtney reflecting on an old passport photo: ""The past is just a dream."" While a line like that could seem nursery-rhyme commonplace on its own, it builds force nestled amid tracks like ""Awake"", a gentle apology for strumming next door that offers its own ruminations on the past, and ""Asleep"", a backwards-effects reverie that's somewhere between an ""Oh Yoko!"" dream and ""I'm Only Sleeping"". The terrain may be narrow, but Courtney finds subtleties to explore in his quest for a wisdom that will keep growing in meaning as months and trend cycles pass. Many Moons isn’t all painstaking philosophy on the inevitability of change. A more immediate highlight is ""Northern Highway"", which cruises along, suitably upbeat, as it balances existential questions (""Do you feel just like a stranger?"") with the narrator's avowal that he could never retire to a place without seasons—all via a chiming arrangement befitting the Left Banke. Or ""Little Blue"", a windows-down listen about windows-down listens that’s named after Courtney’s old car. By contrast, on ""Focus"", when Courtney implores, as if giving Magic Eye advice, ""The trick really is not to try,"" it's a bit too on the nose; besides, he already put it better on Real Estate's 2011 sophomore LP, Days, singing, ""Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise."" The trick is not to reveal it's a trick. The simple complexities of Many Moons all come together on the 10th and final song, ""Airport Bar"". It's about, yes, airport bars—places that stay the same while the people who pass through them speed around the globe. The music here is the album's most hypnotic; the lyrics are its most observant. Courtney's raconteur has been asleep, dreaming, before he finally realizes what’s real: ""Please don't go forgetting about me,"" he repeats, understanding full well that Timehop, Facebook's ""On This Day"" feature, or even ripped-jeans-pocket Polaroids are no substitute for ""just being here."" It's all unassuming enough that it almost breezes past, and, if Courtney didn't know better, he might even say that's the point.","The charmingly low-key Many Moons from the lead singer of Real Estate is an act of humility and, beyond that, quiet grace. Once heard quasi-chanting about suburban suds, Courtney is now the lawnchair-Zen dad.

Life,Dan Friel,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1989d034d5c69bf4a49/1:1/w_160/e008e9d5.jpg,2015-10-21 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21174-life/,Thrill Jockey,"The sound Dan Friel has created is so uniquely specific, it's easy to oversimplify: distorted nursery-rhyme melodies over cracked drum-machine beats. But dig just a little below the surface and there's a lot more going on. At various points Friel evokes noise, industrial, punk crossed with techno, video games, even jazz. On Life, his fourth full-length, he covers that range more thoroughly than ever, which perhaps explains the album's all-encompassing title. Pretty much his entire musical existence is locked in these grooves. The title might also refer to the fact that Friel has literally created life—this is the first album he's recorded since his son Wolf was born in 2013. Friel's music has always had childlike qualities, but here he makes that connection explicit. He opens with a sweet, woozy jingle called ""Lullaby (For Wolf)"", following later with the even-more sugary ""Theme"", which could pass for an outtake from Raymond Scott's Soothing Sounds for Baby. The warped, off-speed crunch of ""Sleep Deprivation"" would fit on any Friel album, but pinning its title to parenthood reveals how well his music captures the half-awake fog of early child-rearing. The rest of Life may not be about kids, but every track contains some simple melodic nugget that any toddler would happily hum along to. The best songs revel in that anthemic innocence, particularly the catchy ""Cirrus"", an immediate earworm on the level of Friel's 2012 insta-classic ""Valedictorian"". The two title tracks are nearly as memorable, though a lot more abrasive, ringing with distortion and bullet-like fuzz blasts. But again, hearing Friel through a single thematic prism is unwise. Some sections in Life sound like hip-hop bathed in nitrogen, or even like lost Bomb Squad beats. Friel's way of taking his melodies off on tangents evokes jazz solos; his obsession with gritty texture gives some pieces, like the clanging ""Bender"", the musique concrète feel of a busy construction site. And for all its machinistic beats, Life can also sound like a sloppy punk band rattling basement walls. That's especially true during ""Jamie (Luvver)"", Friel's wordless cover of a Joanna Gruesome song, which gives the already-energetic original a huge shot of late-night caffeine. What unites all the styles in Friel's sonic fryer is playful momentum. His main instrument, a Yamaha Portasound keyboard, is literally a toy, and throughout Life it sounds like he's rolling around on the floor. Most of his songs include a constant whirr, and leave you with the echo of that eternal buzz—an effect that I imagine is a mirror of Friel's bleeping brain. Give Life some time and you might find it infecting your synapses, too.","At various points, the electronic composer and onetime Parts & Labor frontman Dan Friel evokes noise, industrial, punk crossed with techno, video games, even jazz.

Ballin Like I’m Kobe,G Herbo,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b170c0084474cd0c1df1/1:1/w_160/1b020f2e.jpg,2015-10-21 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21153-ballin-like-im-kobe/,CinematicMachine Entertainment Group150 Dream Team,"Can street rap really raise alarm bells? Or are profit-minded artists merely preaching to the sociological choir—did you know the hood is fucked up?—while affirming and banking off conservative America's worst stereotypes? Certainly it would be difficult to suggest gangster rap tropes are winning a PR war over middle America. But at the same time, the implicit realism of Chicago's street rap scene makes armchair cynicism about its stars' motives impossible: Ballin Like I'm Kobe is no lazy b-ball double entendre, but a reference to Jacobi D. Herring, a friend of G Herbo's who was killed in 2013, and over whose tombstone he crouches on the tape's cover. Likewise, ""I'm Rollin"", the tape's underground smash single, opens with a roll call of lost friends, and the drug they'd do with Herb if they were here today. That Southside-produced track comes near the tape's conclusion, and it's the most structurally compelling on the album. This isn't the kind of hit you can force; it just happens. It sounds as if it were hewn from craggy granite, each segment of the song—the beat, the backgrounds, the chorus, Herb's rapping—grinding into place, sparks flying. It takes up an aggressive amount of space, forcing listeners to open themselves to its heft and rough edges. Formally, the record is his most innovative, one which ambitiously reimagines the rules of songcraft. Thematically, it captures the strange dissonances of what's been called drill music, its heightened stakes and tragic context contrasting starkly with its artists' armored detachment. No other song on Ballin Like I'm Kobe feels quite so one-of-a-kind. Sometimes it's pro forma; drill records like the DJ L-produced ""Gang"" sound as if they could have been recorded any time within the past three years. But outside of ""I'm Rollin"", Herbo's doesn't traffic in the kind of pioneering stylistic breakthroughs common to the first wave of drill artists—King Louie, Lil Durk, or Chief Keef. He is not drill's most versatile talent, preferring to play to his own strengths. His more traditional approach is an ability to wring narrative pathos from the song without letting his voice's cracked shell fully break. His vocal style is ragged but forceful, and in contrast with the East Coast influences to which it might be readily compared—the LOX, say—there's a sense of Herbo's words scratching past the lines, moving with a looser, less precise rhythm, as if to suggest an anxious undercurrent. And likewise, his subject matter seldom moves toward the humor of classic New York mixtape artists, preferring to shift from the autobiographical to very real-seeming threats. There's a tendency to approach Herb—in contrast with other artists on the scene—as if he were his genre's moral conscience, the Manichean good to drill's unmitigated baseline of evil. This reduces the genre's complexity to a simplistic binary. Herb's strength is less about moralism than it is about showing a complete human being in your speakers—an honest rendering of a morally compromised soul. These are the album's best moments. There is the DJ L-produced ""Eastside"", with scribbled double-time verses and contradictory tones of resignation and pride. It's an approach that works similarly on opener ""L's"": ""The shit I been through made me heartless, all my feelings on this glock."" And it's readily apparent on the melancholy ""Bottom of the Bottom"", which frames the rapper's aggressive approach with a crying string sample, which lends an echoing power to an atypically pointed chorus: ""Now the judge hang us with a hundred years, used to hang us with a tree.""","Rapper G Herbo doesn't traffic in the kind of pioneering stylistic breakthroughs common to the first wave of drill artists—King Louie, Lil Durk, or Chief Keef.

Tous Les Garçons Et Les Filles / Le Premier Bonheur Du Jour / Mon Amie La Rose / L’Amitié / La Maison Ou J’Ai Grandi,Françoise Hardy,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1155e6ef9596932208a/1:1/w_160/9fa90ffa.jpg,2015-10-21 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21098-tous-les-garcons-et-les-filles-le-premier-bonheur-du-jour-mon-amie-la-rose-lamitie-la-maison-ou-jai-grandi/,Light in the AtticLight in the Attic,"In the 1960s, French yé-yé pop stars had a particular shtick. They were teenage girls, dressed up in bows and baby doll dresses, singing flirty songs about love and adolescence penned typically by adult male songwriters. France Gall sang of swallowing ""lollipops"", Chantal Kelly sang of telling an older lover she’s only 15, Clothilde was forced to sing bloody fables. When the songs weren’t sexually charged jokes, they were melodramatic pop ballads about youth, from Chantal Goya’s unpredictable heartache to Sylvie Vartan’s simple dance-driven desires. And then there was Françoise Hardy. She wasn’t quite a black sheep of the genre, but she certainly complicated the formula. The Parisian singer auditioned for Vogue Records at 18 and went on to top charts with her very first release, a 1962 self-titled record now known as Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles based on its hit song. From there, the infamously timid Hardy became one of the few French pop stars of the era to cross over, jetting from England to France to record, serving as a muse to designers like Yves Saint Laurent, and inspiring Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger. That debut showcases Hardy at her simplest, wringing rockabilly-tinged pop magic from modest jazz percussion and steel guitar. Hardy wrote most of her own material, setting her far apart from her peers, and on her debut she penned every song but two. Her lyrics would never hew this close to yé-yé traditions again: See the ""whoa-oh-oh"" echoing on tracks like ""Il Est Tout Pour Moi"" and her cover of Bobby Lee Trammell’s ""Oh Oh Chéri"". The title track ""Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles"" remains an iconic vision of Hardy's aesthetic: frank music for romantic wallflowers. ""They walk in love without fear of tomorrow,"" she sings in French of the young couples she watches on the street. ""Yes but me, I’m single with a tormented soul, yes but me, I’m single because nobody loves me."" The five albums that make up Hardy’s reissues are really compilations of four-track, seven-inch singles. Because of this, some of these records feel disjointed, a side effect from compiling songs that weren’t initially made to sit next to each other. Such is the case for her next three records, Le Premiere Bonheur Du Jour, Mon Amie La Rose, and L’Amitié. Still, each has a different story to tell about Hardy’s musical influences at the time. Le Premier Bonheur Du Jour pulls from American girl groups, echoing the Crystals and the Ronettes on ""L’Amour D’Un Garçon"", ""Nous Tous"", and ""On Dit De Lui"". Elsewhere, the record boasts electric organ arrangements on snappy jazz-inspired tracks like ""L’Amour Ne Dure Pas Toujours"" and ""Comment Tant D’Autres"". On Mon Amie La Rose she explores a Morricone influence that was inchoate on Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles. ""Mon Amie La Rose"", based on the poem by Cecile Caulker and Jacques Lacome, and ""La Nuit Est Sur La Ville"" are terrifically spooky and cinematic, the latter depicting Hardy wrestling with cheating with a man on a lonely dark night. Elsewhere, she dips her toes in plucky Western country-rock on ""Pas Gentille"" and ""Tu Ne Dis Rien"". But with L’Amitié she zigzags between all these references: She’s the cowgirl guitar-heroine on her cover of ""Non Ce N’est Pas Un Rêve"", a dreamy wall-of-sound pop charmer on ""Le Temps De Souvenirs"", and folk singer on ""L’Amitié"". No matter her inspiration, Hardy’s music is bound together by her point of view, which is part of what makes her fascinating. Her songwriting is profoundly lonely, frequently insecure. Observers have emphasized Hardy’s anti-social nature as a celebrity, but you can hear it even in her music. Like all introverts, she seems most alone when surrounded by others, her insecurities ricocheting off those around her. On Tous Les Garçon Et Les Filles' ""La Fille Avec Toi"" she reaches out to an ex only to see him with another girl, bemoaning how beautiful she is. ""I dream of losing myself, if only I can lose myself with you,"" she sings on L’Amitié’s ""Tu Peux Bien"". On Mon Amie La Rose’s underrated star track ""Tu N’As Qu’Un Mot A Dire"", she pines for an old lover, singing the verse in hushed tones like someone hugging the sidelines before rushing desperately to the forefront for the chorus, filled with shrill, swooning violins: ""You just have to say the word and I’ll return,"" she cries, breathing urgency into a word as simple as ""toi."" It wasn’t until her fifth record La Maison Où J'Ai Grandi that Hardy grew into a more grown-up, baroque sound, one that matched the depth of her sorrow and its complexities. It was her most well-produced, well-written record to date, cohesive in sound and subject matter. Over harpsichord and Hardy’s own Spanish guitar, she echoes the previous four albums' worth of lip-quivering romantic longing, reflecting on what it means to lose love once you find it, or when it doesn’t live up to your fantasies. On ""Si C’est Ça"", her whispery voice and hushed guitar playing operate on the same frequency. ""Maybe this is the moment I prefer, the moment, despite it all, where everything could suddenly switch, where life could change at last,"" she sings to a lover who is leaving her on ""Surtout Ne Vous Retournez Pas"". ""So I say nothing."" The girl whose greatest fantasy was once having a hand to hold now wishes to let it go. What always made Hardy’s music stand out from her yé-yé peers is how it tackled adolescent desire: Hardy was often consumed with romantic extremes. She reveled in chest-clutching longing, but her adorations came from a place entirely her own. Her obsession with love was devoid of older, male sexualization or control, a privilege not many others of her era enjoyed. Hardy’s songs feel timeless in how they emphasize a universal dream for pure love. Is this music antique in its sound? Surely. In its sentiment? Hardly. Aside from a few anachronisms (""I’m fine with the movies, for rock, the twist and the cha-cha,"" she sings on her first album’s track ""Je Suis D’Accord"") this is '60s pop devoid of vintage signifiers; nobody goes steady, nobody sings of dying an old maid, there is no cutesy, wink-filled posturing. Sometimes, especially in Hardy's choice to cover male singers, her music feels almost devoid of gender. For a genre so tethered to young women of a certain time period, this is a feat. On Le Premier Bonheur Du Jour’s quick little track ""Le Sais-Tu?"", Hardy finally sings directly to the object of her affections, but she’s forgotten what she yearned to express. She keeps stopping to sing, ""did you know?"" as if stuttering: ""I so dreaded, did you know, this second, which made me think of the end of the world ... One in which you’re there, holding in your hands without maybe even realizing it: my destiny."" There’s a reason her music crossed so many country and language barriers, and it wasn’t just because she looked like a model and hung out with the Rolling Stones. These songs map a sort of adoration that derives its intensity from youth but lingers with us for the rest of our lives. Not many pop stars sing about that these days. To the joy of romantic loners everywhere, Françoise Hardy built her career on it.","The 1960s French pop star Françoise Hardy was one of the few of her era to cross over, inspiring rock stars like Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan. She wrote most of her own material, setting her far apart from her peers, and her songs have resonated with romantic loners everyone.

Liberman,Vanessa Carlton,by: Matthew Schnipper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b19613d197565213a63b/1:1/w_160/7263f6f8.jpg,2015-10-21 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21173-liberman/,Dine Alone,"Let's get ""A Thousand Miles"" out of the way. Fourteen years ago, Vanessa Carlton made a very popular song that will follow her around forever. Fair enough; it's very catchy. But times have changed. Can't Vanessa? She recently told CBS News that she ""learned a lot"" since her debut album, ""which is mostly that you don't know anything."" That's as good a place as any to reset, which she does with the refreshingly raw Liberman. Like the bulk of her recordings, it's still comprised of her honeysuckle voice and piano licks, but Liberman (so named after Carlton's grandfather, one of whose paintings of nudes hangs in her home and served, she says, as a sort of inspiration) either lets those components stand alone or accentuates them with mild indulgences, like blunted brass or hand claps. The bare songwriting is not something you would identify as avant-garde, but Carlton's inclinations are a lot weirder than they used to be. Take the album cover, which with its thick white border and bold black type resembles a Gentlewoman magazine cover. This isn't quite an album of Swiss design-inspired art jams, but maybe it's her version. The single ""Operator"" has Carlton using the huskiness of her voice to sound threatening in a way that makes you wonder what a truly severe Vanessa Carlton album might sound like. Still, Liberman is excellent on its own. Carlton's voice is the key attraction on songs that register between low-key pop, rock, and folk. Early single ""Blue Pool"", for example, touches on each in a way that feels refreshingly old school, as though pop radio these days was comprised of Fleetwood Mac and the Mamas and the Papas. The song's latter third is given over entirely to arpeggiating keyboard runs in a way you don't notice at first, because it's so atmospheric and catchy. But it's also odd—is this a sketch of a song? An extended outro? What is it doing here? The album is pockmarked with quirky decisions like this and it's better for it. Were Liberman the creation of a heretofore-unknown artist, it's difficult to imagine an album of such earnestness generating the kind of pre-release interest that would deem it worthy of CBS News. But that's the pickle of early success. The flipside is that it's also harder to imagine fans of punkier singer-songwriters like Angel Olsen or Tobias Jesso Jr. embracing her. She should share a stage with Perfume Genius. They both have beautiful voices and something to say. For Carlton, that message is a simple, almost sisterly, ""You got this."" ""That's the way it is, love,"" she sings on ""House of Seven Swords"", breaking the fourth wall with some mild real talk. This is the person I want to hear tell me ""shit happens""; the confidence in her voice is very reassuring. Perhaps that is the source of some of Carlton's magic, that she herself is delivering the shaman's prayer she sings about on album opener ""Take It Easy"". ""When heaven wraps around you/ And she will/ Take it easy"". Don't mind if I do.","A million years ago, Vanessa Carlton released ""A Thousand Miles"", the pop song that launched a generation of piano lessons. Now, she's releasing the raw, muted, refreshingly weird Liberman, a record that could share headspaces with Perfume Genius or Angel Olsen.

As If,!!!,by: Cameron Cook,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a29d034d5c69bf4a5c/1:1/w_160/5417204d.jpg,2015-10-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21182-as-if/,Warp,"Despite popular perception, !!! never quite fit with the dance-punk explosion of the early-to-mid-'00s. While an endless procession of angular Gang of Four imitators came and went, !!! carved out a space for themselves as disco true believers, foregoing the calculated dourness of the '80s for the joyous excesses of the decade prior. Few of their peers were releasing epic singles that stretched for almost 10 minutes (2003's now-classic ""Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story)""), or essentially trolling fans with something as simple as their name (""It's pronounced 'Chk chk chk',"" ""Actually, it's any three monosyllabic sounds in rapid succession,"" etc.). And no other group had a frontman as gleefully irreverent as Nic Offer, who is not opposed to busting out a dutty whine onstage in board shorts and a midriff-baring T-shirt. Making the uncool cool became second nature for !!!, yet another quality that separated them from the pack. But !!! have repeatedly suffered from bad timing—they're unable to distance themselves from that one, fairly brief moment midway through their career where they found themselves part of something bigger, and that lens distorts the way their music in received. As If, !!!'s sixth studio album, is very much a reaction to that crisis of identity, a mostly successful attempt at re-establishing themselves as the premier suppliers of fun, kinetic, sprawling indie disco. !!!'s secret weapon has always been their sense of humor—from their beginnings in the late '90s, when Offer basically had the wardrobe of an off-duty American Gladiator, to the tongue-in-cheek career highlight ""Pardon My Freedom"" from their politically-charged second LP Louden Up Now, whose chorus of ""Like I give a fuck about that motherfuckin' shit"" serves as a mini manifesto for !!!'s entire ethos. There's nothing quite as special as ""Pardon My Freedom"" on As If, but opening track ""All U Writers"" delivers the album's first chuckle amidst it's pounding dance beat: ""I knew I shouldn't have kissed him in a Chevrolet,"" sings a plaintive female voice, as Offer's distorted and stuttering vocals provide the song's structure. There's immediately a sense that !!! aren't necessarily trying to recreate past greatness but are pushing their sound and style in a new direction. The clearest example of this—and subsequently the best, if strangest, track on the album—is ""Every Little Bit Counts"", a straightforward rock-pop party song that would fit snugly on a Haircut 100 record circa 1983. The track has a big, broad, singalong chorus, a fist-pumping drumbeat and Orange Juice-like jumpy guitars, and it's unlike anything !!! have put forth up to date. ""Freedom! '15"" serves as a spiritual sequel of sorts to Louden Up Now: ""Freedom!/ How's that working for you, baby?"" sings Offer and his band of sarcastic backing singers, condensing the last decade of American political apathy into six minutes of funk. Speaking of which, As *If * leans a little too heavily on the groove in the middle, with moments like ""Funk (I Got This)"" fading into the background, but it's reinvigorated towards the end by the riveting ""Lucy Mongoosey"", which uses another singalong chorus as an anchor, an introspective pause among all the dancing. The final track, ""I Feel So Free (Citation Needed)"", features Offer's slowed-down, slurred vocals narrating the construction of the song itself: “It's quiet around here without a kick drum” he states, before said drum comes into the mix and transforms it into a heady, weirdo, funny, controlled mess, much like !!! themselves. With a little luck, As If will be the turning point !!! are looking for, the beginning of a new path without the dance-punk baggage they've been toting around for the last decade.","Despite popular perception, !!! never quite fit with the dance-punk explosion of the early-to-mid-'00s. As If, !!!'s sixth studio album, is very much a reaction to that crisis of identity, an attempt at re-establishing themselves as the premier suppliers of fun, kinetic, sprawling indie disco.

Autumn Eternal,Panopticon,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c2b1335d7bf169a327/1:1/w_160/450e3244.jpg,2015-10-20 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21200-autumn-eternal/,BindruneNordvis,"For all the fervor that's supposed to define its spirit, black metal essentially amounts to a set of affectations bundled together into a genre. This is especially apparent when artists outside of Scandinavia adopt hallmark signifiers like facepaint, illegible band logos that look like cobwebs, Satanism, ratty production values, and a harsh, staticky brand of guitar distortion that sounds like static. Not unlike the way rappers across the globe aspire to a constellation of mannerisms that first coalesced in the Bronx, today's black metal artists, regardless of where they're from, mold themselves after an attitude that blossomed within a distinctly Nordic headspace during the genre's early-'90s Second Wave. Still, it comes as something of a surprise that Austin Lunn of the U.S.-based solo act Panopticon harbors such an open fascination with vague, mythical notions of ""the North."" His last album was titled Roads to the North, this new album Autumn Eternal includes a track titled ""Into the North Woods"", and several Panopticon releases feature wintry, foreboding landscapes as cover art that will immediately strike a chord with aficionados. But the ""North"" that Lunn invokes is actually his adoptive home of Minnesota. And, though the multi-instrumentalist has made a personal principle out of staying reclusive, his isolation shouldn't be mistaken for the misanthropic fury that has driven black metal's most notorious antiheroes. As Autumn Eternal, Panopticon's seventh full-length, again makes clear, Lunn is an artist capable of appropriating core aesthetics from a number of genres while simultaneously honoring them—a balance that requires no small measure of dexterity. Lunn's manifesto-like notes on Bandcamp betray a sensitive heart that he wears on his sleeve. Clearly, Panopticon's music isn't motivated by hate or nihilism, and one can easily imagine a Henry David Thoreau-like figure retreating to the woods to contemplate personal, spiritual, and environmental concerns while Bon Iver's Justin Vernon nurses his love wounds in the cabin next door. More importantly, Lunn's work lacks the creepy jingoism that some of his Nordic peers have embraced on the slippery slope to Nazi/white supremacist sympathies. The bands that have flirted with ugly racial undertones have, of course, enjoyed the twin benefits of titillating fans and repulsing detractors, cultivating an aura of danger while hiding safely behind suggestion. Lunn has no need for such coyness because his heart is in an entirely different place. To be fair, it's not like you can understand what he's singing about. And whether or not his intentions truly give this music a more humanistic vibe than other black metal fare is debatable. But his musical agility certainly does set Panopticon apart, Autumn Eternal in particular. As he has in the past, Lunn infuses atmospheric black metal and European melodic/symphonic death metal with prog rock, post rock and, perhaps most audaciously, bluegrass. On paper, those combinations reek of calculation, but Lunn has long proven his ability to blend them into a seamless, irony-free sound, a sound he continues to forge ahead with on Autumn Eternal. Black metal bands have been paying homage to Viking folk tradition for years now, but the results have often been laughable. When Lunn incorporates acoustic roots expressions from the hills of Kentucky, it comes off neither as an academic exercise nor as an attempt to parody his overseas counterparts. In fact, there's no denying the earnestness of Autumn Eternal opener ""Tamarack's Gold Returns"", which prominently features violin work by Johan Becker of Chicago's Austaras alongside Lunn's own dobro playing. Where artists following the metal playbook would have fashioned the tune as a one-minute intro, Lunn and Becker go on for a full three minutes-plus before the music gives way to a minutes' worth of a found-sound ambient recording of Lunn spending time in nature. After that, a hail of ornate, baroque-style metal kicks in with lead guitars wailing dramatically over double bass drum rolls before Lunn makes his vocal entrance. Piercing but also bottom-heavy, Lunn's voice emanates brute animal power. He also allows for long instrumental sections where he refrains from singing, which only highlights its impact when he starts to howl. Autumn Eternal concludes the trilogy that Lunn started with 2012's Kentucky and continued with Roads to the North. Listeners who have followed Panopticon since that point or before will no doubt quibble over whether he's gone too far—or maybe not far enough—with the stylistic variety this time. Other than the myriad twists and turns on the epic ""Sleep to the Sound of the Waves Crashing"", Lunn generally approaches the new material as if he's streamlining his approach rather than going for more audacious or pointed ways to combine his influences. During one of the blast-beat sections on ""Waves Crashing"", the mix suddenly strips down to the point where it feels like you're listening to the drums from inside the unflattering acoustics of a rehearsal space while the guitarist tests a new reverb pedal from the adjacent room. Becker's violin on the song switches gears from a rustic Scottish/Irish vibe to film score melodrama. ""Pale Ghosts"", meanwhile, finds a space for Mono-esque shoegaze within the DNA of furious black metal riffing before the song takes flight into a dreamy passage anchored by a melancholic guitar arpeggio. Lunn has a way of making these and other elements sound perfectly at home with one another. In truth, nothing on Autumn Eternal jumps out as incongruous, which suggests that Lunn is simply expanding—not trying to radically alter—the black metal formula. Still, by renouncing its obligatory celebration of malice, Panopticon gives the form a much-needed makeover, and with Autumn Eternal, Austin Lunn further uncovers musical potential that's long been overshadowed by too much bad-boy posturing.","Panopticon is the Minnesota-via-Kentucky solo project of Austin Lunn. On his new album Autumn Eternal, he borrows from genres like atmospheric black metal, prog rock, post rock, and bluegrass while simultaneously honoring them.

Lost Themes Remixed,John Carpenter,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b141ea9e61561daa6753/1:1/w_160/b3887ef0.jpg,2015-10-20 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21126-lost-themes-remixed/,Sacred Bones,"As John Carpenter began to lose interest in making films, he entered into an unexpected renaissance as one of the most influential icons of the synthesizer age. Carpenter himself will tell you how accidental that status is: He only began composing and recording the scores to his films—starting with his first one, 1974’s Dark Star—in order to avoid having to pay someone else to do it. His use of electronic instruments, even his signature minimalist style—all of it sprang from budgetary concerns. But Carpenter’s scores—specifically the ones for Halloween and *The Fog—*developed a cult following among synth geeks, and this burgeoning fan base has inspired him to try his hand at making music without a movie to compose it for. Encouraged by his musician son and his discovery of modern digital recording software, he released his first solo album, Lost Themes, earlier this year. Although the tracks are smoothed out by bland Logic plugins, it was a pretty decent evocation of his soundtrack work. If Lost Themes provided an opportunity to reflect on Carpenter’s influence on several generations of electronic musicians, the selection of remixes by other artists tacked on as bonus tracks makes that influence explicit. Now, Sacred Bones has fleshed out the set out with a couple more tracks and Lost Themes Remixed stands as a companion volume to the original record. Remix albums are tricky things, and the ones that fail (and most of them do) do so for the same few reasons: too many stylistically disparate remixers, too much reverence for the the source material, remixers who are clearly in it for the easy paycheck. Lost Themes Remixed avoids all three. Carpenter’s status seems to have inspired the nine remixers to bring their A game, and Sacred Bones selected committed experimentalists like Prurient, Zola Jesus, and Blanck Mass (aka Fuck Buttons’ Benjamin John Power) who wouldn’t play too nice with Carpenter’s recordings. Stylistically, pretty much any artist who’s going to want to remix John Carpenter is going to have a few things in common, including a pervasive gloominess and an affection for throbbing, single-note bass lines played on analog synthesizers. As a result, LTR manages to hold together as a unified stylistic statement in a way that isn’t common for remix collections. Despite the project’s singular focus, LTR doesn’t just reflect Carpenter’s influence on contemporary musicians, but the range of artists that he’s inspired. Prurient transforms Carpenter’s New Age-leaning ""Purgatory"" into a harsh, icy soundscape. The Blanck Mass reworking of ""Fallen"" sounds like slasher-movie music from some grimy, glitched-up cyberpunk future. Zola Jesus and Dean Hurley reconfigure Lost Themes’ most classically Carpenteresque track ""Night"" into vocal house for vampires. Interestingly, some of the remixers seem to be correcting Lost Themes’ deviations from Carpenter’s signature formula. In its original form, ""Abyss"" highlights both Carpenter’s knack for building complex arrangements out of deceptively simple parts and his weakness for really corny synth patches. Foetus mastermind J.G. Thirlwell swaps them out for the kind of assaultive analog sounds that set the tense mood of Carpenter’s early films (and which themselves were considered corny at the time). One one hand there’s something offensive about the idea of somebody trying to fix an artist’s new work by making it sound more like his old stuff. On the other hand, I have to admit I like the remix more.","The film director John Carpenter became an icon of the first synthesizer age just as he lost interest in making films. His minimal works have influenced a generation of acolytes, and earlier this year Carpenter tried his hand at a standalone album with Lost Themes. Here, remixers from Prurient and Zola Jesus to Blanck Mass tackle the master's works.

American Tragic,Wax Idols,by: T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc7ea9e61561daa64f1/1:1/w_160/832e17e1.jpg,2015-10-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20859-american-tragic/,Collect,"As the frontperson and creative force behind Wax Idols, Hether Fortune has cultivated an aesthetic of icy cool—punk rock bravura shrouded in multiple layers of gothy frost. The last Wax Idols record—2013’s sophomore effort Discipline + Desire—was an exercise in sustained tension informed, at least in part, by her training as a professional dominatrix. As a result, the record played like an extended tease—tantalizing the listener with heavily eyelinered pop stylings but still keeping things at a cool remove, always stopping just shy of delivering the kind of massive hook that could have potentially knocked everyone out of their collective creepers. In contrast, American Tragic is a much more empathetic affair, fully stocked with songs that bear the trappings of gloomy post-punk and the appropriate gray shades of goth, but wraps them around words that articulate real human feelings. While previous Wax Idols tracks sometimes felt like excuses to show off an aesthetic, Tragic manages to unpack a number of complicated ideas, particularly about how much our personal identities are defined by our relationships. And while it would be easy to attach a personal narrative to songs like ""Goodbye Baby"" and ""Lonely You"" (based on the fact that Fortune reportedly went through an ugly divorce prior to making this record), the album strives to be much more than a classic breakup record. In the end, it’s a record about getting over. The album opens with ""A Violent Transgression""—a bit of reverby melodrama in which Fortune sets the tone for the record by singing ""This is an absolute negativity/ A sudden, irrevocable plunge"" before ultimately concluding that ""Desire/ It’s violent."" The violence of wanting—both wanting in and ultimately desperately wanting out of a relationship—lies at the heart of American Tragic. The most compelling tracks are those that deal with the queasy malaise of missing something you know is ultimately bad for you. On the glorious ""Lonely You""—a bit of Anglophilic guitar pop that sounds like some long-lost ""120 Minutes""-worthy single that never was—Fortune pauses to pine for a lover that is better left in the dust. ""It was a sorry gilded cage/ That bound our hearts together,"" she laments, ""Now I just want to push the weight of you away forever."" Elsewhere, on ""Goodbye Baby"" the notion of a collapsing romance is both devastating and empowering: ""I’m not wasting time/ I’m taking my heart back/ I’m taking what’s mine."" If Fortune sounds newly empowered here it’s for good reason. American Tragic is, in every way, a very personal missive. She wrote and recorded everything herself (except the drums, played by Rachel Travers) and the collection unspools like a clever synthesis of dark new wave and late-'80s post-punk without ever sounding too much like an obvious pastiche of either. ""At Any Moment"" approaches Sky Ferreira levels of mainstream pop accessibility, while ""Deborah"" gives a twist on the classic doomed heroine ode (""Had you pegged for a gay boy but you were just a playboy"") and wraps it up in Cure-like guitar lines and a sprinkling of drum machine handclaps. On the other hand, ""Severely Yours"", with its references to sexual power dynamics and submission (""You can be the Marquis tonight""), is a little too on the nose for someone who has already mined this kind of territory so thoroughly in the past (and there should be a moratorium on non-ironic references to crucifixion and martyrdom for any kind of goth-approved record that isn’t actually Pretty Hate Machine). Mostly though, Tragic avoids living up to its namesake by sidestepping cliché and never overstaying its welcome. At a relatively brief nine tracks, the record is a perfectly paced blast of dark pop that deftly reflects Fortune’s growing prowess as a songwriter—here offering everything from slow burn dirges on romantic grief to perfectly executed synth jams about emotional freedom. As a result, it’s not a surprise that she increasingly draws comparisons to women like Chrissie Hynde and Siouxsie Sioux—powerful forces who knew how to strike a perfect balance between authority and vulnerability. By opening up and shedding some of her icy veneer on American Tragic, Fortune places herself in very good company.","Wax Idols' intensely personal new album unspools like a clever synthesis of new wave and late-'80s post-punk without sounding like a pastiche of either.

Dream All Over,Gun Outfit,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04f13d197565213a444/1:1/w_160/a0c0a0ea.jpg,2015-10-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20980-dream-all-over/,Paradise of Bachelors,"What Gun Outfit do sounds secret and borderline ineffable. Like many bands to come out of Olympia since the '80s, they understand their place in rock history: their four LPs bear the mark of musicologists who know their ""Bad Moon Rising"" from their Bad Moon Rising, their ""Kool Thing"" from their ""2 Kool 2 B 4-Gotten"", their ""Some Velvet Morning"" from their Some Velvet Sidewalk. Levitating hooks and an emotional heaviness co-exist in their impressionistic songs, like the light-and-dark glow of a perpetual magic hour. As a singer, Carrie Keith (who also plays guitar) has absorbed as much from Lucinda Williams' pained rasp as from Kim Gordon's spacious monotone. And it's telling that her notably crazy-legged fellow guitarist Dylan Sharp once played in a corrosive hardcore band called Spiritual Warriors, an allusion to the surrealist filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky. The connection underscores the subtle late-capitalist critique in his plainspoken lyrics, a soft-pedalled but deeply felt ideological edge. Gun Outfit are a seemingly modest band who sound alternately chained or freed by their devotion to thinking big-picture, by their gentle insistence on life-or-death stakes. As ever, they sound like they just wandered off the set of a country Western being shot inside a shipping container, but Dream All Over is Gun Outfit's most consistent record by some margin. With its echoing grooves, drifting landscapes, and new textures—bits of bluegrass banjo, homemade electric sitars—Dream All Over has the blue-sky sensibility of a soul-searching road trip. There's gorgeous outlaw poetry on Keith's imagistic ""Legends of My Own"", a tale of a woman reborn alone in a foreign land. ""When I put my blanket down/ I'm going to dream all over,"" Keith sings; it's an inspired metaphor for the act of becoming, and the cool composure with which she draws out the line ""I wear a mask but not to hide"" is its own kind of empowerment. That abstract feminism also comes through on the LP's bare, sun-staring centerpiece ""Angelino"". Keith's symbols of ""a kingdom in ruins"" and ""all of the cowgirls on the losing end"" are more graceful ways of saying ""fuck the patriarchy,"" but if you listen close to them they bite. Dream All Over's incantatory folk-rock cushions pleas for the systematically oppressed, meditations on apathy, poverty, greed, slavery, death. In the survivalist's love song ""In Orbit"", Sharp sings ""You and I/ Are not the only satellites/ Circling an uninhabitable void/ For our whole lives."" At least they are together. Gun Outfit's music has gotten slower with each release, an inversion of (or response to) how human life has evolved since their band formed nine years ago. They reject the pace of our times, where everything happens so much. When they do evoke the modern world—like the 3D-printed gun that appears in the lyrics to closer ""Only Ever Over""—there is an ominous, no-future edge to it. They seem to acknowledge the planet is doomed, while drawing a strange relief from facing facts. ""Oh world, what lesson do you teach?"" Sharp sings on the poignant ripper ""Worldly Way"". ""Console yourself with sadness/ Befriend your misery."" It made me think of an essay by the poet Melissa Broder, in which she explores the idea that depression is the over-evolution of the mind. Perhaps this is why Gun Outfit—a band that will validate your pain as much as it will comfort you—still has such a fervent cult following underground. Punks love Gun Outfit because punks are inherently a little shattered. It's easy to carry a heavy heart when you live in a state of constant confrontation, when ""anxiety's your default,"" as Sharp tosses off on the relatively upbeat ""Gotta Wanna"". Gun Outfit understands what it is to feel unsettled, to need some calming. On ""Only Ever Over"", after making the grand, dour, and quietly hilarious assertion that rock'n'roll and literature are dead, Sharp sings: ""Cup a little coal/ Try to make it glow/ We're going to have a fire before we go."" In a recent interview, Sharp gave one of the best definitions of punk that you're likely to hear this year—that it's broadly ""about being humble and resisting the illusion that everything's fine."" In this framework, Gun Outfit fit as logically alongside folk tradition as Sonic Youth, to whom they have often been compared. The latter connection seemed truer of 2010's clattering, astounding Possession Sound, which should have made Gun Outfit as popular as contemporaries like Kurt Vile or Angel Olsen. The comparison now feels more spiritual, insomuch as Gun Outfit can offer a countercultural compass of restless subterranean artists, filmmakers, bands, labels, philosophies. Dream All Over recalls the most crucial lesson of all underground rock music: become your own sound, and create a universe for it to exist in.","On their fourth LP, the Olympia band sounds as ever like they just wandered off the set of a country Western being shot inside a shipping container. But this modest-feeling band explores vast emotions, and Dream All Over has the blue-sky sensibility of a soul-searching road trip.

Nothing Feels Good,The Promise Ring,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1455e6ef9596932014c/1:1/w_160/8ee6420c.jpg,2015-10-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21125-nothing-feels-good/,Jade TreeJade Tree,"The Promise Ring didn’t write the book on emo; they just named it. One has to assume Nothing Feels Good graces the cover of Andy Greenwald’s genre exegesis, subtitled ""Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo"", partially because of its title: Greenwald takes us to the LiveJournal era and beyond, so ""nothing feels good"" speaks both to the performative oversharing and theatrical sadness most have associated with emo as well as the self-deprecation and guilt that is assumed of its fans. But even after 18 years, there’s no way anyone can listen to the Promise Ring’s landmark second LP and feel as if it’s an endorsement or cause of anhedonia; it’s one of the most effective cures. The world of Nothing Feels Good doesn't pinpoint specific, identifiable emotions. It is a state of being, one where an overactive mind and overstimulated body aren’t exactly at war, but struggling to attain common ground. It’s feeling like your heart is pumping Mountain Dew straight to your brain and your central nervous system can’t be trusted. Davey von Bohlen himself is at a loss for words to describe it: many of Nothing Feels Good’s inscrutable, quotable lyrics are a result of internal miscommunication: ""I got my hands on the one hand, and I don’t know where to put them"", ""I married a room, where I’ll at least keep my hands in order"", ""how do I explain your body to the rest of my day?"" The Promise Ring were in their very early twenties in 1997, when Nothing Feels Good was released. They retained the urgency and velocity of their rawer, punkier debut 30° Everywhere (also being reissued), matching it to the nervous energy of an entire freshman dorm at a midwestern public university on a Friday night. The Promise Ring can barely contain themselves here, their biggest difference from von Bohlen's previous band Cap’n Jazz, who didn't even try. This touch of restraint amidst chaos makes the Promise Ring a quintessential emo band, and it's the rhythm section that sets them apart from proper indie rock. Compare Nothing Feels Good to the predominant bands of the era—Yo La Tengo, Built to Spill, Pavement, and Belle and Sebastian weren’t exactly known for their exuberance, earnest embrace of pop or crisp musicianship, and while Sleater-Kinney and Fugazi were the only two bands with tighter rhythm sections, their concerns were far different than those of the Promise Ring. This was ""college rock"" but with a different set of reference points: Imagine if Fugazi’s ""Do You Like Me?"" were written from the mindset of ""Call Me Maybe"". And so when skeptics conflate the Promise Ring with more pop-punk oriented peers like Saves the Day or the Get Up Kids, drummer Dan Didier and bassist Scott Beschta (sorely missed on subsequent LPs) are the best counterargument. ""Is This Thing On?"" starts Nothing Feels Good in a full sprint and from that point forward, Didier rarely repeats himself for more than four bars, filling every moment with syncopations, triplet fills, or double-time cymbal crashes. Beschta likewise forgoes indie's preferred thumbing of simple root notes, treating bass as an active melodic and rhythmic participant. It’s not music you can really dance to, but it encourages extroversion and restless giddiness just the same. The sheer likability of Nothing Feels Good may result in its slightly underrated status—it lacks the mythic aura of Cap’n Jazz, isn’t granted the same hushed reverence of Diary, nor is it as currently influential as American Football, passionately defended as The Power of Failing, or as expansive and progressive as Clarity. But it's still subtly innovative—the unconventional song structures showed emo could become pop without verses and choruses, while their open-C tunings lent a warm beauty to even the friskiest songs. More importantly, von Bohlen neutralized early emo's chest-beating with his off-key lisp and playful, poetic language, bridging the abstractions of Tim Kinsella’s Joan of Arc and Owls with Mike Kinsella’s plainspoken mash notes in American Football. Even when ""emotional hardcore"" was presented as an way out of its excessively aggro roots, it was still music meant to be taken very, very seriously—loud and fast and extremely earnest, not entirely concerned with melody, driven by an intense, cloth-rending yearning for spiritual deliverance. The guy at the center of Promise Ring songs is idealistic and well-read, but approachable; we come barrelling into a house party during ""A Broken Tenor"" and all of a sudden, one of the kitchen drinkers is quoting Sylvia Plath’s ""Daddy"". Von Bohlen’s vocabulary is heavy on geographical and chromatic symbolism—he canvasses the continental United States and likes how his girlfriend looks in red, white and blue (""Red & Blue Jeans""), whereas on ""B Is for Bethlehem"", those colors represent flesh and blood. Conflating place and people names would soon become one of the emo's most tired cliches—the Promise Ring themselves were already guilty of it by Very Emergency (""Jersey Shore,"" ""The Deep South""). Still, Nothing Feels Good is charged with the honest enthusiasm you feel upon discovering how much there is out there beyond your hometown, where every new city and every new person seems impossibly fascinating. With sensations this intense, the potential for burnout is perilously high. Greenwald’s book views it as a foregone conclusion for emo bands and fans alike, and there’s a lot of evidence backing up this view—nearly all of the genre's legendary bands flamed out spectacularly, made overtly ""mature"" albums that were shunned by fans, or evolved into more sedate, wistful projects (including Von Bohlen’s own Maritime). ""I don’t know if anything at all will be alright,"" von Bohlen sings on the title track, likely referring to the pressures of adulthood. But he was unfortunately prophetic: the Promise Ring would suffer a near-fatal van accident in 1999 and tried to put a happy face on things with the Botox’d power pop of Very Emergency. A year later, von Bohlen was suffering from severe migraines before a fist-sized tumor was discovered and removed from his brain, followed by an insertion of a prosthetic plate in his skull to replace an infected fragment. On the subsequent Wood/Water, the Promise Ring signed to Anti-, hired a guy who produced Smiths records, and von Bohlen wrote floral, folky songs about settling down, giving up on guitar music, and wishing he never was a singer. Meanwhile*, Nothing Feels Good* sounds like the kind of record only people in their early twenties can make. The Promise Ring never did cash in during the subsequent gold rush (the closest they got was von Bohlen’s cameo on Bleed American); at least their place in the history books is literally secure. And rightfully so: from the first moment of ""Is This Thing On?"", Nothing Feels Good bursts with enthusiasm and nervy optimism, a tireless advocate for the thrills this style of music alone can provide.","Is Nothing Feels Good the quintessential emo record? Maybe, maybe not, but you could do a lot worse than starting here. Though now 18 years old, the Promise Ring's landmark sophomore album retains the freewheeling spirit its members, then in their early twenties, imbued it with. Listening to it isn't about being transported back in time to their youth, or yours for that matter—it's about encapsulating all the frenetic, nervous joy that comes with new adulthood.

Lightless Walk,Cult Leader,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16eea9e61561daa6795/1:1/w_160/bc554f4a.png,2015-10-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21152-lightless-walk/,Deathwish,"Cult Leader’s Useless Animal EP from last year included a cover of Mark Kozelek & Desertshore’s ""You Are Not My Blood""—which wouldn’t be all that remarkable if Cult Leader wasn’t a metallic hardcore band. With that cover, the Salt Lake City foursome established itself as a band that wasn’t afraid to tinker, deconstruct, or simply open up and let its guts spill out. Lightless Walk is the group’s debut full-length, and while it doesn’t contain any left-field covers, it certainly doesn’t need them. Three-quarters of Cult Leader hail from Gaza, the defunct, progressive grindcore outfit whose 2012 swansong No Absolutes in Human Suffering wound up being the most intense thing they ever produced. Lightless Walk tops it. Gaza bassist Anthony Lucero has moved up to lead vocals for Cult Leader (with new bassist Sam Richards abetting guitarist Mike Mason and drummer Casey Hansen), and his doom-soaked howl is enough to leave you wondering what took him so long to front a band. On the mutated, d-beat-meets-blastbeats jolt that is ""Walking Wasteland"", Lucero sings from his intestines instead of his lungs, letting Mason’s caustic riffs wash over him like an acid bath. ""Great I Am"" makes great use of space, hovering distortion, and needles of feedback that are somehow crosshatched into insidious melody. On the whole, Cult Leader is a more aggressive yet concise band than Gaza—and one that gets the notion of merciless self-editing. The closest that the album comes to Gaza’s savage, unrelenting excoriation of organized religion is ""Gutter Gods"", but even then, Lucero’s head-splitting refrain of ""Our eyes are open"" feels more introspective, haunted, and full of metaphysical dread than simply accusatory. Yet Lightless Walk works just as well, if not better, when it crawls and sprawls. ""A Good Life"" dissolves into a drone of lurching arpeggios and Lucero’s chanted baritone; similarly, ""How Deep It Runs"" decelerates to a hypnotic slither. But it’s Lightless Walk’s title track that truly shows off the lessons Cult Leader learned from covering Kozelek. At over seven minutes, the song lays a tribal beats over atmospheric, minimalist guitar, a slowcore reinvention of grind that gives Lucero what seems like horrific amounts of room in which to wander, ponder, and lament—not to mention show off his chops as an apocalyptic crooner. At points, the song resembles the recent output of Swans in both ritualistic bleakness and ambition. If that’s a hint of where Cult Leader might head from here on out, even better. There’s a backstory to Lightless Walk. Gaza’s frontman Jon Parkin was accused of rape in 2012; Gaza broke up shortly thereafter. Since then, the remaining three members have cut all ties with Parkin and spoken of him, when prodded, with a mix of bitterness and frustration. That said, Lightless Walk doesn’t feel in any way like some misguided attempt at vindication. The shadow of Gaza doesn’t hang over the album at all. Instead, the music casts its own shadows: deep, long, and teeming with the ghosts of things lost.","The Salt Lake City metallic hardcore band Cult Leader features three members of the defunct progressive grindcore group Gaza. Last year they released an EP that included a cover of Mark Kozelek & Desertshore’s ""You Are Not My Blood"". Their intense debut full-length doesn’t contain any left-field covers and it doesn’t need them.

Alma Do Meu Pai EP,DJ Firmeza,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1bc9d034d5c69bf4a7b/1:1/w_160/b6f16918.jpg,2015-10-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21195-alma-do-meu-pai-ep/,Príncipe Discos,"Batida, the umbrella term for the variant strains of dance music coming from the ghettos perched in the hills surrounding Lisbon proper, roughly translates to ""my beat"" in Portuguese. As DJ Marfox, the scene's unofficial current figurehead, explained earlier this year, it's also ""the same word for when your heart beats when you have a car crash."" It's perfect sensory context for the heavily percussive polyrhythms streaming from these isolated projects, mostly filled with emigrants from Angola, São Tomé E Príncipe, and other former Portuguese colonies: jarring, frantic, but alive. But for years, there was no platform for batida producers to release any of this stuff; it existed communally—in the Quinta do Mocho and Quinta da Vitória and other remote housing projects, built hastily after Portugal's 1974 revolution brought a sea of immigrants from former colonies to the crowded city—or not at all. Then came Príncipe Discos, a tight-knit local label fiercely devoted to ""100% real contemporary dance music coming out of this city, its suburbs, projects and slums."" Since their first release in 2011, DJ Marfox's Eu Sei Quem Sou EP (or ""I Know Who I Am""), the label has been committed to respectfully representing and propagating these singular, community-driven sounds. The label's latest is Alma Do Meu Pai, a six-track EP from DJ Firmeza, a producer and DJ born in Portugal but of Angolan descent. At 20, he is one of the batida scene's younger members, but his first solo release on the label is refined and mature. Within the Príncipe catalog, Firmeza is more of a minimalist than peers like DJ Nigga Fox. Melody is almost never a factor on Alma Do Meu Pai, which translates to ""Soul of My Father"" in honor of his recently deceased dad. His focus is percussion above all else—sparse, efficient, streamlined. Closing track ""Suposto"" evokes a soca rhythm whittled down and deconstructed; a lilting flute traipses through the remains, head-faking towards melody before it becomes a percussive element itself. You don't see it coming. Most batida tracks are short, two-minute bursts, suited for dancers' wandering attention spans. But the title track ""Alma Do Meu Pai"" clocks in at over six minutes, churning and lurching at a breathless 143 BPM. At a glance, it's repetitive; it's easy to let it all blur together and submit to its current. But with focus, you notice subtle deviations in rhythm, the layers, the way the percussive components move in connection with one another. But instead of cold metallics, this stuff feels warm, organic, very much human, as though each element of a track is part of a larger conversation. It's tempting to explore Alma Do Meu Pai in parallel with underground dance genres like footwork or grime. The movements function in socially similar ways, forging stunningly unique sounds and dances from urban tensions. But batida is different. As Pedro Gomes, one of Príncipe's four label heads, emphasized: ""This is not techno, this is not house, this is not dubstep, this is not grime—this is this, it's not anything else, so if you want this... present this for what it is."" Alma Do Meu Pai, then, is a calm, strange, and deceptively simple study in what can be wrung out of rhythm. It is music for dancing, and for contemplation. And though it is not an explicitly political record, the fact that we are hearing it at all, from the remote projects of Lisbon the city itself forgot, is a political act in itself.","Batida, the umbrella term for the variant strains of dance music coming from the ghettos surrounding Lisbon proper, roughly translates to ""my beat"" in Portuguese.

Incitation EP,Olga Bell,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b106c0084474cd0c1d4b/1:1/w_160/d72609c4.png,2015-10-19 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21089-incitation-ep/,One Little Indian,"Few albums of the last five years provided as profound a feeling of escape as Olga Bell’s breakthrough album Krai. For the Brooklyn-based composer and electronic musician, the effect of its process was the opposite: The piece, meant as a ""concert"" work and funded by a grant from the American Composers Forum, was her way of re-accessing her earliest memories as a young child in Moscow (she moved from there to Alaska when she was seven), as well as exploring the remotest corners of her ancestral land through extensive research. The fruits of her labor are near-uncharacterizable: Bell melds Russian folk melodies with pop, traditional Eastern European forms with jagged, prog-rock onslaughts, and integrates non-Western vocal styles—from Altai-style throat singing to throaty, piquant harmonies recalling the 4AD tapes of the Bulgarian State & Television Female Vocal Choir. By embracing a musical world that feels more in line with her present—and self-consciously down to earth—her new five-song EP, Incitation, provides something more immediately parsable than Krai. Like her 2011 full-length Diamonite, Incitation consists of electro-pop music ready-made for one-person performance. Unlike Krai, Bell is not wrestling with demented mirror reflections of herself; the busy and tangled vocal counterpoint is gone. The digital instruments act as extensions of her strong solo voice in the center of the mix—the pointillistic MIDI synth figurations (think Glasser) on the periphery, the booming electroacoustic percussion and subdued bass. Incitation has an economy of purpose and more serious bent than her previous electronic work, in which Bell made a strong break from her years training as a concert classical pianist and paid tribute—in ecstatic, self-aware or outright jokey tones—to her new life as a composer and performer in New York City. Instead of rushing to keep in time with skittery, double-time drum machines, Bell aims for the austere on this EP, embracing the melismatic melodies and damaged electronic architecture favored by Björk and so many after her. The richly textured drum sampling is the most modern element, indebted to artists like FKA twigs who have drawn threads from R&B toward IDM and other realms of the avant-garde. The lyrics are epigrammatic, and often solemn: They seem to address either her narrator’s self-doubt, or moments of impasse with a lover. In any case, some other soul or specter is always at play as an antagonist, even if it seems like it’s just Bell moving outside herself. In ""Rubbernecker"", the simple repeating piano riff forms an eccentric rhythmic relationship with the drum loop, perfectly underscoring Bell’s fraught diary entry of impressions from a recent national fly-over (the refrain: ""My soul, how hard you're driving/ Get along/ Watch your own road""). Likewise, on ""Goalie"", a synth evoking woodblocks hammers nervously away, as gutted, uneven drum beats pull in and out at random. Bell’s melodies come through with pealing clarity, but her emotions seem harder to pin down: ""For all the tiny muscles in your hand, you don’t shake like I thought you would."" If Krai was on the verge of being irreducibly complex, Incitation risks cutting to the chase too hastily. The songs make an impression only after several run-throughs, and the appeal of some (the title track and ""Pounder I"", especially) waxes and wanes across their duration, sometimes feeling too risk-averse. It feels good to be drawn closer by Bell—to be trusted—but one can’t help but wish for some more complications to the narrative. The music is comfortable, hinting in plenty of promising directions but hesitating from going all the way toward them.","The composer and singer/songwriter Olga Bell joined Dirty Projectors for the tour behind 2012's Swing Lo Magellan and released a profoudly strange and complex album in 2014 called Krai examining her childhood in Russia. Her new EP, Incitation, is more straightforward, evoking FKA twigs and Björk.

Electronica 1: The Time Machine,Jean-Michel Jarre,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b139c0084474cd0c1d9d/1:1/w_160/8e14d669.png,2015-10-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21117-electronica-1-the-time-machine/,Columbia,"In many ways, Jean-Michel Jarre is a natural fit for today's electronic music culture, with its fireworks and bombast. The French producer was a pioneer of flashy outdoor events—laser harps, pyrotechnics, crowds of a million or more, and budgets running into the millions, set in places like the Great Pyramids of Giza. His records sold like hotcakes—his 1976 debut, Oxygène, is said to be France's best-selling album ever—and featured spacy, arpeggio-laced fantasias, halfway between the ""cosmic"" synthesizer music of Tangerine Dream and the techno-pop of Kraftwerk, but they often veered dangerously close to kitsch. The French musician's last new album was in 2007, but now he returns, borrowing a page from Giorgio Moroder's playbook, with an album clearly designed to introduce him to a new generation. There are 16 songs on Electronica 1 and 15 collaborators (""Automatic"", a co-production with Yazoo's Vince Clarke, is in two parts), and they run the gamut, from titans like Tangerine Dream and Laurie Anderson to rising dance-music stars like Gesaffelstein. Fellow synth maestro John Carpenter represents the electronic old school along with Anderson and whatever surviving members of Tangerine Dream are now using the name. The classical pianist Lang Lang lends a little high-culture gravitas, and Pete Townshend is here for some reason. Then, on the contemporary side, there's the French synth-pop soundscaper M83, one of the artists indebted to Jarre's sense of texture and volume, along with the adrenaline-loving techno producer Boys Noize, the prog-minded electronic duo Fuck Buttons, and the electro-pop singer and musician Little Boots. But this diversity presents our first problem. Because unless you approach Electronica 1 as a collection of unrelated songs designed to be cherry-picked for playlists—and given the generic title, maybe that's the point—there's little to hold it together. In the first three songs we're taken from buzzing, high-energy techno-pop with Boys Noize, a billowing schaffel number with M83, and a weird New Order-goes-New Age pastiche with Air, and it never gets more coherent than that, unless you count Jarre slathering filters and bright, buzzing synths on everything like so much Cool-Whip as a common denominator. And that brings us to our second problem: apart from a few songs—the moody ""Automatic"", with Vince Clarke, and maybe the goth-leaning Gesaffelstein track—the music just isn't very good. ""Suns Have Gone"" is an anodyne electro-house bouncer featuring a mopey Moby. The Tangerine Dream tune features some nice, pinging synths, but there are literally dozens, if not scores, of Tangerine Dream records you'd be advised to reach for first. ""Rely on Me"" saps Laurie Anderson's voice of its arch, critical qualities and turns her into the centerpiece for a sultry downtempo cut you'd expect to find on a Hôtel Costes compilation. Maybe the song that makes the most sense is the Armin van Buuren collaboration ""Stardust"", and that's because the trance icon is most like Jarre himself in his fondness for whooshing effects, gleaming synths, and big, emotional-button-pushing chord changes. Of all contemporary electronic styles, trance is the only one where Jarre's influence is really felt; it would have made more sense to team him up with a dozen producers from that style, where a real back-and-forth exchange of ideas might have taken place. Instead, Electronica 1 is mostly a matter of superimposing one style upon another—sort of like tracing shapes on the pyramids with lasers.","In many ways, French producer Jean-Michel Jarre is a natural fit for today's electronic music culture, with its fireworks and bombast.

Divers,Joanna Newsom,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b113ea9e61561daa670b/1:1/w_160/5649bf69.jpg,2015-10-19 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21097-divers/,Drag City,"Joanna Newsom's Divers is an album about a profound love, but it hardly features any love songs. The singer/songwriter recently explained to Uncut that her marriage in 2013 had invited death into her life, ""because there is someone you can't bear to lose,"" she said. ""When it registers as true, it's like a little shade of grief comes in when love is its most real version. Then it contains death inside of it, and then that death contains love inside of it."" There is only one domestic vignette on the record, towards the end of ""Leaving the City"", where Newsom and her love go running on a beautiful day. Immediately, though, her high dims: ""The spirit bends beneath knowing it must end."" 2010's Have One on Me traced the death of a relationship as Newsom tried and failed to defeat a proud man's human nature. On Divers, she attempts to defeat time to stave off death. To bear the weight of its subject, Divers fits to scale, ornate and roaming after the intimacies of Have One on Me. The arrangements—tackled by Newsom along with eight different musicians, including Nico Muhly, Ryan Francesconi, Dirty Projectors' David Longstreth, and her brother Pete—cover the ground of all her past work in a fraction of the time, making this her most dynamic and exhilarating album. The first half in particular veers between baroque poise, jaunty blues, and rococo beauty, as if searching for answers in disparate places. Landlocked between the dry, acoustic arrangements of ""The Things I Say"" and ""Same Old Man"", the lilting harp and piano of the title track casts her lover as a deep sea diver and measures the distance between them, ""how the infinite divides."" The meticulous internal rhymes in the chorus of ""Leaving the City"" contract against the tug of her harp, a cascade of tiny parts that form a huge, billowing whole, like tiny bones in a vast wingspan. ""The longer you live, the higher the rent,"" she sings inside the frenzy. Divers makes a landscape out of this abstract fear of loss. On the courtly ""Anecdotes"" and ""Waltz of the 101st Lightborne"", she is part of a battle fought by birds to try and wrest control of time. ""You Will Not Take My Heart Alive"" is the most Ren Fair piece here, on which Newsom contemplates ascension to some transcendent plane, ""[severing] all strings to everyone and everything."" Its sister song ""A Pin-Light Bent"" descends sadly back towards reason and reconciliation of her unsuccessful quest to outrun time. ""In our lives is a common sense/ That relies on the common fence/ That divides and attends,"" she sings with palpable mourning, accepting that her life, ""until the time is spent, is a pin-light, bent."" Where this kind of cosmic existentialism could come off like a stoner marveling at the moon, Newsom pulls it off with balance of poetry and reason. Her fantastical world is sometimes hard to get your head around, but it brings surreal, sometimes sci-fi delight to a record that's otherwise often lyrically despairing. Where Newsom's second and third records each overhauled what came before, Divers is a refinement that draws on elements of each of its predecessors. The shapes of her records often get misinterpreted as concepts themselves, rather than the sign of a writer attuned to her work's needs. Ys from 2006 was the five-song suite; Have One on Me from 2010, the three-disc opus. On its surface Divers is more conventional, a single disc where nine of its 11 songs are under six minutes long, but it also happens to be a wild, genuine concept album. The final song, ""Time, As a Symptom"", ends with Newsom in raptures, commanding white stars, birds, and ships to ""transcend!"" On the very last burst, she clips the word to ""trans—"". The first word on opener ""Anecdotes"" is ""sending."" It is a perfect loop. Most artists on their fourth album settle into atrophy, or at least comfort, Newsom delivers such complex, nuanced music, filled with arcane constructions, that she is only her own yardstick. (In a recent interview about Divers, David Longstreth cited The Milk-Eyed Mender as one of the reasons he quit college: ""[What] am I doing here if someone is already out there making music like this, on this level?"") Her consummate craft is a given; what surprises every time is her ceaselessly renewing sensitivity for life's vicissitudes and the fantastic ways she finds to express them. D**ivers is not a puzzle to crack, but a dialog that generously articulates the intimate chasm of loss, the way it's both irrational and very real. Nothing will stem the fear of a loved one's death, which western culture does little to prepare us for until the very end, but by pulling at the prospect of mortality from every angle, Newsom emerges straighter-spined, and invites you to stand alongside her.","On her fourth album, Divers, Joanna Newsom comes down in size if not scope. A love letter in the form of a reckoning with death, Divers deals with making tangible the huge mass of impending doom about the loss of love. You know, the small stuff. It's a gorgeous record, full of her usual harp wilyness and baroque rhythms.

Shape Shift,Zombi,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1949d034d5c69bf4a41/1:1/w_160/8e5697f3.jpg,2015-10-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21171-shape-shift/,Relapse,"For decades, the theme from the film Halloween has been about as well-known as a piece of music can get, but it's only lately that iconic horror filmmaker John Carpenter has embraced the spotlight as an electronic musician and quote-unquote composer. Listen to any record by the one-time Pittsburgh-based duo Zombi, though, and it's obvious that keyboardist/multi-instrumentalist Steve Moore and drummer A.E. Paterra wear their film-geek affinities on their sleeve. The band's name is, in fact, derived from the Italian title of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, which was filmed at Moore's hometown shopping mall and scored by Italian prog rock outfit Goblin, a huge influence on Zombi along with Carpenter and other film composers such as Fabio Frizzi and Riz Ortolani. Paterra and British documentary/video game composer Paul Lawler recently collaborated under the moniker Contact, while Moore has embarked on a side career scoring films on his own, most recently supplying the score for Belgian director Jonas Govaerts' 2014 horror movie Cub. Relapse Records is, in fact, releasing Zombi's fifth full-length Shape Shift and the Cub soundtrack on the same day. It's impossible to ignore the common thread between the two albums, and since the Cub score doesn't do enough to re-contextualize Moore's approach to harmony, it only serves to reveal his limitations in Zombi. But, as Moore has made clear in recent press, he and Paterra have always considered Zombi a post-rock outfit that happens to use the vocabulary of soundtracks. In their view, their work has more in common with, say, Battles or Trans Am than it does with those aforementioned cinematic influences. Indeed, Zombi's third album, 2009's Spirit Animal, combined the stately gesturing of Genesis' 1974 prog epic The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway with the ominous intonation of film music. Somehow, Moore and Paterra managed to evoke the murky synthesizer ambience of the 1970s while also infusing their music with a decidedly modern aura. Though Shape Shift marks the first time since 2006's Surface to Air that Moore and Paterra made music in the same room with one another, the throbbing analog synth pulse of album opener ""Pillars of the Dawn"" suggests that the pair might have lost their ability to draw on their influences without getting stuck in the past. Paterra's drums very precisely recall the tone and feel of drummer Neil Peart's performance circa Signals, Rush's 1982 head-first dive into synth-driven rock. From a purely sonic standpoint, it's an impressive feat to recapture the acoustic fingerprint of Peart's drums without using sample triggers, but you can't shake the sensation that you've just stepped out of a time machine and landed in the wrong year. In that way, Shape Shift initially comes across as pandering to retrophilia when Moore and Paterra have already demonstrated that they're clever enough to not have to resort to that kind of thing. That said, it doesn't take long for the band's underlying attitude to breathe life into this material. Two tracks in and it becomes clear that Moore and Paterra play with a fire that their musical forbears lacked. Paterra in particular—the way his drumming both drives the music and makes room for it to breathe, the nuanced variations in the way he strikes the snare, hi-hat, and the bell of his ride cymbal—gives Shape Shift a gritty, utterly human quality that complements Moore's synthetic palette. In general, Zombi favor mid-tempo grooves that require a lot of reserve, but Paterra reminds you at all times that you're listening to a rock band with an underlying sense of millennial angst, even if that angst is never explicitly articulated. We are, after all, talking about long-winded mathy instrumental music here. But that's the thing: at some point while listening to Shape Shif**t, it dawns on you that you can actually hum all of these tunes. Sure, there are times when Moore and Paterra let their instincts to impose changes for their own sake get the better of them. Not far into the 8-minute-plus ""Interstellar Package"", a groove built out of an oscillating low-pitched synth throb grows to a majestic crescendo that prematurely gives way to six minutes' worth of undifferentiated drone, a move that short-circuits the tune's potential payoff. Nevertheless, in their own way Moore and Paterra write catchy music. That their tastes position them as soundtrack-buff outsiders at the fringes makes the cohesion, listenability, and passion of Shape Shift that much more of a triumph.","Zombi get their name from the Italian title of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, but keyboardist/multi-instrumentalist Steve Moore has said he considers his group a post-rock band that just happens to use the vocabulary of soundtracks.

Cardamom Times EP,Weyes Blood,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b136c0084474cd0c1d99/1:1/w_160/5caa35e4.jpg,2015-10-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21116-cardamom-times-ep/,KemadoMexican Summer,"Weyes Blood is the project of multi-instrument folk musician Natalie Mering. She recorded the four-song Cardamom Times EP on a reel-to-reel deck in her Rockaway, N.Y., home studio; it sounds like a lush, pristine folk-rock gem rescued from the 1960s. The playing is patient and assured, and you can't say enough about her voice, a dusky, soulful soprano that draws you into her world as well as into a larger tradition. She has the kind of voice that’s both distinctive and familiar, and it fits perfect with her style: the arrangements are at once classic, sneakily innovative, and entirely her own. Cardamon Times follows Mering's second album, 2014's The Innocents. It's more pure, and the overall sound is less composed. Instead of a complex studio creation, it comes off like an overheard monologue in the woods. The rural, solitary video for the stunning five-and-a-half-minute closer ""In the Beginning"", which was shot on Super 8 film in Northern Canada and finds Mering wandering the countryside by herself, captures this feel. Cardamom sounds a bit like an archival folk collection but it's filled with suprising details. The lengthy ""Take You There"" opens with a minute of melancholic organ drone; for the rest of the track, she sings over the fluctuating keys without any percussion. Opener ""Maybe Love"" has pretty, Sundays-like guitar strums and eventually, at songs's end, noise is layered beneath ghostly multi-tracked voices. On ""Cardamom"", her voice is almost distorted beside crystal clear guitar picking and a piping flute. As you listen more closely, subtle touches distance Mering's music from the purely nostalgic. Her lyrics feel personal. Cardamom Times mostly focuses on love, lost and found and lost again. ""Maybe Love"" includes the touching, realistic detail: ""I like seeing you notice me/ When I’m feeling better about/ You and me."" The old-timey sounding ""Cardamom"" snaps into the present when she sings: ""I like your band, can I hold your hand this time?/ Do you find what I do kind of cool?/ Would we last a minute or two?"" Nothing seems permanent here, even when the music is timeless. ""In the Beginning"", her best song to date, features a melancholic but catchy melody and an arrangement of guitars and organs and her voice. She sings about a field of stars. She sings about suffering and changing, of bittersweet meetings that happen at the wrong time. She asks ""Have you ever walked in on a Queen before?"" She admits she's not trying to relate at the moment. And she just keeps going, and it's astonishing. Her music seems so simple at first, but it keeps deepening.","The Cardamom Times EP sounds like a lush, pristine folk-rock gem rescued from the 1960s.

All We Need,Raury,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1959d034d5c69bf4a44/1:1/w_160/58acfb95.jpg,2015-10-16 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21172-all-we-need/,Columbia,"Raury made his big debut in 2014 with the folk-leaning EP Indigo Child, which was anchored by its single and centerpiece ""God’s Whisper"". That EP was a daring first statement with soulful alternative rock jams supercut with real, recorded fights he had with his mother. It was stuffed with big ideas, but it often had trouble wrangling them. Still, it effectively established Raury as this sort of genre migrant who existed adjacent to the rap world without sounding much like it. The singer-songwriter has a real sense for composition and a knack for ambiguity, and he, like his stylistic forebear André 3000, remains at arm's length from hip-hop, never quite a full-fledged rapper but certainly draped in the tropes of the genre, reaping the benefits of everything cool and useful that comes from identifying with it. He is literally indie rap, and his debut album, All We Need, searches further for perfect balance. All We Need isn't the transcendent Raury project that’s been foreshadowed since he became a blog darling, the one that reconciles genre distinctions and renders them obsolete. It isn't ahead of its time or magnificent in scope. Instead, much like Indigo Child, it's merely an exhibition for a young creative still figuring out the true extent of his genius with as many hiccups. The wrinkles haven't been ironed out yet; his genre-mashing can be scatterbrained and even hollow. Sometimes, like on the RZA-featuring ""CPU"", it works well and sometimes, like on Big K.R.I.T.-featuring ""Forbidden Knowledge"", it completely misses the mark. Raury emerged with a fully formed aesthetic, but his sound, albeit fascinating, still needs time to incubate. From start to finish, All We Need scans as Indigo Child Redux with similar pacing and nearly identical tropes. This one is anchored by its single, ""Devil’s Whisper"", which puts a slightly darker tint on the hand-clapping-around-the-campfire folk of its predecessor. The album is mostly a reprise of his boho hippie rap tunes, wandering in and out of folk territory with lots of stringy acoustic riffs, hedging toward rock with hip-hop spirit, casually blending influences like a Tumblr kid that grew up in a post-Napster world. The writing is angst-y and centric to a wide-eyed, teenage worldview: chasing girls and soothing parents and saving the Earth. On the opening title track, he sets the tone for his flower child vibes: ""Don’t hate, my brother/ God is our friend/ I walked for miles and/ I see no end/ To the hate."" Many of the songs call for unity and love with several mentions of an impending Armageddon, and Raury tackles these huge topics with ambitious arrangements. On ""Revolution"", he pleads for divine intervention over strum-heavy riffs, throbbing 808 bass, hand drums, and vocal chops. On the slow-moving ""Peace Prevail"", which has a tempering rhythm and melting bass, he borrows André 3000's flow to rap about being a rap outlier (""Been by myself since the White T’s/ Been by myself since Dem Franchize Boyz did that dance on that hoe in the white tee"") before praying for peace with a chorus of voices at his back. There’s significantly more rapping here than on his last release, and while dextrous rapping isn’t exactly his forte, there are moments where he finds his flow. It doesn't feel like he's gotten that much better at what he does, but he seems to be figuring it out. He's got people like Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello and underground Atlanta rapper Key! on the album to help him. With an album replete with Spanish guitar jams, wide-eyed hip-hop, and psychedelic rock k-holes, there isn't much ground left for Raury to cover. Now, he must figure out how to do it all just a little bit better.","Raury is a genre migrant who exists adjacent to the rap world without sounding much like it, and All We Need isn't the transcendent project that’s been foreshadowed since he became a blog darling.

I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler,YACHT,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1a15e6ef95969322168/1:1/w_160/d2fe94e9.jpeg,2015-10-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21181-i-thought-the-future-would-be-cooler/,Downtown,"Claire L. Evans is as fascinated by and enamored with ideas of ""the future"" as she is skeptical and critical of them. She's an ardent ""science fiction apologist,"" a busy writer, an editor at VICE's science and tech journal Motherboard, and a co-creator of 5 Every Day, an app that provides users with ""a no-nonsense events calendar and exploration engine"" in and around Los Angeles. She's smart as hell, bursting with talent, and pretty damn cool, to put it plainly, someone you can't help but pay attention to when she speaks. Her Twitter is patently great. Evans is also a member of YACHT, an erstwhile solo project started by Jonah Bechtolt in 2002. Over the course of two albums for James Murphy's DFA label, 2009's See Mystery Lights and 2011's Shangri-La, the pair shared vocal and songwriting duties, crafting disco-touched pop songs exploring cosmic anomalies, hallucinatory excursions, and utopian ideals. It never mattered much that the basis of their sound started as an homage to LCD Soundsystem—hell, even the music video to ""Summer Song"" was an homage—because their attitudes and charisma elevated the music. At their best, YACHT gave us Devo's wit, Blondie's grace, and Tom Tom Club's playful energy, all wrapped in a knowing grin and a clever concept. Four years later, YACHT has changed, sort of. Evans, now the sole lead singer, is pictured alone on the cover of I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler, and the title makes clear that she now has something to say. It all seems promising on paper: Evans' credentials posit her as a strong, intelligent voice, and YACHT's punky dance-pop would ostensibly sit well within the latest '80s resurgence. And yet not quite. For one, although her tone has shifted drastically, the music has remained as upbeat as ever, even goofy in places. At the beginning of I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler, Evans sings, ""I only learned who I loved when I left them all in the past,"" and by its end she's shouting, ""Give me entertainment! Death by entertainment!"" It makes for a jarring match. When we're told of ""mediated war zones and countries full of death"" over breezy post-disco grooves and light Rhodes chords in ""Matter"", it's like a friend making an off-color joke over text—you're pretty sure they're being sarcastic, but it definitely didn't sound that way. There is some solid songwriting on Future. The juxtaposition of bubblegum new wave and tender synth-pop in ""Don't Be Rude"" feels effortless and inventive, and ""Miles & Miles"" is a rousing throwback to those DFA albums. Bechtolt's co-production with Rob Kieswetter recalls Midnite Vultures electro-funk on ""Hologram"". But for every decent takeaway, we're confronted with ""I Wanna Fuck You Til I'm Dead"" or the spastic, vibe-killing chorus of ""Ringtone"", nonsensical amalgams that range from tactless to tone deaf to straight obnoxious. They're YACHT's uncanny valley: lifelike approximations of late-'90s power pop, early '00s Top 40, and blog-house mp3s that somehow aren't lifelike enough. I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler has good intentions. As Evans told LA Mag, ""The central thesis is not that we're disappointed that we were promised jet packs. It's more like, I don't care about jet packs if we still don’t have basic human rights."" Songs comment on our increasing tech obsessions, societal violence and inequality, and future fatigue with effusive hooks, lending each decidedly familiar arrangement a fresh immediacy thanks to upgraded production values. Their messages, however, are in turns vague ruminations, condescending truisms, or just foregone conclusions for anyone with an interest in current events. Future is YACHT's would-be critique of our pre-dystopian, post-Internet culture, but it rarely comes off as more than a charismatic cover band singing us yesterday's news.","At their best, YACHT gave us Devo's wit, Blondie's grace, and Tom Tom Club's playful energy, all wrapped in a knowing grin and a clever concept.

Thank Your Lucky Stars,Beach House,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1bfc0084474cd0c1e73/1:1/w_160/5d056739.jpg,2015-10-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21197-thank-your-lucky-stars/,Sub Pop,"Over the last decade, Beach House have been remarkably consistent: at regular intervals, they put an immaculate new record into the world, and each tends to satisfy the same need. Until now, their pace of releases has indicated a grasp of the spot their music held in listeners’ hearts; the world that Alex Scally and Victoria Legrand build on their records is a place we want to revisit, but the spaces in between records has felt essential to that magic. They are in their own way a theatrical band, and what’s more theatrical than a well-placed pause? Which all makes the appearance of Thank Your Lucky Stars, the band’s second full-length in as many months, surprising. Depression Cherry is still very much in view, and as fans, it feels a bit like the cast to a hit show suddenly reappearing for one more encore after the house lights have switched on and we were filing out. Thank Your’s nine songs were recorded at the same time as Depression Cherry, and they do have a slightly darker edge: Legrand said that the album was more ""political"" in nature and that they felt the need for these songs to exist on their own, separate from the long-lens telegraphing of the typical album release cycle. Their sound feels purposefully smaller, tamping down the reverb that made Teen Dream, Bloom, and Depression Cherry feel like they were recorded in great stone cathedrals. You can hear them experimenting more with ""off"" notes in their otherwise-immaculate arrangements. On ""Somewhere Tonight"", Legrand lets a sour note sneak into one of her organ runs, and ""One Thing"" opens with a heavy cloud of electric guitar that feels more tethered to snaking cables and rattling amps than usual. Spiritually, the album feels closer to the mood the duo cultivated before they signed to Sub Pop: These songs feel pneumatic, dusty, like they are pulling a blanket around themselves in a heatless attic to ward off a threatening chill. The mood is also bleaker in spots, as if joy and comfort had vanished from the songs along with the reverb. ""All Your Yeahs"" is closer to the midnight sulk of Johnny Jewel and Chromatics than their usual open-air romanticism. And ""Elegy to the Void"", the album’s clear standout, might be the most death-obsessed Beach House have ever been: The organ processional that wells up in the song’s intro has a funereal tinge, while Legrand sings darkly of ""Sons and daughters/ Bending at the altar/ Disappearing in the mirror."" The song offers a series of gorgeous images—a ""black clock, looming distant"" and ""freckle-faced young virgin""—as it surges into a slow-motion burst, Scally’s normally crystalline guitar breaking apart like a DNA strand uncoupling. But Thank Your is still undeniably a Beach House album, a familiar mix of warm tones and chilly sentiments. With the imprint still fading on Depression, *Thank Your’*s impact is undeniably dulled, causing a strange ""too much of a good thing"" problem. You start noticing surface similarities that you wouldn’t pay attention to otherwise: Play the arpeggiated keyboard figure that opens this album’s ""Common Girl"" next to Bloom’s ""On the Sea"", for instance. Their music is built on echoes: even their self-titled debut felt like covers of chansons you didn’t remember. Timing isn’t everything, of course, and Thank Your Lucky Star**s, as surprising a gesture of generosity as it is, is still welcome. But Legrand and Scally, who know their way around a stage, would do well to gracefully exit left for a while and give this run of music some time to sink in.","Suprise release Thank Your Lucky Stars is Beach House's second full-length in as many months.

Grievances,Kowloon Walled City,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16a5e6ef95969322111/1:1/w_160/09c7d696.jpg,2015-10-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21149-grievances/,Neurot,"No one but a person who’d experienced abject powerlessness and the passive acceptance of degradation could have created Grievances. It’s the third full-length by San Francisco’s Kowloon Walled City, a post-metal group that Scott Evans fronts as both singer/guitarist and producer. Wearing that many hats in a band suggests a position of authority, but you’d never guess that listening to Grievances. Evans subsumes his riffs within vast, oppressive swathes of empty space. He submits his voice to a process of industrialized monotony. His guitar doesn’t gently weep—it curls up, plays dead, and still isn’t able to halt its cataclysmic spasms. Yet Grievances sounds anything but weak. Kowloon’s last album, 2012’s Container Ships, showed a shift toward refinement that felt more like a half measure, but here, Evans and crew have hit on something profound. It isn’t a concept album per se, but it does have an overarching theme: the psychic, social, and spatial anxieties of the modern workplace. But Grievances isn’t about run-of-the-mill disgruntled employment as much as it’s a haunting meditation on humanity’s disassociation from the product—or, in our increasingly cyber-centric world, the service—of its labor. ""You sell it like a poet,"" Evans howls on ""The Grift"", the centerpiece and high point of the album. It’s an accusation of self-commodification, seemingly aimed both inward and outward. It’s more than that, though; as a trainwreck of AmRep-style noise rock is sculpted into minimalist shapes, that structure becomes a metaphor for hollowness of all kinds. ""The fiction sells,"" Evans reiterates, and when he slams the ""confidence game"" of modern interpersonal commerce, his sardonic use of ""confidence"" is even more lacerating than his sly insinuation of melody. At just over three and a half minutes, ""The Grift"" is the runt of the album. Song lengths stretch onward from there, including Grievances’ title track, which crawls along for nearly seven minutes’ worth of forlorn rage. While Evans levels the charge ""No love/ No memory/ Just admit it"", fellow guitarist Jon Howell locks into a pneumatic, dehumanized groove that sputters out in gasps of dead air. Bassist Ian Miller chugs and claws; drummer Jeff Fagundes (replaced by Julia Lancer since this recording) puts the brakes on spacetime. If Godflesh and Codeine had ever conspired to hybridize, it might have come out like this: bleak but bare, mechanistic yet melancholic. Grievances is inalienably heavy, but it’s not sludge in the conventional sense. On ""Your Best Years"", the distortion is more clotted than fuzzy, with immaculate slabs of dissonance left dangling overhead. But it’s ""Backlit"" that sums up the huge step forward Kowloon has taken with Grievances. Arid and static at first, it builds into a monument to grim resignation that feels weathered and ancient right out of the gate. ""Wear out your weaknesses,"" Evans half-commands, half-implores; later he adds, ""Wear all your weaknesses."" Resistance is futile, but in that steadfast futility there is strength.","Grievances is the third full-length by San Francisco’s Kowloon Walled City, a post-metal group fronted by Scott Evans.

Let's Jam 1 EP / Let's Jam 2 EP,Zomby,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b167ea9e61561daa678d/1:1/w_160/ad0bbb63.png,2015-10-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21148-lets-jam-1-ep-lets-jam-2-ep/,XL,"In the two-plus years since 2013's With Love, Zomby has experimented with a new mode: silence. Or, at least, relative silence, as the irascible producer has been dormant after keeping a near constant release schedule since debuting in 2007. It's been for the best, really, as London's grime underground, including upstarts like Visionist and Logos, took the genre to new, exciting places just as Zomby's twinkling arpeggios started to feel too familiar. Now Zomby returns, first with a one-off single this summer with grime godfather Wiley and now with Let's Jam!!, a series of two four-track EPs, his first work for stalwart independent XL Recordings. Anyone hoping for fireworks upon Zomby's return is likely to be disappointed, as Let's Jam!! is slight both by XL's standards and the strictures of dance music 12""s. Zomby has referred to at least one of the tracks here (""Acid Surf"") as a ""DJ tool""—a simple, repetitive piece meant to aid DJ mixing—and much of Let's Jam 1 proceeds in this manner, offering up slight variations on simple riffs. DJ tools are a common, simple convention, but they usually aren't packaged with promotional airhorns (nor do they tend to come out on XL Recordings, or at least not since the early '90s), so it's fair to assume that Zomby sees these as somewhat more substantial than that term implies. Locating that substance proves difficult. On Let's Jam 1 Zomby (finally!) abandons his signature sound for something that amounts to a walking tour of early rave conventions—of the early history of XL, coincidentally or not—adding little to the equation. Opener ""Surf I"" is essentially a harmless electro sendup, featuring a low voice grunting the track's title while short melodic lines phase in and out. The problem is that, even for a low-stakes genre exercise, ""Surf I"" is badly lacking in dynamism, deploying that same curt vocal sample on the first downbeat of every other measure of the track while a short bassline repeats. It is noticeably repetitive in a realm in which repetition is basically the entire point. No, if you're looking for the type of subtle shifts and melodic changeups that are part and parcel to the very concept of dance music you'll have to wait for ""Surf II"", a similar concept but with just enough rhythmic interplay and moving pieces to register as improvement. If for some reason you should want to bridge these Zomby offers aforementioned tool ""Acid Surf"", which sounds like a parody of Zomby doing an acid track: a zippy 303 bassline, a sample of someone sternly declaring ""acid"", and lots of airhorn. ""Slime"", a coarse interpretation of the hoover bass sound, is a far better fit for Zomby's eerie sense of melody. There's less to say about Let's Jam 2, which returns Zomby to his default style—sparkling synths, fizzy square wave bass, pools of reverb—with diminishing returns. The best of the four tracks, ""Bloom"", wouldn't sound out of place on Local Action or Keysound Recordings or any of the other London labels releasing lush, forward-thinking bass explorations, but nor would it stand out. (More troublingly, you could say the same about its placement on Zomby's past two albums.) Grime has gotten vaster and braver in Zomby's absence; long reverb tails and gunshot percussion don't quite cut it anymore. Let's Jam!! does unload some of With Love's portentous conceptualism. It's nice to see Zomby return to the short, understated format under which he's released some of his most potent material; With Love suggested that his gilded, buzzy sound is difficult to scale. No points just for showing up, though, and Let's Jam!! finds Zomby far too conservative working through two distinct periods of UK dance history.","Zomby returns with a series of two four-track EPs, his first work for stalwart independent XL Recordings.

Eyes of Love,The Edge of Daybreak,by: Marcus J.

It happens on ""Your Destiny"", and it’s the freest moment of a recording made in five hours in a Virginia federal prison. Released in 1979, Eyes of Love was recorded in one take on a $3,000 budget at the Powhatan Correctional Center in State Farm, Va. The band members were all inmates, incarcerated for armed robbery and assault, with sentences ranging from six to 60 years. The musicians, some of whom played in other bands before they were locked up, were allowed to play instruments at the prison complex. They covered songs by the Isley Brothers, Slave, and Earth, Wind & Fire. Jamal Jahal Nubi, the Edge of Daybreak’s lead singer and drummer, entered the Virginia prison in 1976 and established another group called Cosmic Conception with Edward Tucker and William Crawley. He’d later form Edge of Daybreak with fellow prisoners Harry Coleman on additional vocals, James Carrington on keys, Cornelius Cade on guitar, McEvoy Robinson on bass, and Willie Williams on percussion. The band didn't have equipment to overdub, so they brought in backup musicians to play instruments when the regulars had to sing. A few local media outlets covered Eyes of Love upon its release. Only 1,000 copies were pressed. ""PM Magazine"", a now-defunct television news show, produced a segment called ""Cellblock Rock"" that aired footage of Edge of Daybreak’s recording. The album arrived as the outside world was moving away from brassier sounds for the likes of disco and nu-wave. Up the road in Washington, D.C., musicians like Chuck Brown and Trouble Funk were putting their own unique twist on black music. Their blend was called go-go, a percussive strain of funk designed to keep the beat going without breaks. In a way, the Edge of Daybreak seemed influenced by the homegrown genre, and at certain points on Eyes of Love, you sense the band’s urge to break away from the literal and figurative structures that contained them. Given their circumstances, it would’ve been easy for the group to create something sullen. Yet on Eyes of Love, it’s as if the band wanted to uplift themselves through song, and to forget their living arrangements if only for a few hours. These songs are optimistic, touching on the brilliance of love and glorifying romance in all its sugary splendor. Songs like ""Let Us"" and ""Let’s Be Friends"" recall the 1960s doo-wop era, while ""Edge of Daybreak"" and ""I Wanna Dance With You"" are extensive dance grooves. Thematically, Eyes of Love is about a group of guys making the best of a tough situation. That a collection of inmates even recorded an album is a testament, and the fact that it’s so well done is a plus. The inmates couldn’t just go to the studio. Prison personnel required Alpha Audio—in nearby Richmond—to record the band at the Powhatan complex. They had to sing and play their instruments simultaneously, and get everything right the first time. The album’s last song, ""Our Love"", was recorded as prison guards told the band to wrap up recording. The group members were taken back to their cells as soon as the last song finished. Despite the duress, there aren’t any noticeable hiccups on the LP, making me wonder what could’ve been if the band had more time to perfect it. By the fall of 1980, keyboardist Carrington was transferred to another prison. Then vocalist Coleman. Then Cade, who was moved to Powhatan’s North Housing Unit, essentially breaking up the Edge of Daybreak. There were talks of a sophomore album, but with the musicians in separate prison facilities, it was impossible to rehearse. In the end, Eyes of Love would be the group’s swan song. Thirty-six years later, it’s still a living testament to what can be done in tumultuous conditions. It’s a push to make a way, and to persevere, even when the light is dim.","Released in 1979, the R&B group Edge of Daybreak’s Eyes of Love was recorded in one take at the Powhatan Correctional Center in State Farm, Va.

Each song was captured in one take, and the whole album recorded in a daylong session. Her lyrics are collaged-together English translations of the songs' source material, which mostly concern seduction and infatuation. After a certain point, her singing becomes wailing. Her screams are pained and, to borrow Khan's word, ""orgasmic."" When it came time to name the project, she shrugged and told Carey, ""It’s Sexwitch, innit?"" The material for the album was unearthed during a fruitful crate-digging trip, when Khan and Carey obsessed over some rare psychedelic tracks from other countries. They found two songs from Iran: ""Ghoroobaa Ghashangan"" (on the Light in the Attic comp Zendooni) and ""Helelyos"" (a song by Iranian singer Zia that's appeared on several Iranian pre-revolutionary pop compilations). Two songs are featured on the Raw 45s of Morocco comp: ""Ha Howa Ha Howa"" and ""Kassidat El Hakka"". The original version of ""Lam Plearn Kiew Bao"" is from Thailand and can be found on a Soundway comp. These songs' messages of liberation and passion are well suited to Khan's voice, especially at its most intense. Compared to The Haunted Man, Khan's untethered presence on Sexwitch is a departure. Her Bat for Lashes work foregrounds structure and melody, but here she takes key phrases and molds them, repeating and inverting them. When necessary, she makes her voice percussive, especially when she emphasizes the repeated words ""my dark girls"" on ""Helelyos"". Khan's performances are equal parts wild and controlled, and TOY have no trouble nailing these songs. They're funky on ""Ghoroobaa Ghashangan"" and their percussion work on ""Kassidat El Hakka"" is satisfyingly heavy. To Carey's credit, this album sounds great, too. But since every song on Sexwitch is a cover, it begs the question: What do Sexwitch's versions add? Occasionally, they feel overlong. Repetition is key to this music, but after several cycles, tracks begin to plod, broken up only by Khan's vocal work. The Sexwitch interpretations lose vital elements from the originals like horns, organs, and bells. The most successful cover is arguably the closer: Skip Spence's ""War in Peace"". It's an excellent choice, and it offers Sexwitch the opportunity to simmer, jam, and gradually ramp back up. ""War in peace,"" Khan sings, adding, ""What a funny combination."" The song is proof that they can thrive in the sweet spot between unchained freewheeling psychedelia and something more regimented and precise like ""All Your Gold"". But then again, why tame a band that's hell-bent on staying untamed?","Sexwitch is a project from Natasha Khan of Bat for Lashes. With her producer Dan Carey and the UK-based psychedelic group TOY, she reinterprets old Moroccan and Iranian songs. She seizes on the material, allowing her voice to leap into a wail and break free. Each song was recorded in one take, and the album is the product of one daylong session.

The Documentary 2,The Game,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe913d197565213a379/1:1/w_160/3a15b8a7.png,2015-10-15 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20903-the-documentary-2/,Entertainment OneBlood Money,"This year marked the 10th anniversary of The Documentary, meaning it's also been a decade of the Game reminding us he was once involved with a record that sold 5 million copies. ""Involved with"" feels like the right terminology: Given that the production credits alone list Dr. Dre, Scott Storch, Kanye West, Cool & Dre, Havoc, Just Blaze, Timbaland, Hi-Tek, Jeff Bhasker, and Buckwild, it would be extremely misleading to say Game ""made"" The Documentary. He’s tried to reverse his subsequent free fall with an exhaustive array of desperate, attention-seeking tactics, and calling his new LP The Documentary 2 could be the final Hail Mary: if he’s mortgaging the goodwill from his most successful record on something that’s no different than LAX or The R.E.D. Album or Jesus Piece, there won’t be a Documentary 3. The Game’s last three LPs debuted, respectively at #2, #1, and #5, even with all of the dud singles that embedded their ignominious future prospects right into the first listen. Most would consider that a pretty decent run all things considered, but those albums all were modeled after *T**he Documentary—*hitch the Game to the greatest possible number of bandwagons and hope it moves. That continues on The Documentary 2, which features Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Future, and Kanye West. But they don’t really show fealty to or chemistry with the Game—he’s more like the rich kid in high school whose parents are always out for the weekend. ""100"", the Drake feature, is Game’s first charting single since ""Celebration"" in 2013, and it’s a pleasure to hear Drake spit one of his hardest verses of 2015 after sounding like the walking dead on What a Time to Be Alive; about two minutes in, you forget the Game’s actually on it, and as for ""Mula"", Kanye sounds like he could’ve recorded his part in the time it takes to tie a pair of Red Octobers. The one contemporary superstar who does sound happy to be here is Kendrick, and The Documentary 2 is best when it remembers what the Game is good at: making West Coast gangsta-rap records. Even if it still sounds like he’s learning new flows on the fly, the rapping on a Game album is about as important as the dialogue in a Fast and Furious movie—the funniest parts are wholly unintentional, as are the moments of emotional resonance. You’re here to see a bunch of famous dudes play with expensive toys. This is pretty much the sole purpose for ""Standing on Ferraris"", which features Diddy and is about exactly what it promises. Once more, the Game is in the right place at the right time—it’s a good year to make a West Coast, pop-gangsta rap record. Dr. Dre gave this his blessing, so we don’t get the Game spending the requisite 50% of The Documentary 2 or so explaining Doc’s absence. And the usual dream team (Jahlil Beats, Mike WiLL Made It, Boi-1da, will.i.am, Hit-Boy, DJ fucking Premier) recreates the lush, filmic production that defined To Pimp a Butterfly, My Krazy Life, and Compton—mid-song beat switches, segues, and well-placed samples make The Documentary 2 sound like a record that was conceptualized in advance rather than the usual ""failed singles + Lil Wayne features"" conglomeration. But since The Documentary 2 is longer than most actual documentaries (to say nothing of the upcoming bonus LP The Documentary 2.5), the Game is given room to try on any number of identities: overcompensating Blood nostalgist (he would immediately correct this sentence to ""overbompensating""), wounded alpha male emo-rapper, well-meaning but extremely awkward ""socially conscious Game"". What doesn’t pop up is *Doctor's Advocate-*style lone wolf Game; 50 Cent went bankrupt this year and when he gets mentioned, instead of going for the kill shot, the Game sorta wishes G-Unit could get the band back together. It’s just as well that the Game shows as much love as possible—The Documentary 2 solidifies him a grade-grubbing student of hip-hop, one with far more resources and drive than natural talent, but a student all the same. This year, we’ve seen Dirty Sprite 2 and Fetty Wap both top Billboard with a singular sound, street singles, and hands-off A&R’ing—these records are both namedropped here. But like The Documentary, the sequel is a highly enjoyable tribute to old-school, cash-flush, crowd-pleasing, too-big-to-fail hip-hop album making, which can actually sound novel in 2015. The biggest lie he keeps telling is that any album he makes is definitely going to be his last. Can’t leave rap alone—the Game needs it.","The Documentary 2 is the sequel to the West Coast rapper's 5 million-selling breakout debut. Featuring Future, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Dr. Dre, and others, it continues the strategy of that album and his subsequent ones: hitch the Game to the greatest possible number of bandwagons and hope it moves.

Grief's Infernal Flower,Windhand,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b59d034d5c69bf48f0/1:1/w_160/f5799523.jpg,2015-10-14 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21054-griefs-infernal-flower/,Relapse,"The draw of Windhand is neither mysterious nor complicated: Even on the Virginia doom squadron’s very early demos, the haunted, hypnotic voice of Dorthia Cottrell cut through thick guitars like a finger beckoning through the pale fog. ""Black Candles"", the first song of the band’s first release, transcended its lockstep Black Sabbath ancestry only when she arrived, shifting as she did from a soulful moan to a blues wail in one sublime instant. Even when the band became more elaborate for their 2011 full-length debut, both by adding samples and entering extended psychedelic tangents, Cottrell remained the focus of the action and attention. Each song felt like a setup for her arrival, as Windhand methodically followed another set of doom or stoner instructions. Maybe it’s the group’s tube-amp buzz, but something about the relationship has long suggested a colony of worker bees, preparing the hive for its rightful queen. But this approach—and Cottrell, specifically—got lost on Soma, the disappointing 2013 album that once seemed as if it might signal Windhand’s move toward the masses. Nearly from start to finish, Cottrell fought against the sounds surrounding her. The band suddenly subsumed the leader, presenting itself less as a support squad and more as the new star. Bass overran Cottrell on ""Orchard"", and the riffs wouldn’t step out of her way for ""Woodbine"". During the record’s two-song, 45-minute closing sequence, the band swallowed her almost entirely. Sure, the riffs, rhythms, and solos were competent and sometimes even captivating, but if you’re an idiomatic doom band signed to one of metal’s biggest labels, you’d hope so, right? Windhand overrode their best asset. Grief’s Infernal Flower, Windhand’s third album and first with power producer Jack Endino, reverts to the strength of Cottrell and the songs themselves. The shift is apparent as soon as the drums and guitars lock into a march at the start of opener ""Two Urns"". Cottrell’s presentation—cool, collected, sinister—sits just above the surface of the still-roaring band. This time, she guides the action rather than being trapped inside the self-aggrandizing tumult. During the first eight minutes of Grief’s Infernal Flower, Windhand land a very deep hook, something they rarely accomplished across Soma’s 70 minutes. They even creep toward the economy and impact of alternative rock with ""Crypt Key"", a five-minute bruiser whose instant chorus suggests the Breeders with a big, burdensome case of the blues and a Sleep-sized backline. Windhand’s performances are direct without being simple here. The band and Endino take care to fold the layers of sound beneath or around Cottrell, never above her. This directness carries over to Cottrell’s two solo numbers, too, both of which are more concise and less cloaked than her lone acoustic turn from Soma. The wonderfully frail ""Sparrow"" ponders the space between eternal devotion and the disappointment that mortality inevitably brings. You can imagine it as an antediluvian tune Harry Smith might have collected or a number fit for Windhand’s vintage guitar vortex—a testament to Cottrell’s command of songs when she’s given space to sing them. Despite Windhand’s emphasis on economy, the quintet hasn’t given up on its love of at-length indulgence and improvisation just yet. For the finale, they pair two 14-minute tracks, each ending with a slow, steady, psych rock march. There are extended solos in both, the tones bending and fluttering into surreal patterns. During ""Kingfisher"", Windhand hover in a half-acoustic, half-electric haze, suggesting folk rock lost on a narcotic trip. Still, even as the jam lurches ahead, the singer and the song seem in control, as Cottrell judiciously delivers her sermons at the start and in the middle. She then slips into the background, as if dispatching the band to do her bidding. Likewise, Cottrell drifts in and out of ""Hesperus"", appearing, disappearing, and reappearing only to counter electric miasmas with arching melismas. Even when she’s quiet, Cottrell is now in control. Early this year, Cottrell released a self-titled set of solo recordings. With her voice multi-tracked and manipulated, she sang 11 rather simple folk-and-blues songs over her own acoustic accompaniment. The sound was lovely, yes, but the effort felt listless and inward, as if a tape recorder had just happened to catch these back-porch performances on the wind. The hesitation mirrored Soma. But making and issuing that album, released the same month Windhand cut Grief’s Infernal Flower, must have galvanized Cottrell’s role as a capable singer able to command an entire enterprise. She expresses no hesitation here, and for that, her band has never sounded better. Sure, you can come for the twin guitars and the loaded rhythm section, but at last, Cottrell has made it clear you’re staying for her.","On their third album, the first with power producer Jack Endino, the Virginia doom band Windhand overcome the mistakes they made on their 2013 collection, Soma. Most importantly, the haunted, hypnotic voice of Dorthia Cottrell guides the action rather than being trapped inside the tumult.

St Germain,St Germain,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b16bb1335d7bf169a29f/1:1/w_160/d4d69ad4.jpg,2015-10-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21150-st-germain/,Warner Music Group,"A lot has changed since French producer Ludovic Navarre released his multi-platinum album Tourist in 2000 under the name St Germain. A wildly successful hybrid of dance music and jazz, it put St Germain on tour for over two years, sharing stages with the likes of Herbie Hancock and playing the likes of Glastonbury and Royal Albert Hall. Trend pieces lumped St Germain in with Cassius and Daft Punk as purveyors of ""the French Touch."" In the intervening 15 years, there have been three French presidents, and trends in dance music have moved far beyond the realms of nu-jazz and downtempo, Navarre's métier at the turn of the century. Consider that Navarre's closest peers, Daft Punk, released Discovery, Human After All, the Tron: Legacy OST and Random Access Memories in that same time period, and it's a drastically different world that St Germain returns to with this self-titled album. Fans of St Germain's old work might find little that's instantly recognizable from Tourist, which was part of Navarre's strategy. ""I had to stop completely, I just had to take a break from music,"" he told The Independent. ""I realised that I didn't want to do something like Tourist again – I needed to do something new."" And so he disappeared for most of the '00s until this past June, when the single ""Real Blues"" was released, built around a vocal sample of Texas bluesman Lightnin' Hopkins and balafon. It turns out that even in his reinvention, much remains from St Germain's previous work; now, rather than dig for rare groove jazz for his source material, he's dug into the music of Mali. He is landing on well-trod territory: Since 2000, any number of western musicians have traveled to Mali, to the sub-Sahara, or elsewhere in western Africa to collaborate with artists like Tinariwen and Amadou & Mariam. Musicians like Damon Albarn, Brian Eno, Santigold, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner, Wilco's Nels Cline, TV on the Radio, Amp Fiddler, and more have already sought this fusion. Navarre did well to draw on the talents of kora player Mamadou Cherif Soumano and the fleet-fingered guitarist Guimba Kouyate, as well as Brazilian percussionist Jorge Bezerra, whose polyrhythms at the end of ""Voila"" make for a subtle blend of the two continents. Bezerra also helps move ""Family Tree"" out of the sluggish piano opening to something far more enticing by song's end. But the most interesting results on the album seem as if they could easily exist without Navarre's so-called ""French Touch."" Perhaps if Navarre had returned circa 2007, these hybrids would sound revelatory. But much like his fellow countrymen Daft Punk did in RAM, he has dismissed loops and sampling out of hand for something more ""organic"" and ""real"", and in the process he has turned his back on his greatest strength. The result sounds like something that's already been comp'ed to death by Putumayo.","The French producer Ludovic Navarre released his multiplatinum album Tourist 15 years ago, and became synonymous with ""French Touch."" To revitalize his sound, he has turned to the music of Mali.

so the flies don't come,milo,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c013d197565213a670/1:1/w_160/8f150589.jpg,2015-10-14 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21199-so-the-flies-dont-come/,Ruby YachtThe Order Label,"Some of the best and weirdest alt rap in the country is coming out of Hellfyre Club, a Los Angeles-based collective founded in 2011 by California battle rapper turned rapper’s rapper Nocando. The roster boasts a host of eclectic wordsmiths like Project Blowed associate Open Mike Eagle, L.A. veteran Busdriver, and NxWorries member Anderson .Paak, who recently started to garner public attention after being prominently featured on Dr. Dre’s Compton. In 2013, the collective’s 17 track compilation, Dorner vs. Tookie, spotlit yet another featured lyricist: milo, aka Scallops Hotel, a Wisconsin transplant who carves poetry out of multisyllabics, scheming in micro-bursts and tightly woven yarns. Last year, milo (whose real name is Rory Ferreira) released his refreshing debut album, a toothpaste suburb, which delivered wisecracks with a straight face, matching sharp barbs into sequences and carefully squeezing in references to Harry Potter, Jean Genet, Clementine Hunter, Kant, and Kim Kardashian—and that was just the opener. milo has a deadpan he uses to serve up witticisms that often double as smart jokes (and sometimes crude ones). Not all of his bars are one-liners, but they are all connected to at least one tangentially. His latest album, so the flies don't come, is his most fascinating work to date, filling weird, side-winding productions that deflate and wheeze with tumbling lyricism delivered in near spoken word cadences. The project is entirely produced by electronic-leaning hip-hop producer Kenny Segal and the two have a real chemistry, with a shared inclination for the off-kilter and the oddball. Segal’s beats, synth-heavy abstractions that turn chords into cushions, make fitting soundbeds for milo’s staggered raps. Occasionally milo nestles into the sidewalls, like on ""souvenir"", and then quickly lurches out into pockets of dead space before retreating back. His blank, sometimes wooden demeanor is often betrayed by the snappiness of his writing, which somehow manages to capture Nietzche-esque nihilism with the comic simplicity of the shrugging emoticon. milo has a knack for using quips as a lens through which to stare into the void, but his greatest strength lies in his very particular way with words. Songs like ""an encyclopedia"" and ""napping under the Echo Tree"" tell stories in their own language, something milo himself seems to understand; on the former, he opens, ""No one taught me the language of rap song/ I was born speaking it."" With such an innate understanding of rhythm and timing, it certainly sounds like it. His speech patterns vary, not so much abiding by the restraints of production as acknowledging them before ignoring them. When milo isn’t playing around with funny phonetic sounds or fidgeting with tricky taunts, he’s just making flat out great hip-hop. The song ""going no place"" proves he’s capable of adhering to conventional rap standards with compact verses. On the closer, ""song about a raygunn (an ode to Driver)"", he gives a critical reading of aesthetics, something like a thesis: ""Parse good from the nonsense/ Never let the form dictate what's the content/ It's never art for art's sake/ Despite whatever the corpse of a Marxist thinks."" He closes the thought—and the album, with, ""I guess I'm stupid/ Following a rule is just too hard for me/ It's hardly me."" But if there’s one thing milo isn’t, it’s dumb. It’s his inability to follow the rules that makes his music so smart.","milo's so the flies don't come is wonderful, laidback California rap. But don't let the aesthetics fool you—he's a fierce lyricist with a killer sense of humor. A perfect album for weird days and off kilter listeners.

BYLUG World,Doughboyz Cashout,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1c4b1335d7bf169a32c/1:1/w_160/9c514306.jpg,2015-10-14 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21202-bylug-world/,self-released,"To succeed in rap in 2015, you have to be good with the Internet—or prolifically bad, at bare minimum. It helps if you can meme-ify your personal brand, through Vine dance sensation or hashtaggable one-liner. The West Detroit supergroup Doughboyz Cashout, meanwhile, have not used their Twitter account in nearly two years. They don't have a Wikipedia page. They're signed to Jeezy's CTE World imprint, but haven't released an official single on the label since 2013's ""Mob Life"" remix, to say nothing of a full-length project. But the Doughboyz—whose membership has ranged from four to eight members since the group's 2006 inception—are currently the biggest street rappers in Detroit, and the best rap group in the Midwest. Doughboyz' latest, BYLUG World (short for ""Boss Yo Life Up Gang""), is a relatively minor release in the group's nearly decade-long career. It's not as consistent as last year's excellent We Run The City 4 tape, and lacks the immediate hits of 2012's Free Roc, their best work. There's nothing resembling a crossover play in the vein of ""My Young Niggaz"", a DJ Mustard-produced collaboration with Jeezy and YG; in fact, label boss Jeezy shows up exactly zero times here. But for longtime fans and those nostalgic for turn-of-the-century Cash Money and No Limit, there's a lot to love. To the uninitiated, BYLUG World may sound anachronistic: the stabby piano, the rubber-band bass, and bounce are pure Mannie Fresh worship. Most of BYLUG World's production is handled by Payroll Giovanni, who doubles as Doughboyz' most popular solo rapper; you can hear the eerie ricochet of Fresh in most of his tracks here, from menacing opener ""BYLUG Baby"" to the stripped-down murder piano of ""OVL"". But like Fresh's best work, the production leaps out while providing space for the tape's rotating cast of rappers. And ultimately, storytelling is at the heart of Doughboyz' appeal. BYLUG's sole time-stamped moment, ""Netflix"", should be a goofy throwaway about Netflix and chill, but its novelty is redeemed by Payroll's deft but unshowy bars: ""She was intimidated when I pulled up, for example/ She couldn't find the coupe door handles."" The tape's blunt edges are softened by the occasional warbling melody from Clay Baby—the closest thing Detroit has to a Nate Dogg, who delivers the tape's best hook on ""Fell Off""—and a handful of smooth, contemplative synth-scapes from former Taylor Gang producer Cardo. On YG-featuring ""Day Ones"", he evokes a screwed-up, waterlogged AraabMuzik, and on his G-funk-leaning ""Street Heaven"", Payroll offers a coolly specific narrative that recalls Curren$y: ""Meanwhile, I'm cracking smiles at Mr. Chow's/ Out in Cali, would I like another drink?/ Yes, gladly."" But the celebration is shaded by struggle and countered with knowing paranoia: ""Lately I been having dreams of trucks and 7s/ And nightmares of the Feds wanting me in their possession."" This tightrope walk of aspiration and consequence is the Doughboyz' formula stripped down to its essence. Even at its core, it hits as hard as ever.","Despite a limited Internet presence, Doughboyz Cashout are currently the biggest street rappers in Detroit, and the best rap group in the Midwest.

VEGA INTL. Night School,Neon Indian,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a0c0084474cd0c1c9d/1:1/w_160/4a7f78fc.jpg,2015-10-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21041-vega-intl-night-school/,TransgressiveMom + Pop,"Alan Palomo of Neon Indian recorded VEGA INTL. Night School over the span of four years at a number of crash pads across America, but most crucial to the album was a self-described ""magical winter"" the singer spent on a Carnival Fantasy Cruise ship with his brother, who played in the house band. (Insert chillwave joke here.) The album contains enough reggae and Balearic tropical breeze to prove Palomo doesn’t shy away from pleasing the lido deck, but beyond the kitsch, an extended stay in a floating, inescapable city is an apt metaphor for VEGA INTL. Night School, where the inherent danger of total immersion is offset by generous hospitality. Palomo acts a gracious host, delivering the most deluxe, comprehensive Neon Indian album yet. He's presenting the 51-minute record as a ""double album"" and the interstitial bits ensure the beat never stops. The production values are higher, and there’s even more of Palomo's queasy pitch-shifting, 16-bit synths, and disembodied samples—more of everything. Palomo might have seemed like someone stumbling onto a recipe with Psychic Chasms, but now it's clear that this is Palomo’s foundational music, his blues or funk. Palomo's riff on the idea of ""night school"" is the album's unifying thematic construct: stay up after midnight, and you’ll learn about how human nature really works. In this way, the progression of Neon Indian is best seen as Palomo moving from PG-13 to NC-17—if you dial the Neon Indian hotline he set up for this album, what you hear is a voice purring ""hey there, sexy."" Everyone’s committing crimes of passion on VEGA INTL.—a missed phone call occasions a ""CSI"" investigation on ""Annie"" and on ""Baby's Eyes"" Vega harbors a charismatic murderer. Elsewhere, we're exposed to a polyamorous tryst in ""Smut!"" after a chance meeting behind the red curtain in the porno section of a video store. So consider VEGA INTL. Palomo finally freeing his dirty mind, even as the music maintains a veneer of innocence. Neon Indian is an inherently nostalgic project, and Palomo views the musical cross-pollination of the early '80s as unfinished business rather than something to romanticize. Era Extraña framed Palomo as the rock star he could often seem on stage, engaging in the pouty, guitar-centric forms of post-punk—shoegaze and MTV-friendly goth in particular. Conversely, VEGA INTL. recalls the synthesists who took ""post-punk"" as a mandate to leave punk rock behind. The reggae bump of ""Annie"" and ""61 Cygni Ave"" recall Scritti Politti and the Police, and there’s plenty of Tom Tom Club and Blondie in the album's bubbly disco. The cumulative impression of VEGA INTL., then, is that of a Carnival Cruise night based around New York's Danceteria, circa 1982, a place and time of glaring blight as well as utopian all-night clubs where synth-pop, disco, funk, R&B, and early hip-hop were feeding off one another. Any artist trying to capture the spirit of that specific era has to reckon with Prince, a personification of the idealism of early '80s pop, and Palomo finally gets there at the end of the record: ""News from the Sun (Live Bootleg)"" recalls both the insular psychedelia of Around the World in a Day, the ""is it really live?"" crowd noise of ""Purple Rain"", and the communal ecstasy of Sign 'o’ the Times. Before the final leap into a daredevil key modulation, Palomo delivers the record’s final line: ""We’re all just waiting for something—'til love touches you like a hand in the dark."" Those words encompass the starry-eyed ideal as well as the unsavory reality of how people tend to find love. Morning might bring to light all of the shameful things that have just gone down, but ""News from the Sun"" assures that whatever happens on this fantasy cruise stays there.","Here, Alan Palomo delivers the most comprehensive Neon Indian album yet.

Exercises in Futility,Mgła,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b2b1335d7bf169a16f/1:1/w_160/c2c5730e.jpg,2015-10-13 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21052-mgla-exercises-in-futility/,Northern HeritageNo Solace,"Mgła are the exemplars of Polish black metal. They play melodic black metal that isn't immediate in its beauty, though a dark elegance does surface. Groza, which they released in 2008, was a promising debut, and on 2012's With Hearts Toward None they began to come into their own in terms of composition and lyrics. Exercises in Futility, their third full-length, improves upon Hearts' template, with guitarist/vocalist Mikołaj ""M."" Żentara and drummer Maciej ""Darkside"" Kowalski delivering their most spirited performances to date. It doesn't just set the standard for black metal in their home country, it's one of the finest black metal albums this year. As its title implies, Futility is focused on a pessimistic, defeatist worldview. The opening line is ""The great truth is there isn't one,"" a tone-setter if there ever was one. If we're to believe them, Mgła would prefer to be in hell shouting at the devil, not the purgatory of life. As M. laments on ""II"": ""I wish it was classic fire and brimstone/ But clearly there is a very special plan/ Paved with havoc and shattered virtues/ As if there were any other paths."" Futility's lyrics are a cut above basic sadboy depressive tropes, especially in a section of ""V"" masked as an ode to the working class: ""Blessed be the tailors, the masks are cut to fit/ Blessed be the woodworkers, the crosses and the gallows/ Blessed be the forgers of iron, and the spikes and the barbwire/ Blessed be the stone cutters, it took a quarry to bury the dreams."" They're lyrics don't offer much hope, but M.'s guitar work suggests anything but failure: his playing draws from metal's wells of depression as well as the affirmative lights that can coexist with it. Mgła are the true heirs to Dissection's style of black metal; the melodies are huge without dipping into the saccharine. Even when M. gets into his nastiest playing, it never feels like he's wading in the tar pits of despair for despair's sake. Mgła also balance their bursts of nihilistic euphoria with mid-paced sections that show discipline without sacrificing majesty. ""II"" uses this contrast as a springboard—the slower melody naturally builds into the brighter, faster vortex where hypnotism is a means of getting towards something bigger, not an end unto itself. ""V"" is another master study in these shifts—the slower sections are their darkest grooves, and when they race off, they run farther and faster than anything on the record. You imagine the duo would hate to be compared to post-rock, but both post-rock and black metal also-rans could stand to learn a lot about dynamics from them. Mgła's emphasis on the mid-paced is one testament to Celtic Frost's continued influence on black metal; it also lets the beauty of the riffs exfoliate, and those who got into black metal for its prettier, more accessible side would find much to appreciate here. M.'s riffwork puts Mgła above most black metal groups, but it's Darkside's drumming that launches them into a class of their own. His cymbal work is key, bringing with it a formidable delicacy. ""II"" begins with a drum fill that serves as Darkside's own mini-suite, with the rides and crashes pinging louder than his tom fills. Maybe it's because we're not used to hearing cymbals used so prominently that they resonate this much; Darkside sees his kit as an extension of M.'s melodic prowess and not just an anger-management tool. Where most black metal drummers focus the most energy on bass drums or snares, he transfers that intensity towards guiding cymbals into a nervous dance. On ""V"", M.'s ecstatic melody becomes a light of rapture with Darkside's touch, elevating what's already seemingly in the heavens. Across Futility, he brings detail you'd expect from a solo project headed by drum-focused multi-instrumentalists like Leviathan or Panopticon. It's rare to see two players so clearly meant for each other, and Mgła's accomplished performance on Futility transforms the lyrical content into a call to action. Great metal can harness strength from hopelessness; turning that strength into art is a blustering triumph. ""The great truth is there isn't one"" may be a swift roundhouse, but it's one that it will sober you up to find your own purpose. And on ""IV"", M. howls ""Every empire/ Every nation/ Every tribe/ Thought it would end/ In a bit more decent way,"" a sentiment that can be applied to more than the collapse of states; it's the radical acceptance that there is no such thing as a clean break. No, Futility doesn't sell you the promise of a better world taken like gummy vitamins.

All Odds End,The Mantles,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0945e6ef95969321fba/1:1/w_160/f2220008.png,2015-10-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21032-all-odds-end/,Slumberland,"All Odds End, the Mantles' third proper full-length in six years, is full of scenes of stasis: Vocalist Michael Olivares sings of baths and bedridden Sunday mornings, delivers a paean to standing—""all day""—in a doorframe, and somewhat sarcastically laments missing his ride down south to Los Angeles. It ends with ""Stay"". The thematic focus on idleness befits the Mantles' breezy but rickety pop, and though the lyrics rarely despair, All Odds End is nevertheless saturated with a quiet, interior melancholy. The Mantles, who formed in the mid-'00s, first garnered notice with their eponymous 2009 debut. The record mediated indie-pop, pastoral '60s psych, and the various locales known for jangling in the 1980s, all liberally swathed in tape machine gauze. Along with the Siltbreeze connection, the production pegged the Mantles as ""lo-fi,"" a reductive category that was particularly ill-fitting in their case. After a downtick in output following the turn of the decade, 2013's Long Enough to Leave reaffirmed what the Mantles always sounded like: a band besotted with too many disciples of the Velvet Underground to list but defined by its immutable eccentricities. That's even more so the case with All Odds End, where Olivares' ragged vocal melodies stumble between notes, emphasizing flair and character over the conventions of pitch. If on earlier material Olivares risked overstraining his delivery, here he's more settled, inclined to deadpan instead of whimper a snappy phrase for effect. Meanwhile, the expanded lineup augments his voice with greater presence and texture. It's still scrappy—with cymbals that fall like trashcan lids and an overall reverence for basic root notes—but while the Mantles continue to prize sparseness and restraint, All Odds End sounds especially confident in that decision. Many indie pop songs endear with their sense of delicate, precarious construction, but here the individually shambolic parts coalesce into a substantial whole. All Odds End suggests an ensemble of players who don't need to hold back; they choose to, together. Olivares' metaphors for resisting change and liminal places usually have a lackadaisical tone, but the lyrical focus connects to how the band has drifted toward anachronism. Many of the Mantles' early regional peers have dissolved or resettled in L.A.—which ""Best Sides"" deals with in veiled terms—and the group never demonstrated much interest in consistent release schedules, touring, or otherwise playing the indie career game. Indeed, as Oakland and San Francisco undergo rapid and reckless redevelopment, it's easy to hear All Odds End as a defensive retreat inward, an attempt to suspend time. As a futile endeavor in reality, it's sad. As a listening experience, it's effective.","The jangly San Franciscan band the Mantles have never seemed that interested in consistent release schedules, touring, or otherwise playing the indie career game. On their third release in six years, the group's breezy, rickety pop has the poignant feel of a retreat from reality.

Off That Loud EP,DJ Spinn,by: Leor Galil,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07dc0084474cd0c1c67/1:1/w_160/6b2f50cc.png,2015-10-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21018-off-that-loud-ep/,Hyperdub,"Off That Loud is billed as as the first EP for Hyperdub from DJ Spinn, but this designation obscures the footwork producer's long history in the Chicago underground electronic scene. Spinn, born Morris Harper, has been pressing energetic, beguiling footwork onto record for decades, even if only a fraction of those releases have featured his name on the title. Back in the '90s, he dropped tracks on cassette with longtime collaborator and Teklife co-founder, the late DJ Rashad. He squeezed through the closing doors of vaunted ghetto house label Dance Mania before it shuttered in the early '00s, releasing a raw, crackling track in 1998 called ""Mutha Fuc*a"" that Dance Mania misattributed to DJ Thadz. He also had a hand in eight of the 14 songs on Rashad's masterpiece, 2013's Double Cup, and this year alone appeared on a slew of Teklife and Rashad-related releases. Spinn's lack of marquee status often seems due to his eagerness to work with others, but he finally takes center stage on Off That Loud. It's his first solo release since Rashad passed away in April 2014, and the EP comes during a particularly rich year for footwork. Massive opener ""Throw It Back"" delivers megaton drops between scorching acid synths and sprightly, rapid-fire kicks. Footwork remains a niche concern—Planet Mu honcho Mike Paradinas recently told Dummy Magazine footwork albums sell so poorly he can only afford to drop two a year—but ""Throw It Back"" could chameleon its way onto a playlist of arena-sized EDM songs as easily as it could provide a soundtrack for dancers facing off at Battlegroundz on Chicago's South Side. Spinn handles two of the EP's four tracks on his own—""The Future Is Now"", with its cross-stitching rhythms, is the hardest of the four, and the title track marries rich Rhodes organ with sputtering vocal samples and twitching patterns of percussion. But the best of the bunch is a tune Spinn made with Rashad, the previously released ""Dubby"", which showcases the pair's penchant for experimentation while keeping footwork grounded in its idiosyncratic pulse. Spinn and Rashad marry jungle breaks to footwork's syncopated drum and bass, and then pass the mic to Danny Brown, who raps: ""I don't know 'bout where you from but this is how my hood work."" Brown's squawk has colored downtrodden tales about growing up in Detroit, but he sounds utterly at home on ""Dubby"". As Spinn adeptly blends foreign sounds into a distinctly Chicago genre, Off That Loud shows his ability to help footwork thrive outside its birthplace. Spinn earned his veteran bona fides years ago, but Off That Loud feels like a new beginning.","Off That Loud is billed as DJ Spinn's first EP for Hyperdub, but the footwork producer and Teklife co-founder with the late DJ Rashad has been recording for decades, with or without his name on the title.

Paradise Goulash,Prins Thomas,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b105c0084474cd0c1d49/1:1/w_160/c05310c0.jpg,2015-10-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21088-paradise-goulash/,Eskimo,"Prins Thomas' Paradise Goulash is seamless like a DJ set and wildly idiosyncratic like an independent radio broadcast. Spanning three CDs totaling nearly four hours' worth of music, it represents a colossal amount of effort:  I don't even want to think about the licensing headaches involved in putting it together, what with its 57 songs, many of them out of print, including one dating all the way back to 1968. Unlike many commercially available mix CDs, it's clear from the intermittent tempo-nudges and occasional stretches of near-chaos that this one was mixed by hand—with all the risks, and all the added hours' worth of flubbed takes, that mixing in real time and without recourse to the sync button entails. But despite all this, Paradise Goulash never feels like work; it is an invitation to sit back and let Thomas do the driving, and it covers a lot of ground. The first mix begins with lyrical Norwegian jazz and the third mix concludes with Kurt Vile's ""Baby's Arms""; along the way, we're treated to Spanish guitar, Balearic ambient, '70s Europop, French/African electronic music, dub techno, acid, deep house, Detroit techno, Swedish space rock, Italian synth pop, and a conceptual artist's cover of Arthur Russell's ""This Is How We Walk on the Moon"". It's the kind of mix you might plan a dinner party around, but beware—somewhere in the middle stretch, there will be dancing on tables, and it will probably be barefoot. Thomas is known for his eclecticism, so the range isn't surprising. What is surprising is how seamlessly it flows. Even his oddest selections seem designed to seduce, and whether he's riding the mix hard—one Ricardo Villalobos track weaves in and out for nearly 20 minutes—or simply playing out songs in full, his sleight-of-hand skills are such that you never really notice the changes. Disc one begins with jazz, detours through groovy funk rock, and then stretches out to explore all manner of sounds you might have heard Ibiza's DJ Alfredo spinning in the early '90s. A five- or six-song stretch of chilly drum machines, slow-motion acid, and world-music accents that climaxes in A Split - Second's chugging New Beat is particularly inspired; it seems to open up a kind of wormhole in time and space, collapsing multiple places and eras into a single idea. As for the tranquil denouement, Kurt Vile and that Arthur Russell cover may be notable talking points, but the most remarkable find here might be Il Guardiano del Faro's ""Ma Ci Pensi, Io E Te"", an Italian easy-listening song from 1980 that sounds like John Carpenter at the Ice Capades. Those are a few of the highlights, anyway; every listener will doubtless pick up on different moments. The sheer volume of material, combined with Thomas' knack for teasing out a given tonal or rhythmic idea across long stretches begins to lend repeated listens a kind of hallucinatory air. Where am I? Didn't I just hear this? Does this stairway lead up or down? It's rare that a mix so accurately replicates the sense of disorientation that you get from a marathon stretch of clubbing, but on Paradise Goulash, the windows are blacked out, you can't find your friends, who knows what time (or day) it is, and you wouldn't have it any other way.","Prins Thomas' Paradise Goulash is a real-time, hand-mixed DJ set, and it spans 57 songs and hours of music. It's the kind of mix you might plan a dinner party around, but beware—somewhere in the middle stretch, there will be dancing on tables, and it will probably be barefoot.

Are You Alone?,Majical Cloudz,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09f5e6ef95969321fcf/1:1/w_160/2e9046d8.jpg,2015-10-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21194-are-you-alone/,Matador,"Halfway through Majical Cloudz's set at the 2014 Pitchfork Music Festival, the music cut out, leaving singer Devon Welsh alone with a live microphone in front of 6,000 people. The scene put a new spin on an old bad dream: Not only had Welsh shown up to class without clothes on, but the classroom had become a baseball field and everyone on it was a little bit drunk. After a couple of dumb jokes (the packing peanuts of any good showman), Welsh canvassed the audience for requests and ended up singing an a capella version of an already startlingly intimate song called ""Bugs Don't Buzz"" from the band's 2013 album Impersonator (""If life could be forever one instant/ Would it be the moment you met me? No, my love""). For some bands, the moment might've constituted disaster, but for Majical Cloudz it was a logical endpoint to their music, which functions as a kind of emotional strip show: Welsh knows it's a performance but he still ends up naked. When the song was over, the crowd clapped with embarrassed hesitation: Should we be watching this? And should Welsh be doing it? The band's new album, Are You Alone?, picks up where Impersonator left off: Stark, ethereal instrumentals buoyed by Welsh's unflinching voice. Musically, their roots are in English romantics like Depeche Mode, themselves a moody electronic gloss on the lieder that composers like Franz Schubert were writing 150 years earlier. Philosophically, they chart a junction of new age and hardcore punk, both of which prize a radical scraping away of excess in their search for truth. Majical Cloudz want empathy and they want it now. I call them a ""band"" but should note how they stretch the definition of the word. As a singer, Welsh performs with the confidence and intimacy of someone holding a hairbrush in front of their bedroom mirror—the music is mostly in his head. His counterpart, Matthew Otto, is less visible but equally important. A former student in an electroacoustic studies program that emphasized sound design as much as composition, Otto doesn't try and approximate backing musicians so much as create vapor trails where backing musicians might've stood. If the name Majical Cloudz has any bearing on their sound, it's because of him: He's the air Welsh breathes. Alone is less stripped-down than Impersonator, but it feels less confrontational, too. The band recently went on tour opening for Lorde, and seem to have figured out how to broaden their sound while softening it at the same time, all without losing the detonating high that made Impersonator so remarkable. Songs like ""So Blue"" and ""Downtown""—both standouts—are easy to imagine as more fully fleshed out pieces of music, conveying size without occupying space. Like photographic negatives, you can still see the image but the inversion of blacks and whites lends it a kind of alien melancholy. Like Impersonator, Alone is a sad album, but its sadness is a kind of tall tale, the details of which are overblown for dramatic effect. At times its lyrics sound less like expressions of personal darkness than advertisements for darkness in general, written in lettering so big you could read it from the highway. In a recent interview with Pitchfork, he professed his admiration for Andy Kaufman, an artist usually classified as a comedian but whose work tends to function more like social performance art. The connection makes sense: Like Kaufman, Welsh tends to scramble performance and sincerity, laying himself bare in a way that seems more honest when he's onstage than it might in so-called real life. At peak he becomes a kind of Puberty Incarnate, bearer of feelings so awkward and yet so incandescent that they seem like a joke and a dare at the same time. A few weeks ago, I blew off part of an afternoon to see the Pixar movie Inside Out, which follows the inner life of a young girl named Riley as personified by five fundamental emotions: joy, fear, anger, disgust, and sadness. The emotions—characters unto themselves—run around Riley's head jockeying for control, turning each new experience into a color-coded orb later filed away in Riley's labyrinthine memory. Early on, Sadness—a dumpy, self-effacing Midwestern woman—is portrayed as a kind of negative-force King Midas, unwittingly ruining Riley's memories by turning them a cool, melancholy blue. The movie's revelation is when Joy—cannily represented as part-Tinkerbell, part passive-aggressive control freak—starts to realize that Sadness isn't a threat to Riley but a necessary catalyst for her growth, not a barrier to Joy but a bridge. Toward the end, a new feeling pops out of Riley's psychological conveyor belt: The yellow of Joy and the blue of Sadness, swirled together like ribbons inside a marble. The moral is simple, but in a culture obsessed by happiness, it seems surprising, too: Maybe sadness isn't just an O.K. feeling to have, but an essential part of our emotional balance. Without it, we live in monochrome. I kept thinking of Majical Cloudz, whose music—like *Inside Out—*seems to recast sadness as a feeling that doesn't damage the self but helps keep it whole. Now, when I see that album title (Are You Alone?), it seems less like a grim rhetorical question than an invitation—the kind of thing you might ask someone who is alone but looks like they could use a little company.","The new Majical Cloudz album picks up where Impersonator left off: Stark, ethereal instrumentals buoyed by frontman Devon Welsh's unflinching voice.

Armz House EP,Cooly G,by: Britt Julious,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1329d034d5c69bf49b2/1:1/w_160/3cd91801.jpg,2015-10-12 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21113-armz-house-ep/,Hyperdub,"When given the opportunity to craft their first solo full-length, some electronic producers veer from the sounds and the scenes that first made them popular. Consider Maya Jane Coles, who first rose in the electronic scene making deep house. Her 2013 solo debut effort, Comfort, retreated from standard, four-on-the-floor, bringing in moody, rousing elements of trip hop and dubstep. George Fitzgerald made a similar departure with his debut Fading Love earlier this year, foregoing the instant likability of early singles ""I Can Tell (By the Way You Move),"" or the addictive depths of ""Magnetic"" for a more smoothed-over mood. Cooly G (born Merrisa Campbell) seems to have fallen into this impulse as a delayed reaction. Her first two solo albums, the beautiful, righteous Playin' Me and the eerie and sensual Wait 'Til Night, were singer-songwriter experiments, ones in which Campbell used music as an outlet for and compliment to her sexual reawakening. Blending icy-cold synths with vulnerable lyrics, she speaks profoundly to women within the electronic music scene, evoking the simultaneous terror and power of long nights, either alone or in the comforting arms of a lover. It felt uncomfortable but necessary, the kind of sound you can’t immediately turn away from even if its complicated internal wiring is difficult to comprehend. That is why it was frustrating to find Campbell pulling back the reins on herself – her openness, that now-signature rawness – while listening to the Armz House EP. This is the club-ready Cooly G of old. She told the Quietus recently that she wanted to find a way to work her vocals back into her club sets, and her solutions seems to treat them like another tool, mechanically inserted into the mix rather than front and center. Most times, her voice is barely perceptible: Her whispery coos appear for only a handful of seconds on ""Tippin B"" before they are overwhelmed by her pointed use of synths and drums. Most of the time, this restraint pays off.  The addictive tension of album closer ""Horrors in the Dance"" sounds  like the pushing and tearing of strong muscles. Both Playin' Me and Wait Til Night were the sort of records one sits with alone rather than dances to, but Armz House, from its first few seconds, aims hard at dancing crowds while keeping the sensuality of her previous records. ""Booboo"" is a cheeky and energetic club banger featuring at least three vocal samples, echoing the energy and nimbleness of ""Horrors in the Dance"". If you arrive at Armz House expecting a journal of her emotions, you will be disappointed, but Campbell displays a mastery of her form here that's impossible not to admire. She pushes her songs to their limits and then pushes them a bit more, making complicated tracks sound and feel simple. Even if the results aren't as showy or bombastic as her peers, she still manages to ultimately make music that is, while not perfect, very fun. For dance music in 2015, that has become an increasingly rare feat.","Get open or go for the dance floor? That's the big question for so many producers when it comes time to produce a full length. Cooly G has made music in both directions. This EP is back to her more OG roots as a post-dubstep producer, but it's mixed with the personality of her newer, quieter releases.

Psychic Warfare,Clutch,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04e13d197565213a441/1:1/w_160/ab24b4e8.jpg,2015-10-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20979-psychic-warfare/,Weathermaker,"If Mastodon are kings of the sludge-rock world, then their past co-headliners Clutch are the jokers. Since their start in 1991, Clutch have amassed a global reputation as the platonic ideal of stoner rock, with frontman Neil Fallon regarded as one of rock’s most talented auteurs. Like Baroness and Lo-Pan, they’re not afraid to roll up their sleeves and crank out a filthy blues jam (1998’s The Elephant Riders more than gives the Black Keys a run for their money), but the band does so with a cartoonish flippancy that their peers lack, which in turn injects the genre with a much-needed sense of humor. “I have a great luxury that I'm a professional liar—that's what a storyteller is,” Fallon said in the album's press release, going on to add, ""It's the one socially acceptable way to completely deceive people, and that's what they want.” Liars tell the best tales, for sure – and when they're packing guitars, all the better. Where Brent Hinds and company purvey AP lit-inspired epics and extensive experimentations in genre, Fallon and his partners have but the boogie and the bellylaugh—and in the hands of this foursome, that’s more than enough. Clutch’s last record, 2013’s Earth Rocker, marked their biggest triumph to date: a playful, occasionally psychedelic LP that wasn’t afraid to go prog once in a while (it’s also one of the best driving albums in recent memory). Psychic Warfare, recorded in Texas and produced by Machine (who manned the boards for both Earth Rocker and 2004’s  Blast Tyrant) isn’t as overachieving, instead marking a return to the bluesy, boozy rock of their early catalog. After a nondescript intro, Psychic Warfare starts with one of the band’s strongest songs to date: “X Ray Visions”, an ode to conspiracy theories, drugs, sex, and horoscopes all rolled into one. Over the span of three-and-a-half minutes, Fallon manages to incorporate visits from Republican apparitions (tapping out a telegram in a motel room, he’s “quickly overtaken by the angry spirits of Ronald and Nancy Reagan”), a raucous refrain that renders quacky sci-fi concepts like “x ray visions” and “energy weapons” undeniably badass, and the best musical role-call since Sweet’s “Ballroom Blitz” (when’s the last time you introduced yourself as “on the mic…SCORPIOOOOOOOO!”?). It’s a contender for one of the best hard rock songs to date, so it’s unfortunate that the rest of the album–except, perhaps, the “Highway Star”-cribbing “Firebirds!”–fails to capture that divine, batshit energy, despite Fallon’s tales of supernatural lust (“Sucker For The Witch”), cyclops’ revenge (“Behold the Colossus”), decapitated bodies and three-legged mules (“Decapitation Blues”). Perhaps it’s the abundance of one-three-five chord progressions, or the scarcity of skyward solos (although “Noble Savage” is a shoe-in for Rock Band 4) – or maybe “X Ray Visions” is just a hell of an act to follow. Either way, Psychic Warfare settles into craggy cruise control by “Sucker For The Witch”: haggard verses festooned by Fallon’s goofy imagery and anchored by the no-bullshit percussion of drummer Jean-Paul Gaster and bassist Dan Maines, which in turn give way to stadium-ready choruses. Occasionally, they dip into Texan blues (“Our Lady of Electric Light”, “Son Of Virginia”) – a welcome bit of contrast that comes at the expense of lost momentum, with mid-album “Doom Saloon” being the worst offender. Clutch work best when they keep the pulley of punchlines and pummeling riffs running at max speed, and as a result, Psychic Warfare proves a tad too meandering to eclipse Earth Rocker or Blast Tyrant. But guffaw, gawk, pump your fist you will—and in the self-important, super-serious world of heavy music, that’s worth more than you think.","Since their inception, Clutch have amassed a global reputation as the platonic ideal of stoner rock. Psychic Warfare marks a return to the bluesy, boozy rock of their early catalog, with more than enough wacky stories to go around.

Exhausting Fire,Kylesa,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1b0b1335d7bf169a30b/1:1/w_160/71baa78c.jpg,2015-10-12 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21186-exhausting-fire/,Season of Mist,"Kylesa have been experimenting with and expanding their sound for almost 15 years. They've kept moving, which is admirable, but when the Savannah, Ga., band started out, they were already unique: a crusty sludge-punk juggernaut that mixed shout-along male-female vocals into anthems that got your adrenaline going even if you weren't paying attention to what they were saying. As time went on, they added a second drummer, and replaced some of the sludge with pop. They mentioned Built to Spill as an influence, as well as early '90s alt rock and riot grrrl. Vocalist/guitarist Phillip Cope included Beach House and Sleepy Sun on a year-end list. The thing is, as much as they tweaked the metal formula, and copped to quieter listening habits, they still basically sounded the same: even on 2013’s chillier, darker, atmospherically expansive Ultraviolet, Kylesa barreled along like Kylesa, but in a slightly less interesting way. Which is what makes their new, self-produced seventh album, Exhausting Fire, unique to the trio’s catalogue: On these 10 songs, Cope, guitarist/vocalist Laura Pleasants, and drummer Carl McGinley often sound like a different band entirely. The Cope-fronted “Moving Day” is a mid-tempo death rock song that fits nicely between Killing Joke and Christian Death on a mix tape, and stands out as one of my favorite individual songs of the year. Previously, when Kylesa weren't speeding along, they'd stall. When they got too ambitious, you'd wish they'd get back to packing basements. It's not that anything was offensive or embarrassing—it was just bland. Here, they’ve sharpened their songwriting on tracks that don’t immediately sound like Kylesa, so you get a nice mix of the familiar fist-pumpers along with curious diversions that work. ""Lost and Confused"" goes from spaced-out mellow to fist-pumping shout-along, then elegantly keeps the pedal pressed to the floor until an atmospheric coda. It's a geat song, one that's inspired a lot of air drumming at my desk this week. Or the amped-up, smeary ""Inward Debate"", which shows them subtly working deeper psychedelia into the double-drumming. On the longest track, ""Shaping the Southern Sky"", the band drifts from rock 'n' roll boogie into a cavernous desert of Meat Puppets tumble weeds that builds, over 2 minutes, to a massive rock punch that's worth the wait. Importantly, on the previously mentioned “Moving Day”, you hear Kylesa crafting a legitimate hook, one that could close a John Hughes movie. There's a lot that echoes the Pixies here, perhaps because on Exhausting, there’s more of a mix between the vocalists: Pleasants handled most of the singing on Ultraviolet, or at least Cope took a backseat, shouting choruses now and then. She has more range than Cope in a traditional sense, but her voice isn’t that compelling alone—you ultimately need his chanted intonations against her spacier tones to keep things interesting. When they both shout, it's golden; they do that a lot here. And, often when you think a song's boring (see: ""Growing Roots""), the other singer joins in and saves the day. Some can't be saved, which happens when you keep expanding. The first movement of opener ""Crusher"" feels like a hangover from Ultraviolet, and the nighttime psychedelia of “Falling” limps along for 4 minutes. More often than not, though, the center holds, and it makes Ultraviolet look like a scratchpad for what they ended up doing here: radically shaking up their formula—from the inside out—and coming back with compelling results.","The Savannah, Ga. metal band Kylesa have been experimenting with their sound for almost 15 years, sometimes to bland results.

It’s Great To Be Alive!,Drive-By Truckers,by: Jonathan Bernstein,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fe5e6ef95969322068/1:1/w_160/cb7bba67.jpg,2015-10-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21083-its-great-to-be-alive/,ATO,"Halfway through the Drive-By Truckers' new live record, Patterson Hood abruptly stops singing four minutes into “Goode’s Field Road”, a dark song with a paint-by-numbers Truckers premise: a junkyard operator makes some bad decisions and ends up committing suicide to avoid being sent to jail. “He was a god-fearing man, he was a family man, he was a hardworking man, trying to raise his family and support everybody the best he could in difficult times and a troubled economy in North Alabama,” Hood says, now preaching in front of the band’s minor-chord sludge. By the time Hood finishes expounding on various histories—social, economic, cultural—of his beloved Lauderdale County, the reason for his very un-rock 'n' roll professorial digression becomes clear: sometimes a story can’t be told in just a song. There are two or three moments like this at every Drive-By Truckers concert, when Patterson Hood the storyteller interrupts Patterson Hood the songwriter, cramming background information that his songs—novelistic in detail, cinematic in scope—can’t quite contain on their own. That’s because at their heart, the Drive-By Truckers are a storytelling band. It’s easy enough to compare Hood to a prolific novelist and Cooley to a modernist poet, but most of their songs could just easily be labeled: based on a true story. That’s the central tenet of the Hood and Cooley’s indignant premise when they first started the Drive-By Truckers in the post-grunge mid-late 90’s: the idea that a young scrappy band can write heroic songs about their grandparents. Why look further than that? The stories collected on It’s Great to be Alive!, the sprawling, three-plus hour document of the Drive-By Truckers’ 2014 three-night stand at San Francisco’s Fillmore Auditorium,are tall-tales mumbled by friends at the bar, family legends passed on through generations, anecdotes from neighbors romanticized and made grand. As such, a Drive-By Truckers concert can feel like a punk staging of the Southern oral tradition that takes place on front-porches and in rocking chairs. Hood and Cooley act out the role of grizzled elders with countless tales up their sleeve, taking turns swapping their story-songs without any semblance of a setlist. That’s why Truckers shows can also be occasionally exhausting: Sometimes you might just not be in the mood to hear Grandpa Hood launch into that seven minute story about Mary Alice and her chemo treatments again. This is hardly the first live record the Truckers has released in its near 20-year history. It is, however, the first time the band has tried to faithfully replicate what it feels like to attend a Drive-By Truckers concert. The material, which spans from “Runaway Train”, a song by the pre-Truckers late-80’s incarnation Adam’s House Cat, to a half-dozen selections from last year’s English Oceans, is performed by the slimmer, five-piece lineup the band has used since 2012, after various departures, firings and lineup changes. On stage the band has reworked much of its back-catalogue to fit its current streamlined incarnation, which has grown more sophisticated and elegant in the studio as of late (their last few records contain more piano and banjo than distorted guitar feedback). An unhinged rant like “Sink Hole” is now a precise polemic, whereas the mournful pedal-steel coda to “A Ghost to Most” is now a freewheeling, two-guitar improvisation. The modern-day Truckers are particularly good at such shape-shifting, switching from sloppy to stately from one song to the next. It’s Great to be Alive! is the sound of a veteran band in complete command of its back-catalog. “Box of Spiders” is reimagined as a country-soul centerpiece, another song that gains multitudes when prefaced with Hood’s four minute story about his relatives. “Sounds Better In The Song” is a revelation in its prickly full-band arrangement, and “The Living Bubba,” Hood’s ode to a stubborn musician slowly dying of AIDS, sounds more moving with each passing year, an anthem of persistence and survival for a road-weary band still chugging on. A carefully curated setlist can go a long way, and the tracklisting here benefits a great deal from some post-hoc sequencing. Tales of defeat and struggle promptly segue into stories of defiance and hope. Soul ballads bleed into rockabilly raves. A song like “Goode’s Field Road” is followed by “Uncle Frank”. Although Cooley’s “Uncle Frank” takes place more than 50 years before Hood’s “Goode’s Field Road”, the two stories may nearly be identical: North Alabama tragedies filled with depression and heartless bureaucracy that conclude with suicide. The one-two pairing serves as a quiet, powerful comment on Southern change and progress, or lack thereof. Like the best live records, It’s Great to be Alive! is a carefully curated document that does a great job pretending to be a raw, unfettered documentation of a single night. As its partially sarcastic, partially dead-serious title suggests, It’s Great to be Alive! serves as a pointed testament to the Drive-By Truckers’ longevity and continuing relevance. A little less than half of the songs on the record come from the band’s post-Jason Isbell period, from their 2008 subtle masterwork Brighter Than Creation’s Dark onward. The subtle interpersonal drama in recent songs like  “Primer Coat” and “Mercy Buckets” are every bit as urgent as older, anthemic statements like “Tornadoes” and “Women Without Whiskey”. Musicians will forever insist that their more recent work holds up alongside their classic material. It’s Great to be Alive! is proof that the Drive-By Truckers’ discography is the rare case where such wishful thinking actually proves true. “Tell me another story,” Cooley sings towards the very beginning of their latest live record. “Tell me about the lows and the highs.” The Drive-By Truckers spend the rest of It’s Great to be Alive! proving that they’ve always honored that modest request better than anyone.","It’s Great to be Alive!, the sprawling, three-plus hour document of Drive-By Truckers’s 2014 three-night stand at San Francisco’s Fillmore Auditorium, is a carefully curated record that does a great job pretending to be a raw, unfettered representation of a single night.

Fading Frontier,Deerhunter,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09d5e6ef95969321fcd/1:1/w_160/4d62ad34.jpg,2015-10-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21039-fading-frontier/,4AD,"A Deerhunter album rollout usually coincides with some pithy and provocative statements from Bradford Cox on pop culture. He sort of obliged on Fading Frontier, calling most modern pop music ""totally unredeemable"" in an interview. But other than that, he seemed serene: ""Fifteen years I spent proving myself,"" he mused in that same piece. ""The only reason for me to make a record now is to make the record."" Accordingly,  after the grotty, pissed-off Monomania and Cox's catastrophic car accident comes Deerhunter's most content, warm and plainspoken work to date. Cox drew an ""influence map"" for this record, one which included R.E.M., Tom Petty, and INXS. All of these names together clarify something about Cox's intentions: These are amongst the most agreeable rock artists to ever become stars, and Fading Frontier sounds like Deerhunter attempting to create songs that are equally enjoyable in an objective way as ""Free Fallin'"" or ""Need You Tonight"" or ""The One I Love""—ones where if you hear them in a restaurant or car or house party, no one will ever ask you to turn them off.  While Deerhunter's created a number of indelible songs over their career, Fading Frontier may have their first that could conceivably blend into real-deal classic rock radio. Deerhunter reunite with Halcyon Digest producer Ben H. Allen, who forgoes his trademark aquatic ambience and booming low-end to approximate the embossed sound of Jeff Lynne or Scott Litt on ""Breaker"" and ""Living My Life"". Even compared to the contemporary indie rock elite working with late-'80s pop-rock at the moment, Fading Frontier sounds happily centrist. Opener ""All the Same"" shares a title with a Real Estate song, as well as their chiming, interlocked guitars and chipper melodic resolutions. The waltz-timed number with tinny drum machine and slide guitar also happens to share a title with Beach House (""Take Care""). These are crisp and professional recordings, midtempo strides with cleanly strummed open chords, broad harmonies and hooks, unbeholden to any particular subgenre or time period. Meanwhile, the harpsichord and high-capoed guitars of ""Duplex Planet"" and ""Carrion"" show a clearheaded psychedelic side of Deerhunter that's more Paisley Underground than Velvet Underground. Cox has called Fading Frontier his ""domestic"" record, but you shouldn't expect a facade of contentment: ""All the Same"" finds Cox turning his attention to a friend's father, who ""changed his sex and had no more"" out of boredom and loses his wife, kids and will to live as a result. Meanwhile, the foggy ambience of ""Take Care"" parts to reveal Cox singing about burnt dry ice and rotting corpses. The title is not a tender promise, it's a sarcastic, suicidal salutation. Even if Cox hadn't spent much of the past year in recovery, Fading Frontier would likely still obsess over mortality; this is a Deerhunter record, after all, and so we end up with sturdy, industrious pop-rock songs about creeping death, survival and revival. Cox has urged us not to confuse ""I"" with me,"" but  has spent a significant portion of his life in and out of hospitals, and both ""Snakeskin"" and ""Duplex Planet"" feel inspired by his convalescence."" I don't ever want to go back again to the old folks' home,"" he sighs on the latter, and it feels like an echo of the riddle he posed on Halcyon Digest's ""Basement Scene,'"" where he claimed, ""I don't want to get old"" and ""I want to get old"". Perhaps he did mean both.  Note the play on words of the closer ""Carrion"", or hell, the double meaning of ""remains"". If it doesn't initially seem like there's as much at stake as there was on Halcyon Digest or the singleminded commitment of Monomania, Fading Frontier is Cox reckoning with the dissonance of being relatively young man of 33 with a band who's already in legacy-building phase*.* But the tough talk on ""Snakeskin"" comes from someone whose mere physicality is considered a major health risk and confrontational by default (""I was born already nailed to the cross""). If there isn't a Deerhunter sound, there's a Deerhunter perspective that runs through their work, best summed up in ""All the Same""—""take your handicaps/ Channel them and feed them back/ Until they become your strengths."" The weird era continues.","After the grotty, pissed-off Monomania and Bradford Cox's catastrophic car accident comes Deerhunter's most content, warm and plainspoken work to date. While the band's written many indelible songs, Fading Frontier may have their first that could conceivably blend into real-deal classic rock radio.

Timeline,Mild High Club,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1ae5e6ef95969322185/1:1/w_160/f3784346.jpg,2015-10-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21185-timeline/,Circle Star,"In 2009, the funk maestro Dâm-Funk released Toeachizown on Stones Throw, reinventing his career, and delivering a kick in the ass to a storied label that had floundered after the death of J Dilla in 2006. He also released an odd, anomalous single in the same year, ""It's My Life,"" on the brand new label, Circle Star Records. Six years later, Circle Star has returned and it's become easier to understand why it exists. In Our Vinyl Weighs a Ton, the documentary about Stones Throw, there's a period during which it seems that the label's founder, Peanut Butter Wolf, has completely lost his interest in hip-hop. As he starts flirting with glam rock, AM radio redux, and other, weirder stuff, the loyal fans of Stones Throw can't understand what's going on. ""For all of us frickin' die-hard, hip-hop, b-boy type people, we were just a little confused,"" the Gaslamp Killer says of the period. The siloed existence of Circle Star Records is an explicit effort to clear up that confusion. Its artists don't fit neatly into Stones Throw's traditional output, at least when it comes to genre. Alex Brettin, who performs as Mild High Club, is a good example; he's just released Timeline on Circle Star. It's a record full of psychedelic soft rock that draws strongly from White-album era Beatles and T-Rex, with swirls of '80s-indebted synthpop. Like Dâm-Funk, Brettin is a musician's musician, whose bona fides, for those not familiar with his technical ability, are communicated by his associates: Wire, Ariel Pink, Mac DeMarco. Occasionally, there are strong echoes of Pink and DeMarco on Timeline but Brettin ends up sounding more like their tame cousin. As the artist name suggests with the word ""mild,"" Timeline is largely missing those moments of heightened intensity that make an album memorable. There are nods to the Zombies and Jim Croce; it's uneventfully easy listening all the way through. The most exciting tracks here have rougher reference points. The undergirding riff on ""Rollercoaster Baby"", brings out the Marc Bolan in Brettin, making for a slightly more charged experience. On ""Undeniable"", he confidently assumes the mantle of his psychedelic forebear, Arthur Lee with some fantastic, buzzing guitar work. Spot the Influence can be a critic's shell game, a way to sort of triangulate a new artist without actually engaging with his or her work. But the fact that Brettin's many reference points are so obvious suggests a problem with the music of Mild High Club: the act's identity is so loose that listeners will have trouble ignoring its artistic antecedents. If this is musical pointillism, then the dots are just too big. None of this comes as a total surprise. Peanut Butter Wolf has always had a huge admiration for oddball creatives with vast technical ability, and has never seemed concerned with originality, per se. His feeling appears to be that giving talented people room to record is enough; and maybe he's right. After all, nothing about Timeline is bad. It's a pretty strong release for a brand new imprint to build on. But if the same record were released from, say, Stones Throw, we might sigh, and chalk it up to another good-but-not-great album from a label that still hasn't quite figured out a unified new direction.","Mild High Club's glam rock-y Timeline on Stones Throw imprint Circle Star isn't a bad record per se, but if this is musical pointillism, then the dots are just too big.

Safe,Visionist,by: Louis Pattison,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0b05e6ef95969321ff2/1:1/w_160/95d7d1a1.jpeg,2015-10-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21051-safe/,Pan,"Louis Carnell, if you’re into neat categorizations, is a grime producer. But his debut album Safe squirms out of all such neat categories. Hailing from suburban south London, Carnell is of grime’s second generation, scholarly about its history but not hidebound by its rules. His more conventional productions have leant towards the energetic and darkside—see his 2013 track “Snakes”, the murky swing of its beats accompanied by the crack of gunshots. But increasingly, Visionist has shed conspicuous genre trappings and shucked off layers, too, tending towards something more minimal, introspective and haunted. His two I’m Fine EPs, released on the New York-based label Lit City Trax in 2013 and 2014, were ethereal and virtually beatless, barely grime at all. They explored, said Carnell, the five stages of grief—the journey from denial to anger to acceptance, known to psychiatrists as the Kübler-Ross model. About the precise nature of his loss, though, Carnell was keeping schtum. Since, Carnell has joined forces with Bill Kouligas of the Berlin-based label PAN to create a new sub-label Codes—a sort of reboot of his earlier label Lost Codes, dedicated to outliers in the grime matrix. And now the debut Visionist album appears on PAN, and comes with a theme not unlike I’m Fine—billed as “a personal portrait of anxiety” that traces the onset and passing of a panic attack. This subject came as a little bit of a surprise, as I interviewed Carnell in 2014 and he struck me as coolly self-assured in that way that you might easily read as arrogance. Still, reflect on the crisp meticulousness of his music—those deft flurries of icy melody, vocal samples diced as if by scalpel—and perhaps you can perceive a telltale tension in his hand, a yearning for precision and control. As with the I’m Fine EPs, Safe finds Carnell working extensively with the human voice. Broadly, his approach with vocals recalls that of Burial: both filch acapellas from pop and R&B records before bending them out of shape and turning them to new ends. In Burial’s productions, though, vocal lines generally remain vocal lines, while what Carnell does with them feels rather more baroque. On Safe, these voices are assembled as melody lines – cloned, layered and pitched way up until they form a fluttering polyphony, or glitter like jewels in a crown. (Perhaps a closer reference point for Carnell’s sampling technique would be Fatima Al-Qadiri’s Asiatisch; indeed, the pair collaborated on an earlier Visionist track, “The Call”, their breathy melodies arranged as point and counterpoint). The track titling—“Tired Tears, Awake Fears”, “Let Me In”, “Constraint”—indicates something of the territory that Safe seeks to cover, a landscape in which love equals imprisonment and feelings skirted or repressed. Around beautiful melodies, Carnell arranges more dissonant sounds to imply pain or unease. On the opening “You Stayed”, a diva's cry is encased in a prison of cascading, pointillist melodies and queasy timbres. On “Victim”, metallic percussion pounds without mercy, while up in the higher registers, synthesized strings sketch out a sad elegy and voices curl into gasps, sobs and whimpers. Sometimes, vocal lines repeat themselves, numbly circling as if frozen in some kind of Stygian limbo—see the closing refrain of “Too Careful To Care”, a cry of “In my head…” that repeats over and over, pitched alternately high, low and midrange, as if in search of some sort of escape route. Elsewhere, Carnell’s disembodied cries strike more graceful notes, as if their wordlessness allows them to softly alight on truths over which mortal sentences clumsily stumble. Key to Carnell’s style is a sense of spaciousness, although Safe is more filled out, less minimal than the I’m Fine material. Still, it is seldom predictable. The breathtaking, gothic “1 Guarda” moves forth on ticking hats and dull rumbles that sound like rotating granite pillars, and where there are beats, they upset expectations. Floor-trembling bass bombs erupt spasmodically throughout “Constraint” and ""Safe"", while “Let Me In” rolls forth on the sort of booming trap undercarriage you might expect to hear blasting from a passing jeep—although everything above that is a mirage, a weave of woozy strobes and hiccupping voices. Here and there, Carnell does pare things right back, and this is where Safe is at its very prettiest. “Sleep Luxury” is a washed-out grime lullaby adorned by twinkling harp and the ripple of running water, while the cold chimes of “Sin-cere” appear to fantasize a music box sculpted wholly from ice. This year has been a banner year for producers working at grime’s outer reaches. On the one hand, the likes of M.E.S.H. and Rabit have released records that intensify grime’s alien skitter into something harsh, mechanical, and abstracted. In parallel, the “weightless” tendency, pioneered by Mumdance and Logos’ Different Circles imprint, pulls away layers, lifts grime off the road and into the stratosphere. Safe draws on elements of both, but more than any of his peers, Carnell has succeeded in making a statement that feels not just a flexing of experimental techniques, but something rich and human, too. Perhaps its closest recent antecedent is Arca’s Xen, another record dealing with the desire to shed one’s skin, slip free of this prison of the flesh. Diaphanous of texture but heavy of spirit, Safe revolves upon this tension, the pressure point of a soul under strain.","If you’re into neat categorizations, the Londoner Louis Carnell is a grime producer.

Things That Grow,Cara Stacey,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1335e6ef959693220b0/1:1/w_160/63c9f1b1.jpg,2015-10-09 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21114-things-that-grow/,Kit,"Nowadays, a bow usually comes with an arrow in hand and a film camera behind it, though history shows us they've been used as musical instruments ever since 13,000 BCE, a good deal before Katniss ever picked one up. The concept is pretty simple, just string a cord through a bent stick. Then run it over stuff: other strings, other wood, your hands, etc. That’s it. To this day, they’re still frequently used in Africa, including Swaziland—the once-homeland of Cara Stacey. To call Stacey well-versed as a musician is an understatement. The South African multi-instrumentalist, composer, and researcher received two master's degrees in musicology and musical performance from various universities in London and Edinburgh—and she's still working on a doctorate. With all that knowledge under her belt, Stacey gives South African music a dizzying, beautiful spin, wielding both an uhadi bow and an umrhubhe bow on eight-song voyage Things That Grow. The difference between the two is their resonators, the section of the bow which broadcasts their otherwise quiet sound. The uhadi is a long bow where the player attaches a gourd to the bow, moving it towards and away from their chest to let out pitch-varying overtones. The umrhubhe is a short bow where the player places their mouth on the bow, manipulating their tongue and throat muscles to highlight harmonics coming off the string. The sound hums with an unusually comforting tone, like a saw being sharpened or the coarse bellow of a violin in need of rosin. Despite its rootsy instrumentation, the album is a raw collision of experimental classical with jazz. Because Cara Stacey didn't grow up in the rural Eastern Cape, nor was she set in the traditional ways of one of South Africa's most traditional instruments, she’s able to explore the bows’ sounds. Opener “Oscillations” hears her scratch the string repeatedly, building up a wall of buzz until the gentle padding of drums come into focus and, almost immediately after, the carefree whistle of someone strolling through the woods. “Durée” places the notes of her bow at the forefront again, even while upright bass begins to grow, so that its resonator captures her every move. There’s the occasional harsh scratch—think a single pinkie nail on a chalkboard—on a few songs, but otherwise the bows act like a never-ending scroll for the other instruments to hammer out a Morse Code message of complex meditation. Joined by Shabaka Hutchings (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Seb Rochford (drums), Ruth Goller (bass), Hugh Jones aka electronic musician Crewdson (concertronica), and Dan Leavers (synths), Stacey darts between animal-like calls over the course of the record, especially on nearly 10-minute album closer “Fox”. On Things That Grow, her companions play sensitively, keeping an eye on her use of the bow as to never overpower it, even with the studio space carefully capturing its nuances. “Sunbird”, full of warm strings and bizarre looped synth, keeps her bow ringing at its core, while it begins to take on the form of a short-seizing robot. Even the eerie bass of “Dark Matter” should go full Wed 21-era Juana Molina on Stacey, its latin-style grooves taking the lead, but they refuse to let it drown her out. Things That Grow relies heavily on the improvisation of her bandmates and the fluidity with which their melodies play out. The only work composed beforehand by Stacey were melodic aspects and her individual bow parts. Yet that lack of cohesion can drag certain moments of improvisation down. The metal tapping in “Music of the Spheres” veers towards aimlessness in context of the album as a whole. Designated improvisational sections step back for someone else’s solo that occasionally lacks the confidence needed to take over. But improvisation doesn’t have to be indecisive. A track like “Circadian Clocks” treads minimalist repetition with Philip Glass in mind, and, when Stacey reaches far enough, she explores configurations other bow players have yet to publicly investigate, namely bringing the quiet bow into a buzzing room filled with conflicting instruments. For that alone, Things That Grow sees her shoot the image of the bow farther than we’ve come to understand it in the Western world today.","Who says bows are only for Katniss? South African musician Cara Stacey makes handy use of various strings and wood, bringing in sounds we've never heard before. Things That Grow is a dizzying, beautiful spin.

Sore,Dilly Dally,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b101b1335d7bf169a1eb/1:1/w_160/8955d612.jpg,2015-10-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21085-sore/,Partisan,"When moves to defund Planned Parenthood attempt to confine female desire, there's something so satisfying about the way Toronto four-piece Dilly Dally's debut just oozes with it. Singer/guitarist Katie Monks' voice is filthy and fleshy, as if the sodden voicebox of Shane McGowan or Pete Doherty had been transplanted into her own healthy 20-something throat. In almost every song, she unleashes a dive-bombing scream that drops like a flare down a well, illuminating the absurdity of mythologizing women's sexuality while also making plain how it feels to carry that burden. Guitarists Monks and Liz Ball started Dilly Dally as school friends six years ago, immediately confident that they were the best band in town. With maturity came a little humility, but Sore—written and recorded with new bassist Jimmy Tony and drummer Ben Reinhartz—makes good on their early ambitions. The band reinforces the natural squalor of Monks' voice with heavy swagger redolent of some of the best ever alt-rock—the Pixies' malevolent rumble, Hole's poisoned hard candy, and SST-style bile. Monks and Ball's guitar parts are full of personality, making Dilly Dally's dirges distinct and sticky whether they're scaling triumphal peaks like their their countrymen Japandroids, carving out idle, loping riffs—or flitting nimbly between modes in a single song. No matter what, the record sounds tumescent, like it's throbbing with blood and might spill over. Blood rushes to Monks' head amidst the skidding guitars and angelic coos of ""Desire"", a spellbound rave about some heavenly girl whose inner fire she's powerless to resist: ""Desire is coming at me lately,"" she sings, as if standing in the path of a runaway truck. On ""The Touch"", she describes a woman's healing hands, using enraptured language that mocks the cultural tendency to treat female sexuality as some kind of magic. ""Snake Head"" explores the dark side of that exoticizing. As blood leaks from between her legs, she jokes that she's turning into Medusa, and her bonehead so-called friends agree: ""Man, this bitch is goin' crazy/ She'll make you turn to stone."" Despite all this, Sore enshrines Monks' persistent faith in the transformative power of sex and love. There's a Celtic, Pogues-ish tinge to ""Green"", where a brief moment of lust (""I want you naked in my kitchen, making me breakfast"") gives way to a prayer of renewal, and the record's loveliest lyric: ""I need food and I need light, and darling I need you/ Just because my heart is clean doesn't mean it's new/ I scrub it up with love anthems written for teens, like by the Libertines."" ""Next Gold"" is festive celebration rock, as Monks swears she'll ""stay chasing dreams tied to the road,"" spurred by the lingering taste of a car makeout session on her lips. She knows, though, that you can't outrun human nature. ""I wanna change,"" she bawls on the piercing ""Purple Rage"". ""You can put it on my grave."" Sore has a definite gothic sensibility, but it's rarely self-serious—only closer ""Burned By the Cold"", a chilly piano torch song about feeling alienated by the place you grew up, comes off a little grandiose. Like Speedy Ortiz or Parquet Courts, Dilly Dally's music is rich with their own weird humor that puts it a cut above. Monks could be doing a Kraken impression almost all the time, and the band play with the toxic sugar rush of kids on a Halloween rampage. Dilly Dally always sound like they're being crushed throughout Sore, in a good way: They inhabit the dank space beneath dead weight, the place where the good stuff festers.","The Toronto four-piece Dilly Dally's debut oozes with female desire.

Central Belters,Mogwai,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1025e6ef9596932206e/1:1/w_160/e954a7ae.jpeg,2015-10-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21086-central-belters/,Rock Action,"In the vinyl-revival era, the box set exists for primarily completists and Record Store Day hoarders—by repackaging entire discographies in 180-gram reissues, they forsake curation for comprehensiveness. But in their initial '80s iteration as CD-stacked behemoths, box sets were actually designed for the casual fan. The earliest paragons of the format—Bob Dylan's Biograph, David Bowie's Sound+Vision—presented expertly compiled overviews of a veteran artist, weaving in hit singles, choice album tracks, rarities and live cuts to form a chronological portrait of their evolution. Sure, they could be prohibitively expensive, but in the days before you could access everything through a YouTube deep dive, box sets made life easy. When faced with the prospect of schooling yourself on an artist 20 albums deep into their career, a three-disc round-up of the best stuff offered maximum return for the least hassle. So in that sense, there's something quaintly anachronistic about Central Belters, a three-disc (or six-LP) compendium celebrating 20 years of Mogwai. The Scottish art-rockers are ideal subjects for a box-set distillation—they've released eight proper albums, not to mention a handful of soundtracks and stand-alone EPs. They're the sort of reliable band—both in terms of line-up stability and rate of output—that's no doubt lost some old-school fans along the way, and picked up some new ones (2014's Rave Tapes was their first album to crack the UK top 10), so both camps could benefit from a refresher on what they've missed. While Mogwai's means have changed over the years, the mood of their records has remained consistent. Pretty much every single Mogwai track resides somewhere on the spectrum between rainy-day melancholy and blood-boiling rage; the only laugh to be had in their discography is in the title of 2003's Happy Songs for Happy People. But they've been so good at recreating that despairing atmosphere on an album-by-album basis, that it's easy to overlook how much they've actually deviated from their formative script. Mogwai are an instrumental band, except when they're not; they're noise-loving sonic sadists, except when they're being tenderly delicate; they're slowcore saddos, except when they're making motorik synth-pop. They're a band you think you know, until you realize you don't recognize them anymore. Mogwai have evolved in baby steps—each of their records has yielded a track or two that opens up new avenues for the band, without radically altering their essence. But the quasi-chronological, best-of compilation that comprises Central Belters*'* first two discs has the effect of making that transformation seem much more pronounced and dramatic. The set charts a mostly linear progression, from the stormy psychedelic surges of 1996 single ""Summer"" to last year's neon-tinted dream-pop anthem ""Teenage Exorcists"" (featuring Stuart Braithwaite's most unabashedly melodic vocal performance to date), but emphasizes the aesthetic outliers in their canon. On any given Mogwai record, the vocal tracks make up maybe 10 per cent of the tracklist; here, it's more like a third, lending this set a more vibrant energy than their albums proper. Greatest-hits compilations in general are something of an endangered species, given that streaming-service playlists can now generate them for you, but there's still something to be said for getting a band's own take on what they deem essential. (To wit, the ""Intro to Mogwai"" mega-mix on Apple Music features 25 songs; only 12 of them are featured among Central Belters' 34 tracks.) For one, there's a conspicuous lack of tracks from 1997's Young Team, the album that first brought the Glasgow group international attention and solidified their noise-rock bonafides. Yes, Young Team is ably represented by its seismic 16-minute closer ""Mogwai Fear Satan"", but there's seemingly no room for its equally explosive counterpart ""Like Herod"", a song that pushed the well-worn indie-rock quiet/LOUD template to atomic extremes. (Perhaps Mogwai have come to see ""Like Herod"" as their ""Creep""—an early, simply structured, attention-seizing track to which they no longer feel a connection.) A career survey of Mogwai feels incomplete without ""Herod"", but, otherwise, Central Belters' first disc maps out the band's early peaks: the sad-eyed space rock of ""New Paths to Helicon Pt. 1"", the creeping, tension-tweaking build of ""Christmas Steps"", the mountain-scaling triumphalism of ""2 Rights Make 1 Wrong"", and the chrome-gilded grandeur of ""Hunted By a Freak"", which marked the breakthrough moment where Mogwai's epic canvases began to make room for a more finely tuned pop sensibility. The second disc covers the era from 2006's Mr. Beast to last fall's Music Industry 3. Fitness Industry 1 EP, over which the band's guitar-powered onslaughts gradually gave way to synth-driven experimentalism. Even with the benefit of a cherry-picked tracklist, Central Belters still can't mask the inertia that set in for Mogwai in the late 2000s, with tracks like Mr. Beast*'s ""Friend of the Night"" and The Hawk Is Howling'*s ""I'm Jim Morrison I'm Dead"" following a well-trodden path from desolate piano meditation to cymbal-crashing climax. However, the robo-Pavement groove of Hawk highlight ""The Sun Smells Too Loud"" points the way to the electro excursions of 2011's Hardcore Will Never Die But You Wil**l and last year's Rave Tapes, wherein Mogwai toyed with cruise-controlled Krautrock (""Mexican Grand Prix"", ""How to Be a Werewolf"") and sci-fi soundtrack ambience (""Remurdered""), and seemed to genuinely loosen up after so many years of painstaking post-rock crescendo-climbing. And with the aforementioned ""Teenage Exorcists"", Mogwai proved themselves capable of writing a proper pop song, even if it took them nearly two decades to figure it out. Central Belters' third disc is given over to B-sides, EP deep cuts and outtakes, but compared to the carefully curated, crafty sequencing of the first two discs, it feels randomly cobbled together. And though it zig-zags between eras—encompassing everything from the elegiac Come On Die Young era castaway ""Hugh Dallas"" to the band's ragged 2008 collaboration with Roky Erickson, ""Devil Rides"" to a sampling of their Zidane and Les Revenants soundtracks—the overall tone is more dour and mournful. All but one of these tracks have been officially released (the exception being the loungey, laid-back instrumental ""D to E""), so it's hardly some unearthed treasure trove that warrants a separate presentation. Integrating these tracks into the chronological greatest-hits sequence would've made for a more satisfying overview. But then that would've meant dropping the disc three finale—the 2001 single ""My Father My King""—halfway through the collection, and it's the sort of song that's nigh impossible to follow. A perennial Mogwai show closer, ""My Father My King"" is the band's wordless cover of the traditional Jewish prayer ""Avinu Malkeinu"", and it's biblical in every sense of the word, using the hymn's dual circular melodies to form a cyclonic 20-minute scorcher. It's the Mogwai song to end all Mogwai songs—and, really, the band never attempted anything as audacious, or brutally savage, from that point on. Its late-game appearance here reinforces Central Belters' raison d'etre: to trace the throughline between Mogwai's old and new testaments for lapsed fans and new converts alike.","Central Belters is a three-disc (or six-LP) compendium celebrating 20 years of Mogwai.

Da Reality Show,Young Dro,by: Israel Daramola,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fcb1335d7bf169a1e1/1:1/w_160/facd011f.jpg,2015-10-08 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21080-da-reality-show/,Entertainment One,"Grand Hustle rapper and former T.I. sideman Young Dro has been surprisingly good at maintaining relevance in an ever-changing rap landscape. To anyone not paying attention, his return to the mainstream with his viral Vine hit ""FDB"" in 2013 was probably out of left field, but in truth he's been around the whole time: producing a steady stream of mostly solid mixtapes and using his always slightly-offbeat eccentricity to keep the songs exciting. Da Reality Show, Young Dro's third major-label album, is an acknowledgement of Dro's place in the current rap landscape; it's at once an album that could have easily dropped shortly after 2006's Best Thang Smokin'**, yet still feels refreshingly new without being forced. Dro has been making music since the early '00s, but we're coming up on 10 years since his first major album, and Da Reality Show is a celebration of and a reflection on a life well-lived, full of goofiness, giddiness and sobering reminiscence.  He's feeling himself—""I kilt the streets and made history"", he boasts on ""Coupe""—and very few are as good at doing that as Dro is, with as many undertones. On the song ""Dead"", he raps: ""Hope yo ass be ready for the fed/Hope yo ass be ready for the lead/Hope you ready for the hospital bed/dopeboy, dopeboy, now the nigga dead"" as a way of calling out another dealer as a sucker. It's typical braggadocio, but in it also is a glimmer of awareness about the inevitabilities of trap life. This introspective honesty carries the back half of the album.  ""I know how it feel to be numba one/I know how it feel to be numba nothin’”, he raps soberly on “Feeling Myself”. Dro seems comfortable enough with who he is to put his real self on record, and the record carries the gravity that comes with seeing both the highs and lows a long rap career can bring. He also has a natural sense of how he fits into the sounds of rap radio today without compromising his essence.  The album finds Dro perfectly at ease with the sound of current Atlanta and making it work for him instead of the other way around. The Zaytoven-assisted ""Ugh"" is a melodic and busy hymnal, and amid Zaytoven's menagerie of sounds, Dro's is the best instrument. He glides through it,  crooning then rapping like his words are drum kicks to making playful ad-libs and ad-libbing on top of those ad-libs. It's an effortless energy and showmanship that he carries into the next track ""Parallel Park"". The church organs that surround the song are appropriate; Dro captures your attention and is as theatrical in his style as an Atlanta Megachurch Preacher. Da Reality Show would have probably been better off holding onto this momentum, because the traditional attempts at inspirational anthems in the back half feel a little forced, and lack the freewheeling excitement of the rest of the album. At the end,however, Dro allows himself to really get sentimental on ""Hood Gospel"", reflecting on lost love and the murder of his mother. The pain is audible in his voice, but so is the full-hearted joy and wonder at his rise from those traumatic experiences to where he is now. It is a beautiful moment and a reminder that behind all the boasts about exotic-colored cars and women, there is a man who just wants to share his testimony.","Grand Hustle rapper Young Dro has managed to hold onto relevance in an ever-changing rap landscape with sheer giddiness and force of personality. On his third album, Da Reality Show, he gets a little reflective, seeming comfortable enough in his skin to reflect on the highs and lows a long rap career can bring.

Where All Is Fled,Steve Hauschildt,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b110ea9e61561daa6707/1:1/w_160/e9aac5ac.jpg,2015-10-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21095-where-all-is-fled/,Kranky,"Steve Hauschildt was always the quiet Emerald. While John Elliott was headbanging away to rhythms that only he could hear and Mark McGuire adopted the traditional grimace of rock'n'roll axemen since time immemorial, Hauschildt stood stock-still behind his synths, like a member of Kraftwerk who had strayed from the assembly line. Since the Cleveland synth-and-guitar trio's 2013 split, Elliott has poured his energies into his Spectrum Spools label's considerable output, and Mark McGuire has put out six or seven new records, some with a considerable shred quotient. Hauschildt, meanwhile, has mostly kept his head down. Last year he released S/H, a double-CD collection of studio experiments, live cuts, and CD-R favorites, but Where All Is Fled is his first album of new material since 2012's Sequitur. That album surprised many listeners, given the way that it balanced Hauschildt's customary ambient burble with pert drum-machine programming, vocoder, and synth-pop flourishes. But Where All Is Fled swings the pendulum back towards his sweet spot, musically speaking: gentle arpeggios, chiming leads, sunrise synths poised on the brink between sublimity and kitsch. It's his most emotionally potent offering yet, taking the gentle ecstasy of previous records and drawing it into a deep, soul-cleansing reverie. Hauschildt lays all his cards out on the table with ""Eyelids Gently Dreaming"", a graceful piece built around a melodic chord progression, steady as an IV drip, that sounds a lot like Stars of the Lid—is the title a giveaway?—rendered with synthesizers instead of guitars and strings. ""Anesthesia"", a weightless shimmer that sounds like something off Cocteau Twins' Victorialand run through a very expensive reverb unit, suggests what you'd get if King Midas picked up an opiate habit. And the unabashedly sentimentalist title track wouldn't be out of place in an On Golden Pond reboot, what with its teary-eyed piano melody. Still, there's a strangeness to the overall sound—the piano pocked with stuttering artifacts, Fennesz-style distortion looming beneath—that sets it apart. Even when he's reaching for his hanky, he's careful to keep one hand on his synth, tweaking away in search of the perfect patch. But it's not all so slow-moving; On tracks like ""Vicinities"", ""Edgewater Prelude"", and ""The World Is Too Much With Us"", Hauschildt channels his energy into arpeggios that spin like sparkling dynamos. ""Arpeggiare"" is particularly lively, with dizzying delay taps suggesting Frippertronics in zero-G. His newfound focus on pulse sometimes leads him to forms approaching a kind of drum-free dance music. The cosmic ""Sundialed"", with its wild, chromatic leaps, is not so far off from Lindstrom's super-saturated space disco, and ""Caduceus"" is reminiscent of John Beltran's Ten Days of Blue, Detroit Escalator Co.'s Black Buildings, and other examples of techno at its most yearning. And fans of Pub's ""Summer"", a now-obscure dub techno single from 2000, will be thrilled by how uncannily Hauschildt has recreated that song's watery bliss. While it's true that much of the album represents a refinement of ideas and processes that Hauschildt has been playing with for years, at least one song, ""Lifelike"", points to possible avenues for further development. Like ""Aqueuus"", it's a wonderfully watery meditation on the kinetics of bubbles. Chimes and plucks peel off into rippling delay chains, and the shimmering melodic line suggests a lullaby for jellyfish; it's a picture of biology as rapture, of physics as ecstasy. We've always known that Hauschildt could make amazing sounds. The question, going into this album, was whether he could give them purpose and meaning—whether he could put his technical mastery into the service of music at once experimental and lyrical. Where All Is Fled answers resoundingly in the affirmative.","Steve Hauschildt was always the quietest member of Emeralds, standing stock-still behind a bank of synths as he spun out soothing electronic ambiance. His first solo album in three years is his most emotionally potent offering yet, taking the gentle ecstasy of previous records and drawing it into a deep, soul-cleansing reverie.

Beach Music,Alex G,by: Pat Healy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15a9d034d5c69bf49e7/1:1/w_160/35f512a6.jpg,2015-10-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21138-beach-music/,Domino,"Alex Giannascoli reached audiences beyond Bandcamp for the first time last year with DSU, a mostly upbeat collection of bedroom-spun indie rock that showcased a 21-year-old Philadelphian with a knack for songcraft and a tinkerer's curiosity. Under the moniker of Alex G, he has made seven full lengths, most of which he put out himself. Beach Music is his Domino debut and, as he is poised to reach an even larger audience, he lets his weirder and darker instincts run rampant. Giannascoli opens the curtains on Beach Music with a restless experiment that sounds like a cruddy bootleg of Aphex Twin trying to make beats for Scratch Acid. Distant yelling, electronic beats and lo-fi guitars all meet in a track that's less than a minute and sets the ground rules that this will not be Alex G's big, accessible breakthrough. He segues into ""Bug"", a traditional indie rock recipe of acoustic strums and stereo-panned electric guitars sprinkled with harmonics. The song is moody and intriguing, and just when you think it might be a good playlist candidate for a road trip with your parents, he warps his voice into Chipmunk territory on the line ""bug in the crosshair"". Alex G has often used pitch-shifting, but he deploys it more than ever on Beach Music. ""Brite Boy"" sends his voice up a few notches to play a girl whose affection the title character will spurn and whose help he will reject, while ""Station"" brings his voice down so he can embody a homeless man breaking into a liquor store.  And ""Salt"" features both high and low voices, like tribes of ogres and elves uniting in song. These moments bring to mind the similar voice trickery of Ween, who formed just about 50 miles north of Havertown, Pennsylvania, where Giannascoli grew up. The difference between the two lies in their motivation: Ween used the trick for comic effect, but Alex G doesn’t seem like he’s goofing around. Ween wrote in the liner notes for The Pod that they were huffing Scotchgard while recording—though they've since said they were bluffing—but Alex G makes no narcotic admissions whatsoever.  Regardless if the composition process involved new chemicals or not, it's clear that a lot of nefarious characters are lurking in these songs. Giannascoli's style has been compared to Elliott Smith in the past, and that's often been true of his presentation, but on Beach Music, it's as if the characters from Smith's darker songs have wandered over to Giannascoli's world, and they're a lot worse for wear. Most of the songs have one-word titles and the lyrics are both vague and evocative. These traits come together best in the haunting and sweet ""Mud"". For this track, Giannascoli reaches beyond the pitch-shifter and gets an actual additional human being, Emily Yacina, to harmonize with him. When the pair repetitively whisper-sing, ""I know something you don't know,"" your mind leaps to the worst conclusions of what this ""something"" could be, as nauseous keys creep into the arrangement and overtake the sounds of fingers skating up and down the frets of an acoustic guitar. Some of the songs also feature the slightly atonal jangle that Pavement eventually claimed as their sound when they became a full band. What is remarkable about Beach Music is that some of these arrangements beg for you to dismiss them, the way you might have the very first time you heard Pavement, but what at first feels sloppy and clogged is actually intricate upon closer inspection. Complicated arrangements and gorgeous melodies reveal themselves  to you as rewards for your patience. Over time, even the alien voices begin to sound natural, even inviting.","Alex Giannascoli reached audiences beyond Bandcamp for the first time last year with DSU, a mostly upbeat collection of bedroom-spun indie rock that showcased a 21-year-old Philadelphian with a knack for songcraft and a tinkerer's curiosity.

GO:OD AM,Mac Miller,by: Tayler Montague,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09c5e6ef95969321fcb/1:1/w_160/3a0607ec.jpg,2015-10-08 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21038-mac-miller-good-am/,Warner Bros.,"Who is Mac Miller? On Blue Slide Park, he was a childish ""frat rapper"" who made dumb jokes about smoking weed and referred to the vagina as a ""cooter."" On the claustrophobic Watching Movies With the Sound Off, he was rapping in a pitched-down voice alongside Earl Sweatshirt and Ab-Soul about friends lost, drugs consumed, depression, and the trappings of success. And on the transparent, relaxed GO:OD AM, he sounds like someone’s troubled little brother made good: from the album’s opening horns, you can sense that this is a victory lap for Mac, a homecoming. From start to finish, this is his most refined and well put-together project. Getting through the 16 tracks on Blue Slide Park was like an endurance test, and even the deeper and much-improved Watching Movies started to sound interchangeable before it ended. The beats on GO:OD AM have a New York, boom-bap feel, with lots of jazz samples and harder drums, and it’s both more varied and more upbeat, from the trap-sounding beats of  ""When in Rome"" or the Chief Keef-featuring ""Cut the Check"" to love songs like ""ROS"" or the Miguel collaboration ""The Weekend"". Miller said he recorded 400 songs for Watching, and sometimes you couldn’t help but wonder about the selection process (""Objects in the Mirror""?) but on GO:OD AM, he’s learned to self-edit. Lyrically, Mac offers a music industry ""Scared Straight"". ""I’ve seen some motherfucking shit,"" he warns on ""Two Matches"". The interlude before ""God Speed"" includes a voicemail from his brother, checking in on him at a low point in his life, and later on in the song, he admits: ""White lines be numbing them dark times/ Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up/ Admit it’s a problem, I need a wake up/ Before one morning, I don’t wake up."" It’s funny to hear a 23-year-old who just kicked his habit and could be considered a kid himself refer regretfully to ""all the kids doing drugs"" on ""In the Bag"", but Mac has enough of his sense of humor intact to keep the album from playing like a D.A.R.E. campaign on wax. On ""God Speed"", the album’s standout track, he pays tribute to the close friends in his Most Dope Family, especially his right hand man Q, and it’s genuinely touching. ""Everybody saying I need rehab/ So I’m speeding with a blindfold on/ It won’t be long before they watching me crash/ And they don’t wanna see that,"" he raps, thanking the people that got him through the toughest time of his life. He’s never preachy, though: He sounds refreshed and rejuvenated, like someone who has been going for daily walks, eating veggies and drinking fruit smoothies every day. Many songs here reference his status as a white rapper, signaling his awareness of the rap game’s perception of him: ""I’m a white rapper/ They always call me shady,"" he says on ""Brand Name"", just a few minutes into the album. ""I know niggas think you white and you not about to go in with these bars,"" chimes in Domo Genesis on ""In the Bag"". There’s a kind of authenticity to him that has been there since the beginning, if you look for it: He doesn’t rap about breaking the law, because he’s not about that life. He’s a corny white rapper (meant as a compliment) who loves his family, friends, and hometown. We might not learn a lot of specifics about him, but there’s a lot of honesty in his music if you look for it.","From start to finish, this is Mac Miller's most refined and well put-together project.

Florasongs EP,The Decemberists,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b158c0084474cd0c1dcd/1:1/w_160/0ec242b8.jpg,2015-10-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21137-florasongs-ep/,Capitol,"For all of the Decemberists’ considerable instincts as performers, they've never been a band to leave listeners wanting more. Save for 2011’s uncharacteristically concise The King Is Dead, even their best albums often seemed like too much of a good thing, and most have felt longer than their runtimes—much, much longer in the case of 2009’s proggy endurance test The Hazards of Love, a cautionary tale about the overreach ambitious artists are capable of when left unchecked. Like The King Is Dead before it, this year’s What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World played like a correction to that record, a continued dialing back of the band’s more audacious tendencies, but it was overstuffed in its own right, and with no musical or conceptual themes binding its 14 songs, it begged for some focus. Terrible World was the first Decemberists album that didn’t have the vision to justify its bloat. Casual fans won’t be overcome with excitement upon learning the band’s Florasongs EP was culled from leftovers from the Terrible World sessions. Even for Decemberists diehards, an addendum to the band’s most forgettable album probably wasn’t high on the wish list, and the EP reaffirms what Terrible World already made clear: that Colin Meloy brought an abundance of songs to these sessions, but not much in the way of a big picture. Unlike its full-length counterpart, though, Florasongs has brevity working in its favor. These days, the Decemberists sound best in small doses, and at just five songs and 19 minutes long, the EP goes down easier than its predecessor. If the EP has a unifying thread, it’s the band’s wide-eyed fascination with '80s college rock. Filled with ringing guitars and taut melodies, ""Why Would I Now?"" moves with the swift efficiency of Elvis Costello’s King of America-era output. A shanty caressed with accordions, ""Riverswim"" plays like it was traced over the Pogues’ ""Dirty Old Town"". And though Decemberists have so fully internalized R.E.M.’s playbook by now that they could probably turn around a Lifes Rich Pageant tribute album on two days’ notice, ""The Harrowed and the Haunted"" is one of their most elegant homages, building to the same lovely, slow reveal as R.E.M.’s dreamiest numbers. Even the Communist Russia setting of ""Fits & Starts"", the EP’s lone rocker, feels like a throwback to the Reagan era in its own way. ""I was watching on the apparat/ Some comely little apparatchik felled,"" Meloy sings over pounding pianos. As rowdy party songs go, it’s hardly AC/DC, but it’s about as close as he’ll get. As The King Is Dead proved, there’s still some pleasure in hearing a relatively reigned-in Decemberists. But while the band wears restraint well, Florasongs never overcomes the sense that they’re selling themselves short, penning good-enough songs when they used to shoot for grand, great ones. This is a band that once thrived on risks. The Crane Wife shouldn’t have worked but it did. The Hazards of Love shouldn’t have worked and, by and large, it didn’t, and ever since they've been playing it safe. After five years of bowling with bumpers, maybe it’s time for them to start taking chances once again.","For all of the Decemberists’ instincts as performers, they've never been a band to leave listeners wanting more.

The Dutch musicologist Phons Bakx has compiled a list of more than 1,000 names for the instrument, including the English-language terms trump, gew-gaw, mouthfiddle, Omaha flapjack, and marranzano pancake. It's most commonly known in English as the Jew's harp—a name whose etymology has flummoxed scholars for decades. Spaniards have called it the pio pollo (""squeaking chicken"") and the Dutch, the Gedachtenverdrijver (""thought dispeller""). But among its most evocative names might be the Italians' scacciapensieri, or ""worry killer""—a name whose meditative connotations go to the heart of the Italian producer Donato Dozzy's contemplative new album, which is built entirely around the instrument. It's an arcane concept, but Dozzy—whose most common mode is techno—is no stranger to constraints; his last LP, the Spectrum Spools-released Sintetizzatrice, was made using only the singer Anna Caragnano's voice, run through kaleidoscopic, dubwise processing. His approach is similar here, wreathing the instrument's gravelly flange in an airy filigree of reverb and delay. Sometimes he sets the mouth harp front and center, as with the opening ""Personal Rock""; Dozzy has described how he recorded the album on the slopes of mountains and overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, and ""Personal Rock"", bookended by buzzing bees and distant thunder, swims in that sense of place. On ""For Arnaud"", the instrument's steady plucks are stretched and warped by subtle delay and chorus effects; the brightness of the tones and the brisk, skipping pulse are light and invigorating, like an early fall morning. Elsewhere, Dozzy opts for abstraction. ""Cross Panorama"" sounds like it comes from the same tapes that yielded ""Personal Rock"", but this time electronic echo all but swallows the source material, and the reverb's resonance throws off great, yearning harmonics. In ""Concert for Sails"", the instrument is nearly eclipsed by the gentle creaking and slapping of ropes in the harbor. And in ""The Net"", short, clipped tones are tossed down a ricocheting delay chain, evoking the influential dub techno project Vainqueur, while the grinding title track might almost be a cover of Aphex Twin's iconic ""Digeridoo"". It's generally a meditative set, and only on the album's final track, ""Exit the Acropolis"", does Dozzy return to the sound with which he's most closely affiliated: Tapping out clicks like 808 hi-hats, and weaving three or four layers of mouth harp into enveloping contrapuntal pulses, it's the perfect approximation of Berghain-styled techno. In his notes on the album, Dozzy speaks of trance states and all-night rituals, and here, he successfully unites centuries, if not millennia, of tradition into a hypnotic whirlwind. Not bad for a sound made entirely from a strip of bent metal.","Italian producer Donato Dozzy's contemplative new album is built entirely around the sound of the mouth harp.

Why Choose,Shopping,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03db1335d7bf169a09e/1:1/w_160/0a38e2da.jpg,2015-10-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20965-why-choose/,Fat Cat,"Whenever Shopping are asked whether they’re a political band, they always default to talking about dancing. Any messages in their music are purely a matter of circumstance, they say: of being delivered by a queer woman of color, of being a London DIY band who know what productivity looks like on their own terms. It's not hard to see why they'd want to avoid the political umbrella: when a British band cops to having political motivations, their inability to overhaul the system/write ""Ghost Town"" Part Two is usually held up as a sign of their failure—in the U.K., at any rate. And so rather than subject themselves to that scrutiny, Shopping instead choose to shake off their oppressors, encouraging shimmying to fill the emptiness of the superficial social interactions and masquerade of commerce-as-choice that their songs quite clearly detail. There’s no shortage of academic texts citing the radical nature of movement, but the trio’s second album, Why Choose, is blissfully direct and free of added intellectual ballast. When so much modern discourse is a teetering layer cake of opinions, it’s bliss to hear Rachel Aggs celebrate idleness in one breath—over the awkward twangs of ""Time Wasted""—and then demand urgency on ""Why Wait""’s anxious, accelerated disco hi-hats. As she puts it in the latter, ""Why choose when I just want it both ways?/ When I could just take it all?/ I wanna do it my way."" To that end, very few of Shopping’s post-punk moves are novel, but the trio maintain an exhilarating, crafty pace, having upped the detail and twisted the structures of their songs since 2013’s Consumer Complaints. The almost uniformly plain guitar tone used throughout is a great showcase for their bright and endlessly varied post-punk tangles. Their nimble songs barely touch the ground, other than the occasional coldwave synth breeze, or seawashed motorik splash à la Electrelane, touches that make for lovely, errant starbursts in Shopping’s otherwise tightly martialed constellations. A sense of street-smarts survival runs through Why Choose: The rattling guitar of ""Wind Up"" and ""Knocking"" is scrappy as a young bare-knuckle boxer. ""Take It Outside"" runs on caustic pep, mocking the language of empty threat with drummer Andrew Milk delivering weary pleas to ""break it up."" By contrast, the record’s sincere, personal moments don’t posture. On the brisk ""I Have Decided"", Agga adopts a deep, unyielding tone to declare, ""You won’t change my thinking/ This means nothing to me."" Shopping are in constant conversation, literally so when Aggs and Milk act out halves of two different lovers’ quarrels on ""Straight Lines"", the second half of a dialogue they started on Consumer Complaints. On that record’s ""For Your Money"", Milk played the role of a young man hooking up with rich older guys; here he plays the moneyed party, allowing the band to turn the uncertain power dynamic of user and used inside-out again. He reels off his character’s anxieties at the arrangement, concluding: ""You go home empty-handed when you go home with his type,"" but there's no implied judgement of the situation. Shopping’s idea of choice doesn't mean one agenda at the expense of another, but establishing a welcoming space for all comers. It works because their naturally scatty, riotous spark means they could never sound neutral.","Direct, smart, catchy, and extremely punk, Shopping is a band for our confusing times. It's for dancing first and foremost, with any political undertones there for the taking after you're done shaking your ass.

Stretch Music,Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1279d034d5c69bf49a0/1:1/w_160/bc424fe3.jpg,2015-10-07 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21105-stretch-music/,Ropeadope,"Stretch music, according to New Orleans jazz musician Christian Scott, is an approach that engenders a more absorbent and sensitive kind of jazz. ""We are attempting to stretch—not replace—jazz's rhythmic, melodic and harmonic conventions to encompass as many musical forms/languages/cultures as we can,"" he says on his website. He titled his fifth album after the concept, but this sensibility is visible even in his earliest work as a leader; the title track of 2007's Anthem is jazz in its instrumentation, but it also obeys the rhythms and structures of post-hardcore, a series of contrasting shapes which build an atomically tense and spectral space, like a cathedral at night. His description of ""stretch music"" somewhat resembles the omnivorous jazz approaches of bassist/singer Esperanza Spalding and pianist Robert Glasper. It's similarly collaborative and elastic. But Scott's genre splicing is not as mosaic as Glasper's. It’s doesn’t lock different genres together in unusual patterns as much as it melts them down into asymmetrical and indivisible sculpture. It's almost curious to call it ""stretch music"" when it feels as if jazz isn’t so much expanded here as collapsed into small, oblique jewels. Later in his mission statement, Scott describes his intention to draw unusual instruments through distortion. This is how Stretch Music begins: A piano, played by Lawrence Fields, struggles through noise, as if pressing and blurring against a force field. Instruments undergo a kind of metamorphosis in Scott’s aesthetic, which is reflected in the album cover: his trumpet bends and warps into elastic shapes. On record, Scott’s playing is patient and crisp, and it seems the product of spatial reasoning, more concerned with the area around his notes than their actual occurrence. He is sometimes accompanied by the ribbony flute phrases of Elena Pinderhughes, which contrast pleasingly with the routine collapse of the backdrop. This collapse is occasioned by the percussion, played by Corey Fonville and Joe Dyson, Jr., alternately on drums and SPD-SX pads. Snare rolls are enhanced into dense exaggerations, glitching in and out of compressed rattles which physically approach vortexes of static. It lends the songs the accelerated yet organized rhythms of accident; it reminds me of sparks convulsing from a severed cable. Sometimes the instrumentation is more obscure, as on ""Tantric"" and ""Perspectives"", each chord landing and shimmering with a kind of blurred phosphorescence. There are also more typical fusion exercises, as on ""West of the West"", where Matthew Stevens’ guitar recalls the metallic echo of Sonny Sharrock. When Scott played at this year’s New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, he said ""West of the West"" describes the sense of dislocation he felt when he lived in L.A., a place that seems unlocked from its own geography, released into imaginary and aggressively blank space. His music is the opposite of dislocated; it is thoroughly articulated, busy and compressed. The reach of Stretch Music can often feel literal—even as the threads warp and drift a deeply woven structure is preserved.","New Orleans musician Christian Scott craves a more absorbent and sensitive kind of jazz. Stretch Music finds him experimenting with moods and electronic textures, bumping against the genre's conventions even as he remains rooted in tradition.

The Agent Intellect,Protomartyr,by: J. Edward Keyes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03e9d034d5c69bf4844/1:1/w_160/a76c3d5e.jpg,2015-10-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20966-the-agent-intellect/,Hardly Art,"In what feels like an odd moment of prescience, roughly halfway through The Agent Intellect, the harrowing third album from the Detroit band Protomartyr, the Pope pays a visit. It’s 1987 in Pontiac, Mich., and Pope John Paul II is visiting the Silverdome, delivering Mass to the 100,000 faithful who’d come to hear him speak. Among them was a young Joe Casey who, 25 years later, would grow up to become Protomartyr’s frontman. The event was historic—it set an attendance record at the arena—but what Casey remembers about it in ""Pontiac 87"" isn’t the beauty of the sermon or the spectacle in the ceremony, but the ugliness boiling just beneath the surface. On his way into the arena, he sees ""money changing between hands,"" and on his way out, a riot, where ""Old folks turn brutish/ Trampling their way out the gates towards heaven."" This is the universe Protomartyr inhabits, one where violence hovers constantly at the periphery, where peace and hope gradually curdle and turn ugly, and the desperate people who once clung to them eventually fall prey to their worst impulses. The emotionally brutal Under Color of Official Right from 2014 took place against the crumbling skyline of Detroit, where deadbeat fathers disappeared into bars while their children planned revenge at home and politicians made backwards deals that benefited no one but themselves. On Intellect, Casey’s got bigger matters on his mind. The first character we meet on the record is, literally, the Devil, but he doesn’t have red horns and a trident, and he’s not cackling in a smoldering cavern. He’s a teenager in his bedroom at home, full of promise and almost dewy-eyed naiveté until his peers shun him and all of his grand plans fail, and he’s left at the end of the song vowing, ""I will make them feel the way I do/ I’ll corrupt them ‘til they think the way I do."" If Right was about the evil that men do, Intellect goes one bigger and asks why they do it. The answer, again and again, is rooted in hurt, pain, neglect, and disappointment. Intellect draws its energy from the panic of mortality. Casey lost his father to a heart attack and his mother to Alzheimer’s disease as he was writing the record, and their presence on Intellect provides some of its most wrenching emotional moments. His mother arrives strong and determined on the grim, booming ""Why Does It Shake?"", swearing, ""Lithe in thought and pumping blood…I’m never gonna lose it,"" but suddenly the song collapses and decays. It concludes with the chilling appearance of ""the stranger"" who, in Casey’s words, always wins—""He enters the temple/ It falls/ It always falls."" The song’s title comes from something Casey’s mother said, noticing the tremors of old age in her hands. That sound of the ticking clock makes all of the violence and drunkenness on Intellect seem that much more desperate, that much more futile. Throughout the album, the band rises to meet the weighty subject matter. On Right, songs arrived in brute slashes, but on Intellect they’re textured and spacious. Guitarist Greg Ahee cloaks ""Cowards Starve"" in a Morricone-like cowboy flange, gradually gathering tension until the song detonates in the chorus. ""Dope Cloud"" rides a razor-wire post-punk guitar line as its protagonists accumulate treasure only to be met with Casey’s bleak reminder, ""That’s not gonna save you, man."" And in ""Ellen"", a love song written from the perspective of Casey’s father to his mother, they beautifully underplay, supporting the song’s sweet sentiment in feathery chords. But it is Casey who has undergone the greatest evolution. Casey has described his stage demeanor as ""30 minutes of a fat guy yelling at you,"" but on Intellect, he’s more measured, and his writing has developed an almost Joycean grasp of detail and narrative. The second verse of ""Pontiac 87"" feels like something that could have turned up in ""The Dead"": a crowd of regulars pile into the Detroit bar Jumbo’s (familiar to Protomartyr fans from its appearance on No Passion All Technique) the day after Christmas. Casey describes the scene with such stunning narrative economy you can almost see the lines on their faces: ""Remembering a Jumbo’s night, December 26th/ Weird faces filled up the bar, half sober/ Outside, a steady snow—all new white."" He’s also become a powerful, passionate singer. His delivery throughout Intellect has gravity and nuance; he’s able to make a sing-along out of the line ""Social pressures exist/ And if you think about them all of the time/ You’re gonna find that your head’s been kicked in."" He goes from baleful and bereft to nasty and snarling, commanding “Destroy the gateway, bind them up, break the circuit, cast them out.” And what he’s driving at, again and again, is that we do all of those things when we feel like trapped animals, when we’ve thrown our full bodies into life and it’s given us nothing back but loneliness and poverty and emptiness, and each advancing year is less time we have to do something of substance. It’s a profound and uncomfortable truth, and it’s one that The Agent Intellect unflinchingly stares down. All of this is highlighted to shattering effect in ""Uncle Mother’s"". At first, it seems like another in a long line of Protomartyr bar tableaus, the battered working class piling into a dive to suck down Old Styles until the world seems bearable again. The revelation of the song’s true meaning comes in what at first feels like a throwaway detail. At the start of the song, Casey advises, ""Welcome to Uncle Mother’s/ Leave your children in the car."" From there the carousing begins, and the usual boxes are checked: there’s a drug deal in the kitchen and bad doings in the back corner. But at the end of the song, Casey repeats himself, and turns a declarative into a question: ""Welcome to Uncle Mother’s/ Are your children still in the car?"" In that moment it becomes clear that the subject of the song isn’t the drunks—it’s the children. That subtle shift is what gives the record its almost palpable sense of humanity, of sorrow, of compassion. On The Agent Intellect, we are all the children, shivering alone in an empty station wagon in a bitter Detroit night, waiting in vain for someone to come and take us home.","The third album from Detroit post-punk outfit Protomartyr ups the ante considerably from the first two. Their grim but compelling songs highlight a place where violence hovers constantly at the periphery, where peace and hope gradually curdle and turn ugly, and the desperate people who once clung to them eventually fall prey to their worst impulses.

Hallucinogen EP,Kelela,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad86b1335d7bf1699c02/1:1/w_160/32de06df.jpg,2015-10-07 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20432-hallucinogen-ep/,WarpCherry Coffee,"Earlier this year, the L.A.-via-D.C. singer Kelela spoke about the challenges of performing electronic music in a live setting. ""I feel like I just want my emotions to be at the forefront of my performance, and if anything distracts from that, I’m in trouble,"" she told The Cut, riffing on the experience of seeing the veteran of digital feelings, Björk, on stage. That kind of resonant tactility also goes a long way when it comes to listening to electronic music, and Kelela’s 2013 release Cut 4 Me indicates that, whether she was aware of it or not, this ability to transpose intimacy to music has been part of her wheelhouse from the start. Her new EP, Hallucinogen, uses the gristle and guts of feeling as a thematic base for exploring new textures in music. Like Cut 4 Me, the sound is like being enveloped in the black-lit silence of the intro to Belly: it’s a sensuous, sensitive, hi-definition approach to R&B. Some of the producers are the same (Kingdom, Nguzunguzu’s MA) and some are new (Arca, Kendrick and Drake collaborator DJ Dahi), but these partnerships hew to what’s now the Kelela template: soulful songs with unpredictable, assaultive drum patterns, whorls of whimsical synthesizer effects, and so much processing on the vocals that it sounds like you’re listening to a transmission from tomorrow. The deconstructed clatter of FKA twigs—who also worked with Arca—might be from another dimension altogether, but Kelela, whose music feels like there is blood flowing through it, looks to a future with a decidedly human shape. Kingdom, who co-produces the EP’s sole uptempo track, ""Rewind"", is a student of Timbaland’s slick approach to pop-R&B. Alongside Kelela and Nugget, he channels that, as well as the bounce of Jazze Pha, for the song, which is the EP’s lead single and a showpiece for Kelela’s much-improved singing. ""All the Way Down"" pulls rap producer DJ Dahi into completely different terrain; the shudders of hi-hat trills provide the seams, but the print he’s working with is studded with twinkling synths that gives way to a droning. Dahi’s beat doesn’t explicitly recall Aaliyah, but Kelela's voice does—she riffs on the melody and phrasing and pillow talk-closeness of the late singer’s 1999 track, ""I Don’t Wanna"" (incidentally, a Jazze Pha production). More pressing is the existential rumble that bookends the EP. ""All I know is all I’ve got/ Is it hard to face all we lost?,"" Kelela questions on the desolate opener ""A Message"". Arca’s hollow kickdrums prod the song along at a ragged crawl, allowing Kelela to wring out a melody with her voice while he fills the space with funereal, yawping organ-like patches. It’s the only song on the EP, aside from closer ""The High"", in which Kelela sings without heavy reverb or effects, heightening its somber quality. ""And I’ll do anything for the high,"" she urges a placid lover on the latter, the piercing hook contrasting with her hushed verses. In content—and maybe even in producer Gifted & Blessed’s tranquil heartbeat—it’s a song that feels spiritually descended from the Weeknd. And there's another connection: writing on Pitchfork about the Weeknd’s music and its inherited ambience, Hannah Giorgis described a ""long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining,"" and it’s instructive to think that Kelela—whose family is also from Ethiopia—may have absorbed a similar propensity for mournful music. If you consider that Kelela’s roots are in soul and R&B, the emotional side of her music makes sense. The mechanics of dance music might inspire feelings in listeners, but within the genre, overrun with the egos and opinions of ""bro-teurs,"" her emotions are revolutionary. She is a transparent creator, unafraid of tainting the canvases of her mostly male collaborators with the imperfect, vulnerable contents of her brain and heart.","The singer's new EP, featuring production from Kingdom, Nguzunguzu’s MA, and Arca, continues her sensuous, sensitive, and hi-definition approach to R&B. These songs use the gristle and guts of feeling as a thematic base for exploring new textures.

No No,Co La,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f7b1335d7bf169a1da/1:1/w_160/08d7ca18.jpg,2015-10-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21078-no-no/,Software,"Sampling isn't a lost art form just yet, but it's fair to call it a diminished one. This has happened even as the sample itself remains a staple of modern music production: how Young Chop has access to an orchestra, how every bedroom producer from Los Angeles to Berlin owns an 808. Those sounds are meticulously recorded and integrated into popular software. Sampling itself—the act of sourcing, manipulating, and arranging previously recorded sound—is more esoteric; certainly there are fewer producers rewriting the history of jazz and funk (DJ Premier, the Bomb Squad) or expanding the cosmic vistas of the dance floor (the KLF, the Orb). The practice remains more common in dance music, but it's still notable when someone returns to the old methods, and licensing concerns crowd many out. Instead, sampling has followed a path opposite that of most musical trends: from the unobtainable feel of early studio instruments to widespread pop deployment to the obscure and niche. Baltimore's Co La belongs to a shrinking group of composers—Flying Lotus and Bibio among them—for whom sampling remains a singular muse. His last album, Moody Coup, was a genteel patter that stitched together everything from ASMR-like frivolity to reggae toasting. His third-ish album (he's had several cassette and low-run releases) and second for Software, No No, arrives with a harsher mandate, aiming to explore the banging, echoing sounds of the club. This makes for a louder, tenser listen, even as Co La's methods remain largely unchanged: all of No No's sounds are recognizable, or at least conceivable. There's nothing truly alien here, and you'd always feel comfortable at least guessing at a sound's source. Increasingly, those sources are drums, or things that sound mostly like drums. There's a lot of diffuse banging on No No—only rarely does a deep kick-like sound arrive on time—and it sounds like Co La is one of a growing pool of producers inspired by the rhythmic daring of artists like Pearson Sound and Jam City. This manifests itself in tracks such as ""Crank"", which rises from a clutch of voices into a surprising, hands-in-the-air throb, and ""Gush"", which revels in a suspended state before perforating the bubble with rapid bursts of percussion. Of course, No No isn't dance music; Co La seems unwilling to commit to that level of structure. So while you could see a deft turntable hand or a devout remixer turning this club-ready, there are lots of potent moments (""No No"") and transfixing loops (""Barricade""'s pitched dollops) that are abandoned too quickly. Elsewhere, as on opener ""Squeeze"", the percussive elements feel placed at random, and the track, untethered, scatters away. I miss the gentleness of Moody Coup, and when the latter half of ""Tragedy"" opens up with a laughing voice and a rich piano lament I realize how stern and abrasive much of No No sounds. That's probably intentional, given the playfulness that's baked into Co La's methods and sound sources. This is avant-garde music at its core, and the precision with which these sources are treated and deployed means Co La probably has more in common with, say, Steve Reich than with DJ Premier. No No asks a lot of listeners, that we unpack all of these fun inferences even as we're being assaulted by the 143 different sounds Co La casted into the vestige of a snare drum. No No, on balance, is worth the effort.","Baltimore's Co La belongs to a shrinking group of composers for whom sampling remains a singular muse.

Taking Flight EP,Ryan HemsworthLucas,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0fd9d034d5c69bf4963/1:1/w_160/92c90a51.jpg,2015-10-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21082-taking-flight-ep/,Secret Songs,"No matter what source material he’s working with—be it a Gucci Mane verse, a Mitski song, or a Pokémon sample—Ryan Hemsworth wants you to know that he loves this stuff, sincerely and without reservation. He’s more than just an armchair curator, though; in the last few years, he's developed both a well-defined aesthetic and a deft hand. Where other DJs seek the thrill of juxtaposition alone, Hemsworth excels at making divergent tracks feel of a piece. Whether he’s flipping Tinashe or Blink-182, it always sounds like Ryan Hemsworth. Lately, Hemsworth’s evangelism has found a new platform in Secret Songs, a quasi-label where he handpicks tracks from up-and-coming producers for an audience of the faithful. He’s built Secret Songs into a sort of anti-PC Music; in place of ironic distance, there’s a loving embrace—the label’s mantra states that this is a ""friends only"" affair. Naturally, the songs tend to hew to a type, which is to say that any of them could cleanly slot into Hemsworth’s DJ sets. One of these tracks, ""Keep U Warm"" by Seattle producer Lucas, was an early standout, a set of disparate sounds, ranging from wind chimes to cricket chirps, sequenced with the delicacy and precision of a music box. For his latest project, Hemsworth teams with Lucas for a collaborative EP that serves as Hemsworth’s first Secret Songs release. The end result finds the two producers engaging in a generous give-and-take that plays to each of their strengths. The biggest surprise here is that the largely unknown Lucas often sets the tone. Whereas Hemsworth’s recent solo work favors crisp, clean lines, these tracks tend to crackle, buzz and fade. Melodies waft in as if through an open window and often drift off just as unceremoniously. Vocals are treated past the point of intelligibility, serving as textures that rub up against other elements in the mix. Given the gauzy sonic palette, emotions feel implied, rather than announced—not a bad look for Hemsworth, who can occasionally veer into preciousness on his own. There’s a sort of hazy sheen over Taking Flight that makes even the big crescendos feel slightly blurry, like vaseline smeared on a camera lens. Thankfully, Hemsworth’s knack for pulling heartstrings remains intact, as does his skillful, trap-influenced drum programming, if it's used judiciously. While ""From Grace"" is the only track on here that feels like it’s built for the dance floor, there are points in all of these songs where, for a brief few seconds, things snap into focus rhythmically before retreating back into the haze. Lucas likes to work with snippets of found sounds and every rattle, flutter, and squeak here feels like it’s adding up to something, nudging the song toward a resolution. Drums are often employed only to stitch together all the sounds floating in the mix, suddenly making you aware of a beat that was there all along. This is warm and unhurried electronic music that's built for Sunday mornings. At just over 20 minutes, Taking Flight is hardly ambitious, but it's a casual experiment that manages to feel vital throughout. It serves as one hell of a calling card for Lucas, whose previous output is limited to a handful of SoundCloud tracks. Meanwhile, a guy who’s made a career out of bending other people’s songs to fit his aesthetic gets to demonstrate that he’s just as adept at doing the exact opposite. And in allowing a less seasoned artist to eat away at the edges of his sound, Hemsworth has somehow managed to bring his gifts as a producer into even sharper focus.","Taking Flight finds Ryan Hemsworth and largely unknown Seattle producer Lucas engaging in a generous give-and-take that plays to each of their strengths.

Tug of War / Pipes of Peace,Paul McCartney,by: Ron Hart,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08cea9e61561daa663f/1:1/w_160/41e25ab7.jpg,2015-10-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21028-tug-of-war-pipes-of-peace/,ConcordMPLConcordMPL,"Paul McCartney's team-up with Rihanna and Kanye West on ""FourFiveSeconds"" earlier this year was met with surprise and bewilderment by some, but if you go back far enough you'd see it's just par for the course in the mind of Macca. Ever since the Beatles covered the Cookies back in '63, McCartney has been testifying to his love of R&B. ""Smokey Robinson was like God in our eyes,"" he once said. There was a reason Billy Preston's Rhodes solo fit so perfectly in ""Get Back"", after all. Paul McCartney was an R&B lover before he was ever a Beatle. In McCartney's solo material, however, you have to fast forward to 1982's Tug of War and 1983's Pipes of Peace to hear how that R&B influence evolved in his distinctive sound. It is within these two misunderstood albums in the Macca canon that the square root of ""FourFiveSeconds"" can be discovered, particularly upon the release of this latest pair of deluxe editions as part of the ongoing Paul McCartney Archive Collection series. In one sense, Tug of War plays out like the album we might've gotten had Lennon and McCartney taken up Lorne Michaels' famous $3,000 offer to reunite on ""Saturday Night"" in 1976. George Martin sits at the controls on a Fab Four-related project for the first time since Wings' ""Live and Let Die"" (unless you count the 1978 soundtrack to the unmentionably awful ""jukebox musical"" Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band). The specter of Lennon's tragic death and the unresolved differences between the two lifelong friends loom large across much of this material, especially the jubilant ""Ballroom Dancing"", the symphonic title track and ""Here Today"". The latter is the album's most direct reflection on Lennon's death, and it's a song McCartney has been regularly incorporating in his concerts the last couple of tours. Whatever Paul might not have said in the press at the time of Lennon's assassination, he certainly said here. The nucleus of Tug, however, is McCartney's yin-yang pair of collaborations with Stevie Wonder. Of course we all know ""Ebony and Ivory"", pure ground-zero Macca schmaltz tethered by a goofy yet endearing analogy to the synchronicity between the piano's keys. Strangely enough, the song's message has grown more urgent over the years, while the utterly Triple A orchestrations of the music itself grows as dated as that Joe Piscopo/Eddie Murphy send-up on ""Saturday Night Live"". The key moment comes earlier on the album with ""What's That You're Doing?"", a tour de force of Hotter Than July-era Wonder funk that can be seen as the ColecoVision to the PS4 of ""FourFiveSeconds"". Some critics derided McCartney for aging gracelessly upon the release of the electro-tinged Pipes of Peace in '83, right as he turned 41. However, a good listen to the album today reveals some ways it was ahead of its time. With the ballad ""So Bad"", McCartney confirmed his aforementioned Smokey worship by paying homage to Robinson's ""Quiet Storm"" era, emulating the Motown great's cool falsetto to such perfection that Smokey himself had a little bit of a rough time emulating it on his own cover from The Art of McCartney. Then there is ""Tug of Peace"", an early, primitive version of a mash-up that brought together the title cuts of these underappreciated albums. The blend is clunky, but it foreshadows his electronic music work as the Fireman and on Liverpool Sound Collage. Then there's ""Say Say Say"", written in collaboration with Michael Jackson. The song was a simpatico matching of minds, combining Paul's harmonies and Jackson's meticulous sense of rhythm. Mark ""Spike"" Stent's magnificent 2015 remix of ""Say"" on the bonus disc of the Pipes reissue stretches the groove to nearly eight minutes, buoyed by a rocksteady 4/4 handclap beat that conjures up visions of the New York City Breakers dancing in your head. On ""The Man"",  the Macca/Jacko duo sways a little closer into Paul territory with its strummy acoustic charm and Wings-esque bombast, showing that beyond ""Say Say Say"" and ""The Girl Is Mine"", they were a potent creative team before it all imploded in a dust of Beatles royalties and Nike ad money. The extras dug up for the Tug of War reissue (the Super Deluxe Edition of each also contain DVDs of era-appropriate ephemera) make for some interesting listening—demo versions of ""Wanderlust"" and ""The Pound Is Sinking"", and a version of ""Ebony"" with just McCartney on electric piano. But those pale in comparison to the veritable alternate LP included in Pipes of Peace. The previously unreleased ""It's Not On"" sounds like Ween, while the tremolo guitar that floats across another rare cut, ""Simple As That"", could be the secret template for The Smiths' ""How Soon Is Now?"". Elsewhere, proper album tracks like ""Average Person"", ""Keep Under Cover"" and ""Sweetest Little Show"" in demo form sound like they could have been leftovers from Ram. In all, this reissue series continues to shine a new light on McCartney's varied solo output, finding new stories they tell.","These two albums from the 1980s, now reissued with bonus tracks, aren't anywhere near Paul McCartney's best, but both have their moments and they shed light on his long-time love of R&B.

Zipper Down,Eagles of Death Metal,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b135b1335d7bf169a23c/1:1/w_160/95eb9078.jpg,2015-10-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21115-zipper-down/,UMET-Boy,"It’s been over 15 years since childhood friends Joshua Homme and Jesse ""the Devil"" Hughes founded their cartoonish, carnal blues-rock project, Eagles of Death Metal. When Homme's not manning the drum kit or the mixing board for Eagles (he’s produced each one of their LPs) he fronts Queens of the Stone Age, one of the biggest hard rock bands on the planet. So it makes sense that listeners would categorize the group as a Queens of the Stone Age side project. But EoDM has never been Homme’s show—this band has always been about Hughes, the strutting, showboating, irredeemably decadent presence at its center, the greasy cog around which the freak show turns. The arrival of Zipper Down coincides with the documentary The Redemption of the Devil, which details one hell of year in Hughes' life, one in which he becomes ordained as a Protestant minister, prepares to marry former adult film star Tuesday Cross, ventures further to the right on the political spectrum (he's a noted gun fanatic), enters a custody battle for his kid, and, somehow, finds time to cut a new Eagles record. The film attempts to answer a question faced by every aging rocker at some point in their lives: when you’ve had your fill of sex, drugs, and scuzz-rock, who do you turn to for guidance? In Hughes’ case, there are only two logical responses: the guy upstairs, and the guy behind the bar. On Zipper Down, it's clear that Hughes’ certificate of ordination doesn’t exclude him from the party; as outlined on album closer ""The Reverend"", his spiritual leanings are all part of his divine mission to get us all to ""boogie-woogie"". In interviews, he's preached the gospel of pure methamphetamine and public sex acts, while openly accepting the fiery abyss that lies in wait. In other words, he’s prepared to pick up the tab for every bender (and miserable morning after) detailed on *Zipper Down—*but only once the party’s over. Accordingly, most of the songs aren't about angels or demons, but rather girls who like to shake their asses (""Got a Woman"" and its ""Slight Return"" on side B), girls who like to swing their asses (""Silverlake (K.S.O.F.M.)"") and two-timing heartbreakers (""I Love You All the Time"", ""Oh Girl""). Homme supports the songs with one shuffling, snare-heavy beat after the next, peppered by handclaps and the odd cowbell. But Zipper Down’s tongue-in-cheek humor belies the dark self-awareness of two guys well-versed in the study of human depravity. A closer look at the puffed-up, pivoting highlight ""Silverlake"", for example, reveals it not as a paean to the fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood, but rather a tale of a wannabe hipster trying to weasel his way into the hotspot-du-jour by having his girl get with the bouncer (""So if you date this guy/ He's gonna let us in!""), only to suffer an existential crisis in the end. Likewise, a forlorn, foggy-headed cover of Duran Duran’s one-night-stand anthem ""Save a Prayer"" revisits the album’s coital motifs through a confessional lens, solidifying aforementioned themes of atonement and reckoning. Despite these more reflective moments, Zipper Down mostly sticks to the formula of the duo’s past three albums, frequently recycling structural and instrumental elements from past songs. The haggard guitars and handclap-heavy backbeat of ""Got a Woman"" recalls Death by Sexy highlight ""Chase the Devil"", while ""The Deuce"" shares a bluesy foundation with Peace Love Death Metal's ""So Easy"". This repetition isn’t to the Eagles’ detriment: theirs has always been a goofy project, one grounded in humor, wit, and sass rather than paradigm shifts. Easy rockers like the sawtoothed, shimmying  ""Complexity"" prove that the tricks aren’t necessary, as long as your hips are moving.","Josh Homme's band with Jesse ""the Devil"" Hughes returns with another album of sleazy and entertaining rock'n'roll.

Unbreakable,Janet Jackson,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bf5e6ef95969322006/1:1/w_160/172ff89a.jpg,2015-10-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21060-unbreakable/,BMGRhythm Nation,"Montreal producer Kaytranada put out a remix of Janet Jackson's 1993 single ""If"" in the fall of 2012, but the edit, which reimagines the misty original as bubbling, whimsical house, became a party staple. The remix was unique, not just because it lingered on DJ playlists far longer than most major-label hits, but because it created an entry point to then-rising nu-house operatives like Soulection and HW&W via a cross-generational touchpoint like no other: Janet. That gauzy vocal loop, floating in on an elastic bassline, nudged along by dense handclaps and pin-sharp hi-hats, deaded the lumbering, surly dominance of brostep in one fell swoop. What Kaytranada did with the remix is what Janet’s long accomplished over her musical career: she won hearts and bridged imaginations on the dance floor. It’s playful and funky and sensual; it sounds like something Janet would make for herself. And even though it’s been out in the world for three years, the tour DJ on Jackson’s current tour runs it pre-show. Probably the only downside to Janet’s 11th album *Unbreakable—*aside from it running about three tracks too long—is that it doesn’t contain that kind of axis-shifting single. Missy Elliott gives it a try, two-stepping in with a squirmy synthesizer for ""BURNITUP!"" and the lazy bass and airy vocals of ""Dammn Baby"" sounds like Tinashe-meets-Teena Marie. ""The Great Forever"" and ""Night"" are formally ambitious pop songs, but don’t deliver as much personality as 2004’s underrated Damita Jo. Instead, Unbreakable is a synthesis of ideas Jackson’s collected and tested throughout her career. ""2 B Loved"", with its cavalcade of hoots and hollers, is probably the album’s most ""now""-sounding song. ""No Sleeep,"" the dusky R&B single, is quintessential Jam & Lewis-abetted Janet. A sweet melody and ribald Isley Brothers sample builds a sultry Quiet Storm groove. Even the silly J. Cole feature can't prevent it from being one of the best songs of the year, a conscious curving of the melismatic summertime bombast of chart-toppers like the Weeknd, Jidenna, OMI, and Bieber. It came out in June, in time for warm summer nights, but fits in better with the enveloping dark of fall. Like Janet, it's timeless. The story here is love and catharsis. It's her first album since Michael Jackson's death in 2009, and the dissolution of her relationship with Jermaine Dupri. The warm, acoustic guitar sway of the title track sets the tone: these are giddy, grateful grown-woman songs. Janet's settled into a new relationship and, if songs like ""After You Fall"" and ""Broken Hearts Heal"", are any indication, ruminating with love on her brother's life and death. On the former she dips into her lower register whilst singing over a somber piano line; on the latter, an uptempo pop song filled with sunny harmonies, she tilts her voice skyward, singing a song of praise about childhood memories and afterlives with an Arabic 'inshallah' on the hook. Jackson, now married to a Qatari businessman, remains private about her personal life but has reportedly converted to Islam. And that one word coming from a pop icon does more for a post-9/11 world than Unbreakable's social-message songs like ""Black Eagle"", and especially ""Shoulda Known Better"", a start-stop fist-pumper about reading beyond the headlines that's two choruses and a verse too long. This ability to synthesize what music needs instead of catering to its whims is what has made Janet Jackson an enduring pop star. Unlike Madonna, whose presence and work open up much-needed conversations about sexuality, commodity, and the gendered age biases of pop music, Jackson, 49, exposes these conventions as construct. Unbreakable might be her most demure album in years, but that doesn't mean it's not sexy. Its strength comes from savvy instead of gimmickry, returning to the producers and formula Jackson built her career on (jubilant dance-pop, bedroom R&B, that angelic giggle). Because Unbreakable is about putting faith in one's career and fans, it plays like the natural next phase in Jackson's discography, which individually might be markers of their time but are ultimately ageless.","Unbreakable is Janet Jackson's first album since Michael Jackson’s death in 2009 and the dissolution of her relationship with Jermaine Dupri.

I Need New Eyes,Larry Gus,by: Abby Garnett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0afc0084474cd0c1cc0/1:1/w_160/0a37f7a0.jpg,2015-10-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21050-i-need-new-eyes/,DFA,"When Panagiotis Melidis, the Greek producer who records as Larry Gus, first began releasing music, his primary mode of expression was parroting other artists to create sample-heavy pastiche. His productions encompassed everything from Afrobeat to hip-hop; after signing to DFA, his first two albums for the label were somewhat unsteady attempts to turn bits and pieces into a cohesive whole, taking cues from prototypical psych pop outfits like El Guincho and Animal Collective. His last album*,* Years Not Living, was a more conceptually confident (if sometimes muddy-sounding) stew of African-influenced grooves, slathered-on samples, and his own heavily layered vocals. Though he’s pared down the clutter and clamor somewhat since his initial DFA outing, Melidis is still no stranger to chaos, as evidenced by the mishmash of styles on his new album, I Need New Eyes. Like Years Not Living, it’s made up of immersive grooves and smartly deployed samples. But the music borders on the emotionally drippy, with lyrics lamenting the ever-present fear of failure inherent in creative work—a feeling he describes somewhat cheekily in the album’s first track as a ""black veil of fail."" As a writer, Melidis is often either obtuse to the point of sounding glib (""children are all foreign shores"") or absurdly abstract (""all the tigers breathe with the fires from above""). He smartly offsets his own straightforward singing with vocal samples from other sources, and his strongest songs piggyback off of other influences: ""A Set of Replies"" sounds like an earnest adaptation of the Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind"", elevated by sweetly reedy details and percussive pinging, while the sugary ""The Sun Describes"", with its warbling vocals and tropical percussion, is a melancholy reimagining of his early Avalanches rip, ""Contours Sway"". In some ways Melidis is the consummate consumption-driven producer, whose wide-ranging tastes fuel an obsessive thirst for sounds and ideas: in interviews, he seems comfortable driving the narrative that his music is a sum of influences, gamely referencing Prince, Raymond Queneau, Marc Maron, Lucio Battisti, and Seinfeld. (The album’s title is itself a veiled reference to Proust.) He’s an artist who’s attracted to ambiguity, and who’s attributed one of his most profound moments of inspiration to listening to Madlib while in the grip of sunstroke. Anyone seeking out that woozy, half-sick, half-euphoric feeling will find it all over I Need New Eyes. The album’s sweeping final track, ""Nazgonya (Paper Spike)"", is a satisfying culmination, a swirling, unambiguously warm callback to psychedelic pop. Of all the songs on the album, it’s the most straightforward, and therefore the most successful. The problem is that Melidis’ ear for busy atmospherics and his desire to say something deep don’t quite mesh; this music is like that huge spinning wheel on ""The Price Is Right""—efficient, colorful, deadening.","Panagiotis Melidis, the Greek producer who records as Larry Gus, is no stranger to chaos, as is evidenced by the mishmash of styles on his new album, I Need New Eyes.

Natural Born Losers,Nicole Dollanganger,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f8c0084474cd0c1d38/1:1/w_160/1339e324.jpg,2015-10-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21079-nicole-dollanganger-natural-born-losers/,Eerie Organization,"""I’d give my body to Satan if I could only keep my soul,"" Nicole Dollanganger sings in a whispery, desperate voice on ""Angels of Porn (II)"", a song about how the singer seems to have been trapped in a food and cum-stained dungeon for days. ""But I can’t seem to find the split between them anymore."" This is the sort of subject matter that made her music popular among her Tumblr followers in the first place, long before Grimes made her the first artist on her new label. And no matter how chipper her plucky bedroom folk sounded on the surface on previous records like Flowers of Flesh and Blood and Curdled Milk, she was still singing lyrics like, ""Why didn’t anyone tell me love is like being fucked with a knife?"" Over nimble electric guitar and booming kick drum, her new album Natural Born Losers tells tales of murdering angels, ""fucking the soul of the south,"" and telling your lover he’s going to get fried in jail for his crimes. Like any recording that moves from lo-fi demos to sleeker production, Natural Born Losers fills out Dollanganger’s music, matching the darkness of her lyrics with equally creepy instrumentals, replacing soft piano and ukulele with thundering electric guitar and murmuring organs. And while the music’s simplicity might ring dull for some, it places what matters most with Dollanganger’s music front and center: her songwriting and her voice. Dollanganger's fascination with desolate Americana imagery recalls other similarly moody, bleak pop singers: think Melanie Martinez’ broken-housewife routine, Halsey’s tortured teen road-trip anthems, and Lana Del Rey’s dark, star-spangled camp. But those singers’ stories still feel romantic, while Dollanganger's music is only inviting in the way the cute, white Victorian house from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was at first glance. ""I’ll be your sister, your young bride, your angel, your slave,"" she sings to her vinyl glove-clad, cop lover in a whisper on ""Mean"". She sings of drinking the titular liquid and getting chained up in bed on the fuzzy ""Alligator Blood"" and she’s bleeding to death during knife play on the pretty, minimalist guitar ballad ""American Tradition"" but ""it doesn’t matter, 'cause my baby is still the winner."" Her angelic, high-pitched voice coats every utterance in innocence, a façade considering how much this album loves giving and taking pain. Her elemental lyrics help elevate her record above kinky bad-girl tropes: With every act of violence inflicted on Dollanganger, she reveals how corrupted she can be as well, proving she’s just as a strong and sadistic of a hunter. She never really lets any of the dark sentiments exist in a vacuum, which is important considering the violence she mines for aesthetic and emotional affect. Dead bodies get fed to the Earth’s starving animals, animals get fed to starving humans; she sees a father’s violence in his son’s eyes and sings that ""history repeats our whole damn lives."" Her portrait of tortured sexuality and death is tethered to an ambiguous portrait of backwoods living, a North American wilderness where anything and anyone can be hunted. Natural Born Losers plays like a work of wicked anti-pastoralism from the perspective of a bad girl who stares out at her rustic life with not wide-eyed romanticism but sad familiarity and resignation. ""This same place is getting old but dreams are fulfilled where the purple grass grows,"" Dollanganger sings on ""White Trashing"". ""And I can see it all just beyond our window.""","Nicole Dollanganger is the first artist signed to Grimes' label. Her full LP Natural Born Losers fills out the wispy lo-fi feel of her demos, matching the darkness of her lyrics with equally creepy instrumentation.

Holding Hands With Jamie,Girl Band,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08fb1335d7bf169a13e/1:1/w_160/2f48dd27.jpg,2015-10-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21029-holding-hands-with-jamie/,Rough Trade,"Girl Band’s debut EP, 2012’s France 98, was good but unremarkable, the sound of four young Irish guys experimenting with dissonance but rarely straying from ten-a-penny post-punk gloom. By contrast, last year’s ""Lawman"" was the sign of a band that had found their own sharp footing. Writhing, sexy, and strange, the Dubliners soldered frenzied hi-hats to an industrial mess that recalled early Liars, and Dara Kiely had found his yowling voice located somewhere between his apparently unhinged jaw and spirit. The revelation was nothing compared to what the song did for Kiely himself. During a period of poor mental health, the euphoria he experienced from writing the song (which dealt with a recent breakup) triggered within him a superhuman complex. ""I had this thing, this, ‘You are your own god, you are your own master’, this extreme idea,"" he said. ""It was the most amazing feeling I have ever had… I thought I could control the weather. Everything."" Kiely spent a while living in a tent in his back garden, and the episode became so severe that his mother took six months off work to care for him, encouraging him to write when he couldn’t do anything else. Eventually, he had a breakdown and checked into a hospital, and emerged, he says, genuinely at peace. The rest of Girl Band had continued to write while he was away, and on Kiely’s return, he fitted observations from his journal to their squall. His wit hadn’t vanished alongside his sense of reason. ""The Last Riddler"" repeats verbatim the moment where he asked a doctor for their favorite band. Given the reply ""ABBA"", Kiely presented him with a piece of paper that read ""the winner takes it all,"" along with some cryptic advice: ""Think about it."" Elsewhere he’s more fragmented: He ""snorted a wasp and told them to eff off"" on ""Pears for Lunch"", where he struggles with body dysmorphia and has a self-loathing wank in front of ""Top Gear"". Acutely attuned to the goings-on of the natural world, he scraps with pigeons, toys with fetid food, and watches a girl “[race] her slugs to the salt lines."" His tragi-comic tidbits combine to a universal portrait of idle squalor and degradation that trumps his realist peers, and aligns him with absurdists like Captain Beefheart or cult poet Patricia Lockwood. Should you laugh? Holding Hands With Jamie is as discomfiting as Kiely’s mental state. ""Pears for Lunch"" swells with dangerous fearlessness, recalling '90s news reports of bad amphetamines that made hopped-up kids think they were Icarus, while at the end of ""The Last Riddler"", Kiely’s screams and explosive bursts of roiling guitar and drums give the impression of a man running amok with a chainsaw. ""Paul"" picks up the conversation between techno and industrial music that Girl Band started on their cover of Blawan’s ""Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage"" and takes it somewhere utterly godless and glorious: seven minutes of ravenous, gathering violence comprised of screaming guitar, lurching bass, and superhuman effort from drummer Adam Faulkner. Where this spring’s The Early Years EP—led by ""Lawman""—either went hell for leather or slowed the pace entirely, on Holding Hands… Girl Band have mastered suspense. ""Baloo"" chugs like Battles’ Mirrored retooled from corroded scrap metal; ""In Plastic"" has a pendulous, borderline romantic quality. They self-produced, and the record often sounds as if it was recorded on the other side of a warehouse wall, like muffled industry contained within a rubbery membrane. This strange distance could be frustrating, but it becomes an integral part of Girl Band’s sound, which feels unique right now. Traces of Liars’ DNA persist, as do similarities to those tireless Texans Shit and Shine, but it’s hard to think of another guitar-based band conjuring fear this exhilarating and volume this rapturous.","After some fairly rough—if creatively fruitful—mental times, Dara Kiely brings heavy vibes and great songs to Girl Band's new album. Should you laugh? Holding Hands With Jamie is as discomfiting as Kiely’s mental state.

Age of Transparency,Autre Ne Veut,by: Puja Patel,Editor-in-Chief,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a7c0084474cd0c1cac/1:1/w_160/ed48688d.jpg,2015-10-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21044-age-of-transparency/,Downtown,"The opening to Age of Transparency  teases us with memories of 2013's ""Play By Play"", still the greatest song Arthur Ashin (aka Autre Ne Veut) has ever recorded. ""Baaaaaaaaaaaabe,"" he warbles, his voice soulful, strained and knowing, before he slides into a reprisal of ""On and On"", remaking the upbeat single into an exercise in jazz improvisation and bare-boned composition that goes just long enough before it chokes out into a sputter. A theme for the album is wrapped within; this set of songs extends something beautiful to its limits and then tries to will it beyond its end. Sometimes to a fault. Ashin's showiness as a singer is part of his grandeur; his voice has always managed to pull a song together. Yes, he's been lumped into the inner mines of ""bedroom R&B"" or ""PBR&B""–the latter of which is an innocuous title for a genre, an easy way of associating the soul of R&B with the electronic embrace of indie–but he has always had his eye somewhere outside the bedroom. His singing feels directed to a shrine rather than the club, and he's able to emote despair and acute yearning through the rawness of his voice, not in spite of it. It can be unsettling to hear that singular spark start to work against him now. The disconnect could very well come from the fact that he's now surrounded by a proper choir, and on his most sonically incoherent album yet. On ""Get Out"" he is navigating a track that feels primed for cinematic pop glory, but the song flags as it goes on and his flights of melodic inspiration begin to feel like a parody of a blues singer. On ""Over Now"", a glitchy sample turns a dreary lullaby to the death of something or other into a vacuous wall of static; what is clearly meant to be a captivating mess of noise becomes literally difficult to listen to. ""Switch Hitter"" turns a menacing pop framework, with its elastic guitars and looming synths, into something that feels half-baked. Where these songs hit their most visceral moments is where they can feel their most contrived. Joel Ford (Ford & Lopatin) and Young Ejecta appear on production again, but Ashin has graduated from his former roommate's Software imprint to a bigger label with a bigger budget, and with that his sound has become cleaner, denser, and glossier, barring some of the organic simplicity that he's benefited from in the past. His lyrics remain simple and poignant, but some of what surprised us on Anxiety has lost its newness here. The sudden moments of rapture–the ones that that pushed through layers of electronic ambience–remain, but are less frequent and more predictable. That said, when it does all come together on this album, it really is quite gorgeous. ""Panic Room"" is some of his best writing musically and lyrically. The lines ""I don't want to feel like you're not here with me/ Even when you say that you are not here with me"" are heart wrenching on their own. Lay them on a wave of synths and the flutter of percussive rolls and the track is as enveloping as ""Play By Play"" or ""Counting"" were before it. ""World War Pt. 2"" dabbles with some frantic pop sampling before retreating, underscoring the fevered pull of a line like ""heartbreak is not enough."" ""Age of Transparency"" is another highlight. In these moments, where he approaches the brink and opens his arms to it, the messiness of his intense and manic music mirrors the messiness of life. The title of Age of Transparency acts as Ashin's commentary on the way we live our lives out in the open, and his music seeks to pull you through uneasy, emotional dregs with its every turn. But what once felt intimate has started to lean to over-exertion. Here we see what happens after the fireworks have burst, when its casing is left smoldering and you're hoping for more.","Arthur Ashin (aka Autre Ne Veut) has always been lumped in with the ""bedroom R&B"" of How to Dress Well and others. At his best, his singing feels directed to a shrine rather than the club.

V,Wavves,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a1ea9e61561daa6660/1:1/w_160/6b85ce7b.jpg,2015-10-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21042-v/,Warner Bros.Ghost Ramp,"In July, Nathan Williams became the latest musician to show you can take the boy out of indie but you can’t take the indie out of the boy: He got in a fight with his major label. Williams uploaded ""Way Too Much"", a single from his then-untitled new album, to SoundCloud, only to see Warner Bros. take it down. Without disclosing Warner’s motivation behind the takedown, he implied the label was threatening to sue him, and wrote, ""Its so obnoxious to work tirelessly on something and then have a bunch of ppl who just see me as a money sign go and fuck it all up."" On this, Warner was right: V is definitely not a record that’s going to make them a lot of money. That would require Williams writing the pop-punk crossover LP of his career—a little more Paramore, a little less Psychedelic Horseshit. Instead, what we have is an angry collection of songs more indebted to his recent collaboration with Cloud Nothings and the brute-force approach of his earlier releases, where punk catharsis was achieved by saying the same lyric over and over. (Say ""I’m so bored"" five times fast and you, in fact, will feel bored.) V was inspired by a breakup, as well as the band’s hellaciously bad habits: 100 beers and two bottles of Jameson a night for the four-piece group, a period of ""just drinking, straight drinking,” as Williams says in the album’s press materials. Accordingly, V sounds like a hangover. Every song starts somewhere dismal, and ends up somewhere that’s only a little hopeful—a process akin to the recovery from a hangover, when by the end you're mostly happy not to be drooling and vomiting on yourself. Multiple tracks refer to headaches both physical and spiritual. Williams’ budget has outsized the lo-fi recordings he made his name with, but he hasn't deviated much from the core formula. Though there’s room for easy-breezy surf rock (""Heavy Metal Detox""), insistent riffage (""Flamezesz"", ""Pony""), and shuddering sounds ripped from a horror movie (""Redlead""), the predominant aesthetic is dirty and discordant backed by big harmonies—the sweet spot from which all memorable Wavves songs emerge. It’s a faster record, too: V abandons Williams’ previous attempts at balladry, with all slow moments preceding the eventual assault. At times, the pace works to his advantage. Williams writes a killer hook, and it’s easy to hear crowds slamming along to the feel-bad vibes of ""Heavy Metal Detox"",  ""All the Same"", ""Way Too Much"", and ""My Head Hurts"". A line like ""I lost my job today, but it’s all the same"" (""All the Same"") is delivered much more happily than ""It gets better"" (""Pony""), a reminder that he’s better reveling in angst than trying to convince us it doesn’t matter. When he leans into his ennui, V achieves momentarily thrilling peaks. Williams is a child of singers like Billie Joe Armstrong and Tom DeLonge, pop-punk brats great at sounding snotty next to a massive chorus. The best songs remind you of his keen ability for penning sonically fractured, melodically appealing ""woe-is-me"" anthems that won’t bruise you too badly in the pit. (The best songs were written with the other members of the band, too, suggesting a necessary camaraderie.) Still, V is a slight regression from the subtle growth he showed on 2013’s Afraid of Heights. Songs like ""Demon to Lean On"" and ""Cop"" weren’t just excellent songs—they showed the crystallization of the Wavves project into something mature, a word that’s rarely been used to describe Williams or his music. V will make you think he’s lapsed back to his #worstbehavior. Take a characteristic line like ""Everything sucks if you don’t get your way"" from ""Tarantula""—it’s like he fell through a portal from 2009, and is back to playing the perpetual brat. V is a perfectly capable record, one that showcases what we’ve come to expect—and in many cases, enjoy—from Williams and his band. Even so, you wonder where else they might have gone.","Wavves' fifth album was inspired by a breakup, as well as a period of what Nathan Williams calls ""just drinking, straight drinking."" Accordingly, V sounds like a hangover. The best songs here will make for a welcome injection into his set list, reminding you of his keen ability for penning appealing ""woe-is-me"" anthems that won’t bruise you too badly in the pit.

Outfit Of The Day,Moscow Club,by: Patrick St. Michel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ac13d197565213a4e1/1:1/w_160/54ec0efd.jpg,2015-10-02 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21048-outfit-of-the-day/,Fastcut,"There was a moment a few years ago when Japan’s independent music scene seemed poised to break out internationally. Between 2011 and mid-2013, artists from all over the nation were making inroads abroad -- shadowy project Jesse Ruins signed to Captured Tracks, while outfits such as Sapphire Slows and Hotel Mexico were regulars on MP3 blogs such as Gorilla Vs. Bear, with many more rising up beneath them. It was during this period that Tokyo’s Moscow Club started sharing their music online, earning attention for their genre-hopping releases. The quartet also saw the potential in front of Japan’s indie community, prompting them to spearhead a compilation in 2012 highlighting unsigned artists. “It is so exciting that there are still so many undiscovered amazing talents creating their own sound somewhere on this little island,” they wrote at the time. Moscow Club’s second full-length album, Outfit Of The Day, arrives long after the community they championed left the international spotlight. No moment can last forever, and many of the bands from that fruitful span have broken up, changed drastically or simply stopped doing anything (Moscow Club themselves vanished for two years, returning this summer). Outfit features collaborations with many of the artists from that period, and lends the album a feeling of a tribute for a time that slipped away, but also serves as a reminder of the talent that still exists. Above all else, Moscow Club -- and the artists in the same orbit -- stood out because they knew how to write a solid, catchy song. Outfit starts with “Band Of Outsiders,” a fleet-footed indie-pop song packing every hooky idea it can into just over two minutes. This is the lane where Moscow Club excels, and Outfit features plenty of guitar-anchored tracks skipping towards sticky choruses. They especially shine when glossing up their jangle with synthesizers. The extra twinkle adds an emotional pining central to numbers such as “Carven” and “Celine” (owing to a band-wide interest in fashion, the album boasts a fashion theme, down to the Instagram-born title). The latter -- written by lead singer Kazuro Matsubara after hearing a Tokyo train station melody and featuring backing vocals from Amanda Åkerman of Swedish group Alpaca Sports -- showcases Moscow Club at their best, capable of a chugging number that progressively ups the drama. Although hazy, melancholic indie-pop is their strength, part of Moscow Club’s appeal has always been their eagerness to branch out, resulting in glistening dance numbers or straight chillwave. Their ambition remains, as one of Outfit’s finest comes on the slow-burning “Tour De Moskow.” The title gives away one key point of inspiration -- though, if you forget, the breathing samples throughout serve as a reminder - but its shuffled beat also pays homage to Frankie Knuckles’ “The Whistle Song” and nods to electro group Telex. It’s a lot to juggle, but Moscow Club balance it all just right. More of a curveball, though, is “Carven (Orchestral),” a four-minute orchestra version of the more straightforward “Carven.” It’s an interesting interlude, albeit one that could have shaved a minute off. Outfit, as mentioned, isn’t just a Moscow Club creation, but a collaborative effort featuring names central to the Japanese independent scene. Some of them appear on the songs proper -- Eri Nakajima of Osaka indie-poppers Wallflower sings on “Margaret,” while Ryota Komori plays saxophone on “Saint Laurent,” bringing the chaotic edge of his main band Miila and the Geeks to Moscow Club’s world. Two members of Kyoto’s now-defunct Hotel Mexico pop up too, although only lead singer Ryuyu Ishigami appears on track, as former bassist Kai Ito provided words for two songs. Yet the names behind the scenes are just as important, helping to write the lyrics gracing Moscow Club’s music. It adds up to a very solid collection, and one bringing to mind a time that feels long gone. Western media tends to cover Japanese acts veering to an extreme side, whether that be harsh Japanoise or, in more recent years, cuter and weirder fare rarely taken seriously as music. The embrace of art confirming existing images of the country -- as strange, as colorful, as different -- is a disservice to bands such as Moscow Club, who sing in English and don’t play up being Japanese for just that reason. Outfit Of The Day is a solid collection of indie-pop with some detours, and a reminder of how good the often overlooked indie community in the country can be.","Tokyo's Moscow Club came to attention at a time when bands from all over Japan's independent music scene seemed poised to break out internationally.

Women’s Rights,Childbirth,by: Lindsay Hood,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07eb1335d7bf169a120/1:1/w_160/6f357199.png,2015-10-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21019-womens-rights/,Suicide Squeeze,"Julia Shapiro (Chastity Belt), Bree McKenna (Tacocat), and Stacy Peck (Pony Time) open their album screaming ""Childbirth!"" and ""Women's rights!"". Peck pounds her drum kit while Shapiro draws out each phrase, McKenna joining in on the latter. It's a puzzling forty seconds, and at first the track feels either unnecessary or like a joke. But if it is a joke, it feels both vital and too close to home when you consider that 241 representatives of the GOP recently voted to defund Planned Parenthood.  It's just as well the punk trio keeps shouting on repeat as if the subject had no meaning. Ultimately Women's Rights plays like an album created to deflect hopelessness with crude humor, and Childbirth are indiscriminate in their choice of topics, as long as they're ripe for comedy. They'll tackle anything from online dating to Seattle's influx of tech culture, brought to you by Amazon (All band members reside in the PNW). Shapiro opens ""Tech Bro"" with a cheerful guitar riff only to begrudgingly admit, ""I'll let you explain feminism to me/ Tech bro, tech bro/ If I can use your HDTV,"" proving that you can be disgusted by gentrification, but intrigued with its trappings at the same time. During ""Siri, Open Tinder"", McKenna's backing vocals are reduced to the simple instructions ""Swipe left!"" or ""Swipe right!"" only to exclaim, ""Which one are you?!"" upon encountering a group photo. All over the album, repeated lyrics are interrupted with one liners to highlight peak ridiculousness. However, it's not just dudes under attack here. Tracks like ""Let's Be Bad"" and ""Breast Coast (Hangin' Out)"" – where lyrics like ""Hanging out/ Doing stuff/ With my boyfriend"" and ""I love him cause he's hot"", read like a dig against Bethany Cosentino – are perfect for all the times when perfectly curated Pinterest boards, UGG boots, and pictures of pumpkin spice lattes on Instagram make you want to scream. In order to level the playing field, we're gifted the single ""Nasty Grrls"" – a laundry list of disgusting habits that ""nice young ladies"" shouldn't indulge in, like wiping away boogers and never washing bras, amongst others transgressions of hygiene. (Hate to break it to you, but we do dip everything in ranch.) Then, of course, there's the matter of the band's namesake. They're quick to point out that once you've reached spawning age, women's conversations are downgraded to a competitive arena. Take ""More Fertile Than You"" where Shapiro outright brags, ""I've got eggs by the dozen and you got none"". But by far, the highlight of the whole album is the hilarious and dark ""Baby Bump"".  The line, ""I'm that horrifying person from your past/ I'm a party creep/ Why are we still friends?"" delivered by a snide friend to an expectant mom, rings painfully true. Those of us who choose to abstain from motherhood often feel we become nothing more than grubby, little deviants who snort coke off a key in your bathroom. When will we settle down? With all of these cultural touch points, it's clear that Childbirth are not concerned with maintaining relevance over the next ten years. Women's Rights is an album created entirely for the moment, which keeps the spirit lighthearted even when they're dealing with heavy-handed subject matter. You know exactly what they're referencing, and they're quick to make you laugh. The problem is, it's easy to feel clobbered by the album's bluntness and their variety of topics don't differ much from the first record. Shapiro and McKenna's back-and-forth calls get tedious and the feeling become less ""Well, that's funny!"" and more ""Okay, we get it"". But there's a point somewhere in there, too. Women are subjected to such a barrage of expectations and judgements that it's fucking exhausting even when it's funny, and sometimes you have to mock everything because you feel powerless to change it. It makes you so angry that you have to keep repeating yourself.","Childbirth is a group consisting of Julia Shapiro (Chastity Belt), Bree McKenna (Tacocat), and Stacy Peck (Pony Time). Women's Rights plays like an album created to deflect hopelessness with crude humor, and Childbirth are indiscriminate in their choice of topics, as long as they're ripe for comedy.

Hamilton: Original Broadway Cast Recording,Various Artists,by: Felipe Delerme,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b13fea9e61561daa6750/1:1/w_160/3636ba90.jpg,2015-10-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21122-hamilton-original-broadway-cast-recording/,Atlantic,"Hip hop is nothing if not rich in drama. Beyond even the competitive feuding, the best rap music chronicles its makers' highs and lows, detailing the gnarly realities of difficult lives lived triumphantly. Hip hop and theater, with their shared fondness for linear narrative, should make for more frequent bedfellows, but it took until this year for the two genres to combine to properly resounding effect. Debuting at the Public Theater to raves earlier this year and accumulating hype ever since, the rapped musical Hamilton tells the story of the United States founding father born and orphaned in the Caribbean, who used a prodigious writing talent to catapult himself off the island of St. Croix and leave as deep a thumbprint in United States history as has been made. Hamilton could not have been an easy show to write, even for a theater savant like Lin-Manuel Miranda, the 35 year-old Grammy-winning author of In The Heights and recent MacAuthur ""Genius Grant"" recipient. The play is composed of 46 individual songs, here split between two discs (Acts I and II) that make up the album. Adopted by Miranda from Ron Chernow’s biography, Alexander Hamilton*,* the songs are vehicles for Hamilton’s life experiences, and great pains have been taken to maintain the accuracy of an already-fascinating story amidst the likewise-necessary shimmer of theatrical performance. Pairing early US history with one of the country’s youngest musical art forms, one born of the underprivileged especially, could have been as painful as listening to one of your history teachers ""bust a rhyme,"" but Miranda’s command of both golden era hip hop and showtunes allows him to turn the pomp and circumstance of even congressional proceedings on its head. Though ostensibly a rap record, from the show opener, ""Alexander Hamilton"", it’s immediately apparent that we are still essentially in musical-theater territory. Theatrical dialogue must be clear and audible to reach its audience—even when presented in song—which denies the cast the freedom to indulge in grand tonal flourishes or vocal tics. Miranda and his cast’s delivery is steadfast and well-enunciated, the flows delivered with a watchmaker’s precision. It helps that the song itself is a bracingly economical synopsis of Hamilton’s early years: The treacherous hurricane that destroyed St. Croix, the letter he wrote  to his absentee father that published by a local paper and caused such a fervor on the island that a group of businessmen took up a collection to send the then 17 year-old Hamilton to New York for college. Disc one is the more jovial of the pair, chronicling Hamilton’s rise to prominence, and flexing a number of smile-inducing touchtones. Over beatboxing and a drum breakdown replicating hands banging on a lunch table, we get introduced to eventual Hamilton murderer, Aaron Burr. ""My Shot"" is Miranda spouting couplets in a manner a little too close to slam poetry for anyone’s good, but a number introducing ""The Schuyler Sisters"", (one of whom Hamilton would marry and another of whom he’d keep a suspiciously affectionate pen pal correspondence with) sounds like it could have been a last-second album exclusion for one hit wonder and infamous Wyclef protégés, City High. ""Wait For It"" moves with a dancehall lilt and ""The Ten Duel Commandments"" pays homage to the Notorious B.I.G.’s ""10 Crack Commandments"". Disc two is Hamilton’s unraveling, covering, among other things, his affair with one Maria Reynolds and the very public fallout that followed and the death of his 19-year old son in a duel defending his father’s honor. Musically, there are direct allusions to LL Cool J and Mobb Deep (""I’m only 19 but my mind is older,"" Phillip Hamilton spouts on ""Blow Us All Away"", a near-quote of ""Shook Ones Pt. II"") and an a capella verse from Miranda on the second-to-last track ""The World Was Wide Enough"" is thoroughly reminiscent of the prayers that used to close out DMX albums. The Hamilton cast recording was executive produced by Black Thought and ?uestlove of the Roots, who know maybe better than anyone the intricacies of presenting hip hop over live instrumentation successfully. These are, however, still very much showtunes. An audience for musical theater comes to hear a story first and foremost (they bury the backing musicians in a pit, for goodness sakes) and the songs of Hamilton work to that end with every bar, even when seamlessly formatted for storyline, as in the case of the show’s freestyle battles by way of cabinet debates. As an educational tool, Hamilton is a new standard, a piece that will very likely do more to cement Hamilton’s legacy into the consciousness of the general public than any history class ever could. Kaplan would be wise to commission volumes of these kinds of hip hop-driven biographies from Miranda and force him into some kind of lifetime contract. As an album, however, the audio removed from visual context, it’s a lot to digest. It’s 46 songs of verbose, intricately delivered raps, spun from a story with enough character to have already made it a New York Times best-seller. There’s a lot of ground to cover regardless of medium. The closest thing to it in popular rap in recent memory would be Kendrick Lamar’s Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City. Just like Hamilton, GKMC is an album that requires time and attention, and rewards that investment handsomely. Hamilton, though, is an album for a very specific audience. It’s for theater lovers, sure, but more generally for people who probably wish they were watching a production of Hamilton. There’s an argument to be made that GKMC’s songs, too, work best within the context of the entire album, as a holistic production to be devoured whole hog. But many of those songs are able to live on their own as great radio singles in a way Miranda’s songs never could. For Hamilton there is no such debate. You need the whole of it, from curtain rise to call.","The popular rapped musical Hamilton tells the story of the United States founding father Alexander Hamilton. Executive produced by the Roots' Black Thought and ?uestlove, the 46 songs, here split across two discs, show an impressive command of both showtunes and golden-era hip-hop.

La Di Da Di,Battles,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b15dea9e61561daa677f/1:1/w_160/cd9c09c1.jpg,2015-10-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21140-la-di-da-di/,Warp,"Battles’ third album, La Di Da Di, feels like a return to something elemental and specific in the band’s history. It is satisfyingly clean, echoing the bright, shiny flatness of the current digital landscape. It’s as basic as these guys can get, which all said, isn't especially basic: The music feels like a highly-saturated, highly-composed Takashi Murakami print, or a website that needed a lot of programming to make it look as minimal and usable as possible (not for nothing are there songs here called ""Dot Com"" and ""Dot Net""). They could’ve easily gone in a different direction. After a series of early EPs, Battles had their breakout with their 2007 debut LP, Mirrored, a collection bolstered by the single, ""Atlas"", a propulsive track featuring the sped-up, processed vocals of Tyondai Braxton: part man, part machine, part Saturday morning cartoon. It was bouncy, energetic, instantly memorable, and had an appropriately shiny, cathartic video that found the group performing the song in a glossy, glassy cube. It also meant they had a de facto ""frontman."" But Braxton left while Battles were recording the followup, 2011’s Gloss Drop. As a result, the remaining members invited a few guest vocalists to contribute: Gary Numan, Kazu Makino, the Boredoms' Yamantaka Eye. The biggest song was the sunny, poppy ""Ice Cream"", which featured vocals from Chilean producer Matias Aguayo. It didn’t necessarily sound like Battles, but like ""Atlas"", it had a great, sexy video and got a lot of traction. Expanding the number of knob turners, Gloss Drop was followed by a remix collection, Dross Glop, that included reworkings by Kode9, Shabazz Palaces, Gang Gang Dance, the Field, Hudson Mohawke, and others. That’s a lot of cooks, for sure, and when your core group features players like heavy-hitting drummer John Stanier (Helmet, Tomahawk), virtuosic guitarist/keyboardist Ian Williams (Don Caballero, Storm & Stress), and bassist/guitarist Dave Konopka, vocals and additional hands aren’t necessary. These are expressive, inventive players who know how to compose and execute in interesting, affecting ways. They can basically ""talk"" through their instruments, and it was a good move to strip things back on La Di Da Di, a vocal-free collection heavy on repetition. You might think of Trans Am, Factory Floor, or Zombi, but it’s squarely Battles. The various vocalists on Gloss Drop gave that collection a kind of chaotic or ""various artists"" feel—here there’s a solidity and feeling of forward motion. It’s at its best early, especially on the almost-7-minute opener, ""Yabba"", which starts with a wash of colorful feedback before moving into a tight pulse of keyboards that sound like guitars, guitars that sound like keyboards, and rumbling drums and bells. (This is echoed in the final song of the collection, ""Luu Le"", which feels like a deconstruction of what came before it.) La Di Da Di succeeds when you’re on the edge of your seat. It’s less successful, mostly in the middle and toward the end, when things start to come off a bit like playful incidental ambient bits or post-rock circus music. The best songs bring to mind super specific images (here were a few of mine: a landscape of yellow parakeets, an HTML version of the Who, a Magic Rock sculpture, ""attack of the Sea Monkeys"", the recent Earth catalogue sped-up and painted neon, a mime dressed in a rainbow-colored unitard), and that’s part of what makes Battles interesting. Things drag here and there, mostly when they move away from hyper speed to mid-tempo, and when Stanier’s drums take a bit of a backseat to the instruments piling up in front and around them. During those moments, Battles sound like too many instrumental acts with chops, and lose what makes them special. At 50 minutes, it's maybe a bit too long: when you're working with coiled energy, you can't afford to lose momentum. That said, when they're in the zone, there's not much like it.","La Di Da Di, a vocal-free collection heavy on repetition, feels like a return to something elemental and specific in Battles' history. It's a satisfyingly clean take on what the band does best after the somewhat chaotic, ""various artists"" feel of 2011's Gloss Drop.

Meow The Jewels,Run the Jewels,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b164ea9e61561daa6786/1:1/w_160/a387535e.jpg,2015-10-02 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21145-meow-the-jewels/,Mass Appeal,"Cats are the Internet's favorite pets for many reasons, not least of which is their endless mystery. By some estimates, felines were first domesticated around 12,000 years ago—and yet, even now, we humans don't fully understand something as simple as their purr. There are theories. A purr can translate to contentment, sure, but it could also indicate hunger, or fright. Most intriguingly, those low rumbles may double as a healing mechanism for cats and people alike: purrs vibrate at frequencies between 20 and 140 hertz, which happens to be ideal for mending bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. If purrs do indeed have such powers, Run the Jewels' new cat-sampling remix album could very well be the most physically restorative record ever made—there are a lot of fucking purring sounds on this thing. Before it became an IRL curio featuring the production talents of everyone from Prince Paul and Dan the Automator, to members of Portishead and Massive Attack, to hip-hop heavies Just Blaze and the Alchemist, Meow the Jewels was merely another LOLcat goof. In the runup to last year's Run the Jewels 2, El-P and Killer Mike decided to have a bit of fun with online feline culture as well as fan-gouging pre-order-package culture by offering to “re-record RTJ2 using nothing but cat sounds for music” for $40,000. Soon enough, modern crowdfunding mentality kicked in and a Kickstarter raised $66,000 to get the idea off the ground. The way in which this project lines up with the duo's paradoxical ethos, where they're able to spit the most cartoonish puff-chest bars alongside deadly serious tales of death and strife, can be observed in a recent El-P tweet: “did we make the silliest, occasionally most grating possible remix album? of course. and we did it for you, mike brown and eric garner.” (All profits made by the album will go to charity.) It's easy, and not wholly inaccurate, to dismiss Meow the Jewels as a well-meaning wisecrack that went several steps too far. Even El-P himself told Deadspin, “I would never even insult the world by saying [the album is] 'good,' but it's certainly the high-water mark for cat-sound records, I think.” So while the way these remixers warp meows, hisses, scratches, yelps, and purrs into passable rap beats is impressive, only a few songs rise above the level of novelty. Part of this has to do with the fact that, you know, this is 42 minutes of rapping over cat sounds, but it's also hard to compete with El-P's original Earth-scorching production, perhaps his finest beatmaking in a career that has spanned two decades. While some tracks unwisely try to replicate the source material's dystopian energy, the best moments come when remixers go blissfully off-script. Portishead's Geoff Barrow empties out the beat of “Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)”, replacing it with a disorienting, subwoofer-shaking purr, a tiny cat-collar bell, and some stray yowling for good measure—it sounds like what “Grindin'”-era Neptunes may have done with this odd opportunity if given the chance. But best-in-show honors goes to frequent Grimes collaborator Blood Diamonds, whose featherlight beat for “All Due Respect” injects some appropriate, non-corny levity into the proceedings, which can otherwise feel weirdly dark. But Meow the Jewels isn't really about music at all; instead, it's a major milestone in cats' slow-but-inevitable climb to the status of Hip-Hop's Favorite Animal. In the '90s, I grew up with Snoop Doggy Dogg (whose grace and ease in life and on record always seemed more cat-like anyway) and DMX espousing canine superiority. It was a particularly masculine—and perhaps, um, overcompensating—pose during an era of unparalleled hip-hop machismo. There was a sociological element to this: The use of snarling pitbulls as a way for underprivileged men to exhibit control while caught in an unjust system of power. But, for DMX at least, the obsession could also get strange and ugly—the rapper has been charged with dozens of counts of animal cruelty since his heyday. This century, as hip-hop continues to grow up and expand its borders, the genre's once-strong walls—between mainstream and underground, masculine and feminine—continue to crumble into dust. Run the Jewels itself is a sterling example of this, a duo that could bury any given meathead rapper with outlandish tough talk while also out-smarting any indie-rap dork with vitriolic politics and heart. Meow the Jewels is the result of what happens when cats are afforded more respect and notoriety (largely thanks to umpteen YouTube videos) as hip-hop's subversive streak is allowed to flourish (largely thanks to umpteen YouTube videos). Paving the way to this moment were fellow rap rebels Lil B—the form's most committed rule-breaker—and his adopted tabby cat KeKe, who released a wild, purr-sampling track three years ago; Danny Brown and his beloved bengal Siren; and Tyler, the Creator's tendency to put cat heads on every shirt he can sell. Cats are fascinating in part because of their autonomy: They will most certainly lie down, but not on your command. This is the same independent spirit we desire in our artists. The European philosopher Albert Schweitzer once said, “There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.” It's high time hip-hop figured this out, too.","The European philosopher Albert Schweitzer once said, ""There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.""

The Light In You,Mercury Rev,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04a5e6ef95969321f4a/1:1/w_160/29de873b.jpg,2015-10-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20975-the-light-in-you/,Bella Union,"It’s been seven years since Mercury Rev's last album, and even by this long-suffering band’s standards, the ensuing period was tumultuous. When we last heard from them, they seemed to be tentatively stepping away from their Catskills-scaled orchestro-rock on 2008’s Snowflake Midnight and its ambient companion piece Strange Attractors. And more recently, they revisited their avant-garde film-school roots, performing live improvized soundtracks to screenings as the Cinematic Sound Tettix BrainWave Concerto Experiment. But given the recent upheaval in Donahue and Mackowiak’s personal lives, The Light on You finds Mercury Rev taking comfort in the familiar. The band spent much of 2011’s touring behind a deluxe reissue of Deserter’s Songs, and, in many respects, that campaign continues here. But on The Light In You, the proverbial deserters throw themselves a celebratory homecoming after years in the wilderness. The album charts a gradual, linear journey from darkness to light, with the first half featuring the weightiest, most affecting songs the band has produced since 2001’s (vastly underrated) All Is Dream. For the first time in Mercury Rev history, bassist/producer Dave Fridmann was not involved in the recording, but after 25 years of working with him, Donahue and Mackowiak have a pretty firm grasp on how recreate his seismic sound. So even if the opening ""Queen of Swans"" begins as typically twee Donahue ode to a mythical goddess, its helium-huffing chorus is followed by a rupture that sounds like an orchestra tumbling into a fault line. While that song serves as a reintroduction to Mercury Rev’s symphonic might, they wield it to more devastating effect on ""Amelie"", where mounting string swells accompany a junkie’s plea for forgiveness (""I’ll break the habit/ it’s my last score"") that seems destined to go unanswered; the gorgeous, ELO-esque sweep of ""You’ve Gone With So Little For So Long"" doesn’t gloss over the tale of impoverished hardship couched within. And with the six-minute epic ""Central Park East"", Mercury Rev provide a staggering reminder of what made Deserter’s Songs so captivating: They conjure a sense of intense isolation amid vast, breathtaking vistas. It’s the sort of song that’s intimate enough to let you see the cold breath coming from the mouth of Donahue’s park-prowling protagonist, while expansive enough to conjure the glow of the skyscrapers surrounding him. But The Light in You eventually lets go of urban tensions to revel in the psychedelia of nature. Delivering the sundazed serenades ""Coming Up for Air"" and ""Autumn in the Air"", Donahue sounds like someone who can get a contact high just from watching the leaves fall. On the latter track, he sings, ""I guess this must be what it’s like/ to be in Beatle George’s mind,""  which actually proves to be a relatively subtle namedrop compared to what follows. In what might be the most bizarre turn in this band’s disjointed trajectory, The Light in You*’*s final third sees Mercury Rev refashion themselves as the house band on some alternate-universe ’60s teen dance show, complete with exuberant brass fanfares, sitar accents, and bongo-powered go-go-dancer breakdowns. In their time, Mercury Rev have covered enough oldies-radio standards to fill several jukeboxes, but here Donahue practically turns into a pitchman for a Time-Life box set—on ""Are You Ready,"" he’s getting down to The Rascals and The Pretty Things and episodes of Shindig! and Solid Gold; ""Rainy Day Record"" awkwardly extols the life-changing virtues of listening to misanthropic ’80s post-punk on vinyl in the context of a cheery paisley-soul romp. (Even if you happen to enjoy Jonathan Donahue, rap music, and The Fall, you don’t need to hear Jonathan Donahue rapping about The Fall.) In light of all this band has gone through over the years, it’s understandable that they’d want to let loose, have some fun, and reconnect with the feeling of discovering a favorite band for the first time. But as The Light in You’s dichotomous halves prove, Mercury Rev are much better at being trippy than being groovy.","On their first album in seven years, Mercury Rev chart a gradual, linear journey from darkness to light, with the first half featuring the weightiest, most affecting songs the band has produced since 2001’s (vastly underrated) All Is Dream.

90059,Jay Rock,by: Craig Jenkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b10e13d197565213a57d/1:1/w_160/2980ceef.jpg,2015-10-01 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21094-90059/,Top Dawg,"Top Dawg Entertainment first signed Jay Rock in 2005, in the wake of the Game's The Documentary. At the time, the Dr. Dre-sanctioned multiplatinum album seemed to promise a resurgence for Cali gangsta rap, which might reclaim the throne it abdicated in the mid-'90s after the death of 2Pac. Instead, Game’s Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit connection combusted spectacularly with the record still fresh in stores and L.A.’s stronghold broke, as Snoop became a ward of the Neptunes, Dre tinkered with a third album we’ve only just come to hear this summer, and everyone else fought nobly but ultimately lost footing in the mainstream for good. This was the climate that Jay Rock found himself facing when he geared up to release his debut studio album Follow Me Home*.* The album's singles stalled, its release date languished, and it only saw release in 2011, when it sounded like a formalist relic amid the then-just-emerging DJ Mustard, YG, Ty Dolla $ign and Tyga. It stalled at retail, quietly matched for sales (but surpassed in acclaim) by Kendrick Lamar’s insular, world-weary Section.80, released the same month. Four years later, Kendrick is the sun around which more than just TDE revolves: his gold and platinum successes have bushwhacked a space for young poetic everymen to coexist at radio. Jay Rock might not ever be top dog at his label again, but the lessons of his first failure to launch – that a magnetic persona and perspective outstrip shiny celebrity cosigns and cookie cutter image constructs every time – are crucial to the success of the TDE machine. Jay Rock’s taken the message to heart on his sophomore album 90059, which dramatically shifts the focus of his studio work from making him look tough and cool to illuminating the human struggles beneath. good kid, m.A.A.d city’s “Money Trees” introduce a lot of listeners unfamiliar with Jay Rock’s history to his talents, so it’s fitting that the pre-album single to 90059 is a sequel: ""Money Trees Deuce."" The song is an excellent point of entry into the new album’s mood; its panoramic view of West Coast street life is more nuanced than old Jay Rock records, and the production freely traverses styles. The jazz rap of “Money Trees Deuce”, Dilla homage of “Fly on the Wall”, post-Dre Cali thump of “Necessary”, Southernplayalistic future soul of “Wanna Ride”, and Shaolin swordplay of “90059” collide, each a little bit of seasoning in this gumbo, as Rock notes on track three. 90059’s expanded palette allows the rapper to stretch out too, and he dazzles with limber diction and stunning, cinematic imagery. Opener “Necessary” unfurls the story of a drunken drive-by in lurid detail: “On Forgiato rim tire, automatics spit fire/ Yack in the black canister, look at this bastard go/ It don’t take much to aim, fingers be snatching souls”. Later, “Telegram (Going Krazy)” uses an almost imperceptible hairpin slight of tongue (“I see the telegram goin’ crazy/ I tell the ‘Gram I’m goin’ crazy”) to trip off the story of a couple drifting apart because one is freer with her emotions on social media than she is in close quarters with her lover. Jay Rock’s concepts are braver and weirder here, his words more arresting and illustrative, but the major reinvention of 90059 is his delivery. On “Easy Bake”, Rock hovers around the high end of his register to counteract Kendrick’s deeper, richer tone. He’s singing a lot now, too, and not in the gruff gangster-on-Easter-Sunday mode of Follow Me Home. The melodic turns on 90059’s “Telegram (Going Krazy)” and “Money Trees Deuce” are unfussed and soulful, while the title track has a drunken Ol’ Dirty Bastard energy  completely unfamiliar to Rock's catalog. The album’s bolder vocal turns are credited to a “Lance Skiiiwalker”, but Lance is about as distinguishable from Rock as T.I. was from T.I.P. or Biggie from bizarro Biggie on “Gimme the Loot.” Cuts like “Gumbo” and “The Ways” juggle all of these tricks to showcase a lyricist gracefully in control of his instrument. It's a heartening showcase, and a reminder of just how much vitality there is in TDE's orbit.","Jay Rock is the member of Top Dawg Entertainment best known for spitting bars on Kendrick Lamar's ""Money Trees"", but his major-label career dates back to 2005. Where his 2011 debut felt like a formalist relic, his sophomore effort is weirder and more daring, with free-ranging production giving Rock space to dazzle with limber diction and stunning, cinematic imagery.

Five Years 1969-1973,David Bowie,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e85e6ef9596932204a/1:1/w_160/f50773ca.jpg,2015-10-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/,Parlophone,"""Not only is this the last show of the tour"", David Bowie announced at London's Hammersmith Odeon on June 3, 1973 by way of introduction to ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"", ""but it is the last show we will ever do."" The recording of that nugget of rock history appears in this box collecting most of Bowie's music from the years of his ascent, so let's take him at his word for a moment. Imagine that Five Years (allegedly the first of a series, though Bowie has always announced many more projects than he's released) was all the documentation there was of his musical career—that he'd entered the public sphere with his 1969 single ""Space Oddity"", retired from the stage after the Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane tour, and vanished to a Tibetan mountaintop following a loving salute to his roots, Pin Ups. He'd certainly be some kind of glam-rock legend, even more than his friend and rival Marc Bolan. He probably wouldn't have the enduring cultural cachet he commands in our world, but there would still be a fervent cult around his three great albums and three iffy-to-good ones, and even more interest in his live recordings and ephemera. To put it differently, Hedwig and the Angry Inch would be the same; LCD Soundsystem wouldn't. In our world, though, Five Years is only a slice of a much longer curve. The earliest album in the box, 1969's *David Bowie—*a.k.a. Space Oddity, a.k.a. *Man of Words/Man of Music—*wasn't Bowie's recorded debut, or even his first self-titled album. (In fact, there could theoretically be a Five Years 1964-1968, tracing his evolution from rock 'n' roll wannabe to fussy vaudevillean, although it would mostly be kind of awful.) It was, however, a follow-up to his first successful single, a haunting novelty record about a lost astronaut that had been released a week and a half before the moon landing. The young singer/acoustic guitarist behind these songs obviously has a mountain of charisma, a gift for hooks, and a taste for the language of experimental science fiction, and not the faintest idea what to do with them most of the time. So he wears his influences on his sleeve (""Letter to Hermione"" is intensely Tim Buckley-ish; ""Memory of a Free Festival"" is a hippie rewrite of ""Hey Jude""), and constantly overreaches for dramatic effect. As it turns out, what he really needed was a good hard rock'n'roll band. Bowie assembled a very short-lived group called the Hype with guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist Tony Visconti; by the time they recorded The Man Who Sold the World in April, 1970, they'd picked up drummer Mick ""Woody"" Woodmansey, and gone back to using their singer's name. The Man Who Sold the World is the dark horse of the Bowie catalog. There were no singles issued from it, and the title track didn't really become a standard until Nirvana covered it decades later. But toughening up the arrangements made Bowie's stagey warble vastly more effective, and a lot of his artistic risks paid off: the album's opener is a ferocious eight-minute metal sci-fi opus, ""The Width of a Circle"", with some of the most overtly homoerotic lyrics a pop musician had ever intoned (""He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips/ And showed me the leather belt 'round his hips""). The theme of shifting sexual identity became the core of Bowie's next album, 1971's scattered but splendid Hunky Dory: ""Gotta make way for the Homo Superior,"" he squeals on the gay-bar singalong ""Oh! You Pretty Things"", simultaneously nodding to Nietzsche and to X-Men. He'd also made huge leaps as a songwriter, and his new songs demonstrated the breadth of his power: the epic Jacques Brel-gone-Dada torch song ""Life on Mars?"" is immediately followed by ""Kooks"", an adorable lullaby for his infant son. The band (with Trevor Bolder replacing Visconti on bass) mostly keeps its power in check—""Changes"" is effectively Bowie explaining his aesthetic to fans of the Carpenters. Still, they cut loose on the album's most brilliant jewel, ""Queen Bitch"", a furiously rocking theatrical miniature (Bowie-the-character-actor has rarely chewed the scenery harder) that out-Velvet Undergrounds the Velvet Underground. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars from 1972 was the record that made Bowie the star he'd been acting like for a while, although its reputation isn't quite the same as its reality. It was mostly recorded before Hunky Dory was released; it purports to be a concept album, but doesn't actually have a coherent concept. (""Starman"", ""Suffragette City"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"" were all late additions to its running order.) It is, nonetheless, a fantastic set of songs, overflowing with huge riffs and huger personae. ""Five Years"" opens the album with Bowie's grandest sci-fi apocalypse yet, Mick Ronson shreds his way to the guitar pantheon, and the band's flamboyant performance of ""Starman"" on Top of the Pops famously gave the next generation of British pop musicians a bunch of funny tingling sensations. The whole album, in fact, is as erotically charged as an orgone accumulator: Bowie was probably the only person who could have remained sexually ambiguous after declaring ""I'm gay, and always have been."" Aladdin Sane, recorded while Bowie and the Spiders were touring their asses off in an attempt to get America to love them the way England already did, is effectively Ziggy Stardust II, a harder-rocking if less original variation on the hit album. There's a paranoid sci-fi scenario (""Panic in Detroit""), a blues-rock stomp (""The Jean Genie""), a bit of cabaret (""Time""), a blunt sex-and-drugs nightmare (""Cracked Actor""). The big difference is that where Ziggy ended with a vision of outreach to the front row (""Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful!""), Aladdin is all alienation and self-conscious artifice, parodic gestures of intimacy directed to the theater balcony. Bowie overenunciates his cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" to turn it into a caricature of a disinterested Casanova; his sneering rocker ""Watch That Man"" is a better evocation of the Stones themselves. Then there's Pin Ups, a quick-and-sloppy covers album that's more interesting in theory than in practice. The repertoire is the songs he'd heard in London clubs when he'd been starting out as a professional musician (less than a decade earlier), and that had shaped his idea of rock: music by the Yardbirds, the Who, the Pretty Things, and the like. (In other words, not so much his idols as contemporaries who found their audience before he did.) But the original versions of every one of those songs are vastly better, because Bowie doesn't have much to say through any of them, and covers up for it through cruise-ship-entertainer oversinging. His art, in those days, was an art of persona, and songs like ""Sorrow"" and ""See Emily Play"" didn't have much to offer it. The band was falling apart, too: the Spiders' drummer Woody Woodmansey had been replaced by Aynsley Dunbar (a veteran of the same London scene), and Ronson and Bolder were gone by the next time Bowie recorded. Bowie released six studio albums in the '69-'73 period, but Five Years is a 12-disc set. The Ziggy film soundtrack, a document of that allegedly final stage performance that was first released a decade later, appears in its expanded, two-disc 2003 form, complete with a 15-minute ""The Width of a Circle"" and unnecessary Jacques Brel and Velvet Underground covers (still no sign of the songs on which Jeff Beck played at that gig, though). Live Santa Monica '72, a radio broadcast that was bootlegged for decades and officially issued in 2008, is included here too. Ziggy Stardust itself appears in both its original mix and co-producer Ken Scott's 2003 remix, which is frankly not all that different. The selling point here for Bowiephiles who probably have all of that stuff already is the two-disc Re:Call 1 (its title cheekily adapts the old RCA Records logo's typeface), a collection of material that only appeared on singles. Some of them are triflingly different mono mixes, but there are a few fascinating oddities: both the never-previously-reissued 1970 dud ""Holy Holy"" and the much sharper 1971 remake that nearly made it onto Ziggy Stardust, both the frequently-reissued 1972 killer ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and the just-as-good 1973 remake that nearly made it onto Aladdin Sane, and a peculiar '71 single (released under the name The Arnold Corns) with larval versions of ""Hang On to Yourself"" and ""Moonage Daydream"", both of which were heavily rewritten for Ziggy. Still, Re:Call 1 is far from a complete collection of the officially issued recordings that Bowie made in the 1969-1973 era: there's no ""Sweet Head"" or ""Lightning Frightening"" or ""Bombers"", for instance, and it'd have been nice to include the version of ""The Supermen"" that he re-recorded in 1971 with the Spiders from Mars' classic lineup. Five Years doesn't really reconsider or recontextualize Bowie's first classic period—that was more the job of EMI's Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane reissues a decade ago, and their 2009 Space Oddity reissue. (The book included with the new set features producers' notes from Tony Visconti and Ken Scott, contemporary reviews of the albums and the final Ziggy show, and reproductions of ads, but nothing especially revelatory.) It's just a collection of some superb records, and some less good ones, from an interesting era of a major artist. If those five years had been all we'd gotten of Bowie, this would be an essential artifact. But they weren't, and the wonders that followed them make the scope of this box seem both over-inclusive and incomplete.","Five Years is an exhaustive 12-disc set covering a significant period in Bowie's development, from his proper debut through 1973's Pin Ups. Included among some classic albums are live sets, singles, and alternate mixes.

Big Grams,Big Grams,by: Jay Balfour,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b123ea9e61561daa672f/1:1/w_160/ae30db52.jpg,2015-10-01 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21166-big-grams/,Epic,"As a solo rapper, Big Boi has been pushing steadily against the old preconception that he was the less-daring half of Outkast. On all three of his solo albums—Speakerboxxx counts— he happily explored his quirks, establishing himself as someone more than just Andre 3000's more stolid counterpart. With Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty,  he pulled off an incredible, boisterously funky reintroduction. Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors paired him with Wavves, Little Dragon and Phantogram among others, and if the results were mixed, it was further evidence of Antwan Patton's voracious ear. Vicious Lies paved the way for this full Phantogram collaboration. The indie-pop duo featured on three of the songs on Vicious, but on Big Grams they hit a bit more of a stride. This isn't a Big Boi-on-Phantogram beats project, and Phantogram's Sarah Barthel is nearly as central as the OutKast rapper as a lead vocalist. The two trade spots as lead vocalists playfully and Barthel's hooks are integral throughout. Barthel tries some rapping, and the results aren't actively embarrassing. ""Run for Your Life"", the lead track, is sparse and spacey, and the synth sounds lifted from Stevie Wonder's Moog on ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"". Big Boi's raps aren't deep on Big Grams, but they are captivating: His strategically fluttering drawl, doled out in pitter-patter bursts, is a trademark as recognizable as it is versatile. On ""Fell in the Sun"" he punches quickly with a staccato: ""I whip the yellow Cadillac, I like my seats way back / I bust the sunroof open, beams hit the Braves cap.""  This track, the lead single, is the obvious standout, and it's here that the collaboration clicks fully. Phantogram's Josh Carter builds up a throbbing wall of synths atop a snappy drum loop, and like elsewhere, horn stabs punctuates: proof, perhaps, that everything Big Boi does deserves a little funk. ""Put It On Her"" is one of two tracks on the outing not produced by Carter, and it's certainly the better and more natural of them. (That soulful pump fake of an intro turns out to be a subtle 9th Wonder calling card.) The Skrillex-featuring ""Drum Machine"", however, sticks out like a sore thumb and bogs down the end of the album. For a record that's so smoothly collaborative elsewhere, ""Drum Machine"" sounds contrived and clunky. Luckily it is tacked on the end, making it entirely skippable. The Run the Jewels feature on ""Born to Shine"" fares better, and not just because of Big Boi's pivotal role in Killer Mike's career. Mike's verse steals the show—""Ric Flair'in' / Long fur coat wearin' / Rolex rockin' / Silk shirt wearin'""—while Big Boi happily takes a backseat. This may be a hallmark of Patton's career:  He's continually building up evidence that he doesn't care so much about being the lead as he is interested in being in the middle of something new and different. Given Atlanta's persistent vitality as a hotbed for innovative hip-hop, it's nice to know that one of the city's elder statesmen is off doing his own thing, carving out another little path for himself long after he helped pave the main road.","Big Grams is a collaboration between Big Boi of Outkast and the indie-pop duo Phantogram. The two worked together on Big Boi's last solo record, and the project is further evidence that Big Boi doesn’t care so much about being the lead as he is interested in being in the middle of something new and different.

New Bermuda,Deafheaven,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0825e6ef95969321fa1/1:1/w_160/d5ac1316.png,2015-10-01 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21022-new-bermuda/,Anti-,"Nothing about the band Deafheaven makes literal sense, starting with their place in the world. They are a black metal-ish band, but black metal fans either hate them or engage in constant, spirited discussions about why they don't. Their breakout, 2013’s Sunbather, took basic notions about black metal and shoegaze from their first album Roads to Judah and airlifted them into a rarefied emotional realm where track lengths dissolved into the whole along with straightforward interpretations: George Clarke’s lyrics compressed earthbound experiences—depression, material envy, struggles for purpose— into wild, leaping abstractions about love, oceans of light, tears. This was music that yearned palpably to leap across distances, closing gaps like a firing synapse. New Bermuda, if anything, is more overwhelming than Sunbather. The roiling peaks of that album—say, “Dreamhouse” or ""The Pecan Tree”—are the resting temperature of this one. They have shaped a suite of songs into one pliable and massive 47-minute arc, one that is as easy to separate into distinct quadrants as the stream from a fire hydrant. Clarke still screams euphoniously, leaning into long vowel sounds and open tones so that phrases like “on the smokey tin it melts again and again” function as color more than as thought. (You could never discern the words without the aid of a lyric sheet, anyway.) They are a band that works best in colors, as the titles of the albums and the salmon color of Sunbather’s cover attest: On New Bermuda, they revisit an ecstatic sound world that resembles, as Clarke puts it on opening song “Brought to the Water”, “a multiverse of fuchsia and light.” Having discovered this multiverse, New Bermuda finds them shaping it. The album is shorter and more compressed than Sunbather, and doesn’t telescope into “loud” and “quiet” sections quite as clearly. There is still a nauseous sort of beauty to their chord voicings: the lurches into minor key on “Luna” feel as heavy as their swings back into major, like the motion of a great, creaking iron gate. The second half of the “fuchsia and light” lyric is ""surrenders to blackness now,” and if Deafheaven’s music at its best represents a brilliant collision of beauty and despair, the battle feels pitched at higher stakes than it did on Sunbather. Clarke’s voice is sharper and mixed lower, clawing at the smooth walls of the music like something wretched trying to escape a pit. The lyrics suggest that this confining space might resemble the sort of manicured suburban prison that Sunbather was set inside: ""There is no ocean for me. There is no glamour. Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt. I gaze at it from the oven of my home. Confined to a house that never remains clean,” runs a passage from “Luna”. But listening to Deafheaven, you don’t feel the particulars of this dilemma any more than you notice the pebbles of a gravel driveway from the window of an airplane. The music acts as an incinerator for any malaise you bring to it. It is a warm blur of noise, and fans of many different kinds of moody sensual guitar musics can close their eyes and place themselves inside it: If you have at any point worn a Deftones, Cure, My Bloody Valentine, or an Explosions in the Sky t-shirt, there is room for you inside here. But Deafheaven reach further and further on this album: The drowsily sliding guitars on the long coda to “Come Back” conjure the easy warmth of Built to Spill. An organ wells up as the guitars fade, like something Ira Kaplan would do on a Yo La Tengo record. The thick palm-muted chugging on the beginning of “Luna” is reminiscent of the Slayer of Seasons of the Abyss. The undistorted downstrokes on “Gifts for the Earth” are a visitation from Joy Division, while the flagrant wah-pedal abusing guitar solo on “Baby Blue” is pure Load-era Kirk Hammett. All of these references, which bring together many bands that wouldn’t normally have much to do with one another, points to something dreamlike and uncanny in Deafheaven’s grand sound. At a moment when guitar-centric music feels less central to the conversation, and great indie-rock bands have retreated into hardy local scenes, Deafheaven play like a beautiful, abstracted dream of guitar music's transportive power. The year's most jolting guitar-centered rock records have reimagined the guitar's place in the constellation slightly—on Tame Impala’s Currents, the guitar glimmers distantly at us from beneath a glass, darkly—a distant shape moving beneath the larger, more legible shapes of the compressed drums and programmed synths. On Kurt Vile’s b’lieve i’m going down, it is part of a general out-of-time way of life, a devotion to anachronism and lived-in symbols that keeps the confusion of the outside world at bay. Deafheaven, meanwhile, unabashedly treat the roar of electric guitars as a holy experience. But they have earned their sense of awe, and you can see audiences returning it tenfold in their live performances. The transcendence their music gazes towards has a long spiritual lineage. To wit: I pulled my earbuds out while listening to New Bermuda this morning in a store where Boston's ""More Than A Feeling"" was playing. The transition was seamless. They were aiming at the same horizon spot, made for the moment when you begin dreaming.","Showcasing a brilliant collision of beauty and despair, Deafheaven’s new album, New Bermuda, is even more overwhelming than their 2013 breakthrough, Sunbather. The group has shaped a suite of songs into one pliable, massive, and ecstatic 47-minute arc, one where they unabashedly treat the roar of electric guitars as a holy experience.

After,Doe Paoro,by: Joel Oliphint,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e7ea9e61561daa66c3/1:1/w_160/fb129161.png,2015-09-30 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21065-after/,Anti-,"It was bound to happen. As more and more bands in the extended Bon Iver family have made use of Justin Vernon’s April Base studio in the tiny village of Fall Creek, Wis., the location and the sensibilities of the musicians who overlap on these releases (and sleep there in bunk beds while recording) have begun to create a distinct sound. April Base seems like a place you’d find locally made art on the walls, Bruce Hornsby on the turntable, and half-eaten bags of trail mix on the counters. In the same way Matthew E. White's Spacebomb house band stamps its records with vintage-horn-section grandiosity, April Base recordings tend to have a liquid, woodsy aura like the one Vernon debuted on Bon Iver in 2011. Enter Doe Paoro, who turned heads with her smoky, soulful voice on 2012 debut Slow to Love, which she wrote on a Vernon-esque cabin retreat outside Syracuse, N.Y. Though she didn’t know Vernon, when it came time to record a new batch of songs, she reached out to him, and he ended up producing her single ""The Wind"" and also introduced her to the production team of S. Carey and BJ Burton, who has produced, engineered, or mixed several others in the extended family (Carey, Volcano Choir, Colin Stetson, Megafaun). Burton, who also produced Low’s recent Ones and Sixes in Wisconsin, wisely realized it wouldn’t make sense to give Low the heavy duty cycle of April Base’s sonic wash, which can be dialed up (Repave) or down (Range of Light). For After, Doe Paoro gets the full-on Wilson Phillips-in-the-woods treatment. It fits her just right. A lot of the conversation surrounding Paoro (real name Sonia Kreitzer) has focused on her time in Tibet and her study of Lhamo, an ancient form of Tibetan folk opera. But rather than a direct influence on her sound, Lhamo seems to represent one of the many ways Doe experiments with form. On After, she’s not tied to a specific song structure or genre just as she’s not easily described by one type of vocal tradition. Vintage and modern R&B, soul, Fiona Apple, and '80s synth-pop all commingle. When Paoro originally released ""Traveling"", it was a minimalist performance video with just Paoro on vocals and Guy Blakeslee of the Entrance Band on guitar, but on After, the guitar is subbed for coughing woodwinds, muted synths, and processed keys. ""Silence can be so loud, it’s abrasive,"" she sings, countering any preconceived, romantic notion of isolation. Holing up in a cabin can block out the din of humanity, but that withdrawal can also amplify your own thoughts, making them louder than you ever imagined. ""I wanted solitude and that’s what I got/ Now I’m a living island with only one thought: Maybe I was wrong,"" she sings as organ and the April Base horn section swell and those ""In the Air Tonight"" drums kick in. Either version of ""Traveling"" is a winner, and that malleability makes Doe Paoro something special. While there’s a familiarity to the production of Carey and Burton, the backdrops they create for Paoro are experimental and filled with surprises. Drums disappear as quickly as they appear. Pulsing bass drives ""Nostalgia"", while the patiently paced ""Outlines"" finds Paoro alone with a piano, pausing between bluesy phrases and relishing her chance to take center stage as a damaged but defiant torch singer. As much as the producers and collection of studio musicians imprint After, their influence wouldn’t allow just any songwriter to shine. Paoro, alongside co-writers like Peter Morén and Adam Rhodes, uses the album to reckon with loss and all of its implications, especially as it relates to time—knowing that you’re knee-deep in the aftermath, but not yet on the precipice of something else. The future is a bunch of white space, neither something to get excited about nor dread. So what do you do with the present? Well, for one, you don’t dwell on the past. ""Nostalgia is killing us,"" Paoro sings. And on ""Hypotheticals"", she realizes questions like ""What’s fair?"" aren’t even worth answering. ""I won’t indulge in hypotheticals,"" she spits out in a blast, turning something that could be a tossed-off sound bite from an Aaron Sorkin drama into a charged, anthemic refusal to let someone else change her story. Making peace with something as painful as loss is a messy task. After is a confident, beautiful, clear-eyed testament to that mess.","An album about and of solitude may not seem like an appealing listen, but Doe Paoro comes through the other side strong and clear. Recorded at Bon Iver's April Base studio, she soaks up the sound inherent in that space, while more than capably carving one of her own.

Innocence & Decadence,Graveyard,by: J. Edward Keyes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff75e6ef95969321ec0/1:1/w_160/cd0ec123.jpg,2015-09-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20914-innocence-decadence/,Nuclear Blast,"Though they’ve netted comparisons to everyone from Black Sabbath to Thin Lizzy, if there is an analog in the history of hard rock to the Swedish group Graveyard, it is probably Judas Priest. Both bands have roots in blues, both have a fondness for topping caramel-sweet melodies with gravel and tacks, and both know precisely how to ride the edge of bombast and camp without ever becoming the Darkness. On their fourth album, Graveyard root around even deeper in their record collections. In the kind of quote that becomes instantly regrettable, frontman Joakim Nilsson once said that he wanted the band to be a mix of Slayer and Howlin’ Wolf, but on Innocence & Decadence, they also find room for Motown, Dylan, and Queen. What makes the record work is the way they synthesize all of this into something that is swell-chested, triumphant, and surprisingly human, dosing each song with equal amounts of swagger and charm. In a genre that often prides itself on being forbidding, Innocence is a proudly welcoming metal record, throwing open its tattooed arms and carrying off even the darker material with a wink and a smile. That all-in m.o. is evident from the outset. Opener ""Magnetic Shunk"" rides in on a deep-set, galloping blues groove, Nilsson’s eye on a woman at the far end of the bar. Instead of shaming or objectifying her for her sexual experience, Nilsson celebrates it—""It’s nobody’s business who you give your kiss""—before devising an almost comically ridiculous come-on: ""No need to be gentle, baby, I like it raw/ Treat me like I was crime and you are the law."" That kind of loopy wordplay turns up throughout Innocence; on ""The Apple & the Tree"", whose wandering guitar lead sounds like a distant cousin to ""All Along the Watchtower"", Nilsson opens singing, ""I remember the days I don’t recall."" Before the absurdity of the line can be fully absorbed, he’s skated clean into the song’s slow-winding chorus (the lyrics of which suggest the title’s apple might be the same one that turned up in Genesis Chapter 2). The hard-charging ""Never Theirs to Sell"" is a lean, mean-eyed, fist-pumping anthem of defiance, opening into a double-time, soul-clap break about halfway through that imagines Angus Young sitting in with the MGs. Though the twin themes in the album’s title turn up in most of its songs, it’s the former that gets the most airtime. On the breathless, roller-coastering ""From a Hole in the Wall"", while low-end guitars pummel like rubber bullets, bassist Truls Morck sings, ""Can you hear a big bird singing somewhere in the back of your mind?/ It’s loud enough to make you wonder/ ‘Can I please hear it one more time?’"" Lines like this contribute to the album’s odd sense of sweetness—youth isn’t fetishized as a period of penalty-free rule-breaking, but considered wistfully, as a time of almost ceramic cleanness, before things like pain and disappointment became everyday occurrences. That same sentiment is given flesh, blood, and a broken heart in the straight-up soul ballad ""Too Much Is Not Enough"", which wouldn’t sound entirely out of place on an Amy Winehouse B-sides comp. Over a wood-fired blues lick, Nilsson mournfully watches a longtime lover walk out the door, before concluding, ""I know you tried to keep us together/ But in the end, there was nothing left to keep."" The gospel trio that parenthesize his verses provides the necessary dramatic flourish. Innocence was recorded at Atlantis Grammofon Studios in Stockholm, which is the same place ABBA recorded their earliest material. While it’s not quite the same deep-dive into confectionary pop, Innocence shares both that group’s fondness for immediate melodies and their egalitarian spirit. Theirs is a club where you might get lucky, you might burn the night philosophizing, or you might reconnect with old friends. Best of all, it has a decidedly low barrier of entry: If you’ve ever nursed a drink while thinking misty-eyed about the good old days, you’re in.","The Swedish band Graveyard's Innocence & Decadence is a proudly welcoming metal record.

Collapse,Drew McDowall,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f6c0084474cd0c1d35/1:1/w_160/ccbcdc58.jpg,2015-09-30 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21077-collapse/,Dais Records,"Like anyone involved in the intricate network of bands that sprang from Throbbing Gristle, Drew McDowall has contributed to a number of projects over the past few decades. He’s most notable for his tenure in Psychic TV in the '80s and Coil in the '90s, during which time he honed his craft as a manipulator of synthesizers, samples, and esoteric sounds. One thing he’s never done, though, is release a solo album—that is, until now. Collapse is McDowall’s debut full-length under his own name, arriving 37 years after the first recorded appearance by the Poems, the Scottish punk band he formed with his then wife, and future Strawberry Switchblade member, Rose McDowall. It’s been a long journey from teen punk to avant-industrial vet, but on Collapse, McDowall sounds anything but spent. The album’s five tracks—instrumental, save for a smatter of vocal samples—tap into the same deep wellspring of ritual, apocalypse, and neopagan awe that fueled Coil, only with a fuller and more focused sense of dread. Nowhere is that as evident as on ""The Chimeric Mesh Withdraws (Parts 1-3)"", the 20-minute triptych that anchors Collapse with an arcane gravitas straight out of McDowall’s greatest achievement with Coil, 1999’s Astral Disaster. But where Astral Disaster folds ambience and emptiness into its spellbinding substance, ""Chimeric Mesh"" wields those elements like hammers. The result is cinematic, insectoid, and foreboding, even as it morphs gently from movement to movement in a fugue of skittering static and fractured blocks of noise. Another through line of McDowall’s work over the years is psychedelia, inasmuch as it intersects with the finer pulverization of industrial. ""Hypnotic Congress"" takes a while to settle into its mesmeric groove, but when it does, its rhythmic cascade of echoing pulses, looped chants, and submarine blips segues into a mind-dissolving wash. There’s a ceremonially circularity to ""Through Is Out"" and ""Each Surface of Night"", each of which phases into a sequence of krautrock-like pings and oscillations by song’s end—McDowall has admitted to being warped at the age of 12 by an impulse purchase of The Faust Tapes—that tensely countermands their eerily organic, almost folk-like undertones. But the most starkly psychedelic stretch of Collapse is ""Convulse"", a staccato salvo of hollowed-out power electronics whose chilling sampled voice—""I convulsed,"" intones a woman, clinically—comes across like a radical dub reworking of Joy Division’s ""She’s Lost Control"", told from the perspective of the song’s subject, and played at the bottom of the ocean. In recent years, McDowall has collaborated with numerous artists, including Tres Warren of Psychic Ills in the blissful drone project Compound Eye. On Collapse, McDowall is joined by Nicky Mao (of Effi Briest and Hiro Kone), who contributes violin, unspecified samples, and splices to the album’s beckoning mix of recursion and unease. In any case, those contributions are seamless; as a whole, the collection comes across as a unified meditation that channels an atmosphere of doom, morbid curiosity, and the perplexing pluralism of modernity. It’s also frequently beautiful, even if that beauty is undermined by a vagueness that might have been more sharply defined by wider dynamics. As a solo statement, though, Collapse is a winner—a field recording of the psyche of an extreme-music journeyman who’s finally started to settle in and harness his own dark voice.","Drew McDowall spent time in Psychic TV in the '80s and Coil in the '90s, during which time he honed his potency as a manipulator of synthesizers, samples, and esoteric sounds.

A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons,Little Simz,by: Jia Tolentino,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12b5e6ef959693220a3/1:1/w_160/fbc6dbdb.jpg,2015-09-30 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21107-a-curious-tale-of-trials-persons/,Age 101,"Little Simz, the rapper from North London born Simbi Ajikawo, is starlike in many ways, including a strict one: having dropped eight mixtapes since 2013, she burns off energy at a colossal, dangerous rate. A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons is Little Simz’s first full-length album, and it marks a change from the catholic, unfurling experiments in her mixtapes. This is a tense, terse concept album: The tracks roll forward in one dark, uniform palette, each providing a different answer to a single line of questioning, as laid out by Simz in the opening track. Technically, she’s phenomenal: She revs up almost off-handedly, like she’s jumping rope, and she seamlessly shifts in and out of her singing voice like Drake. Twinning her meter almost classically, she spits: ""They told her women cannot call themselves kings/ They told her fame isn’t made for everyone."" The album that follows is, in effect, a snarling refutation. She might not be a king, but she is certainly a prince, with cosigns from Kendrick Lamar, A$AP Rocky, and J. Cole, among others. She’s got fame in her crosshairs, and likely the other way around, too, but the defining note of Trials + Persons is one of ambivalence. Simz seems engaged with the naysayers—""This the type of music that ain’t never gonna sell/ Well, you should’ve never ever told me that,"" she repeats, in two separate songs—but her real fight is within herself. At 21, she raps with a shapeshifting hardness and ragged sense of spiritual burden that brings to mind Lauryn Hill, and Kendrick too. Trials + Persons was recorded for free in the London Red Bull studio, and released on Simz' own label, Age 101, a corporate liberation that allowed her to make this 35-minute debut essentially hit one reverberating note. With the bigger producers and broader hooks a label might’ve asked for—even a single bright major chord, just once—Simz, an explosively skilled rapper, could’ve landed straight in the center. But instead, she’s keeping her talent under her own strict control, which means, by one calculus, curbing it. Instead of an album spiked with a big banging single, she offers a looping, obsessively focused experience, with her words providing structure and the pulsing orchestral instrumentation coming second. With a few exceptions, like the unprocessed drums and whining electric guitar on ""Full or Empty"", the album is a fugue state, unbroken and undifferentiated. It’s dark, but not impenetrable; Simz’s charisma keeps it lit in here, like headlights barreling around the corners of a dark room. As a writer, though, Simz is less virtuosic. The album’s language is intelligent but wholly straightforward, rarely witty and almost device-less; Simz always says exactly what she means. She’s an original in stance, then, rather than substance or specifics, turning over her central dilemma from different angles, switching between personas from song to song. In ""Gratitude"", she imagines herself stuck at home with children; in ""Tainted"" (her ""Backseat Freestyle""), she introduces her character and then jumps into a voice of a stone-cold, dead-eyed, alpha bitch. ""God Bless Mary"" is dedicated to her aggrieved neighbor (though it carries that ""Zion""-esque double reading), and it takes palpable effort for Simz to step outside herself; she can conjecture nothing about Mary’s life except the woman’s reaction to this record. In a way, the album feels radically personal: Simz is her own primary subject, and as a result is necessarily exposed. But the soul of the album is abstracted. Other people are totally figural, practically hypothetical. There are almost no specific objects, no physical places, no set decoration whatsoever. It’s just curtains pulling back on a spotlight and Simz wrestling with her ambitions like Jacob with the angel, reaching no conclusions but activating something deep.","At 21, the London rapper Little Simz raps with a shapeshifting hardness and ragged sense of spiritual burden that brings to mind Lauryn Hill and Kendrick Lamar.

Fetty Wap,Fetty Wap,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a6c0084474cd0c1caa/1:1/w_160/07b9e75d.jpg,2015-09-30 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21043-fetty-wap/,300,"It's hard not to root for Fetty Wap, the rapper whose irrepressible 2014 single ""Trap Queen"" went from Tri-State SoundCloud sensation to this year's late-pass song of the summer. The 24-year-old, born Willie Maxwell, is unshakably positive, turning a prominent disability (he lost his eye to glaucoma as a child) into a proud calling card that's already inspired a 10-year old to venture out into the world without his own prosthetic eye. He's from Paterson, N.J., a place we would almost certainly not be talking about were it not for Fetty Wap; he's fiercely loyal to his longtime Remy Boyz 1738 crew, including perennial sidekick Monty, a rapper we would assuredly not be talking about were it not for Fetty Wap. He's almost singlehandedly revived the ride-or-die thug love ballad with a serotonin-soaked ditty—now double-platinum—that turns a negative situation (having to cook dope to make a living) into not just an unforgettable date but a symbolic proclamation of undying, committed love. And though he's no longer in a relationship with ""Trap Queen""'s muse, he's currently paying her college tuition as a thank-you. If there's any hurdle in Fetty's way at this point, it's his nagging reputation as a one-and-done singles artist that persists even as he smashes Billboard records. When ""Again"", the album's fourth single, entered the charts in August, he became the only artist in the history of the Hot Rap Songs chart to have his first four singles reach the Top 10 simultaneously. The same week, an article was published: ""Is Fetty Wap Destined To Be Another One-Hit Wonder?"" It's a bizarre dissonance, best understood as such: those four charting singles, addictive as they are, don't do much to break the mold of what we've come to expect from a Fetty Wap song. Which is to say: generous Auto-Tune, exuberant melodies, and a lot of warbled ""Yeaaaaaaaa baby""s and ""1738""s. With Fetty Wap, released through the tech-savvy but still-transitional 300 Entertainment imprint, the rappa-turnt-sanga finally has the platform to show he's more than a singles guy. To that end, he put out a 20-song album with no new friends and no big-name producers—in short, this is the album he probably would have made with his RGF Productions squad in Paterson were there no label involved at all. Those looking for a new direction from Fetty, or who've already mined the depths of his prolific SoundCloud, may find this a letdown. But those who've embraced his loyalty and radical self-love should be delighted: Is there a more quintessentially Fetty Wap move than turning the year's biggest major label rap debut into a self-directed Paterson block party? The first thing you might notice on Fetty Wap's tracklist isn't what's there—if you've kept up with his output over the last year and a half, there's a lot you'll recognize here—but who isn't. Drake's hastily added guest verse to ""My Way"" from earlier this year is missing; the album version features a verse from Remy Boyz' Monty, who appears on nine of the album's 20 tracks, the only guest aside from relatively unknown M80. As a whole, Fetty Wap adopts the same self-assured stance: Fetty's formula definitely ain't broke, and he doesn't seem in a hurry to fix it. In what can only be described as a flex, he opens the album with ""Trap Queen"", a seemingly audacious move he knows full well he can back up. Why coyly tease out your first and biggest hit when you've got 19 more just like it? That's the thing: you could shuffle these tracks endlessly and the album would probably have the same effect. It's not that there are any missteps here, really; if you like what you've already heard from Fetty, you'll like these songs. There are variations, to be sure—second single ""679"" borrows some West Coast bounce, functioning as a clubby palate cleanser in the way that ""Fight Night"" did for Migos. ""I Wonder"" and ""Boomin"" successfully skulk into drill's shadowy corners. But for the most part, Fetty doesn't venture too far outside his comfort zone. Still, when the highs are this high, it's hard to complain. ""My Way"" is still 2015's ultimate trap lullaby, lilting in hypnotic spirals. ""RGF Island"" turns somber keys into a hard-earned celebration, and ""I'm Straight"" dials the exuberance further up with triumphant steel drums. And though he's a much more natural singer, ""Again"" is Fetty's best rap performance. ""I'm tryna finish who I started with/ I'm tryna spend it all who I got it with,"" he crows, reassuring his fed-up trap queen that his crazy life will all be worth it when they can enjoy it together. Fetty approaches everything in his music with the earnest devotion of matrimony: his trap queen, his money, his beloved Remy Boyz. So though it's tempting to wonder what may have happened had 300 recruited labelmates Young Thug or Quavo, or beatmakers du jour like Metro Boomin or Zaytoven, it's only right Fetty insisted on keeping things in the 1738 family.","With his self-titled debut, the rapper behind the smash hit ""Trap Queen"" has the platform to show he's more than a singles guy. Fetty Wap is light on guests and superstar producers and, for the most part, Fetty doesn't venture too far outside his comfort zone. But that turns out to be a good thing.

Unremembered,Sarah Kirkland Snider,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afaa5e6ef95969321e3c/1:1/w_160/5c37c29d.jpg,2015-09-29 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20854-unremembered/,New Amsterdam,"Released five years ago, Sarah Kirkland Snider's Penelope cemented her as one of the decade’s more gifted, up-and-coming modern classical composers for the voice. Emotionally fraught and cloudy, the words used an amnesiac soldier’s past as a lens to explore memory and mortality over muted explosions of electronics and a weighty, restless orchestra. Her new group of songs, Unremembered, is more restrained than Penelope, but no less haunting. Like Penelope, Unremembered features Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond on vocals. This time, Asthmatic Kitty vet DM Stith and Clogs’ Padma Newsome join her, while the ensemble is a collection of all-star new music players from ICE and So Percussion. Its vague stories are set in shadowy old houses, endless meadows, sinister thickets and forests lost souls enter to never emerge from. Snider’s multiple narrators spiral deep into dark memories of these places. The libretto comes from the poet Nathaniel Bellows, who takes his formal cues from 20th century imagists like Emily Dickinson and William Wordsworth, describing gothic New England vistas. The foreboding and chaotic tenor of the music mirrors the fear and horror of the characters: Ghosts are ever-present, evoked by the constant surges of soupy, heavily reverbed background vocals that rise and fall behind each song’s primary narrator—either Worden, Stith, or both. Often, these anonymous voices assume a role in the story: In the pastoral ""The Song"", they are echoing bird calls, but on the more macabre ""The Estate"", they become taunting spirits (""The field has breath, the pond a voice...They told me then to leave this place/ Or stay and lose it all""). Eventually, they become buried underneath Snider’s mournful, kinetic instrumental figures (glissandi-punctuated violin lines, chimes, harp, or Snider’s own celeste), which sometimes recall the work of Snider’s former teacher, David Lang, and at more tuneful moments, Max Richter. Most songs build to booming climaxes, that dissipate along with the ""vapor of the dead"" at the end of each song. The record is best when Snider’s music captures both the beauty and foreboding of Bellows’ setting at once; in restrained pieces like ""The Orchard"" and ""The Past"", she lets subversive dissonance creep slowly into her simple accompaniments. Many of Bellows' poems feature images of mirroring, water, and hazy vantages of landscapes or spirits, and Snider’s musical landscape complements this with a rippling, echoing quality. Her melodic shapes are as vague as the scenes she is describing: It is intelligent and evocative, but it takes a focused listen, and is best enjoyed with Bellows’ words on hand for reference. His poetry interacts closely with the musical pivots. Unremembered definitely lacks the haute tension and the fierce musical contrasts of Penelope, but there are plenty of pleasurably uncanny moments. Even in these more contemplative scenarios, Snider still keeps visceral emotion on the surface of her music.","Sarah Kirkland Snider's Penelope cemented her as one of the decade’s most gifted up-and-coming modern classical composers*.* Her new group of songs, Unremembered, is more restrained than Penelope, but no less haunting.

A Gathering Together,Ron Morelli,by: Louis Pattison,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0eb5e6ef95969322052/1:1/w_160/f725c7de.jpg,2015-09-29 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21068-a-gathering-together/,Hospital Productions,"The phenomenon of noise dudes turning their hands to techno has become a familiar one, but to date there hasn’t been so much in the way of return traffic, and probably little wonder: club music presents access to a world of international travel, plentiful drugs, and beautiful strangers; while the noise life offers lightly attended shows in cold basements and all the Xeroxed fanzines about serial killers you can eat. In short, you have to want it, or more accurately, feel it—and Ron Morelli both wants it, and feels it. Morelli is chiefly known as boss of the New York-born, Paris-based techno imprint L.I.E.S., but A Gathering Together is his fourth release for Hospital Productions, the label run by Prurient/Vatican Shadow man Dominick Fernow. In Fernow, you sense Morelli has found a true bedfellow, one who shares his aesthetic of misanthropy, gutter eroticism, and sonic abrasion. L.I.E.S.’ take on techno is brackish and lo-fi, and Morelli’s 2013 debut for Hospital, Spit, conformed to type: in broad terms, this was a club record, albeit one with torn clothing and dried blood under its fingernails. A Gathering Together is something more uncategorizable and disassembled. There are occasional hallmarks of dance music—a whoosh of sub-bass here, a vandalized vocal line there—but there will be, as Bill Callahan might have it, no dancing. Rhythms recall mechanical or industrial processes, pitched too fast or too slow for physical interaction. ""Desert Ocean"" is a hobbled march of throbbing generator tones and bold horn-like blasts that sound like a tanker lost in thick fog. The sounds of ""New Dialect"" bring to mind a needle puncturing metal, underwater scrapes, and the hiss of compressed gas. ""Voices Rise"" takes a brief vocal sample and suspends it in limbo with a variety of tics, scratches, and twists, while the miasmic drone of ""Cross Waters"" sounds like A Guy Called Gerald’s ""Voodoo Ray"", on fire, being lowered into tar. This oppositional quality leads you to reflect on Morelli’s personal philosophy. ""People are terrible and always have been,"" he told FACT in an interview two years ago, while the accompanying text for A Gathering Together describes the title track as being born from ""rapid-paced dead-end urban environments that force people together."" Perhaps the record’s most vivid, evocative cut, it begins with a disorienting field recording, before we hear what sounds like massed ranks of hands taking up percussion instruments and proceeding to beat out increasingly furious polyrhythms. The message seems plain enough—humanity can be horrifying—but there’s a paradoxical quality to its sense of barely corralled frenzy. If there is fear and disgust here, there is also elation and fascination, too—a recognition of life, even if it feels not so much empathetic as anthropological. Is A Gathering Together a noise record, or not? The mechanistic looping and layering of ""The Story of Those Gone"" suggests Morelli might be familiar with the output of demented industrial recluses such as Maurizio Bianchi or Atrax Morgue. Equally, however, he might not, these being the sort of sounds you might discover given solitude and the right—that is, wrong—mental state. To Morelli’s credit, Gathering feels detailed and textured where it needs to, its shifting layers crisp and detached rather than blitzed into mulch. But Morelli’s negative energy, when robbed of an unrelenting bass drum, can drift toward monotony. The idea that techno is more developed, or evolved, than noise is, of course, a false dichotomy. But take Dominick Fernow: his path from Prurient to Vatican Shadow has felt like a progression, opening up his compositional practice in a way that’s informed his many other projects to date. It’s hard to shake the feeling that Morelli, as he drifts from the dance floor, is taking a reverse path, somehow. Consequently, A Gathering Together is a bold move that falls short of being a landmark. But as an illustration of where Morelli might angle his music and label next—not to mention his readiness to confuse, confound, or destroy in order to explore more personal themes or private fancies—it still illuminates.","Ron Morelli is chiefly known as boss of the techno imprint L.I.E.S., but A Gathering Together is his fourth release for Hospital Productions, the label run by Prurient/Vatican Shadow man Dominick Fernow.

1000 Days,Wand,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b063ea9e61561daa65f8/1:1/w_160/281f4702.png,2015-09-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20995-1000-days/,Drag City,"On their third album, Los Angeles’ Wand gracefully sidestep the potential pitfalls of psychedelic songwriting—meandering guitars, rambling lyrics, directionless tracks. They ground the blurry, bizarre visions established on their previous efforts, Ganglion Reef and Golem, in colorful imagery, so that the faces of the monsters they’ve written about on past records come into full focus. While the shadow of Wand’s mentor Ty Segall still hovers over Wand’s blown-out garage sound, the band’s own flickering light is beginning to shine through more often. They have added some progressive folk rock to the mix, fondly recalling unique and memorable records like Mellow Candle’s Swaddling Songs and Comus’ classic First Utterance without sounding like a carbon copy. Cory Hanson’s voice shimmers  against the acoustic palette of songs like the beautiful closer ""Morning Rainbow"", the song that also contains 1000 Days’ key lyrical thesis: ""We will see this world together in its terror."" Paralysis, paranoia, disappearance, erasure, pure fear, and curdling dreams are all themes that reappear in Hanson’s lyrics for 1000 Days; even the titular song, a concise bit of folky garage pop with a sunny-sweet choral melody, seems like it might be a love song at first but quickly turns into the nightmare of relationship stasis, depression, and ennui (""I don’t need a thing ‘cause I’ve had every dream""). The mingling of beautiful, honeyed melodies with dark, bleak lyrical content is nothing new, but Wand do it especially well, and they have a precision in their songwriting that keeps their music from spinning off into glazed burnout territory. Though one worries that with such a prolific release schedule that Wand will run out of ideas, 1000 Days is a heartening record, a record that sees a young band picking up steam, playing with their influences more deftly than on their prior LPs, and bringing a thoughtful approach to old and well-traveled sounds. There’s enough interesting moments on 1000 Days to hold onto these songs, go back to them, and explore within them. That’s more than many of their cohorts within the cluttered and long-trendy field of psychedelic garage—there are hundreds of disposable tape-label bands with little to say out there, and it’s wearying to search through all that crud for the occasional gem, which does exist—have to offer.","Though the shadow of Wand’s mentor Ty Segall still hovers over Wand’s blown-out garage sound, the band's own flickering light is shining through.

Rub,Peaches,by: Cameron Cook,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b029c0084474cd0c1bcd/1:1/w_160/084bafcd.jpg,2015-09-29 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20950-rub/,I U She,"Back at the turn of the century, Peaches' big and brash ""Fuck the Pain Away"" was a tsunami. Electroclash was at its peak, such as it was, and when the sultry, leering opening line of “sucking on my titties like you wanted me” would spit out of a club PA, crowds of all orientations turned their heads. Sometimes a first impression that arresting can be an albatross, and while Peaches has carved out a substantial career for herself in both the music and art world, the straight press largely moved on.With Rub, Peaches' sixth studio album, she extends and builds upon the body of work she's accumulated in the past 15 years. The overarching themes of Peaches' work—gender identity and expression, queer sex, leftist politics—are now more than ever at the forefront of our culture, which means her lyrics sound less transgressive than they might have even five years ago: ""Can't talk right now/ This chick's dick is in my mouth"" she deadpans on the album's title track. But Peaches has always been able to use her outré, sometimes downright silly, personality to shed light on real issues, like society's patriarchal disgust at the natural state of a woman's body. In the same song, when she sets up a scene of ""circle jerk girls who spray/ we've got a male in the middle and we bukkake"", she may be the only female pop musician working today who sings about sex while firmly and intentionally diverting the objectifying male gaze. While it may not always be pretty or elegant, it's damn necessary, and Rub does an excellent job of it. But is Peaches' music secondary to her politics? Interestingly, the first voice you hear on Rub isn't Peaches', but the distinctive whisper-moan of Kim Gordon. On album opener ""Close Up"", Gordon purrs for Peaches to get closer to the camera as she raps/speaks about her sexual exploits (the song's video features Gordon coaching Peaches through a shit-smearing wrestling match). The track's catchy, powerful bass drum beat threads throughout Rub, which benefits from a driving dance element, much like a sonic sequel to 2009's electro-heavy I Feel Cream. R**ub is the first album in her career where the music feels as foregrounded as Peaches' persona, which makes sense, as she co-produced it with Vice Cooler. Rub's centerpiece is ""Free Drink Ticket"", an altogether strange offering that doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the album. With her voice downpitched to sound more masculine, Peaches delivers an almost stream-of-consciousness diatribe against a pretentious club promoter. It sounds jarringly personal, and lyrically is strikingly different from every other track. It's a misstep that is corrected by ""Dumb Fuck"", the closest thing Rub has to a straightforward pop song (even though it contains about 35 F-bombs). With it's Robyn-esque disco synths and biting lyrics, ""Dumb Fuck"" is a call for feminists everywhere to ditch their boyfriends for Roland MC-505s. ""I Mean Something"", the album's closer and duet with fellow Canadian/frequent collaborator/ex-roommate Feist, sees Peaches defiantly state Rub's most telling line: ""No matter how old, how young, how sick/ I mean something."" Is that a hint of desperation? Aggression? Bravado? Perhaps, realistically, a mixture of all three, both an assertion of Peaches' rightful place in the trenches of the culture wars and an artistic plea for attention.","Peaches may be the only female pop musician working today who sings about sex while firmly and intentionally diverting the objectifying male gaze.

Dodge and Burn,The Dead Weather,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0989d034d5c69bf48c7/1:1/w_160/d3905a06.jpg,2015-09-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21035-dodge-and-burn/,Third Man,"It's entirely possible that when Jack White allegedly threatened to beat up Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney in a New York City bar earlier this month he was doing some street-team marketing for the new Dead Weather record. Because whenever White steps behind the drum kit of this scuzz-rock supergroup, he hits with a crazed intensity that suggests he’s looking to pound a different sort of skin. Since the release of the band’s previous album, 2010’s Sea of Cowards, White has embarked on a solo career that’s seen his work turn both more intimate and extravagant; in this light, the Dead Weather have come to represent the hanging side of beef on which he can unleash his pent-up aggression. Tellingly, White and his mates—Kills vocalist Alison Mosshart, City and Colour bassist Jack Lawrence, and Queens of the Stone Age guitarst/keyboardist Dean Fertita—have announced they have no plans to tour in support of Dodge and Burn. This news would reinforce the notion that this group essentially functions as an exorcism of its members’ most feral tendencies before they return to their day jobs. Theirs is a blues defined not by chord progressions but physical reactions, embodying the music’s storied tradition of howls and moans and demonic possession into a fierce, physical sound. There’s a restlessness to Dodge and Burn, from Mosshart’s seething vocals and Fertita’s spasmodic guitar solos to Lawrence’s corroded basslines to White’s abrupt breakdowns. Even when songs are built around a shopworn sentiment, they’re given a twist: on the opening ""I Feel Love"", Mosshart answers the song’s titular declaration with a withering ""every once in a while."" The Dead Weather’s cabin-in-the-woods creepiness can verge on the contrived—like on ""Three Dollar Hat"", where White makes like a young Isaac Brock taking on Nick Cave’s ""Stagger Lee"", and losing. But the band’s theatricality mostly complements the agitated tone of the songs and the dubby, dread-of-night ambiance of White’s production, particularly in those moments when Mosshart and White go head-to-head. The mid-album knockout ""Rough Detective"" sees the two trading verses and pushing one another to hysterical extremes; instead of dropping the typical guitar solo after the second shout-it-out chorus, the song yields a carnival-like melee of chopped-up chatter and pitch-shifted squeals. And when White asks, ""what’s happening?"", he sounds genuinely spooked by the song’s sudden descent into madness. Like its predecessors, Dodge and Burn can leave you wishing for more interaction between the two leads—the duets are always the highlight of any given Dead Weather record, the moment when all that simmering tension boils over. But Mosshart once again handles the heavy vocal lifting with menace to spare, be it the frisky sing-speak of ""Mile Markers"", the predatory soul stomp of ""Let Me Through"", or the violent mood swings of ""Open Up"", which upends its desolate opening verse with a riff straight off an early Rush record. And given her commitment to staying in character, it’s doubly strange how, in the album’s dying minutes, the Dead Weather completely abandon their monochromatic schematic. Dodge and Burn is capped by the ill-fitting ""Impossible Winner"", a sensitive piano ballad that’s practically Oasis-like in its orchestral ascent (and which, in light of the equally stately ""The Last Goodbye"" from the last Kills record, prods Mosshart further toward her destiny as a torch-song chanteuse). It’d be one thing if there was anything else on this record—or in the band’s entire discography, for that matter—that showed the Dead Weather had any interest in opening up their airtight rock-noir aesthetic. But tacked onto the end of another dependably dank Dead Weather record, the song feels less like a graceful break-of-dawn denouement than the musical equivalent of being awakened in the middle of the night by a flashlight to the face.","The blues-rock supergroup comprised of Jack White, Kills vocalist Alison Mosshart, City and Colour bassist Jack Lawrence, and Queens of the Stone Age's Dean Fertita returns for another exorcism of its members’ most feral tendencies.

It's the biggest look of Anderson’s career so far by a million miles, one that seemingly came from a chance encounter with the iconic producer. According to Mass Appeal, Anderson attended a studio session when his recent song, ""Suede"", caught Dre’s attention. ""He comes in, and I’m just sitting in the room, and I saw him play it over and over again,"" Anderson told the publication. ""At the third time, he was ready to work."" Until now, though, the California singer/producer had achieved marginal success: Following his 2012 debut under the name Breezy Lovejoy, Anderson’s follow-up—Venice—showed his promise as a storyteller, but the album was largely undercooked and whizzed by without much impact. Anderson has released a few singles and projects on Bandcamp, and he’s the vocal half of NxWorries with producer Knxwledge, a prolific composer who landed this great beat on Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly. The Anderson .Paak EP is the artist’s first release since Venice, and it's appearance is timely. Running just four tracks and less than 20 minutes, The Anderson .Paak EP is a quick listen, but it demonstrates Anderson’s talent and charisma. His raspy inflection evokes Bilal’s sensuous tenor and the lyrics explore mostly light fare—blowing weed, the highs of personal freedom (""Drifter II""), the captivating first moments of new love (""Make it Work""). Even when he discusses serious topics, like on the two-part ""Cheap Whiskey.70’s Reisling"", Anderson does so in the smoothest way possible. ""Wish I had a chance to write ya,"" he croons, presumably talking about an absent father figure. ""I wish I didn’t look just like ya."" Produced entirely by Los Angeles/Chicago duo Blended Babies, who have worked with the Cool Kids and Ab-Soul and credit OutKast and Eric Clapton as influences, the music is laidback, spacious funk polished in a bright, psychedelic sheen. A longer release would've been ideal, but it's a worthy precursor to something greater.","The California producer/singer Anderson .Paak worked extensively with Dr. Dre on Compton, but has achieved only marginal success as a solo artist.

He also has something a lot of precocious upstarts don't: a deep and evolving catalog, counting 15 singles and now three albums to his name. His latest, Blurse—out on Lucy's excellent Stroboscopic Artefacts label—is a bold, confident step away from the dance floor material he's been honing and into deep, abstracted structures and pristine sound design. Blurse opens the way a lot of techno records do—with a grimy, compressed kick drum—and that's about the last time Blurse proceeds the way a lot of techno records do. The second kick arrives nearly a second later, an eternity on a dance floor. By the 90-second mark Chevel seems to have lost interest in the kick drum entirely, taking a mid-track siesta with the swirling harmonics and buzzing synths/insects. The drums come back—they almost always do—but these kind of aberrant structures define Blurse, which sees Chevel continually chart his way to abstraction and back again. Blurse, then, is kin to a certain strand of hypnotic, percussion-heavy dance music that sits at the edges of house and techno, the kind only touched by adventurous and skilled DJs. There are elements of Pearson Sound's coptering drums, of Objekt's cryptic architecture, even of the spacey suspensions of early dubstep masters such as Loefah. And, impressively, Chevel never veers too far into the avant-garde; Blurse, with its hard gray surfaces and dubby quivers, is always identifiable as techno in some mutated form. Chevel is walking a tightrope here, maintaining structure while unmooring most of a track's conventional building blocks. There's fun to be had in the details, too. The end of ""Watery Drumming"" features wildly rippling echoes as what sounds like an actual clock keeps time. ""Down and Out"" consists mostly of short, pitched percussion sounds and little stabs of an electric piano; skipping around the track with your mouse you're as likely to find utter silence as anything. The gorgeous ""Loop #33"" sees gooey, molten synths rise from beneath the cracks in the percussion. Concrete melodies are a little thin on the ground, so Blurse can sound homogenous. The record sometimes lacks the dynamism of works by the aforementioned artists, at times bordering on ascetic and clinical. But this style, which results in a lot of short, compact tracks, lends itself well to the album format. Which might be the point: Chevel has released two EPs and a 10-inch this year, all of them showcasing his steady progression but aimed more squarely at the dance floor. Blurse has the precision of a practiced producer and mischievousness of a rogue. It's the result of a young producer not just making techno but taking it apart, rearranging it, breaking it.","The young European produer Chevel takes a bold, confident step away from the dancefloor into deep, abstracted structures and pristine sound design on his latest album.

Between the screamy guy, the yelpy guy, the nervous guy who sang as if sweating through his pocket protector, and the open invitation for anybody else in the band to pipe in whenever they felt it might lend an extra energy to a song, it was a love-it-or-dismiss-it affair, even by the standards of an emo revival that favors messy, overstuffed statements. The eight-piece band may have filtered their updated emo through the sensibilities of some of the most broadly popular indie rock of the '00s, but they were fundamentally a niche act. On their sophomore album Harmlessness, they become less of one. In an effort to smooth out their rough edges after some lineup changes, TWIABP start with the roughest of them all: those voices. The screamy guy is gone, and the singer who emerges as the de facto pack leader, David Bello, has ironed most of the jitters out of his delivery. Those more approachable vocals set the tone for a record that's more orderly than its predecessor but no less sweeping. These songs still build, crash, weep, and rejoice, often all within the span of a few minutes, and the band still has no interest in moderation. If anything, Harmlessness actually has more going on than Whenever, If Ever, but it’s all done more tastefully, and the album’s warm, open production makes it easier to take in just how sophisticated these arrangements are—without all those voices crowded on top of each other, for instance, you can hear every violin stroke. TWIABP have succeeded where past generations of emo bands have often stumbled: tidying up their sound without losing any of the exuberance and immediacy that made that sound so striking in the first place. TWIABP tuck their most audacious song toward the front of the record. Condensing a subject loaded enough for a full concept album into five-and-a-half minutes, ""January 10th, 2014"" tells of Diana, the Hunter of Bus Drivers, the anonymous avenger from Juárez, Mexico, who shot and killed two factory bus drivers in retaliation for the rampant, unprosecuted sexual assaults committed by drivers on late-night routes. She became a folk hero, honored with statues in two cities. The song lifts some lyrics directly from a ""This American Life"" episode about her myth, including an exchange that’s acted out between Bello and singer/keyboardist Katie Shanholtzer-Dvorak. He voices a driver weary of a passenger who might be Diana; she speaks as every woman relieved to finally have some power over potential predators. ""Are you afraid of me now?"" she sings. ""Well yeah,"" he responds, ""Shouldn’t I be?"" The moment is so on-the-nose, so borderline musical theater, that it’s bound to make some listeners wince, but even those put off by it have got to admire the band’s temerity. Though Harmlessness’s primary fascinations lie with familiar subjects—overcoming depression, navigating changing relationships, finding a place in the world—the band detours from that safe territory to confront listeners with an uncomfortable moral quandary about whether taking a life is ever justified. The song sympathizes with Diana’s crusade while acknowledging the gruesome irony of celebrating a murderer. Of course, Harmlessness does the safer subjects well, too. One of Bello’s many songs about wrestling himself from depression’s grip, ""Rage Against the Dying of the Light"" builds to a hooky alt-rock riff, then pivots right into the album’s celebratory highlight, ""Ra Patera Dance"", which channels the grizzled cheer of Good News-era Modest Mouse. Harmlessness is loaded with these kinds of seamless transitions, and the band’s smart sequencing keeps the record moving with brisk efficiency. ""Haircuts for Everybody"" takes just a minute and a half to build to its brutally pretty climax. Where TWIABP’s last album ended with an epic seven-minute closing statement, ""Getting Sodas"", Harmlessness doubles down with two of them (actually, two and a half, if you count the lovely little hidden track tacked on to the end of ""Mount Hum""). Stacking so many moments of grandiosity on top of each other should be overkill, but it isn’t; each suite pays off triumphantly. With Harmlessness, the World Is a Beautiful Place have accomplished a rare feat: a lofty, loaded album with the grace and momentum of a far leaner one.","The emo band's second album is a step forward, increasing the intensity with more careful arrangements. If anything, it has more going on than the debut, but it’s all done more tastefully, and the album’s warm, open production makes it easier to take in just how sophisticated these arrangements are.

Live & Grow,Casey Veggies,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afdc5e6ef95969321e92/1:1/w_160/ece231a2.png,2015-09-28 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20893-live-grow/,Epic,"California rapper Casey Veggies desperately wants to create a storyline on his debut studio LP Live & Grow. His father—""Big Joe,"" a former Jay Z bodyguard—appears on the intro track, ""I'm the King"", praising his son's mixtape efforts and ability to balance school with his artistic ambitions. He closes out one of his monologues encouragingly stating, ""Watch him work,"" and then Veggies hops in on his verse: ""A lot on mind, and I try not to show/ Yeah, that's part of life, you live and you grow/ She suckin' me slow."" The lines, among many others on Live & Grow, don't exactly broadcast personal progress, and the presence of Veggies' father only exaggerates the near-comical contrast between the title's stated thesis and the nature of the album. Still only 22 years old, Veggies' career stretches back to high school when he founded Odd Future with Tyler, the Creator (who appears on and produced ""R.I.P.""). He's since moved on from OF, released five solo mixtapes, and launched the Peas & Carrots International clothing line. His biography alone demonstrates that Veggies has, in fact, lived and grown. Throughout the album, however, he often shies away from specific details, rendering the title more of a distraction than a mission statement. ""New Face$"", for example, is about Veggies' journey to fame—a road that inevitably includes many hiccups and fake friends—but he reveals very little about the trip. He offers possible insight (""New foreign chick and she famous/ She cashed me out and we dated""), but quickly abandons the thought in favor of played-out tough talk. Veggies' vague lyrics are mirrored in the production, which flips between styles like a major label rap album of 10 years ago might. Tyler, DJ Mustard, Iamsu!, Hit-Boy, Top Dawg collaborator THC, and more contribute work, and there are genuine pop moments (""Tied Up"", ""Wonderful"") alongside somber smooth cuts (""Sincerely Casey"", ""I'm Blessed""). There are even two takes on California's mainstream sounds: hi-hat-slappin' Northern California hyphy (""Backflip"") and bassier L.A. post-g-funk (""Actin' Up""). It's a capable roster, but Live & Grow is more of a platter than a platform, and Veggies never gets to settle into a sound he can develop. He is at his best on the more California cuts. ""Backflip"", for instance, is an instant earworm. Nonetheless he is still upstaged by YG, who delivers a more vulgar, memorable verse than Veggies by actually addressing the song's female subject. Veggies just speaks for her, and doesn't seem to see her as anything other than an object of his own success. This self-interest, instead of self-examination, comes through further on ""Wonderful"" and ""Tied Up"". On those tracks, as on many others, the respective hooks and verses don't relate very much at all. Flat lines like, ""I spend every day like it's my birthday,"" fail to tell us about his lifestyle or to even communicate a mood. Without any real lyrical flourishes to make his character interesting, the listener is left with Veggies' work at face value. He relies too heavily on end rhymes, doesn't vary his flow often enough, puns too obviously, and regularly leans on cliches. The lack of variation makes more sincere moments, like ""Aw Man"", difficult to wade through, as well. The song should be the center of his bildungsroman, but when each line is delivered with a near-identical cadence, hashtag lines sound as important as confessionals, minimizing the song's gravity. It's melodic and quite catchy at times, but Live & Grow is less than the sum of those parts. The album's title isn't misleading as much as it is as trite as the music it contains.","Casey Veggies desperately wants to create some kind of narrative on his debut studio LP, Live & Grow. There are some catchy pop moments but the project feels weighted down by sampler-platter production and vague, trite lyrics.

Every Open Eye,Chvrches,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1255e6ef9596932209f/1:1/w_160/7ae432ee.jpg,2015-09-28 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21104-every-open-eye/,GlassnoteVirgin EMI,"Anyone who has spent more than a minute in a clothing store over the past few years has heard dozens of bands making a calculated, charmless attempt to duplicate what came so naturally to Chvrches on their zeitgeisty debut The Bones of What You Believe. Which leaves the real deal facing a tremendous challenge three years after emerging anonymously from their basement with ""The Mother We Share"". ""After making one record that people really like, some bands reject the things that everyone liked about them and make some really deep, thoughtful, dark record,"" Martin Doherty admitted to Pitchfork earlier this year. Fortunately, the hard work and meticulous fine-tuning of Every Open Eye is so deeply embedded in the finished product that Chvrches never come off as self-conscious. Instead, it manifests as that uncanny, priceless quality of the truly popular: confidence. Chvrches toured The Bones of What You Believe exhaustively, so they don't have to overthink what things ""everyone"" liked about them and which parts were scare-quotes deep, dark, and thoughtful. You’ll be really let down if you hoped Chvrches would build on the proggier excursions of ""Science/Visions"" or if you believed Doherty’s expansive, nearly-six minute closer ""You Caught the Light"" justified a bigger role. Otherwise, the band rightfully assume that their unabashed embrace of pop's ruthless economy got them playing festivals in front of thousands of pop fans. So, when Lauren Mayberry belts, ""we will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold,"" it can be read as the band's artistic edict rather than one of the examples of her occasional slip into Millennial Successorizing (""I am chasing the skyline more than you ever will""). Nearly every moment of Every Open Eye is filled with aspiration and there's not a false step or bum note, verses and pre-choruses and choruses in brutal competition to be called ""the hook."" Mayberry summed it up as ""emo with synths in it"" in a recent podcast while expounding on a teenage love of Jimmy Eat World, and you can suss out a structural similarity between Every Open Eye and Bleed American (five radio-friendly bangers, ballad, four more radio-friendly bangers, slow-dance closer). Even the obvious deep cuts have a functional purpose—""Afterglow"" is a slight comedown that still feels necessary as exit music after nearly 40 minutes of constant peaks, while Doherty's light-stepping, funk-pop inclusion ""High Enough to Carry You Over"" is an allowable indulgence for a band that truly prides itself on being a band, rather than Mayberry and Those Other Guys. There's also an irrepressible buoyancy and reassurance, even if it's not just in her head where Mayberry feels looked down on. Her detailing of the brutal rape threats and casual misogyny she faces as a female public figure are both shocking and sadly familiar; she's more cagey about the personal relationships that serve as the lyrical muse for much of Every Open Eye. Though Mayberry's background in law and journalism served as an early footnote in the Chvrches come-up, she draws on that as much as any musical thread here. Whether asking for reconciliation (""Clearest Blue"", ""Empty Threat"") or demanding closure (""Never Ending Circles"", ""Leave a Trace""), Mayberry is judge, jury, and executioner, making convincing, carefully worded closing arguments set to casually devastate. With nearly all of mainstream pop's biggest acts looking toward the '80s for inspiration, Every Open Eye might be even more of-the-moment than its predecessor—Mayberry’s extracurriculars cast her lyrics in a feminist lens à la Cyndi Lauper and Madonna, while the arena-ready hooks justify the comparisons to pre-Violator Depeche Mode (the synth riff from ""Clearest Blue"" can't get enough of ""Just Can't Get Enough"") and the Pet Shop Boys. But minus the occasionally violent imagery of ""Gun"" and ""By the Throat"", Chvrches lack any of the qualities that made the aforementioned feel subversive or rebellious. This can actually work in their favor—""Leave a Trace"" was memorably described by Mayberry as a ""middle finger mic-drop,"" but her words are neatly manicured and polite enough to painlessly decapitate rather than bludgeon or incinerate. You can't have peak efficiency without formulas, though, and by the time ""Playing Dead"" and ""Bury It"" threaten to get mixed up on title alone, the similarly beaming melodies and diffident references to bones, crossed lines, and oceans start to render heartbreak, joy, resilience, and exhaustion interchangeable. The minor flaws of Every Open Eye are much more acceptable in light of the hedge-betting sophomore efforts from Purity Ring and Disclosure, perhaps the two acts who've been more imitated over the past two years than Chvrches. They've moved past their earliest days when their competition was assumed to be M83 or Passion Pit or even the Knife, but in leveling up, they actually seem more conservative sonically, lyrically, and visually than the pure pop acts for whom they're used as a foil, i.e., Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, Rihanna... hell, maybe Justin Bieber? If Every Open Eye is Chvrches taking the best parts of themselves and making them gold, I can't wait to hear them try to go platinum.","Nearly every moment of Chvrches' follow up to The Bones of What You Believe radiates with sky-high aspiration, the verses and pre-choruses and choruses in brutal competition to be called ""the hook."" The fine-tuning and craft is deeply embedded in the music, which exudes that uncanny, priceless quality of the truly popular: confidence.

100% Juice,Juicy J,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f4ea9e61561daa66d9/1:1/w_160/39b618e6.jpg,2015-09-25 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21076-100-juice/,self-released,"We’re often told rap is a young person’s game, but one of the year’s most noteworthy rap albums was helmed by a fifty-year-old. Jay Z is comfortably in his forties; Kanye will be forty in two years. And somehow Juicy J is forty but he seems particularly ageless—there’s When the Smoke Clears-era Three 6 Mafia, there’s Juicy J accepting an Oscar and appearing on his own show on MTV, then there’s 2011 Juicy J, attached to Wiz Khalifa’s Taylor Gang troupe, rapping with Kreayshawn, spawning catchphrases (""you say no to drugs—Juicy J can’t!""), and releasing free music at a furious clip, keeping up with the Lil B's of the world and rappers half his age. Juicy J didn’t have to come back, but he did, and his career reached a logical conclusion with his third solo record, 2013’s Stay Trippy, which was surprisingly great then, and holds up now. At the time, it wasn’t hard to see some cynicism in Juicy J’s late-career moves—he appeared to be angling for the blog-space that spent so much time covering guys who directly bit his original style (somewhere SpaceGhostPurrp is sighing). But Juicy J is from blue-collar Memphis, all he does is work. On the heels of the largely forgettable Blue Dream & Lean 2, 100% Juice drops all pretense and opens with the clearest mission statement possible: ""There’s too much stupid-ass shit happening right now, it’s time to turn up."" From there, it’s business as usual: dense, booming dark beats, hooks that mostly consist of a phrase shouted like a salutation, cataloging of various drugs taken and sexual escapades, then an occasional guest to break it up. While Juicy J’s re-emergence came on the heels of Lex Luger, Mike WiLL, and Young Chop beats, now he’s playing in a contemporary field consisting of 808 Mafia, Sonny Digital, and Metro Boomin. Juicy J’s greatest asset has been his ability to make his surroundings his own. The same way he ran through those 2011 Lex Luger beats, he slides right into the spacey, trap-noir of 808 Mafia—""Still"" runs a piano loop sounding straight out of Halloween as Juicy J sticks the landing on a vivid line like ""she got my wife-beater on as a nightgown"" and the punchline ""you just looking for a quick come-up, I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins."" How Juicy J rattles off these lines, in a way not unlike the now-infamous Migos triplet flow, but with an ascending and descending cadence that emphasizes the right syllables, is indicative of how effortless this comes to him. He never sounds tired, never phones it in. He’s the consummate pro. Juicy J is funnier than most rappers and capable of getting the most ludicrous hooks stuck in your head (""I drop them beans in my lean"" will haunt you for days) and he’s the rare rapper who commands respect from the people around him. Boosie’s vicious, borderline-disgusting verse on the ""Film"" remix is impossible to not run back a dozen times, demonstrating the intensity with which artists approach a Juicy J feature. Same goes for Lil Herb, who pops on ""Ain’t No Rapper""; the change of scenery breathes new, vibrant life into the Chicago emcee’s scratchy, traditional gangster tropes. 100% Juice, while not a revelation, is sturdy and solid. A great artist can endlessly remake the same sounds and make it work, and the self-contained good time of 100% Juice adds a few new wrinkles.","100% Juice opens with the clearest mission statement possible: ""There’s too much stupid-ass shit happening right now, it’s time to turn up.""

Evermore: The Art of Duality,The Underachievers,by: Mosi Reeves,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b059ea9e61561daa65e7/1:1/w_160/64093fc2.jpg,2015-09-25 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20998-evermore-the-art-of-duality/,RPM MSC,"""I know my soul was born to do some cool things,"" testifies AK over the wood flute-and-maracas loop of ""Rain Dance (Phase One Intro)"". The Underachievers, his duo with Issa Gold, practice the kind of esoteric mysticism that once flourished in some far-flung corners of '90s rap, from the feverish jabberwocky of Leaders of the New School’s T.I.M.E.: The Inner Mind’s Eye to the pan-African zealotry of X-Clan’s To the East, Blackwards, and the backpacker bohemianism of Zion I’s Mind Over Matter, Mystik Journeymen’s The Black Sands Ov Eternia and Abstract Tribe Unique’s Mood Pieces. It’s an ethos that largely dissipated by the end of that decade as rap moved on. But the Underachievers have not only revived it, they’ve stuck with their spiritual bent through four projects, including 2013’s revelatory Indigoism, last year’s uneven but satisfying Cellar Door: Terminus Ut Exordium, and now Evermore: The Art of Duality. At first, Evermore appears to offer more of the same, as they rap about being miseducated in school, dabbling in street hustles, and feeling alienated from society. ""We lost in this world, but it’s hard to relate,"" says AK on ""Chasing Faith"". They strive to use their experiences to educate others through hip-hop music, celebrating the use of ""natural"" herbs such as marijuana and ‘shrooms, but acknowledging that they’ve struggled with harder substances. They underline the importance of their metaphysical lessons by acknowledging in ""The Dualist"" that ""We all sin."" AK and Issa Gold complement each other. Vocally, AK has a more sour tone and a barking delivery that sounds like he’s dispensing real talk. Issa Gold has a mid-range baritone that lightens when he gets excited, as if he can’t wait to finish rapping one line and start the next. Both are strong lyricists, but for much of Evermore, they repeat the same themes again and again. The perils of mental illness are frequently noted; mainstream religious dogma, school indoctrination, and the banality of social media and Western pop culture are repetitively disparaged. These observations are delivered over serene production. ""Shine All Gold"" matches an acoustic guitar loop to a bass drum bounce, then closes with an ambient techno beat. The next two tracks, ""Chasing Faith"" and ""Star Signs"", pick up that downtempo thread and build backgrounds full of melancholy and yearning. ""The Dualist"" breaks the holistic spell with the kind of mid-'90s boom-bap classicism on which the Underachievers and other Beast Coast artists built their reputation. The warm electric keyboards and synthesizers of ""The Brooklyn Way"" make for a particularly glorious peak. ""Hands up if you live for love,"" chants Issa Gold. For much of Evermore, the Underachievers spin in their spiritual axis, until a series of tracks near the end break the heavenly trance with jarring abruptness. Trap orchestration creeps in on ""Take Your Place"" as Issa Gold warns, ""Don’t fuck with the snakes,"" and AK adds, ""Really pop up on a nigga blocka/ If he think he hotta ‘cause a nigga conscious/ Got to keep a chopper just to cease the nonsense."" The duo descends into a hellish inferno until they reach the ninth circle of ""Allusions"". ""Got a bitch in the Bay that loves the ‘shrooms/ She be screamin’ AK when I shove the broom,"" brags AK. Issa Gold adds, ""Smoking fuego with your dame/ Been like a whole 20 minutes, can’t front, nigga still don’t know her name /30 minutes later, had my pinky in her brain/ She like, I thought you was different, all of you rappers just the same/ She ain’t complain."" The latter songs throw everything that precedes it into doubt. Are the Underachievers just rap dudes lusting for weed, bitches, and cash like everyone else? They’re obviously aware of the contradictions, but Evermore: The Art of Duality places these adventures in a present-tense context. Perhaps they’re simply acknowledging their flawed humanity. Just as likely, they don’t yet realize that their perspectives on sex and violence can be as tough to break as the mental prisons that damaged their troubled youth. The Evermore journey is an engaging one, but it would have slid into a new age torpor if not for the spate of ugliness near the album’s end. The coarse ""Generation Z"" shenanigans give the earlier ""Chasing Faith"" added urgency. We now know why the Underachievers strain to ascend their earthly selves. ""I done came far, still got a lot further to go,"" raps Issa Gold on the final track, ""Unconscious Monsters (Evermore Outro)"". ""Trying to leave a mark by giving everything that I know.""","Brooklyn's Underachievers practice the kind of esoteric mysticism that once flourished in some far-flung corners of '90s rap, from Leaders of the New School to X-Clan.

Utakata no Hibi,Mariah,by: Jakob Dorof,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b091c0084474cd0c1c85/1:1/w_160/0a495943.jpg,2015-09-25 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21030-utakata-no-hibi/,Palto FlatsPalto Flats,"Throughout its long, slow journey west, Mariah’s Utakata no Hibi has been an album without context. After a dormant period at home among Japan’s vinyl geek underground, the 1983 record began to spread farther in 2008, when the tastemaking Scottish DJ duo Optimo shared a cut online. That song, ""Shinzo no Tobira"", which they first heard in a Tokyo record store, has since earned a cult following worldwide for the ethereal lines it traces between Asian and Middle Eastern tonalities, folklorish Armenian lyrics, and futuristic Japanese synthpop leads. Its soundscapes are like those once dreamt by Brians Eno and Wilson. But for all the love ""Shinzo"" and its parent album have found in tiny nightclubs and Internet testimonials, surprisingly little has been asked or answered about its origins. It's almost as though Utakata—now reissued by Palto Flats—has at last arrived on our shores not simply through a crate digger’s time warp, but from some other world altogether. Or maybe a few of them: As befits an album that owes its broader discovery to a Shinjuku record store called Eurasia, Utakata’s plainspoken lyrics are sung in alternating Armenian and Japanese. In this regard—and most others—the record bears no resemblance to Mariah’s previous five, wherein a revolving door of popular Tokyo session men dabbled in everything from prog rock to jazz funk. By 1983, the project was being led by Yasuaki Shimizu, a relentlessly exploratory musician best known for the saxophone takes on Bach’s Cello Suites he would later record in both Japanese mines and Italian palazzos. His brilliant solo outing from the previous year, Kakashi, is Utakata’s only obvious relative. But that earlier work’s East-meets-West patchwork of genres, moods, and scales feels much more cut and dry than the seamless marvel Shimizu would soon create. Given how difficult it remains to find a fair comparison for any of Utakata’s seven songs, let alone synthesize the picture they form together, it’s an album that has well earned its reputation as an elusive classic. The long tally of pleasant surprises begins with opener ""Sokokara…"" (""From Here…""), in which slash-and-burn no wave guitar and a frantically overloaded player piano somehow only add to the springtime optimism suggested by the song’s marching beat, blossoming synths, and Shimizu’s skyward warble. ""Hana Ga Saitara"" (""Were Flowers to Bloom"") is a more eloquent draft of the dubbed out, sax-led post-punk that was then beginning to bubble up in England rock clubs, here powered by brass skronk and proto-techno synths. And ""Fujiyu Na Nezumi"" takes the British nursery rhyme ""Three Blind Mice"" and translates it into Japanese, Armenian, and a poetic syntax of spare bass, sustained synths, and simple percussion—indicating not so much the album’s sense of humor as the childlike wonder animating its every move. Mixer and engineer Seigen Ono would later work the boards for artists like John Zorn, Arto Lindsay, and King Crimson, but the way he focuses Shimizu’s playtime ruckus of international instrumentation and production techniques remains the accomplishment of his career. Utakata’s most impressive feat of synthesis, however, lies in its coupling of East Asian and Middle Eastern sounds. The most explicit instance occurs in early highlight ""Shisen"" (""A Vision""), which weds gorgeous piano pentatonics and koto court music with Armenian vocalist Julie Fowell’s mesmerizing mantra, ""Our eyes as one."" When the lone, cavernous drum and piercing sine waves enter, the effect is devastating. The twinning effect is at its subtle best on the famously DJ-friendly ""Shinzo no Tobira"" (""My Life Is Big"") that first got Optimo’s attention, where unforgettable melody walks the fine line it all but invents between its authors’ musical heritages. In 2015, it remains a rare and enchanting thing to hear a piece of convergence culture this effortless—which, after all, may be one reason Utakata still sounds so otherworldly. Another could be the fact that the album owes its existence to a creative moment in Japanese pop that remains virtually unknown to the English-speaking world. Thanks to '80s electronic pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra’s continued chart success and the glory days of the Japanese economy, the mainstream entered a renaissance of open-mindedness and ludicrous recording budgets, producing an abundance of records that answer Shimizu’s sonic adventures with ones every bit as bold and compelling. Maybe Utakata belongs, then, not to some wondrous alternate history, but a real one we’re just beginning to uncover.","This mostly unknown early '80s record from Japan has been absent from conversation for the past 30 years. Now, it  is reissued and ready to blow your mind. With mesh of Japanese and Armenian sounds, Mariah's unforgettable melodies walk the fine line they all but invented between its authors’ musical heritages.

1989,Ryan Adams,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b1209d034d5c69bf4996/1:1/w_160/d34940bc.jpg,2015-09-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21101-1989/,Pax-Am,"Ryan Adams' cover of Taylor Swift's 1989 is a lot of fun to think about and talk about, but not much fun to listen to. It is, in other words, a pure product of the Internet—a robust, cross-platform, thinkpiece-generating app that testifies mostly to Adams' ability to get attention. You have to hand it to him for knowing what he's doing: His album choice churns up some nice, irony-rich soil for culture and music critics to wriggle around in. Even though Taylor Swift has been a songwriter first and foremost throughout her career, 1989 was where she collaborated more intensely with superstar producers like Max Martin and Shellback to help her cross over from Queen of Pop Country to the center of the pop world proper. The move worked spectacularly: 1989 is among the best-selling albums of the post-Napster era. And now Ryan Adams has transformed it again, into... a run-of-the-mill Ryan Adams album. It's an odd object to engage with. Adams is entertaining, always has been, and he's carved out what is by now a fascinating career, filled with a few widely beloved heartland rock albums and a great many weird one-offs that have won him a devoted cult. 1989 is on the one hand an example of the latter, but it's presented in the style of the former. He throws himself into the album completely—the arrangements are fully realized and he sings with care and precision, revealing his admiration. But he also reveals some fairly crucial points about how good songs are put together. Every recorded song is the end point of a long road with many possible forks in it—a series of small decisions about chord changes, melody lines, lyrics, and arrangements. Swift's 1989 songs are written for a specific kind of production—the melodies are clipped, percussive, and designed to hit with force at very specific times. They are written to be electro-pop songs, which rely more on big dynamic changes and repeating cells of melody. At its best, Swift's 1989 crackles with life, and highlights what it feels like to be young and looking at the world from a very specific moment; Adams transforms those feelings into a wistful and generic feeling of weariness. To put it in the context of an artist to whom Adams is often compared, 1989 shows why Springsteen went synth-pop on Born in the U.S.A. in 1984—the songs demanded it. The songs that sound like anthems were meant to be anthems; Springsteen's stark demos of the songs are instructive but they weren't the finished product. Remember, too, that he tried to turn his dark folk masterpiece Nebraska into a full band album but realized it needed to come out as an acoustic demo. Which is to say that ""Out of the Woods"" is ""Dancing in the Dark"", not ""Atlantic City"". Swift knows this about her own material, and the demos of 1989's songs she included on the album show how dramatic the transformation can be. In Adams' hands, they are flat, flavorless rockers, and when the music isn't simply boring it crosses the line into actively grating. He wants ""Blank Space"" to be a Big Star-style heartfelt ballad, but the melody feels thin, rushed, and monochrome in this setting. He delivers ""Shake It Off"" in a grim and determined tone that would be appropriate if he were singing about how conservative politics have decimated rural families at the inaugural Farm Aid—but when paired with a repeated refrain of “haters gonna hate,"" it sounds ridiculous. And Adams' ""Style"" is downright garish, coming off like Bono fronting Survivor, the dark side of the album's titular year. Adams' 1989, for all its sincerity and technical execution, is ultimately hollow because it's nothing but context. There's everything surrounding it (the unexpected match of singer and song, the details of the release) and there's what you bring to it (your relationship to the music of Swift and Adams, your demographic profile, your feelings on rock and pop and covers in general) but there's no essential reason for it to exist. This is why Father John Misty's rush-released version of ""Blank Space"", wherein he remade Swift's song in the style of the Velvet Underground, was such a brilliant example of a recorded song as music criticism. His track was a hilarious (and, importantly, still musically enjoyable) reminder that Adams' entire album is a gesture. It's a formal exercise. You listen and think, ""Ah, I see what he did there"" and then you forget about it.","Ryan Adams' cover of Taylor Swift's 1989 is a lot of fun to think about and talk about, but not much fun to listen to. It is, in other words, a pure product of the Internet. At its best, Swift's 1989 crackles with life, while Adams has transformed it into... a run-of-the-mill Ryan Adams album.

Caracal,Disclosure,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b097c0084474cd0c1c94/1:1/w_160/8c654953.png,2015-09-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21034-caracal/,Island,"Looking back, the intro to Disclosure’s Settle almost reads like a warning to their future selves: ""As much as you like to control your environment, the reality is, everything changes."" Sure enough, Guy and Howard Lawrence’s sophomore full-length Caracal arrives just two years later but in a markedly different pop landscape—thanks in no small part to the brothers' own influence. Their pristine syntheses of UK garage, Midwestern vocal house, and hook-happy pop structures re-oriented the British pop charts and trickled into the American ones, opening the doors for pop-adjacent neo-house acts like Duke Dumont, Years & Years, and Rudimental (not to mention for Sam Smith). Disclosure have never really been the types to throw curveballs: they do what they do, and they do it impeccably. But it’s understandable they’d start feeling restless, especially as the scope of their influence rendered their own tunes increasingly indistinct. ""That sound is everywhere now,"" Guy, now 24, admitted in an L.A. Times profile this summer. ""The same old bass lines, the same old samples. We’re a bit bored by it."" Scrubbed of much of its predecessor's overt 2-step and house homage, Caracal suggests the duo's also grown bored of the conversation that's surrounded them from the start: how dance and pop music can and ""should"" relate. On one hand, here were two young men making wide-reaching dance tracks that weren’t reliant on drops, builds, or any of festival EDM’s creatine-crazed trappings. These guys scanned as ""tasteful,"" for better or worse. But on the flip side were classicists and underground dance fans who pegged the duo as milquetoast gentrifiers of scenes they were too young to fully appreciate, repackaging history with the context and kinks ironed out. There is some sting in the charge, but it's not entirely fair: Disclosure’s work has always made the most sense within the framework of pop, in terms of both form and demographic. In that sense, calling Disclosure contrived or formulaic misunderstands how pop works. Their music may be one-size-fits-all, but it’s also immaculately crafted and catchy as fuck, smudging the divide between the universal and the personal to the point where ""Latch"" somehow seemed to grow more poignant the more ubiquitous it became. Those dance classicists will likely be less territorial with Caracal: the brothers have dialed down the BPMs significantly and turned toward slow-burning, R&B-inspired grooves. But as they’ve edged away from giddy neo-nostalgia toward a sound with less identifiable anchor points, they’ve begun to blend into the background. On ""Omen"", the brothers reunite with Sam Smith for a single presumably meant to reprise the massive success of ""Latch"". And it’s fine—plodding along at a stately downtempo strut with a hint of a 2-step hitch, Smith’s voice a bit mired in that familiar elastic bassline. But it’s nowhere near as immediate, or as gripping; here, when Smith sings of missed opportunities for emotional connection, ""Latch""’s obsessive I-will-never-leave-your-side-god-dammit conviction feels like a distant memory. Much of Caracal is vaguely pleasant music you can put on in the background while you’re working—but is that really what we look to Disclosure for? Meanwhile, where Settle set the tone for years of pop hits to come, Caracal seems content to fall back amidst the pack. Opening track ""Nocturnal"" is a showcase for R&B’s man-of-the-moment the Weeknd, and it wouldn’t sound out of place on Beauty Behind the Madness. Its synth arpeggios seem to aim for Frankie Knuckles and Jamie Principles’ ""Your Love"", but the vibe is closer to late-'00s Hype Machine dance tracks (halfway through, the track practically breaks into its own Classixx remix). This makes sense, in a way: much of the Billboard pop and R&B charts over the last year have embraced this sound, from Nick Jonas’ ""Jealous"" to Jason Derulo to the current bumper crop of vaguely Balearic ""tropical house"" singles and remixes. But for Disclosure, the move feels like a step backward, an aim at broader relevance that’s only watered down what once made them feel thrilling. There are bright spots: lead single ""Holding On"" retains their signature bounce and features stunning vocals from jazz songwriter Gregory Porter, and ""Good Intentions"", with its understated Miguel appearance, is the best example of their smoothed-out new direction, keeping a brisk pace but leaving more open space. Still, it’s getting harder to shake the sense that these redemptive guest spots have become a crutch for a lack of ideas. Both of the album’s two featureless tracks feel instantly forgettable—particularly ""Jaded"", a beige wash of cheeseball lyrics that chastise a dishonest companion with all the depth of the ""Why You Lyin"" Vine. When Disclosure’s hype was at its peak circa Settle, they were often compared to turn-of-the-century acts like Basement Jaxx and Daft Punk—acts who successfully recontextualized older house and disco influences into something reverent and contemporary. But a significant part of both groups’ appeal—and, crucially, part of the outright critical revulsion at the time, too—was their lack of self-seriousness, their willingness to get a little cheesy. Those guys’ nostalgia embraced the kitsch along with the classicism; they had fun. The Lawrence brothers have good taste, sharp instincts, and pristine craftsmanship: playfulness, not so much. Even the album’s most unbuttoned track falls flat: ""Bang That"", a (relatively) raunchy promotional single now relegated to the bonus tracks with a gratuitous sample of 313 Bass Mechanics’ ""Pass Out"", feels a bit cringey, like Kidz Bop does ghetto house. Ultimately, Caracal just doesn’t feel much fun, and even its highs are nowhere near Settle’s polished bliss. Once trendsetters, here the Lawrence brothers too often fade noncommittally into white noise.","On the follow-up to their massive 2013 hit Settle, the brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence have dialed down the BPMs significantly and turned toward slow-burning, R&B-inspired grooves.

Good Sad Happy Bad,Micachu and the Shapes,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ee5e6ef95969322055/1:1/w_160/01119442.jpg,2015-09-24 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21069-good-sad-happy-bad/,Rough Trade,"Micachu and the Shapes revel in making enjoyable noise. Since their relatively conventional-sounding art-pop debut Jewellery, the band has pushed their experimentation further every new release, from crafting homemade instruments to recording live arrangements alongside orchestras. And now, just a year after releasing her harrowing avant-garde score for the film Under the Skin, Mica Levi has returned to her band to release Good Sad Happy Bad. Perhaps in the aftermath of composing a soundtrack for a major motion picture, Levi wanted to bring simplicity back to Micachu, as Good Sad Happy Bad toys with a warped minimalism that feels new even for this band. The record counteracts the fuzzy, almost punk rock energy of their last album Never, settling for soft, acoustic guitar and childlike keyboard arrangements. Even the production of the record is spare and unedited, with warbled vocals and frequent inclusions of studio chatter on songs like ""Dreaming"" and ""Crushed"". The record feels intimate and casual in this unrefined state, but the line between relaxed and lazy is shaky on Good Sad Happy Bad. When all the tinker-toy elements align, it works beautifully, as on ""L.A. Poison"" with Levi singing softly about the loneliness of urban life over mechanically looped strumming guitar and a simple kick-drum. ""Oh Baby"" sounds like a murky, blues-leaning lullaby, as if its keyboards are being played underwater while Levi croons above them. But the off-key, off-tempo energy of tracks like ""Hazes"" and ""Relaxing"" feel thrown together and messy, even if it was purposeful. The biggest shift here is to be found in Mica Levi’s voice, which is strained and echoed as she sings wearily about bad feelings. You can barely understand her at times, but Good Sad Happy Bad is fundamentally a gloomy self-help record, with its assurances delivered realistically. ""It’s gonna be okay,"" Levi repeats in a chipper, sing-song voice at the end of ""Sad"". On ""Thinking It"" Raisa Khan relays how she wants to get better at working out and being healthier so she can enjoy her old age. On ""Sea Air"", all Levi wants to do is breathe in the ocean air because ""all that crap means nothing to [her]."" Although Good Sad Happy Bad is certainly the band’s least polished-sounding record, the combination of the scattered arrangements and Levi’s ruminations on sadness shrewdly underline the topsy-turvy feeling suggested by the title. Even with the band’s music messily chopped, looped, and jangled, the emotional messages always ring clear. ""It’s only suffering,"" Levi sings on ""Suffering"", her voice suddenly lilting the phrase as the song gains tighter, harder percussion and guitar as the song nears its end. ""That keeps my conscious clean.""","Good Sad Happy Bad toys with a warped minimalism that feels new for Micachu and the Shapes.

Samantha,Toro y Moi,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bd13d197565213a4f2/1:1/w_160/47456868.png,2015-09-24 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21059-samantha/,self-released,"Part of the fun in following Chaz Bundick’s musical trajectory is hearing how he changes up his style from one project to the next. From Causers of This on, each Toro Y Moi release has been a subtle shakeup: 2011’s stellar Underneath the Pine laser-cut the corners of chillwave down to a fine point; 2013’s Anything in Return turned his songwriterly impulses into disco and pop gems; and, most recently, he channeled early experiments with garage and indie rock into this past April’s What For? But each project somehow sounds distinctly like Toro Y Moi, bound by Bundick’s unflagging production chops. The latest Toro Y Moi project, Samantha, is a free mixtape that piles together recordings from as far back as 2012 and as recent as last month. It serves as a neat way of tracking Bundick’s progression as a musician while prominently highlighting his talent for both beat-driven and atmospheric production. Samantha is filled with unexpected turns. Sparse one- and two-minute instrumental sketches serve as interludes, creating a sense of flow with soul and R&B samples (""Stoned at the MoMA"", ""Prayer Hands"", the Ciara-quoting ""Boo Boo Mobile""). Bundick ventures into ambient on glitchy, sedate closer ""welp, tour’s over"" and ""ambient Rainbow"", with the latter layering choral vocals and soothing washes of sound to mesmerizing ends. It’s a testament to Bundick’s innovation that he’s still finding ways to contort his signature sound into new shapes. Even when songs do call back to his previous work, as on ""Us 2"", which pairs a churning hip-hop beat with sugary synth pads that sound lifted from his 2011 cover of Cherrelle’s ""Saturday Love"", they still put a fresh spin on the approach. The songs on Samantha are about the ups and downs of relationships, placing most emphasis on the downs. Bundick even goes so far as to tack an extended sample of The Notebook onto the end of creeping, Washed Out-assisted ""Want"", a move that very narrowly evades tipping over into schmaltz. On the trap-influenced ""The Usual"", he laments the frustrations of being a workaholic in a relationship, an unusually frank moment from Bundick. Elsewhere, Kool A.D. spins off into woozy, emotionally conflicted verses (""I got problems acting like a fuckin’ grown up,"" he grouses in Auto-Tune on ""Real Love""), while rising Atlanta rapper Rome Fortune relays relationship fallouts on two of the tape’s best tracks, ""Pitch Black"" and Puff Daddy-sampling ""Benjiminz"". Samantha lightens up by the end, as on the sweetly jittery ""Enough of You"", but the main theme seems to be that relationships are complicated messes that can lead to comfort and love as easily as pain and heartbreak. That Samantha comes in the wake of the guitar-driven What For? makes the mixtape particularly welcome, like a palette cleanser to prepare us for wherever Bundick goes next. Even if he's purging his hard drive of one-offs that didn’t fit anywhere else, with a free-form structure, winning collabs, and appealingly nocturnal ambience, Samantha is a welcome addition to Bundick’s catalog.","Samantha, a free mixtape that piles together recordings from as far back as 2012 and as recent as last month, including collaborations with Washed Out, Rome Fortune, Kool A.D., and more, ably tracks Chaz Bundick’s evolution as a producer and songwriter.

Everything Dies,Various Artists,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07113d197565213a483/1:1/w_160/127674a8.jpg,2015-09-24 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21009-everything-dies/,Graveface,"Des Ark's Aimée Argote can shred with the best of them when the mood strikes, though on Everything Dies, it doesn't. For most of the last decade, Argote's band has existed as a Jekyll/Hyde operation, oscillating between thrashing noise rock and hushed folk. Depending on her lineup, a Des Ark show might find her making a mockery of ear plugs, contorting her body into impossible positions to force the cruelest sounds from her instrument, or playing for a crowd seated on the floor, inviting them to squeeze in closer in order to hear her over her unplugged guitar. Argote makes either extreme feel like her natural state on stage, though capturing both on the same record has proved more of a challenge. 2011's Don't Rock the Boat, Sink the Fucker positioned scorching punk uncomfortably against pretty but sometimes overworked songs that lost some of the intensity of Argote's solo performances. On Everything Dies, she avoids that whiplash. Though it was recorded in bits and pieces at six studios in five states over a span of several years, with a range of collaborators including Swans' Thor Harris, Engine Down's Jonathan Fuller, and Saddle Creek journeyman Andy LeMaster, it coheres like the product of a single session. No track benefits more from this unified approach than ""Ties"". Argote has been kicking that song around since at least 2007, when it first appeared under the misleadingly silly title ""Covert Conspiracy of Spanish Speaking Cats"" on a solo session Argote recorded for the Durham station WXDU. On its Everything Dies' update, she's accompanied by imposing guitars and drums that give the song thrust, underscoring Argote's violent imagery without drowning out the dread in her voice. It's the most devastating song she's ever written, a chilling documentation of the tolls of loving an addict—the promises they might break, the things they might steal, and the bruises they might leave. ""Here it is,"" she sings, ""The bathtub where you'll find the love of your life, choking up his own blood."" The words seem to fight her as they leave her mouth. Not all of Everything Dies is so bleak—it couldn't be. ""French Fries Are Magical"" plays like a prolonged hug, as does the album's most unabashedly pretty number, ""Street Woods"". And the one song on the record that does live up to its irreverent title, ""Don Taco & His Hot Sauce Toss"", is downright gleeful, a communal rejoice that falls somewhere between the Polyphonic Spree's rainbow sing-alongs and the radiant pop of Feist's The Reminder. As on Don't Rock the Boat, there are moments on Everything Dies where you can't help but wonder how a songwriter this good has existed so far below the radar of so many listeners. In a recent interview with After Ellen, Argote shed some light on why that might be, explaining that she prefers to play queer-friendly venues and safe spaces removed from the threats and harassment that women face at traditional venues. ""I don't really feel like I need to cultivate a male audience,"" she explained. ""My songs are written for women and they're written for queer people; those are the people I've been closest to in my life, who I obviously want to share my music with … Really what I would like to do is create spaces that are safe for everybody and since I identify as queer I think it helps."" Those comments sparked some distracting backlash from male commenters somehow upset that a woman might want to target her music at her own community, but they reveal a lot about these songs. For all the turmoil it confronts, Everything Dies really does create that sense of safety. Nearly every song extends a hand to the abused, the subjugated, or the otherwise marginalized and reassures them they'll be all right. ""I'll bandage up your arms, your legs, and leave you where the wounded lay,"" she offers a lover on ""Coney Island Street Meat"". Argote cycles through nearly every emotion imaginable in these songs, but the one that drives her the most is concern.","Aimée Argote's band Des Ark oscillates between thrashing noise rock and hushed folk. Everything Dies is her most unified project, and for all the turmoil it confronts, it creates a sense of safety. Nearly every song extends a hand to the abused, the subjugated, or the otherwise marginalized and reassures them they’ll be all right.

Da' Nic EP,T.I.,by: Ernest Wilkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f39d034d5c69bf4955/1:1/w_160/a9b5ddc8.png,2015-09-24 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21075-da-nic-ep/,Grand Hustle,"Here is your weekly reminder of time's unending march: 2016 marks 15 years of music from Clifford ""T.I."" Harris. Since 2001, the Atlanta rap icon has been churning out hits—be they of the ""mixtape street classic"" or ""mainstream feat. Rihanna"" variety—and thanks to those hits, he has resisted a slow fade into obscurity. In fact, he has packed his dance card to the gills, what with his recent appearance in Marvel's Ant-Man and the usual busywork that a globe-trotting, ""Blurred Lines"" appearing, Iggy Azalea co-signing (and then disowning) Grand Hustle label head has to slog through. While his hardcore fans remain supportive (did you know that T.I. has never had an album that didn't sell at least 250,000 copies?) it wouldn't really shock anyone if he decided to phone it in as an artist by now. In recent interviews though, Harris is adamant on returning to his old ways and Da' Nic, the new five-song EP meant as a warm-up for the forthcoming Dime Trap, showcases this shift effortlessly. Trap will be the first album Harris will record under his original TIP nickname, which he eschewed for T.I. way back when in order to avoid confusion with Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest. As a release, Da' Nic isn't going to pacify any longing you might have for Trap-A-Holics voice REAL TRAP SHIT, but it's a strong record from one of the better rappers we have these days and a breath of fresh air from a guy who was treading the path of ""reality show dad"" just a few years back. If the last few T.I. releases have sounded complicated and unnecessarily heavy, Da' Nic sounds like the guy most of us met on 2003's Trap Muzik finally heading back to his old neighborhood to sit on the porch and talk some shit. Like many others, T.I. has occasionally fallen beneath the weight of the Major Label Rolodex. (Just because you can put Usher or Chris Brown on a song doesn't mean you should, dig?) On Da' Nic there's only one feature: The London on Da Track-produced toe-tapper ""Peanut Butter and Jelly"", which features guest verses from ""Young"" rappers both new (Thug) and old (Dro). More than anything, this record sounds like the work of a seasoned veteran who's annoyed that everyone isn't giving him his dues as a good rapper. Even on his most bloated releases—2007's T.I. vs. T.I.P being the best example—count on T.I. for at least one moment where he showcases his ability to ramp up his verses when he even senses that people are sleeping on him. On Da' Nic, that moment is ""Ain't Gonna See It Coming""  (""No, I'm not that old nigga think that he run it/ And talkin' bout what he did back in the day/ I'm just as vicious as ever, I'm brilliant and clever and still 'bout that action today""). It's refreshing to hear him serve notice. Let's be honest: While the EP is a welcome return to form, it's still five songs. You aren't going to find hidden treasure here. However, for those who have said they want the old T.I. back—the Lil' Flip- and Shawty Lo-obliterating King of the South who spit acid when he wasn't making the girls dance, all while wearing a Braves fitted cocked on his head at an angle that doesn't make any logical sense—Da' Nic promises some hope for his upcoming The Dime Trap.","Da' Nic is a new five-song EP meant as a warm-up for the forthcoming Dime Trap, which will be the first album T.I. will record under his original TIP nickname.

Slime Season,Young Thug,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b11eea9e61561daa6723/1:1/w_160/4637f149.jpg,2015-09-24 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21099-slime-season/,self-released,"If you're new to Young Thug, don't start with Slime Season. An odds-and-ends compilation with no coherent vision, the tape finds Thug rapping at a high level, but performing less consistently as a songwriter. It's not clear he even wants to be a songwriter on all these records; one gets the impression the tape's been compiled ex post facto, a few fully-fleshed out classics mixed in with studio dross. Some feel more like workouts, perhaps cut quickly during marathon recording sessions. (Initially Slime Season was to be produced entirely by London on da Track. ""Ask 300"", the beatmaker tweeted—a reference to Thug's label—when questioned about the more diverse production lineup of the final tracklist.) The bulk of these songs are for Thug completists, or those convinced of his infallibility. Nevertheless, Thug remains one of hip-hop's most exciting stylists, consistent even amid inconsistency, and there are moments worth savoring. Part of the problem is that Thug's catalog has already been flooded with leaks and unofficial releases. Some of them—""Hey I"" is a particular standout—are superior to many of the records here. Thug's biggest fans would be better off compiling their own greatest hits from the pile, and Thug neophytes will find this year's Barter 6 or last year's Rich Gang tape a much more consistent entryway. It's unclear why certain records made the cut and others didn't. The inclusion of Wayne feature ""Take Kare"" (which has been out since last year) may be yet another pointed dig at Thug's idol (the two have since had a falling out), but it was also an anticlimax. ""Power"", produced by London on da Track, seems like something left on the cutting room floor from the Barter sessions, and if it was, it's easy to hear why: where each Barter record made up a discrete facet of the album's sound, ""Power"" sounds a little bit like three of them at once—consummate filler. In the rush to fete Thug for his radical talents, it's important to draw distinctions between what records work, and which ones do not—or those which sort of work, if you look at them from the right angle. Part of the joy of his art is that you can draw together your own version of his canon from a scattered field, picking up on the pieces that most attract you. (This is not a quality limited to Thug; it's been this way since the Internet began to reward rappers, like Lil Wayne and Gucci Mane, who could flood the market without drowning in it.) The most evident gem here is ""Best Friend"". Its hook is inspired by a viral vine (Tokyo Vanity, the meme's creator, has released a ""Best Friend"" record of her own), and its surreal video is sly and artfully unpredictable. The Ricky Racks-produced record, which builds upon disorienting sound effects and hypnotic pizzicato strings, draws you in while bringing you no closer to figuring it all out, a contradiction at the heart of the Young Thug project. Thug's best songs are carefully structured, even if they appear effortlessly thrown together, and the most effective moments tend to be subtle, sidling up to the listener. Each of the song's parts—melodies, backgrounds, hooks, choruses, and flows—lock in to give the song a shape as particular as a fingerprint. Many songs on Slime Season don't chase this goal; at the album's opening, Thug's drawn to repetitive, headbanging patterns and the results are for hardcore fans only. The opening tracks, the Sonny Digital-produced trap banger ""Quarterback"" and the Southside-produced ""Rarri"", are interesting but lack replay value. A few of the harder-edged songs do work: ""Freaky"" might be its best experimental moment, with Wondagurl's unstructured, percussive beat bringing Thug's songcraft and improvisational rap style to the fore. But the album's true highlights don't arrive until its close, with the one-two punch of ""Draw Down"" and ""Wood Would"". On the former—which has been out for some time—Thug  strategically deploys different flows to shape the song, while his unpredictable figurative language keep the listener on their toes: ""Pull up with that K out of the coupe! I like my bitch brown like a mu'fuckin' boot!"" he says at one moment, or later: ""Put that pussy on my head like a fuckin' Motrin!"" Disguised in his squall of a delivery, they're not conveyed as jab-you-in-the-ribs punchlines; they're playful and impossible to anticipate, chasing novelty rather than cliche, lending the song an uncertain, volatile air. As for ""Wood Would"", it's the album's strongest, and stands among the best in his catalog. With its sample skipping like a stone as its drums slam in place, it's low-key and unassuming, evading direct translation and shifting in and out of lucidity. Yet Thug wears his heart on his sleeve through one of pop's oldest tools: an undeniable melody. It says everything he doesn't need to, as if everything you didn't know were clear as day.","An odds-and-ends compilation with no coherent vision, Slime Season finds Young Thug rapping at a high level, but performing less consistently as a songwriter.

Negative Feedback Resistor,Destruction Unit,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f05e6ef95969322059/1:1/w_160/5062c344.jpg,2015-09-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21073-negative-feedback-resistor/,Sacred Bones,"No band makes a show of underground camaraderie like Destruction Unit. The group tends to invite friends on stage, uniting players from typically insular realms like hardcore, minimal synth, and metal in the service of further saturating its already dense, imposing performances. There’s a tagline for this, New American Heavy Underground, which you can find on t-shirts. And the catalog of Ascetic House—an art collective and tape label tied to Destruction Unit—likewise corrals sounds from the shadowy margins of accessibility. Eroding those superficial scene divisions dovetails with broader visions of liberation: Destruction Unit celebrated the release of its latest album, Negative Feedback Resistor, with the pioneering prison abolitionist group Critical Resistance, for instance. But for all of that refreshing commitment to activism and exploding aesthetic cliques, the album sounds rather familiar, an echo of its last full-length statement, Deep Trip, and the usual proto-punk touchstones. Destruction Unit's current lineup solidified by 2013’s Void. Previously, the handle was a vessel for vocalist and guitarist Ryan Rousseau, a refugee from the Reatards. With a new lineup, the Arizonan outfit favored up-tempo, punchy beats inherited from hardcore; riffs pitched to near-total scree; and barren, windswept passages reminiscent of the group’s forbidding but awesome Sonoran Desert surroundings. It was an estranged sort of psychedelia, distinguished by what felt like elemental terror from the American southwest, but with Destruction Unit’s latest album the same approach risks exhaustion. Repeatedly evoking an arid landscape is perilous work; inspiration could evaporate. That said, Negative Feedback Resistor is assaultive in a way that Void wasn’t. This is in no small part due to the rhythm section, which defaults to an up-tempo beat that lurches and bludgeons in the insistent style of Motörhead or even Discharge. With their reliance on halftime breakdowns and sharp drum patterns, Destruction Unit sound inspired by hardcore, but they leave out the concision. That’s too bad. The three-minute highlight ""If Death Ever Slept"" could lead a savage seven-inch. Instead, it’s easy to miss after the album’s midway slog through redundant nine- and seven-minute numbers. This lack of dynamics works better in the band's cataclysmic live show, where the band has few peers. But Negative Feedback Resistor’s relentlessness made me pine for Void’s atmospheric excursions. There are a few hazy, impressionistic moments, notably the introduction to ""Judgment Day"", but they feel appended rather than interwoven. And, as with many traits of Negative Feedback Resistor, the same could be said for Deep Trip. Indeed, Destruction Unit’s prior album opened with a song that pivots abruptly from sprint to halftime in much the same way as ""Disinfect"". Negative Feedback Resistor also harks to space-rock like Hawkwind, not to mention that the core riff for ""Salvation"" is essentially identical to the Stooges’ ""I Feel Alright"". Rousseau’s words are mostly inaudible, morphed into queasy, feverish missives, but the ongoing allusions to drugs and the bible indicated by song titles and lyrical snippets are frustratingly pat and disappointing. Off record, the band’s ideas about getting free are much more urgent, inventive, and contemporary than those psych clichés. Sadly, the band's stylistic conservatism has such a blurring effect on their records that any three tracks contain its total rewards.","The Phoenix psych-punk group Destruction Unit make a refreshing show of cross-genre camaraderie in a live setting and celebrated the release of their latest album with the pioneering prison abolitionist group Critical Resistance. But despite the commitment to activism and their exploding of aesthetic cliques, Negative Feedback Resistor sounds rather familiar.

Jawbox,Jawbox,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afdaea9e61561daa6511/1:1/w_160/43da0ecc.jpg,2015-09-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20892-jawbox/,DischordDeSotoDischordDeSoto,"Two of the best Dischord albums didn't actually come out on the legendary punk imprint. In 1994, Atlantic released Jawbox's For Your Own Special Sweetheart and that same year Epic issued Shudder to Think's Pony Express Record. Both groups had made their names on Dischord, and ""selling out"" was a fraught move for anyone from that world. While neither record made much of a mainstream impact, they were masterpieces that used a major label's resources to magnify, not dilute, an innovative sound formed in a close-knit Washington, D.C. punk scene. Jawbox had a unique approach to that aesthetic with their jazzy time signatures and noise-rock textures, and their major label debut arguably represents the pinnacle of D.C. post-hardcore, catching it just as it made its way into the alt-rock era. But if Jawbox reasonably fit into the mainstream three years after Nirvana broke, it wasn't meant to last. Beck's Mellow Gold also came out in 1994, leading the way for the stoned, sample-happy kitchen-sink pop that was about to push ideological punk-derived music aside. In the twilight of grunge, Sweetheart could get away with being defiantly noisy and raw. Two years later, Jawbox's self-titled finale, which is now being reissued, showed some signs of capitulation to an omnipresent college-radio sound. A certain passively disaffected mien creeps in here and there, an awkward fit for a famously earnest, intense, and hardworking band. But a few dated details detract little from the songwriting, where rampaging fury is tempered by calculating musicianship, pitch-conscious singing, and precise ethics disguised as cut-up squawks of code. Jawbox signed with Atlantic in order to play music full-time, not necessarily to become famous, and their contract wasn't onerous. They had a lot of freedom on Sweetheart and anatomized their sound on its greatest song, the angelically bruising ""Savory"". Nothing about it is hard-charging in the manner of classic hardcore punk; everything coils and squirms in an ominous quiet punctuated by deafening detonations. All of this is still true on Jawbox: J. Robbins' warm, chesty voice oscillates between an ominous croon and an octave-leaping peal. His guitar's spidery treble clashes against Bill Barbot's gnarled, almost bluesy licks, bent out of shape by a high-pressure rhythm section. Zach Barocas lays a volatile foundation, drumming around the beats at a slant, and Kim Coletta's bass embeds more zooms and fillips in outwardly brawny, inwardly delicate masses of sound. But ""preserved"" is an apt term, as the record sounds more canned than its predecessor, losing some of its palpable danger. Though the guitar attack can be ferocious, the former dynamic range is squeezed in. Barbot's guitar work is perhaps more inventive than ever before, but instead of exploding into being, it more often sidewinds in and out of the mix. Relaxed, almost boho passages on ""Mirrorful"", ""Desert Sea"", and ""Livid"" sound more like the Breeders and Pavement than Embrace and Rites of Spring, early emo-core bands that influenced Jawbox. My favorite song on the album is also their prettiest ever, ""Iodine"", a sleepy, melancholy ballad where Robbins sings, with unusual tenderness, over a limpid melody painted in liquid trails of guitar. There's even a hidden song, an unironic (if not overly reverent) cover of Tori Amos' ""Cornflake Girl"". You can't get much more ""120 Minutes"" than that. Signs of the times aside, there is plenty of peak Jawbox to be found. ""His Only Trade"" churns as thrillingly as ""Jackpot Plus!"" from Sweetheart, with Robbins' fiery vocal performance matching the urgent lyrics: ""Someday he's gonna wake up in a burning house and wonder what to save and wonder who to blame."" ""Empire of One"" finds a deep, exhilarating pocket in jungle drums and terse call-and-response vocals. ""Capillary Life"" is notably grand and subtle, with a multi-staged depth and scope elapsing in the usual three-or-so minutes. J. Robbins chants and spits like he means it. But what did he mean? ""Best of all,"" as he sings, ""it's open-ended."" You'd call the lyrics stream-of-consciousness if they weren't so focused, the phrases and delivery so sharply wrought. Robbins' cryptic tirades have a moral dimension and an aesthetic one; they accuse and self-lacerate; they are wary of systems and alert to betrayals of trust. Two frames in particular stand out. On ""Won't Come Off"", Robbins sings, ""One second cut from the arc of a swan dive, pulled out tight to the pitch of a taut line,"" as if encapsulating his band's situation and style: An arc of force that has been pulled straight, thrumming with the strength of its own will to bend back. ""At the bottom, they all want proof, and at the top, no one's making room,"" Robbins adds on ""Chinese Fork Tie"", as if diagnosing his position between an equally restive underground and mainstream. After their self-titled album, Jawbox's Atlantic sub-label disintegrated and mainstream music moved on from cleaning up punk bands. In their relatively brief existence, they made made a lasting impression on incoming waves of math-rock and post-punk bands with dissonant textures, awkward stop-start dynamics, and knotty instrumental phrasing. And if it's not their best album, their self-titled swan song, frequently cutting through its temporal trappings with that old desperation and drive, still holds up.","Jawbox's final album receives a welcome reissue. If it doesn't match the heights of its predecessor For Your Own Special Sweetheart, it still captures a powerful band in top form.

Edition 1,FenneszKing Midas Sound,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b078ea9e61561daa661a/1:1/w_160/4fcf0534.jpg,2015-09-23 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21014-edition-1/,Ninja Tune,"On London Zoo, the 2008 album from Kevin Martin's experimental dub project the Bug, one of the most nimble and beguiling tracks, ""You & Me"", was voiced by light-stepping Trinidadian singer-poet Roger Robinson. After that track, Martin and Robinson joined forces as King Midas Sound and followed with the 2009 full-length Waiting for You. Their latest project is a series of four EPs collaborating with an outside artist, beginning with this release with Austrian guitarist-composer Christian Fennesz. Those familiar with Martin’s brand of concussive dub and Fennesz’s elegant dance between electronic glitches and dulcet guitar washes might be taken aback by the hushed tones of this pairing. There’s very little of Martin’s telltale drum programming, while Fennesz’s singular guitar tone is hard to parse amid the hash of gray static that envelops almost everything here. Kiki Hitomi, who previously lent her voice to both the Bug and a KMS remix, does her best Beth Gibbons impersonation on the melancholic trip hop of ""On My Mind"", but its one of the few tracks with a discernible pulse. Robinson whispers a line about ""hold[ing] each other tight"" but everything about his voice on the record suggests the phantasmal, a now-departed ex-lover who returns only in a dream. When he slurs about searching for safe ground on the eerie ""Lighthouse"" it seems to have been recorded from inside an abandoned one. Edition 1 mimics the depression and subsequent grind and quiet desolation of a breakup so precisely that it's hard to take in all at once. And while the effect of such distant vocals works early on in the album, by the back half, it just sounds like every vocal was recorded over a poor cell phone connection, tinny and small. Robinson details the depression of a breakup in maddeningly mundane detail, muttering about going through the days in a ""weed fog""; subliminal rhythms fade in and out but the expected bass surge never arrives. The album fully comes to life only on the haunting 14-minute instrumental ""Above Water"". The dark melodic guitar elements on the record sound like Fennesz, but very little else is instantly traceable to him. Much of his discography involves collaboration with distinct artists like Ryuichi Sakamoto, Jim O’Rourke, and Sparklehorse, but what’s remarkable here is how Fennesz dissolves into the bleak landscape, his signature sound rendered indistinct, a loss of identity that mirrors the album's main theme.","The latest from Kevin Martin's experimental dub project is a series of four EPs collaborating with an outside artist, beginning with this release with Austrian guitarist-composer Christian Fennesz.

Half Free,U.S. Girls,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04db1335d7bf169a0bf/1:1/w_160/aaa3dd4e.jpg,2015-09-23 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20978-half-free/,4AD,"Three tracks into the new U.S. Girls album, Meghan Remy is awoken by a phone call from a girlfriend. She tells her about the bad dream she just had, in which her father emailed her a digital folder containing nude images of Remy taken when she was a child. But the really weird thing about it was—as Remy notes with a combination of embarrassment and pride—""I was kinda hot stuff. I mean, I don't know, I looked good—so it was kind of confusing."" What follows is a brief conversation about the peculiar relationship dynamic between fathers and daughters compared to moms and sons—Remy's friend concludes that if she had been born a boy, she'd be ""one of those sons that turns into a fascist dictator,"" while Remy retorts, ""instead of just another woman with no self-esteem."" Her sardonic punchline is punctuated by a burst of canned sitcom laughter—and, much like that infamous Rodney Dangerfield scene in Natural Born Killers, the device elicits more squirms than chuckles. But on Half Free, that bizarre exchange counts as comic relief. And even though this interlude—titled ""Telephone Play No. 1""—appears just six minutes into the record, it's still a necessary respite. By that point, we've already heard from the unhappily married wife of a man who had previously bedded her two sisters (""Sororal Feelings""), and a widow grieving her soldier husband's death over a riotous reggae groove (""Damn That Valley""). And there are several more tales of women with no self-esteem to come—unflinching portraits of ladies reeling from inattentive, cheating, or absentee lovers. So the seemingly random appearance of ""Telephone Play No. 1"" actually makes more sense as the album plays out. It's simply a verbal manifestation of what Remy's proper songs do musically: take us into the spaces that are supposed to provide us with solace—home, family, relationships—and make them feel awkward and uncomfortable. (As the dejected narrator of ""Sororal Feelings"" declares through a deceptively sunny harmony: ""Now I'm going to hang myself/ Hang myself from my family tree."") Likewise, Remy's music has always thrived on the conflict between the familiar and foreign. On previous U.S. Girls releases, her pop and experimental sensibilities—part Shangri-Las, part Sun Ra—were often at war with one another. (Take 2011's U.S. Girls on KRAAK, where the Ronettes-style romp ""State House (It's a Man's World)"" gets rudely elbowed into the free-form subterranean skronk of ""Sinkhole"", as if two opposing spirits were fighting for control of Remy's soul.) But, by building upon the grotto-bound R&B introduced on 2013's Free Advice Column EP (whose hip-hop-schooled producer, Onakabazien, returns here), Half Free further fortifies the common ground between Remy's diamond-cut melodies and avant-garde urges. The album sounds like your favourite golden-oldies station beamed through a pirate-radio frequency, seamlessly fusing '60s-vintage girl-group serenades and smooth '70s disco into dubby panoramas and horror-movie atmospherics. But even as its backdrop mutates from deep-house throbs to psych-rock guitar solos, Half Free always focuses your attention to where it should be: on Remy's radiant voice and vivid storytelling. She's the sort of songwriter who can set a 3D scene in a single line that simmers with suggestion—the first words we hear on the record are ""Well there were a four of us in a real small space/ Sharing more than just a family name,"" and you can immediately feel all the humidity and unease hanging in the room. The cinematically scaled production on Half Free only intensifies the domestic dramas playing out within her lyrics: the steady, string-swept build of disco reverie ""Window Shades"" mirrors the emotional breakthrough of its protagonist, a woman scorned who finally summons the courage to confront her philandering partner; the drizzling, slow-percolating beat of ""Red Comes in Many Shades"" provides the gray-skied ambience for Remy's tale of a doomed affair with an older paramour, all while her ""tears fall like rain."" And though ""Sed Knife""—an upbeat power-pop revision of a 2012 B-side—may seem like an outlier here, its images of kitchen-table tensions fit right into the album's theme. The women at the center of these songs are indeed half free: they're prisoners to bad choices, cruel circumstances, and duplicitous men—but they're starting to take control of their situation. And with the epic closer ""Woman's Work"", Remy leaves them with a neon-tinted, mirror-ball-twirling anthem to herald their impending liberation. ""You arrived in your mother's arms/ But you will leave riding in a black limousine,"" Remy seethes at a departing ex who's off to live the high life—or the afterlife—without her, but the defiance in her voice suggests she's richer for it. ""A woman's work is never done/ She doesn't sleep 'til the morning comes,"" chimes the Greek chorus behind her—and when applied to a creatively restless, audacious voice like Remy, it sounds less like a complaint than a promise.","The women on Half Free are indeed half free: They're prisoners to bad choices and duplicitous men, but they're starting to take control of their situation.

What a Time to Be Alive,DrakeFuture,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b12213d197565213a59e/1:1/w_160/725f9dcb.jpg,2015-09-23 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21102-what-a-time-to-be-alive/,EpicCash Money,"Superstar team-ups almost always seem better in theory. History suggests they are nearly twice as likely to produce a resounding dud as a working piece of art, and yet the prospect never ceases to excite us. When rumors began to swirl weeks ago that Drake and Future might be releasing a joint project, the Internet went into a frenzy. Watch the Throne parallels were drawn, fake cover art circulated, and a website countdown appeared as if to wish it into existence. What a Time to Be Alive materialized on Sunday*,* and the mixed results won't surprise anyone who has already noted the decided lack of chemistry between these two. There's been a Drake feature on every Future album, but none of them are particularly riveting, and on What a Time it's clearer than ever that they have difficulty sharing the same space. Many tracks are just Future songs with Drake verses tagged on (Future gets almost double the airtime), and Drake often sounds out of his element. When Future gets rolling on songs like ""Digital Dash"" and ""Live From the Gutter"", Drake is a bystander. The tape was allegedly born out of an impromptu, six-day recording session, and too many moments on it feel like they were thrown together in that time span. Drake probably shouldn’t be on a song called ""I’m the Plug"", for example, and the hook on ""Big Rings"" is terribly bland and awkward. This wasn't created with the care or the dutiful curation we've come to expect from both artists when solo. But that spontaneity is kind of the point of What a Time to Be Alive. Unlike Watch the Throne, which was presented as a grand statement album from self-coronated heads of rap royalty, What a Time is a tag-on release, a one-off that intentionally exists in the shadows of its 2015 predecessors as a bonus disc. Designating it a tape seemingly alleviates the pressure to curate. Meanwhile, Drake’s cushy Apple deal allows him to disseminate it for retail via iTunes and premiere it exclusively on his OVO Sound show on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio. It’s a low risk, high reward proposition. Both artists offer slightly watered-down versions of themselves: Drake offers snarky responses to his recent ghostwriting allegations (""I might take Quentin to Follies,"" ""The pen is working if you niggas need some ghostlines,"" etc.) and Future mentions internal struggles (""When you say you love a nigga do you really mean it?/ When I was sleepin' on the floor you shoulda seen how they treat me/ I pour the Actavis and pop pills so I can fight the demons,"" ""I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average""). It’s an odd juxtaposition, especially with Drake returning to the stiff, pinched ""yes, I wrote these, can’t you tell?"" style of his circa-2010 hashtag rap bars, with some truly dire results (""You remind me of a quarterback/ That shit is all in the past"", from ""Digital Dash"", needed a vigorous ""no"" from someone in the room). Even with Drake’s lazy punchlines, though, both he and Future are still great rap artists in their primes, and sometimes they figure things out just based on sheer talent. What the tape lacks in congruence, it makes up for in glimmering Metro Boomin production, and Drake throws Future the perfect alley-oop on ""Scholarship"" over his muffled synths. ""Jumpman"" is a certifiable banger. ""Diamonds Dancing"" is the first great Drake-Future collab that clicks on all cylinders. Of course, the brightest moments for both rappers come at the end of WATTBA when they are each allowed to work on their own and make music in their respective comfort zones—first Future on ""Jersey"", then Drake on the 40-produced ""30 for 30 Freestyle"", which showcases some of his best rapping in recent memory. It’s a disjointed but fitting end for a working relationship that’s still a work in progress.","What a Time to Be Alive was allegedly born out of an impromptu, six-day recording session between Drake and Future, and the mixed results won't surprise anyone who has already noted the decided lack of chemistry between the two.

"Dimming Awe, the Light Is Raw",Botany,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b093c0084474cd0c1c89/1:1/w_160/8c978e78.jpg,2015-09-22 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21031-dimming-awe-the-light-is-raw/,Western Vinyl,"Austin producer Spencer Stephenson, aka Botany, has lofty ambitions for his brand of warm, psych-inflected electronic music. Initially born as a side project from Stephenson's gig drumming for Denton electro-acoustic outfit Sleep Whale, Botany has since grown into a full-fledged solo act with a peculiar net of influences: sci-fi pulp novels, ""emergent"" music, beat architects Madlib and J Dilla, psych and krautrock, free jazz virtuosos. It’s no wonder Stephenson has described his music as ""studious,"" and often provides long, sometimes brainy explanations in interviews about what his mood-driven soundscapes are all about. Dimming Awe, the Light Is Raw, Stephenson’s second full-length under the Botany moniker, scours away the haze of his underrated 2013 debut Lava Diviner (True Story). That album, the soundtrack to an imagined sci-fi film about a ""geological religious sect hell-bent on destruction"", was dazed and occasionally too dense, but on Dimming Awe he winnows the widescreen approach down into what feels like a clear step forward in both quality and execution. Stephenson’s biggest strength as a producer is his ability to weave all of his influences—Eastern-based samples, throbbing hip-hop beats, stretches of noodly ambient—into alternatingly danceable and meditative psychedelia. Opening instrumental tracks ""Sungblood"" and ""Raw Light Overture"" bounce appealingly between xylophones, bright-eyed melodies, and lilting vocals, even if they hew a little close to Adult-Swim-commercial territory. The circuitous and unpredictable Chicago rapper Milo enlivens ""Au Revoir"" and the soporific ""No Translator"", the latter of which distinctly recalls FlyLo circa When the Quiet Comes. Milo is a good foil for Stephenson: The looped sampling of a laugh track and French chansons on ""Au Revoir"" neatly align with Milo’s meandering, stream-of-consciousness verses. ""Au Revoir"" and ""No Translator"" are also Stephenson's first time working with a rapper, an experiment that bodes well for a collaborative EP with Lushlife (featuring appearances from Shabazz Palaces and Open Mike Eagle) slated for next year. Stephenson has said that much of this album was improvised, his way of taking cues from jazz favorites like Herbie Hancock and Pharoah Sanders. You can hear it in the improv drumming that clatters around in the background of ""Birthjays"" and the synth ad libbing that drives ""All Is Rite"", little touches of ingenuity that insist upon repeat listens in order to catch all the different nuances at play. In a world as carefully constructed and satisfying as Dimming Awe, it's a worthwhile requirement.","Spencer Stephenson's second full-length under the Botany moniker, Dimming Awe, the Light Is Raw scours away the haze of his underrated 2013 debut.

Inevitable,Natasha Kmeto,by: Britt Julious,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ef13d197565213a54b/1:1/w_160/c500c1c2.jpg,2015-09-22 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21072-inevitable/,Dropping Gems,"Electronic producer Natasha Kmeto has described her new album Inevitable not as a conceptual project, but as a reflection of herself. Within the past year, she's spoken frankly about her coming out experience, a development in her sexual identity that has found its way into her music. Her awareness developed in large part on the dance floor, manifesting in a colossal yet loving environment that also served as a space for personal catharsis. Inevitable brings this catharsis to her listeners. Kmeto's vocals have always been a tool in the production of her past works, but they ring out with clear and present force on Inevitable. Her singing is forthright but also verging on breaking, as if she was struck by a sudden wave of vulnerability. From the record’s first seconds, she telegraphs how different the stakes are for her: On opener and title track ""Inevitable"" she pleads ""When you coming back, baby? When you coming back?/ I will love you down, baby, when you’re coming back."" The unadorned sound and raw sentiment send a powerful message: Take me for who I am. Inevitable sounds sharper and smoother than Crisis, but it still feels raw, like the sort of music that is ripped in desperation out of the heart and guts—the truly messy parts—of its creator. There is an unfinished charm to her music; the components of the tracks sound like they don’t (or shouldn’t) mesh together. Kmeto’s voice shimmers on ""Inevitable"" while the slow, rumbling and minimalist instrumentation dies just short of a climactic peak. It seems incomplete, but Kmeto saves it with the vividness of her lyrics and the quiver of her voice. Kmeto has been compared to Grimes and Maya Jane Coles, but those comparisons feel flimsy at best. Kmeto is better understood next to the criminally underrated Cooly G. Both make music lyrically fueled by desire, exploring the possibilities of unspoken meaning found in mood, in space and silence, and in carefully considered lyricism. The music builds as the stakes do as well. On ""I Thought You Had a Boyfriend"", one of the strongest tracks on the record, Kmeto sings about a confusing romantic connection. ""Your eyes, lingered on me as you said goodbye,"" she sings at the outset. ""And our hands held a little bit longer than what would seem polite."" Kmeto sounds at once frustrated and open, and as the song progresses, the synths build and build to an overwhelming wall of sound. Is it the rising bite to Kmeto’s words as she sings on the chorus that makes the song so unsettling? ""I thought you had a boyfriend/ I thought you had a man,"" she says. ""I thought it wasn’t like that/ I thought you had a plan."" After two verses, the synths wash over the listener like a tidal wave of emotions as she repeats the chorus again and again. Kmeto doesn’t ask a question, but she does demand an answer. Other strong songs on the record fit this same structure. ""Closer Comes My Love"" at first sounds like a sensual slow jam, but peaks in cacophony. ""Peak"", more of a traditional dance track, has straightforward lyrics that pair seamlessly with the slight dubstep flourishes found in the track's final minutes. Unlike her young peers also creating soulful jams (Tinashe, Jhené Aiko), Kmeto’s music refuses to slink into the background. On Inevitable, Kmeto’s personal awakening blooms into her music, both lyrically and structurally. As queer identity gets shoved aside with the mainstreaming of electronic music, as if the queer community didn't fuel the genre's formation, it's more vital than ever to have voices like Kmeto's bringing it to the forefront. This, without question, is a record of discovery and confusion as much as it is about the power of confidence in understanding and loving oneself. Inevitable is a collection of slowly ripping cords, the underlying tension manifesting on tracks as if Kmeto must manage simmering emotions and can’t, or maybe won’t.","Electronic producer Natasha Kmeto has spoken frankly about her coming out experience, a development in her sexual identity that has found its way into her music.

Allas Sak,Dungen,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02813d197565213a3fd/1:1/w_160/94d27bd8.jpg,2015-09-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20949-allas-sak/,Mexican Summer,"In 2004, when Dungen released their third and still-greatest LP, Ta Det Lungt, the Swedish quartet was just one good act amid a minor psych-rock renaissance. At the time, a number of bands were finding inspiration in progressive rock from the '60s and '70s and pushing those sounds toward fuzzier and more frantic extremes. This was also the year that Santa Cruz's Comets on Fire released their well-loved record, Blue Cathedral, and around the same time that Dead Meadow, Pearls and Brass, and Boris were putting out some of their best music. Ten years later, a lot of these groups have split up, moved on, or faded from view, but Dungen have proven surprisingly durable, even a bit influential. It’s hard to listen to Tame Impala’s Innerspeaker and Lonerism without hearing some parallels to the Swedish band, particularly in the sense of rhythm and the doubled upper-register vocal melodies. Allas Sak is Dungen’s first release in five years and seventh album overall. Not too much has changed since their last record, 2010’s Skit I Allt. Like that album, Allas Sak is split almost evenly between Swedish-language pop songs and instrumentals. And like all preceding Dungen records, it sounds awesome. Led by singer, multi-instrumentalist, and engineer Gustav Ejstes, the band is able to perfectly dial in the organic tones of vintage '60s pop, even when working with computer-based recording software. While Dungen have never quite bested Ta Det Lungt in terms of pop uplift and songwriting, the band have also never made a truly bad record. Rather, they have remained remarkably consistent, so much so that by the time 4 came out in 2008, audiences had probably started to take them for granted—one more record, one more Keith Moon-style drum fill, one more expertly-fuzzed guitar solo. But after half a decade off, Allas Sak provides some great evidence for why Dungen have endured while so many of their peers have trailed off. Though Ejstes initially wrote all of the songs and even performed most of the band’s music, over the years Dungen have gradually become a group effort, with a dedicated band including guitarist Reine Fiske and drummer Johan Holmegard, and bassist Mattias Gustavsson. As a result, they’ve gotten progressively jammier from album to album. But while Dungen’s music has its share of sprawling moments, it’s seldom aimless. Even in their most improvisational passages, the band’s songs move with intention—one solo or spaced-out interlude setting up the next climax or scene shift. Of the record’s instrumentals, only the guitar-driven freak-out ""En Dag På Sjön"" sounds like it was clipped from a spontaneous jam session, while the rest are deliberate and composed. On ""Franks Kaktus"", Ejstes performs the lead melody on a flute, trading riffs with the guitar and guiding the band in and out of a bongo-laden groove. As smooth as the music is, though, it doesn’t come off as arch or ironic. Indeed, you can hear evidence of Ejstes earnestly vibing out every time his notes go slightly sharp—the wind equivalent of a bent guitar note or scrunchy face. On ""Flickor Och Pojkar"", a delicate Rhodes piano melody is gradually augmented with string and acoustic guitar flourishes that sweep across the stereo field. The music recalls the work of film composer Ennio Morricone in its attention to arrangement and sonic detail. This obsession over small moments and gestures is important to the Swedish band’s music. A lot of psychedelic rock is focused on the big-picture freak-out—the zonked experimental and spontaneous moment where the music becomes combustible and uncontrollable. And while Dungen are capable of producing those moments, the band have always set their primary focus on hooks, both in a rhythmic and melodic sense. Just about any four bars of a Dungen song could be sampled and looped as the foundation for something else. And though the group’s music appropriates sounds and production styles from the past, it’s hard to think of a particular act from the '60 or '70s that Ejstes is consciously emulating. Rather, Dungen use retro-minded instrumentation and recording techniques to convey fairly modern musical ideas, removed from the established sounds of classic rock and psych. The rhythm section, in particular, takes a strong influence from the feel and pulse of hip-hop. In this, they’re a little like Stereolab, another band that drew heavily from vintage experimental music, but who would never be mistaken for revivalists.

Music Complete,New Order,by: T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b099ea9e61561daa6650/1:1/w_160/b93895b1.jpg,2015-09-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21036-music-complete/,Mute,"In his new memoir, Chapter and Verse, New Order frontman Bernard Sumner recalls the exact moment that the band, having only recently changed their name from Joy Division to New Order in the wake of Ian Curtis’ death, opted for a change in direction that would forever alter their career. ""Our music had become so incredibly dark and cold, we couldn’t really get any darker or colder,"" he says. ""I remember quite clearly sitting in a club in New York one night, around three or four o’clock in the morning, and thinking how great it would be if we made music, electronic music, that could be played in one of these clubs."" The rest, of course, is history. New Order would go on to become one of the most successful and innovative dance acts of all time, creating an aesthetic that split the difference between guitar-heavy post-punk and club-ready dance music. Some 30 years later, New Order continue to develop and refine the template they essentially created with surprisingly positive results. Music Complete is New Order’s 10th studio album, and for all intents and purposes, it’s the first thing they’ve recorded since 2005’s Waiting for the Sirens' Call (2012’s long-delayed Lost Sirens was essentially a hodgepodge of Waiting outtakes). It also reflects a series of shifts within the band, created after the departure of bassist Peter Hook and reintroducing original keyboardist Gillian Gilbert back into the fold. For longtime fans, the acrimonious departure of Hook is potentially worrisome, as his melodic basslines were so integral to many of New Order’s most beloved tracks. As it turns out, they needn’t have worried too much. New bassist Tom Chapman, who formerly played with Sumner in Bad Lieutenant, creates a pretty faithful simulacrum of Hook's signature sound both live and on record. Having largely eschewed the heavy guitars that weighed down much of their output for the past decade, New Order embrace electronics again on Music Complete, conjuring the kind of synth washes and house-y piano runs that could have easily pulsed across their records during their mid-'80s heyday, making for what is arguably the most refined record they’ve released since 1989’s Technique. The 11 tracks on Music Complete essentially touch on all the things that New Order do best, from the wistful melancholy of the record’s first single, ""Restless""—a lovely ""Regret""-like bummer ode to the perils of never being satisfied—to the pounding eurodisco of ""Tutti Frutti"", it is as if the band tried to assemble a record based on all of their most iconic vibes. In large part, they manage to succeed. On even their most classic records, New Order can be amazingly inconsistent, the truly great songs always eclipsing the simply forgettable ones. In this way, Music Complete is no exception. ""Plastic"" is the most inspired bit of dance music the band has recorded in years—a sprawling seven-minute bit of Moroder-ish synesthesia in which Sumner’s perfectly affectless vocal—""It’s official, you’re fantastic, you're so special, so iconic""—plays against tastefully employed bits of Chic guitar jangles and a classically New Order-ish bassline that somewhere is making Hooky's head explode. It’s really the only track on the record that belongs on the same kind of rarefied dance floor as classic New Order jams like ""True Faith"" and ""Fine Time""—which means it’s the kind of slick, slightly chilly, and grandly magisterial electro pop that is essentially begging to be remixed into some kind of ecstatic 12” version that can play on a loop for days. Elsewhere, ""Singularity"" opens with what literally sounds like an old Joy Division outtake—an ominous bassline and some warped guitar lines that sound as if they were being played in a room just adjacent to the actual recording studio—before exploding into a digitized electro banger, while ""People on the High Line"" could be a distant cousin to Republic’s ""World"", complete with chorus-echoing female backup vocals. ""Tutti Frutti""—one of three tracks featuring additional vocals from La Roux’s Elly Jackson—reaches for a similar state of dancefloor euphoria and almost gets there. As always, Sumner’s lyrics are hit and miss (""You got me where it hurts / but I don’t really care/ ‘Cause I know I’m OK / Whenever you are there."") but he always manages to sell it effortlessly. In fact, effortlessness has always been New Order’s greatest trick. The best tracks on Complete are the kind of tastefully deployed dance track that the band has spent decades articulating—perfect, polished, airtight—but one can’t help but wish that Music Complete had a few more of them on board. The record’s weakest tracks are generally the most tepid. ""Academic"" and ""The Game"", while certainly not terrible, suffer from being both unmemorable and somehow overly familiar, sounding like a dozen or so other fine but mostly unremarkable New Order tracks haunting the latter halves of previous albums. Elsewhere, ""Stray Dog""—a track featuring a long spoken word passage growled by none other than Iggy Pop—would make for an appropriately larky B-side, but is something of a momentum killer when placed squarely in the middle of a pop album. The record does end on a high note though, with the swooning ""Nothing but a Fool"" adding the requisite dollop of perfectly-metered melancholy and album-closing ballad ""Superheated"" (featuring Brandon Flowers in what one can only imagine is his ultimate wet dream of a guest spot) bringing all the feelings to a charmingly earnest song about lost love that sounds like it could/should have played during the penultimate scene of a John Hughes movie (in the best way possible). For longtime fans, Music Complete is something of a return to form for New Order—complete with appropriately chic minimalist artwork courtesy of Peter Saville. The record’s carefully considered aesthetic and meticulous production bear all the hallmarks of the band’s most iconic work. Still, it’s hard to know if anyone other than the band’s legions of devotees will find most of this material truly arresting. Music Complete certainly doesn’t do anything to diminish New Order’s formidable legacy, but it doesn’t necessarily expand upon it either. That being said, it still sounds like classic New Order, and now over three decades deep into their career, it's kind of amazing that nothing else really does.","Having largely eschewed the heavy guitars that weighed down much of their output for the past decade, New Order embrace electronics again on Music Complete.

b’lieve i’m goin down,Kurt Vile,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9bea9e61561daa64a5/1:1/w_160/5f30eab1.jpg,2015-09-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20840-kurt-vile-blieve-im-goin-down/,Matador,"Kurt Vile has a persona, and you know him by now: He is the weird quiet kid in the corner, the one who seems at first lost in his own world and disconnected from everything around him, but turns out to be smart, observant, and low-key hilarious. So while his albums draw you in with the vibe—the impeccably recorded and mixed songs that shuffle bits of folk, new wave, or country in the mix but are always squarely down-the-middle rock—you return to them for their human qualities, the way they offer a manner of seeing the world, a glimpse at a perspective that feels both voyeuristic and easy to connect to your own life. You have to feel for Vile when he does early interviews for one of his records and he’s asked to characterize them. Music writers look for a story, an angle, a hook, and he gamely tries to give them one, a reason why an upcoming record is different from his last few. In the case of b’lieve i’m goin down, he pointed out that it was darker, an album from the night, written in the lonely quiet hours after his wife and two children had gone to sleep. (My favorite quote on this came from his interview with Rolling Stone: ""It’s definitely got that night vibe…KV’s Night Life—it’s my sequel to Donald Fagen’s The Nightfly""). But Vile’s albums mostly vary in smaller details; they are collections of songs that generally draw from a similar handful of influences, and Vile’s style as a guitarist, songwriter, and especially a vocalist keep them relatively uniform. His arc so far has been a process of refinement, of gradually figuring out settings in which the songs work best. On b’lieve i’m goin down, that means he’s incorporated a bit of banjo and a bit more piano and has eased off just slightly on the reverb. The essential quality of his music is no different, but the banjo picking draws out a bit of folkiness, and piano shifts things slightly from capital-R Rock to singer-songwriter territory. But many of these songs could have just as easily been found on either of his last two full-lengths, which in his case is not a bad thing. Something that has changed over the years is that Vile has grown steadily funnier, and his lyrics have grown more sophisticated. Humor was always part of his music, but on b’lieve i’m goin down it’s an animating principle. Lines like ""When I go out I take pills to take the edge off or to just take a chillax, forget about it/ Just another certified badass out for a night on the town"" scan as goofy on the page, but in the context of the arrangement of ""That’s Life, tho (almost hate to say)"" they become something else entirely. The song is a dark, doom-laden thing, with fingerpicked guitar out of ""Can’t Find My Way Home"" and a bleak undercurrent of synth, something in the realm of Nick Drake in ""Black Eyed Dog"" mode. In this setting, Vile’s tossed-off musings, where punchlines alternate with striking imagery (""I hang glide into the valley of ashes""), remind you that every sage worth a damn knew that life was absurdly funny and tragic simultaneously. The quotable lines are many. It’s been a while since I heard a description of a hangover as evocative as ""A headache like a ShopVac coughing dust bunnies""; ""I’m an Outlaw""’s banjo accompaniment might make you think of a folk ballad, but Vile’s outlaw is like one you’ve never seen, one ""on the brink of self-implosion, alone in a crowd on the corner, in my Walkman in a snow globe going nowhere slow."" ""Pretty Pimpin"" describes a moment of existential confusion in front of the bathroom mirror, with Vile brushing a stranger’s teeth before realizing ""they were my teeth, and I was weightless""—whoops. ""Lost my Head there"" has a piano riff like the theme from an early '80s sitcom, but played a step too slow, like you’re about to watch the usual ridiculous ""Three’s Company""-style misunderstanding happening in drug-induced slow motion. But then it turns out to be a tune about its own creation, and Vile’s description forever colors how you hear it: ""I was buggin’ out about a couple-two-three things/ Picked up my microphone and started to sing/ I was feeling worse, than the words come out/ Fell on some keys and then this song walked out."" As compelling as Vile’s words can be, much of the magic lies in his delivery. Like Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, and Bob Dylan, Vile’s singing voice has acquired an unstable accent of indeterminate origin that shifts to suit his musical decisions, rather than connecting to genre or region or even his own upbringing. Most often, he’s got a nasally twang unlike that of any other native Philadelphian, and it helps his low-key murmur cut through the wooly mid-tempo haze. That twang makes his music feel more grounded and conversational, and there’s also a bit of a ""Hey, it’s me again"" quality the first time you hear it on a new album, an aural watermark that never leaves you any doubt that you are listening to a Kurt Vile record. Vile’s signature qualifier is ""I guess…""—the phrase shows up frequently in his songs. It’s easy to believe he’s never quite sure of what he’s seeing or exactly how he’s feeling. Vile’s version of reality is always slightly confused, a blurry approximation of what’s out there, one in a state of constant revision. This could strike some as lazy, like he can’t be bothered to whittle the blunt stick of his music down to a fine point, and it’s this perpetually fuzzy quality that leads people to label Vile a spaced-out stoner. But from another angle the uncertainty feels honest, an acknowledgement that a great deal of life involves making it up as you go along. Or as Vile puts it on ""Dust Bunnies"", ""There ain’t no manual to our minds, we’re always looking, baby, all the time."" Vile now plays ""rock"" in the most '70s sense of the word—album oriented, guitar solo-friendly, very much about long-haired dudes sitting in a room playing instruments. That he’s hitting his peak as an artist at a time when rock music of the type he practices is falling out of favor and is becoming just another genre instead of the center of the musical universe only adds to his appeal; this is not an artist concerned with being in step. Vile’s relevance to the music world at large rises and falls, but he keeps plowing ahead, secure in the knowledge that in an examined life there will always be more to explore, another bleary morning with another unfamiliar face looking back at you over the bathroom sink.","Kurt Vile's albums draw you in with the vibe, but you return to them for their human qualities, the way they offer a manner of seeing the world.

Thirst Trap EP,DonMonique,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02f13d197565213a40b/1:1/w_160/e1df9711.jpg,2015-09-21 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20954-thirst-trap-ep/,self-released,"On her very first EP, Thirst Trap, DonMonique, an unconventional young rapper from Brooklyn, slinks out the gate with two conventional rap album tropes: the voicemail, and the skit. ""You's a fake and your man's a clown,"" she raps on the intro, leveling barbs at an invisible adversary.  She recalls the huffy, hedonistic bravura of Lil' Kim—right down to calling your man a bird. ""If he with me then you know I make him eat it proper, cuff my hands and show me if you're down to be the poppa, poppa."" Wielding Biggie's nickname like punctuation, it's inarguable that she's paying homage to one of her borough's finest. ""Phone Call"" resumes the schtick, this time over a beat. It's ""Phone Tap"" minus the mise en scène: an old school, pre-social media kind of goading. The message is that DonMonique, without being too Joey Bada$$ precious about it, feels like an old school rapper. Stelios Phili, DonMonique's producer, helps further the allusion. Of the seven beats that follow the intro, no less than three invoke the crisp, airy, neck-cracking loops of the late '90s. ""UNTLD"", in particular, channels Blunted on Reality-era Fugees. Brrrraps waft about the track while guest rappers Remy Banks and Wara duck and weave, playing the Pras and 'Clef to DonMonique's sneering Lauryn. ""Jada"", the EP's closer, fades out with a clip featuring Jada Pinkett in the classic all-women heist flick, Set It Off. And on ""Fifty Kay"", over Stelios' brisk drums, guest rapper Noah Caine makes all these '90s fantasies explicit: ""Me and Don the new Biggie and Kim."" Danny Brown, who worked through his own formative influences before breaking out to become one of rap's premiere weirdos, cuts enthusiastically in like a Kramer entrance on ""Tha Low"", which features a honky-tonk piano loop over smoke-thick bass and boom bap drums. His presence energizes what is otherwise a classic street-to-stage come-up story (DonMonique's said that it's inspired by Wu-Tang's ""C.R.E.A.M."") ""I don't serve no more, bookin' shows off the flows,"" raps DonMonique. On the next verse Brown mirrors the sentiment by looking back: ""Remember when I was thirsty, couldn't even afford the orange juice."" What makes Thirst Trap more than just a series of recycled flows are songs like ""ION"". It's the most pop-sounding track on the EP, with slithering hi-hats and an Auto-Tuned hook that bears traces of the now. I's good, but not the album's best song. With Thirst Trap, DonMonique makes a case for a certain kind of nostalgia: one that's not about lifting classic cadences and rhyme schemes, or cloyingly idealizing the more noble values of a bygone era. This is not a treatise on real hip-hop. Instead, DonMonique zooms in on the lean, mean rapping that made Brooklyn hot.","DonMonique is a young Brooklyn rapper who feels old-school without being too precious about it.  She recalls the huffy, hedonistic bravura of Lil Kim and zooms in on the lean, mean rapping that made Brooklyn hot.

Wasted Days,Sam Binga,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ff5e6ef9596932206c/1:1/w_160/de2d705d.png,2015-09-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21084-wasted-days/,Critical,"Sam Binga's defining characteristic as a producer seems to be generosity. To his fans—he's maintained a frenetic release pace since early last decade (often under his Baobinga alias)—but mostly to other artists, as the majority of those releases feature collaborations with vocalists or other producers. This tends to be the first thing anyone mentions about Binga, and while it's refreshing, especially in electronic music, to see an artistic approach other than Genius Lone Wolf, it's also resulted in a highly variable catalog that has obscured anything resembling a signature touch or sound. Wasted Days, Binga's proper debut record, again features a host of MCs and offers a robust 17 tracks (a four-sided LP version is trimmer) but stands as his most realized and bountiful work yet, synthesizing two decades of UK bass music into something vigorous and modern. Binga is a child of UK rave culture, and his production style has flitted between drum'n'bass, grime, and dubstep. Grime's resurgence, as both a pop and underground phenomenon, has refocused UK music's relationship with dancehall culture, as MCs have increasingly stepped back into the booth. Before grime, though, MCs played a large role in DJ sets, toasting over jungle and UK garage sets. It's this loose, improvisational feel that defines Wasted Days, as vocalists shuffle through tracks Binga has tailored to showcase their slurring patois. Their muddied taunts and boasts offer crucial texture and melody to Binga’s drum-heavy chambers, leaving the tracks in a liminal space between structured song craft and narrative-driven rap. Putting a precise name on Binga’s productions proves difficult. They have the tempos and streamlined tech-y-ness of modern-day drum’n’bass (the album is on Critical Recordings, the pre-eminent home for underground drum’n’bass in 2015), eschewing cut-up breakbeats in favor of sound design. Its slithering melodies and dub-heavy sound recall grime and dubstep, and rap and footwork has seeped into Binga’s work just as it has general UK dance culture. It’s the rare record for which the imprecision of the term ""bass music"" is a positive. At times Wasted Days feels like someone shined a spotlight into whatever dungy corner Kevin Martin’s the Bug project has inhabited the past few years, fumigating the living room and disinfecting the kitchen. The two share a love for UK soundsystem culture, but Binga’s version is far less blunted and menacing. On tracks like ""Mind and Spirit"" and the title cut (featuring frequent Martin collaborator Warrior Queen) Binga’s productions advance in sustained, athletic bursts, moving explosively between verses. Opener ""Believe"" largely consists of a rapid bursts of sub-kicks, leaving plenty of headroom for MCs Redders and Rider Shafique’s id-driven swagger. On ""Stormy Weather"" and ""Reclaim"" (which features fellow bass explorer Om Unit) Binga manages to ease off the gas and offer more contemplative work without sounding lame or maudlin. They offer just enough variety, even if the combination of Binga and the MCs suggests harder/better/faster/stronger is the correct impulse. What’s remarkable though is how well Wasted Days comes together, and how easy it is to return to a 17-track collaborative album of indeterminate style; the degree of difficulty in actually pulling this off shouldn’t be understated, and you need look no further than the last Bug album to see how easily this kind of project can bog down. Wasted Days manages to provide a grand stage not just for the MCs but, at last, for Binga’s talents as well.","Binga's second proper record stands as his most realized and bountiful work yet, synthesizing two decades of UK bass music into something vigorous and modern.

Sleep,Max Richter,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0579d034d5c69bf4869/1:1/w_160/82f36973.jpg,2015-09-21 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20987-sleep/,Deutsche Grammophon,"It is hard to know what to make of Sleep, the new eight-hour album and therapeutic project from the perennially audacious British composer Max Richter. On one hand, the purpose is simple: Richter intends for the listener to press ""play"" on the full-length digital version, nod off to sleep somewhere between the patient piano chords of ""Dream 1"" and the vocal-and-organ ululations of ""Path 3,"" and re-emerge after eight hours of music to a gentle crescendo of stretching strings, wordless harmonies, and long-tone bass near the close of ""Dream 0"". By consulting with famed neuroscientist and past collaborator David Eagleman, Richter has created a slow-motion, electronics-and-chamber-ensemble hybrid meant to reinforce and reflect natural sleep cycles. ""An invitation to dream,"" Richter has called it. On the other hand, the third-of-a-day span between the beginning and the end isn’t some inert, sustained tone, simply meant to maintain a snooze. Instead, it’s an ever-shifting set of meticulously performed pieces that both affirm and expand Richter’s reach as a composer. He webs together string quartets and electronic drones, tense duets for piano and violin, and somnolent keyboard meditations. Richter brings most of his interests as a composer to bear here, too. He blends an Arvo Pärt-like sense of motion with deep, low notes and shimmering drones that reflect his past in electronica and adoration of Brian Eno. His love of high-minded concepts, previously reflected by the likes of his essential The Blue Notebooks, meets his exquisite, human touch as a pianist. So should you use Sleep as directed, as ""a landscape … where people could fall asleep""? Or should you sit upright and let the beguiling Richter ease your daylight hours? Can you actually do both? Richter, of course, is not alone in his quest to help listeners rest better. Sleep is an active avenue of both art and commerce—in large part, it would seem, because we do not get enough of it. The ceaseless streams of social media feeds and on-demand entertainment have intensified that diagnosis. According to Sleepless in America, a National Institutes of Health-supported documentary aired last year by National Geographic, the average person now dozes thousands of hours less than they once would have, a condition that comes with profound physical and mental symptoms. Instead, we spend billions of dollars every year on ways to get more sleep, from medicines that induce it and conditions that foster it to beds that support it and systems that monitor it. We write books meant to reward children for falling asleep, and in a rather Orwellian twist, we weed out employees whose sleep disorders might disrupt productivity. And when we do get it, we brandish it, whether bragging about how good it felt, analyzing our dreams, or funneling pieces of the experience into art. A recent show in New York sampled centuries of art inspired by hypnagogia, that surreal state of mind just between wake and sleep; in 2013, the hotel chain Ibis introduced a feature to guests that tracked their nocturnal movements and transformed them into a lysergic piece of ""Sleep Art"". Sleep fascinates exactly as it frustrates, creating a reflexive cycle that never actually ends. For these 31 uninterrupted pieces, Richter accepts the extraordinary challenge of not only aiding sleep but also translating the act into art—that is, he scores a scene he sets himself. If you listen while you’re awake, many of these pieces conjure dreamy states, where ideas seem fluid and flexible and the world around you seems somehow softer. ""Aria 2"", which arrives in the piece’s final third, turns a sublime piano phrase into a seemingly infinite maze, as though you could follow it forever and never go anywhere. Strings and electronics wash around the melody in waves, oscillating glacially between a few glowing notes like Sigur Rós at their most romantic or Stars of the Lid at their most staid. ""If You Came This Way"" suggests the sweeping, soaring motion of a symphony, though muted and slightly distant, as if it were being played in another room of the same building. The action grows grand only for an instant, testing the limits of your reverie only to galvanize it a moment later. And the gorgeous ""Song / Echo"" seems to do for chamber pop what Grouper has long done for folk rock—disassemble it and scatter the elements in a cloud, making something so wide and gentle that you think you might be able to live inside it. You can snooze in any of these songs. Just don't think about all you will miss. In talking about this eight-hour nightlight of sound, Richter has often lamented the pace of the modern world and the torrent of information that many of us must face each day. ""We have to curate our own information space and that’s quite a big deal to do,"" he told The Quietus. ""You’ll still have to make tons and tons of choices and spend so much of the day reading all these different messages which will give you tons of reading. So sometimes a pause is a good thing."" That idea aligns Richter with the researchers and marketers trying to give people a chance to check out for eight consecutive, recuperative hours, yes. But his use of the word ""pause"" also reflects the way I’ve enjoyed Sleep the most—not as a sleep aid but instead as a relaxing agent. Most of this music is indeed calming not to the point of boredom, where I need to sleep through it, but so that I simply want to sit still and listen and ponder. And though Richter took considerable pains to make Sleep seamless, the payoff of hearing it as a whole (a rather exhausting proposition, ironically) versus the resources required to do so is incredibly low. The music shifts between and slowly recycles parts, so you consistently wind up at some place very close to the start. Instead, I like to push ""play"" in random places and listen for an hour or so, a move that allows me to hear Richter at glorious work and gives me the chance for the restorative ""pause"" for which he’d hoped. This music is absorbing. You'll want to pay attention, to shut out other concerns. The stretch between the narcotic ""Chorale / Glow"" and the twinkling ""Non-eternal"" is perhaps my favorite segment for this reason; it’s an immersive sampler of Richter’s past successes and some new ideas, blurring into one. Sleep, then, is simply too didactic as a name. It’s a command that tells us how to enjoy something that clearly has other uses. That handle, combined with Richter’s conceit, has turned the record into a kind of clickbait story, too, which seems entirely antithetical to Richter’s point. (""That 8-Hour Sleep Album—Explained,"" offers the Time headline.) Pause and Rest come closer to Richter’s ultimate goal of simply taking some time out from the whirlwind around you. At its best, Sleep feels like compositionally rigorous new age music. It’s a place in which you can settle for a while, with or without a pillow, and emerge only when you are ready to rejoin the restive world.","The audacious composer Max Richter has created an eight-hour piece meant to serve as a sleep aid.

"Yours, Dreamily",The Arcs,by: Max Mertens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e5ea9e61561daa66c1/1:1/w_160/49a917fd.jpg,2015-09-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21064-yours-dreamily/,Nonesuch,"While he's best known as one half of the Black Keys, Dan Auerbach's built himself quite a resume of extracurricular actives in the past few years, largely behind the boards. He's produced for artists including Ray LaMontagne and New Orleans piano legend Dr. John, and helped give Lana Del Rey's Ultraviolence its sweeping, cinematic sheen.With his latest side-project the Arcs, the guitarist and vocalist steps back into the spotlight, recruiting Truth and Soul Records founder Leon Michels, Black Keys touring bassist Richard Swift, Menahan Street Band member Homer Steinweiss, Amy Winehouse collaborator Nick Movshon, and guitarist Kenny Vaughan. Instead of coming across as a ""Dan Auerbach & Co."" record though, Yours, Dreamily strikes a more collaborative balance, with all members receiving songwriting credits and an overall feeling of longtime friends jamming ego-free in basements (never mind the fact one of those practice spaces was New York's Electric Lady Studios). In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Auerbach said they were inspired by ""old soul records, Captain Beefheart, and newer hip-hop"". Much like Auerbach and Patrick Carney's well-meaning but poorly-executed rap-rock experiment BlakRoc, the album was recorded quickly in two weeks, though fans of the Akron, Ohio's last stadium rock duo standing will find plenty to enjoy here. Rollicking opener ""Outta My Mind"" could easily be a lost Black Keys Attack & Release B-side and the Arcs incorporate a love of psychedelia and the Stax Records catalog more successfully than the group's last outing. There's a lot of influences coming together here, but they work sonically, from the clop of horses and bird chirps on the country-tinged ""Everything You Do (You Do for You)"" to the orgiastic shrieks and frenzied saxophone on ""Come & Go"". While nobody's claiming to be innovating wildly here, the biggest flaw of Yours, Dreamily lies in its ham-fisted and occasionally rote lyrics (""Pistol Made of Bones"" is the biggest offender). With the exception of the horn-heavy, Junior Kimbrough-referencing ""Velvet Ditch"", which Auerbach says was inspired by a motorcycle trip he took from Nashville to Clarksdale, Miss., too many of the songs here come off like failed attempts to write a Muscle Shoals version of ""Bad Blood"". It's not the first time he's sung about ill-fated romance (his acrimonious split with wife Stephanie Gonis in 2013 made tabloid and music blog headlines alike)—see also his 2009 solo album Keep It Hid—but over the course of 14 tracks, it grows slightly repetitive. Thankfully, his wearied tales get a welcome assist from Brooklyn-based all-female mariachi band Flor de Toloache, who provide ghostly backup vocals and a much-needed sense of perspective on slow-burning highlights ""Put a Flower in Your Pocket"" and quasi-ballad ""Chains of Love"" (disappointingly not an Erasure cover). On tender lead single ""Stay in My Corner"" (inspired by the May 2015 boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao), he pleads his allegiance to a lover claiming ""I will fight for you"" but it sounds like it's himself he's trying to convince. Like that fight, the Arcs will draw audiences (they've already been booked as a musical guest on an upcoming episode of ""Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" and are sure to be a lock for the festival circuit) and Yours, Dreamily draws spirited performances from its players, but works best as a one-off event.","For his latest solo record, Black Keys frontman Dan Auerbach recruits a free-ranging band and jams out a loose, soul-inspired record that feels like longtime friends playing ego-free in basements.

Honeymoon,Lana Del Rey,by: Jessica Hopper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b09613d197565213a4bc/1:1/w_160/757a6c9c.png,2015-09-21 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21033-honeymoon/,Interscope,"On the cover of Honeymoon, we see our star, Lana Del Rey, the idle passenger of a parked convertible Hollywood tourmobile, gazing behind her through face-obscuring shades. As an artist, she's never shied away from the obvious, but the image feels almost too on-the-nose, too apt—Lana doing The Full Lana. And yet, that's exactly what Honeymoon gives us—it is Lana Del Rey's purest album-length expression, and her most artistic one. Accordingly, Honeymoon is a dark work, darker even than Ultraviolence, and the pall does not lift for its 60-plus minutes. It's an album about love, but ""love"", as Del Rey sings it, sounds like mourning. The romance here is closer to addiction—something that's sought for its ability to blot out the rest of life's miseries. On the title track, when she croons ""Our honeymoon/ Say you want me too"", she's dopily hopeful as Brian Wilson singing ""We could be married/ And then we'll be happy."" The album luxuriates in this bleak space between dream and reality, which stretches endlessly from one melancholy track to the next. It's not until ""The Blackest Day"", eleven songs in, that Honeymoon's static depression gives way to apocalyptic ecstasy, as she gasps ""In all the wrong places/ Oh my God"" in multi-tracked harmonies on the chorus. The moment is Honeymoon's emotional apex, but it still moves at the pace of a funeral march, and the release it depicts is that of embracing rock bottom. The morose orchestral grandeur of the album feels like an arrival point, and also possibly a dead-end: the sentimentality and drama throws back to old Hollywood film scores. The setting is pitch-perfect and a million mothballed years away from the current pop landscape; it's strange, a barometer of youth culture trading in such old music. As a singer, Del Rey sounds more like the singer of her pre-Lana Lizzy Grant days here, when she was was performing torch songs in secretarial skirts at A&R showcases, looking too young to seem so haunted. Her previous two records felt like earnest stabs at finding a pop context for that voice, but they were both overwrought, and Honeymoon's arrangements feel built to rectify that. Honeymoon acknowledges what, or rather who, we are here for. It knows that we want big, sad, fucked-up epics. It's rare to get to a chorus within the first minute, and until that point it's usually just Lana, maybe a little guitar or some cinematic strings. The programmed drums of ""High by the Beach"" and ""Religion"" wait nearly a minute to enter, and ""Terrence Loves  You"" is even sparser. Many tracks expand sleepily past the five- or six-minute mark, which is to say that Honeymoon's languor takes our attention for granted. Which is certainly not a mistake. While she's obviously a pop artist, Honeymoon feels as though it belongs to a larger canon of Southern California Gothic albums—Celebrity Skin, Hotel California, The Hissing of Summer Lawns. She sings about it all—the sprawl, toxicity, the culture of transactional relationships, the particulars of the light (""God Knows I Tried"")—with an East Coast blue-blood accent (""scared"" becomes ""skaaaahd""). All the gee-whiz irony of previous albums is gone, often she sounds like ABBA's Agnetha Fältskog roused from a nap, sweet but disconnected. Like Joan Didion's ur-California girl transplant, Maria Wyeth, Del Rey sings like a woman who ""knows what 'nothing' means""—on ""High by the Beach"", ""Freak"", and ""Art Deco"" she sounds beyond longing, like it's been a long time since she felt anything at all. She is cruelly incisive on ""Art Deco"" (""you're just born to be seen""), a highlight that curdles when the careless phrase ""You're so ghetto"" comes out in the chorus. It's one of the few tonal misfires on an album that otherwise feels like Del Rey moving into the temple she's built. She has been transfixed by, and riffing on, America since the beginning, but Honeymoon pushes past easy Kennedy kitsch and undulating flags to mine something more specific. In the opening track, she sings ""We could cruise/ To the blues/ Wilshire Boulevard,"" and the name check is shrewd. One of L.A.'s earliest thoroughfares, a locus of establishing the city's car culture, Wilshire runs sixteen miles, and as architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne writes, ""can take you from a world-famous piece of architecture to a weed-choked lot, from a realized ambition to an abandoned one, in the space of a few blocks."" In the following verse, she replaces blues with ""news"" and substitutes ""Pico Blvd."", which is working class for its duration, bi-secting Koreatown and running through Ecuadorian, Salvadoran, Russian, and Mexican communities. The juxtaposition is startling and canny. In the space of one lyric, she posits the invisible, real city running parallel to the gleaming, manufactured one, sketching an arterial map of a city coursing with ambition. It reminds us of something that was the very issue with Del Rey that irritated some early on—she knows exactly what she is doing. Honeymoon just synthesizes ideas she's been vamping on from the beginning into a unified work. She figured where she was going long before she got there; with Honeymoon she has finally arrived.","Lana Del Rey's third album is her purest album-length expression, and her most artistic one. It is a dark work, darker even than Ultraviolence. While she's obviously a pop artist, Honeymoon feels as though it belongs to a larger canon of Southern California Gothic albums, and synthesizes ideas she's been vamping on from the beginning into a unified work.

Positive Energy,Diät,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b061c0084474cd0c1c33/1:1/w_160/e06d059c.jpg,2015-09-18 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20994-positive-energy/,Iron Lung,"It’s easy, even facile, to compare post-punk bands with a monotone baritone vocalist to Joy Division. In a world of unending and presently meaningless commercial riffs on the infamous Unknown Pleasures artwork (look, you can get it printed on leggings!), the Manchester quartet are the first reference for people who don’t know much about the subgenre—that’s not a slight, simply a fact. Post-punk is rich and expansive territory, though, and there have been bands mining it consistently from 1978 onward. Even among the glut of bands currently exploring the first-wave strain of post-punk, East Berlin’s Diät stand out, much like their labelmates Total Control. Their song structures are playful and unique, their riffs memorable, their lyrics sly and clever, and their rhythm section unbelievably taut (check the drum solo that opens ""Toonie""). While there will doubtless be comparisons to Joy Division, I hear more Blitz circa Second Empire Justice in the guitar lines (bless Diät’s hearts for using the chorus pedal to genuine effect rather than just applying it flat across the entire record), more Crisis in the politic, more Bauhaus in the unfettered energy of the playing, more Modern English circa Mesh and Lace in the song structures. Diät are more than the sum of their influences, and they prove what I suspected from their first two 7""s, released in 2012 and 2013: their debut LP was worth the several-year wait. These songs were worked to the smallest detail. ""Young and Successful"" is wry commentary on how we internalize the capitalist work ethic, and on the line ""Write a manifesto, write a shopping list,"" the song ends abruptly, hanging, grasping, as it should. ""Hurricane"", with its slow percussive build and sharp riff, is about Chris Dorner and the inherent tensions of policing, and the subject fits perfectly with the ominous instrumentation. ""Nightmares"" is fast and meaty and propulsive, more punk than post-. There’s also a Cannanes cover on this record, of all things, and it is a really good one: that is to say, it does right by the well-loved original while putting Diät's own powerful spin on it. This brings me to the title of the album—Positive Energy might seem like a misnomer upon first bleak recognizance, but it’s not. Look no further than a cover of a song by a well-loved Australian indie pop band (some say they were among the '80s twee originators) on a dark punk record for the truth: ""positive energy"" isn’t an ironic pose for Diät. It’s not the kind of sarcasm that goes nowhere. It’s in their approach to music—sarcasm as a way to get to the heart of the matter, with the beating heart still going despite the outside world’s many attempts to still it, that heartbeat being the most important thing, the only thing.","Even among the glut of bands currently exploring the first-wave strain of post-punk, East Berlin’s Diät stand out.

Acne/Ears,The Roadside Graves,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0aac0084474cd0c1cb6/1:1/w_160/f9977c9b.jpg,2015-09-18 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21046-acneears/,Don Giovanni,"Over the span of their first five albums, the Roadside Graves were quintessential, New Jersey roots-rock storytellers, with songs full of empathetic third-person narratives. On the title track of Acne/Ears, they're ready to tell their own. It's as unflattering as you'd expect from a song called ""Acne/Ears"", two facial features that seem to exist for the sole purpose of causing adolescent embarrassment. ""Some boys are filled with piss and vinegar/ Some boys are filled with just pus and blood,"" John Gleason sings, recalling the days when his breakouts were so profuse, he didn't even bother going to school. It's similar to Strand of Oaks' breakthrough single ""Goshen '97"", in which a sullen teen finds relief by singing terribly in the mirror even when he could hardly bear to look at himself. As Gleason inventories his musical, physical, and spiritual failings throughout Acne/Ears, he becomes an avatar for an easily identifiable nowhere man—the guy who trudges through high school without much distinction or even the dignity afforded by being a true weirdo, starts a band, gets a job, and never gets quite far enough away from his origins to forget his past life as a pockmarked loner. On the album centerpiece ""Donna (Reno)"", Gleason thinks back on every book he's read and forgot, every show he was too drunk to remember, and shrinks from the laughter of construction workers and a middle finger from a bus full of schoolchildren. His only wish is to be cremated and baked into the highway, ""so you can say I helped build something."" But otherwise, Gleason tries to turn his liabilities into assets on Acne/Ears—misery as an opportunity for character building, introspection as a bullshit detector. At its best, Acne/Ears unassumingly places itself within reach of New Jersey's A-list of confessional indie rockers. But it lacks a true sense of stakes—Gleason's take on romance occasionally bears the startling bite of the Wrens on The Meadowlands, but otherwise his insights pass after a brief sting, like those kids on the school bus. Nor do Roadside Graves have the youthful brass or ambition to impose its will on naysayers like Titus Andronicus or Cymbals Eat Guitars. The lack of urgency can sometimes show just in the inescapable fact that this took four years to make. There are questionable binaries in ""Surfin'"" that feel at least that many years behind the cultural conversation, and the rousing coda of ""Acne/Ears"" is sunk by archaic gendering of what true rock'n'roll means—""Somebody please wake up those girls in the back on their phones/ Ears are meant to be destroyed by boys in basements making noise."" Though they're now signed to the esteemed Don Giovanni label, Gleason works as a second-grade teacher and the rest of the band is spread out across the country; ""no big tours planned now but hopefully one day!"" reads a post on their Facebook page. Gleason spends a stray thought in ""Donna (Reno)"" dreaming of getting married, moving in with his cousins back in Jersey, and quitting Roadside Graves. It's unclear whether he sees any of that as progress or resignation, but for the time being, he finds a way to live in the moment by expressing disarming sincerity on the title track—""I'm just happy you're listening.""","Over the span of their first five albums, the Roadside Graves were quintessential, New Jersey roots-rock storytellers, with songs full of empathetic third-person narratives.

Four Pink Walls EP,Alessia Cara,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0f1b1335d7bf169a1d0/1:1/w_160/bead750c.jpg,2015-09-18 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21074-four-pink-walls-ep/,Def Jam,"Alessia Cara struck an introvert’s pose on her April debut, ""Here"", and found herself famous. The single’s sound perfectly matched the attitude of its lyrics: a minor-key piano loop anchored a surprisingly powerful series of verses about a miserable party experience. ""Really, I would rather be at home by myself,"" Cara sang, demonstrating a well-defined personality and no small amount of self-assuredness. People noticed. ""Here"" debuted at #4 on the Billboard/Twitter Emerging Artists Chart. Lorde, Taylor Swift, and Drake co-signed her. The New York Times profiled her. Less than six months later, she's made a fast transition from ostensible outsider to insider. An ""antisocial pessimist"" who’d rather not have been invited to the party in the first place is quite suddenly the toast of the pop scene, her songs in heavy rotation on Beats 1. Cara finds herself a priority for Def Jam. They’ve quickly capitalized on her success with an EP, Four Pink Walls, which packages ""Here"" next to four other songs, three of which are very different from that first hit. Cara has a strong voice but lacks the power of an Ariana Grande, let alone a Mariah or a Whitney. Nevertheless, the label seems to think she’s best off belting anthems on the familiar subjects of teenage-dom. ""Seventeen"" kicks off the record with a vocal loop, a simulated handclap, and stirring chords that build into a hook about listening to your parents and appreciating your youth. Sometimes you can hear Cara’s spiky attitude poke through the sweet, pop polish. For instance, in response to her mother’s earnest advice about staying grounded, Cara rolls her eyes: ""Yeah, I guess that sounded nice when I was 10."" But—spoiler alert—she accepts the advice, and it becomes the song's focus. This sense of giving in to conventionality is also present on the record’s other anthem, the even catchier ""I’m Yours"", which, with its fluttery melodies and earthshaking chorus, could have fit in nicely on the Haim album. Some of ""I'm Yours"" is seemingly meant to reflect an antisocial pose—this time toward a guy—but it's more poutily flirtatious than anything else. ""Oh how rude of you, to ruin my miserable, and tell me I’m beautiful,"" she sings. ""I'm mad at you for being so cute."" There’s no reason to expect Cara to be permanently frozen into a charmingly grouchy position. But the specificity of ""Here"" has given way to blander, faux-outcast posing. ""Seventeen"" and ""I’m Yours"" are both well-constructed pop songs, sugary lyrics and all, and it’s easy to imagine them as huge hits. The worst track here, as its name suggests, is ""Outlaws"". Its cheerful, burping horn and tinkling keys don’t seem to do anything for Cara, as she croons that her partner is ""the shine into her star."" She sounds properly Stepford-ized, almost completely without her personality. That leaves us with the title track, a boom-bap, neo-soul closer that shares more musical DNA with ""Here"" than anything else on the EP. And suddenly, the girl with her own opinions and feelings is back. She sounds comfortable vocally, and you can hear shades of Lauryn Hill (who Cara has said she admires) and Erykah Badu. This is also the track where Cara lets us back into her shyness. She tells the story of her sudden fame, going ""from ‘when boredom strikes’ to ‘Ms. Star on the Rise,’"" she sings. ""But those four pink walls, I kind of miss them, man."" The four pink walls are her bedroom, where she was first discovered posting clips to YouTube, before she was snatched up by Universal Music Group. Early fans of those raw recordings may be less than happy that she's given into the customary tropes of bubblegum pop. And Cara herself sounds a little unsure about leaving behind the walls she knew so well for ones that may end up holding her back.","What happens when an introvert becomes an extrovert? Alessia Cara is finding out, after she signed with Def Jam and her loner's anthem ""Here"" crashed airwaves. Four Pink Walls strays from those solitary songs that gave Cara her start, and that's not a good thing.

Mykki Blanco Presents C-ORE,Various Artists,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b038b1335d7bf169a098/1:1/w_160/7ac27ef6.jpg,2015-09-18 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20960-mykki-blanco-presents-c-ore/,!K7Dogfood,"In Jeff Chang’s 2014 book Who We Be: The Colorization of America, he likens the race to co-opt hip-hop and other subcultures in order to capitalize on a wider consumer base as something of a gold rush. Lady Gaga positioned herself as a benevolent ally to the marginalized despite being white, thin, blonde, and rich. Feminism, once an ideological haven, has now become a buzzword bastardized beyond recognition because we insist on aligning its values with celebrities. What keeps the status quo—particularly as it pertains to money, power, and beauty—intact is a kind of cultural phagocytosis: devouring difference in order to bastardize and co-opt. Part of the appeal of Mykki Blanco, a multigender-identifying performance artist and musician, has been his refusal to become prey. ""I would rather be famous like Insane Clown Posse, than A$AP Rocky,"" Blanco said in 2012, helping situate the shock-rock roots of his debut LP, Cosmic Angel: Illuminati Prince/ss. At the time, Blanco was amongst a cohort of ‘gay rappers,’ all finding critical acclaim—and fashion week placements. But Blanco didn’t just survive the mainlining, he got harder. Listening to C-ORE, Blanco’s loud, new collaborative project, feels a bit like fear closing in on itself. Out on his new !K7 imprint, Dogfood Music Group, C-ORE is an album that amplifies the psychic tensions of living under ""conventional cultural boundaries and constructs,"" as Blanco says in the press release. Blanco, Yves Tumour, Psychoegyptian, and Violence put to music a dense prognostication of a world within sight, where subcultures and identities rise up to claim their right to expression. C-ORE doubles down on being outsider and punk in both aesthetic and practice. ""They don’t wanna see a man in a dress succeed,"" he says, setting up the threat that is ""Coke White, Starlight"". A reverberating clank, produced by Jeremiah Meece of The-Drum, the song ensnares you with its righteous rage and then pushes you to dance as it clicks into double time. It’s just one of two Blanco tracks on C-ORE—the other is ""Paw"", an aqueous, drumless, EKG-bleep—but it’s an entry point to an alternative space where it’s okay to still think things are amiss in the world. Most of C-ORE is a chasm of noise. Like a key scraping at a car door, Violence etches guttural raps onto piano and strobe-synth beats. Airhorns signal his impending verse on ""Saturn"". The four contributions by Yves Tumour are mostly wordless: ""Histrionic"" is a three-part suite of dank, hissing, convulsing sound and explosion, which find contrast in the mellow, minimal, hi-hat-driven stutter of ""Childish"". And one of C-ORE’s real standouts is the ""LBCD"", by Psychoegyptian. ""My rap name used to be Little Soda, Little Child Soldier, Little Not Sober, Little I Might Make You Get Melanoma,"" he bellows, his taunting cadence like Azealia Banks meets Mark Hoppus. Later, on ""Lullaby"", he borrows the drunken slur of Kanye-via-Travis Scott. These moments moments of humor help leaven a project that might seem high-minded and self-serious. Earlier this year, a few months after the release of his third project Gay Dog Food, Blanco announced he’d be leaving music and rap to pursue investigative journalism. C-ORE isn’t a Kingdom Come-like statement of return, but it’s also not a departure. As a collaborative work, it documents multiple experiences of life on the margins of America, of music—putting it all on blast.","C-ORE, Mykki Blanco’s loud, new collaborative project, doubles down on Blanco's outsider status, punk in both aesthetic and practice.

Have You In My Wilderness,Julia Holter,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af83ea9e61561daa6476/1:1/w_160/8c307c2c.png,2015-09-18 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20825-have-you-in-my-wilderness/,Domino,"The composer, keyboardist and singer Julia Holter has pursued her strange, dreamlike visions across three albums of experimental pop, all released in the last three years. In that time, she's also worked with electro-pop act Nite Jewel and psych-folk cult favorite Linda Perhacs, and in all of this activity, you hear her restlessly pinpointing and subsuming new, piquant sounds. Those sounds range widely, from French impressionist classical music and 17th-century madrigals to Talk Talk's jazz-infused post-rock, from the avant music-drama of Robert Ashley and Meredith Monk, to the pop songwriting that evolved in the hills of her Los Angeles hometown in the 1970s. But though these names remain on the tip of your tongue as you listen to her music, none of them describe Holter; they are only points on a broader and more inscrutable map. Her latest album, Have You In My Wilderness, is by some measure her sunniest and most accessible. There is no overarching concept uniting the music, no references to Euripides or '50s MGM musicals. As Holter told Stereogum, she ""[made] up stories for every song"" for Have You, but this being Holter, our glimpses of each ""story"" are brief and foggy, and the vignettes themselves are often plagued by ambiguities (""I hear small words from the shore/No recognized pattern"")  and moments of overpowering grief or wonder. More questions are asked than answers given in her often-unrhymed prose poems, and statements fold into themselves dizzyingly: ""Figures pass so quickly that I realize my eyes know very well/It's impossible to see who I'm waiting for in my raincoat"" (""Feel You""). Like a good student of the art music world, Holter clearly hopes that listeners will nurse their own impressions. The music has also shifted, gaining warmth and weight while remaining enigmatic. Lo**ud City Song was a mess of stylistic dissonances working in the service of one discrete story (borrowing mostly from the 1958 film for the musical Gigi), but Have You… is tied together by music so airy it feels in danger of floating right past you. Despite the heavy cloak of reverb,  the record has the clear sound of a small rock band playing the studio, highlighting the inventive but uninvasive upright bass and percussion of Devin Hoff, Corey Fogel and Kenny Gilmore. The haze is also dialed back on Holter’s vocals, making them crystal clear at crucial moments. Despite the breezy, poppy feeling of  the singles ""Feel You"" and ""Sea Calls Me Home"", the choruses are not as immediate as those on the earworm-heavy Ekstasis or Loud City Song. But in looser, through-composed songs like the sensual torch ballad ""Night Song"" and jazz-fusion-inflected ""Vasquez,"" Holter find other, deeper ways to hold our attention. In ""Betsy on the Roof"" –  an inspired reworking of a song Holter previously recorded on 2010’s Live Recordings – she drifts in and out of muted speaksong, sliding from pealing, Newsom-like tones into throaty speech. The chorus (""’Uh oh,’ she said/What of this cloud?""), though, is belted and raw-sounding, and in the wordless coda her gossamer crooning recalls either Christine McVie or Judy Collins. But what ultimately makes Have You in My Wilderness transcendent – and unique in Holter’s catalogue – is its intimacy. The atmosphere is often light-hearted or even parodic: In the  giddy ‘70s singer/songwriter melismas of ""Sea Calls Me Home,"" the husky, Marlene Dietrich-like delivery of ""How Long?"" or the jokey, clap-trap country shuffle of ""Everytime Boots,"" you hear Holter trying on sounds like costumes, sometimes for only a bar or two. Ironically, the more she shapeshifts, the more we seem to get to know her. For an artist who could sometimes seem forbidding or remote, Have You In My Wilderness feels humane,  and with each new release, it seems like a bit more of the personal is teased out of Holter's stately, high-concept approach. Have You In My Wilderness embraces the specific, rather than the eternal, and in her narrowed focus you can sense a palpable self-confidence and a hard-won precision.","The composer, singer and keyboardist Julia Holter's latest album, Have You In My Wilderness, is her sunniest and most accessible. The music has shifted, gaining warmth and weight while remaining essentially mysterious. Instead of unpacking weighty overarching concepts, Holter is telling stories, brief and foggy ones that are often plagued by ambiguities.

Meltframe,Mary Halvorson,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08ac0084474cd0c1c7a/1:1/w_160/724f0131.jpg,2015-09-17 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21027-meltframe/,Firehouse 12,"Mary Halvorson owns one of the more easily identifiable guitar sounds you will encounter, in any genre. That is partly due to an ingenious effect: a delay pedal that she uses as a startling, mid-note pitch-shifter. But if she didn’t have anything to offer beyond that novelty, her playing wouldn’t sustain the three modern jazz groups she currently heads (a trio, a quintet and a septet), as well as her sought-after work in various other ensembles—including two different bands led by jazz guitar luminary and occasional Tom Waits sideman Marc Ribot. With her quick, experimentalist’s mind, Halvorson resembles the great composer, saxophonist and teacher Anthony Braxton (an early instructor of hers, with whom she still collaborates). On her new album Meltframe, a set of guitar covers, she is simultaneously employing two suggestions from her former professor’s syllabus: develop a solo act, and don’t forget to engage with the past. Halvorson is well respected in the jazz community for the speed with which she can conceive of strong ideas. In the midst of a fleet improvisation you might hear her becoming progressively enamored of some small portion of a given melody, selecting it for additional repetition within the flow of a solo. Next, she’s slowing the tempo and turning the fragment into a rollicking vamp, while switching her amplifier’s tone. As you’re appreciating the rhythmic change, you may not immediately notice that she’s also creating a new path back toward the full theme. But when she returns to the original hook, the culmination is as satisfying as any single effect she may have used for punctuation along the way. Meltframe’s tracklist was refined during her stint as the opener for an acoustic tour by King Buzzo of the Melvins. If at first it seems like a self-consciously idiosyncratic grab bag (Duke Ellington and Ornette Coleman?), as usual, Halvorson has a plan. She links these two composers in the album’s sequencing via mournful tune-selection, but uses different methods of attack to preserve a distinction. Slide-playing and tuning quirks grace her performance of Coleman’s ""Sadness"" (while recalling something of the composer’s own ""harmolodics"" concept). Then, she slows Duke’s ""Solitude"" way down, using a delicate reverb to provide the sparest of pulses. Her playing shines in both performances. Nor is a conceptual subtlety the only thing Meltframe has going for it. The opening number is a finger-busting, grungy take on Oliver Nelson’s ""Cascades""—a song aptly titled, given its quickly swooping figures. Those familiar with Nelson’s soulful hard-bop sound may be tempted to wrinkle a nose at the interpretive move, here, but they shouldn’t: Halvorson’s recourse to the distortion pedal successfully underlines what an imposing riff-writer this composer was. A high energy approach also predominates during the back half of Halvorson’s exciting reinterpretation of McCoy Tyner’s ""Aisha"" (which features on the John Coltrane album Olé Coltrane). Halvorson also tosses recent pieces by contemporaries like Tomas Fujiwara and Chris Lightcap into her mix. These cuts don’t always carry the melodic jolt of the certified classics, but Halvorson’s performances show how today’s jazz still works with an awareness of popular textures, including indie rock (as with the noisy drone section she creates when playing Lightcap’s ""Platform""). Surely, Halvorson’s most personal statements are still found on the albums where her own compositions rule. Though by liquefying some of the curatorial borders that surround jazz in the popular imagination, Meltframe refocuses our attention on an essential malleability that is the genre’s core tradition.","Meltframe is a solo guitar album of covers from Mary Halvorson, one of the most exciting musicians making jazz today. It's an adventurous record, both in her song choices and her interpretive playing. In her dexterity, Halvorson acts as a bridge between the jazz of the past and the jazz of the future.

On each successive release, they seem to be trying to find their undeniably unique voice by mixing bits and pieces of '90s AmRep brutality and funky alt-rock (Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and so forth), a mix that makes a peculiar sort of sense if you also grew up in the D.C./Baltimore area with local freeform-turned-Infinity Broadcasting alt-rock radio titan WHFS in one ear and any number of college radio stations in the other. Kunk is more of a prolonged howling squall than its direct predecessor, Lifer, though the filters on Andrew Laumann’s vocals are still set to ""cargo shorts."" Opener ""Casual"" is nearly all hair dryer guitar, that gated-distortion squeal that is guitarist Zachary Utz’s specialty; it’s the interplay between Utz’s looped noise and powerful drummer David Jacober that makes Dope Body so gnarly. The first single, ""Old Grey"", is another standout; Laumann’s refrain ""I’m living in a trash can"" is a pretty descriptive phrase for Dope Body’s ethos, and the track bumps and screeches and spins, lurching forward at regular intervals, crashing into itself spectacularly as Laumann asks himself what this band’s life, what their particular brand of destruction, has wrought. There are sludgier, heavier moments (""Goon Line"" and ""Obey""); here, Dope Body feel genuinely precarious, unhinged, and uncomfortable. This is a good move for them; they’ve always been known as a wild band, but to focus on their riffs and the hefty panic a good noise-rock rhythm section can give make Dope Body more powerful and interesting than the never-ending in-joke they could be characterized as. This contextual balance between paranoiac music and absurdist lyrics was something Dayton's Brainiac, a band Dope Body are often compared to, excelled at. The instrumentals on the album (""Dad"", ""Ash Toke"", ""Pincher"") are Dope Body’s version of rap skits—little unfinished goofs—and somewhat of a breath of fresh air in that they are sketches, pictures of the band figuring out their directions together. They seem to be stretching themselves on this record, searching to create something meaningful in an ugly world, realizing that there are limits to their subgenre-referencing sound and if they are to grow they’ve got to push themselves.","Baltimore’s Dope Body are prolific, averaging one release of scuzzy, groovy noise-rock per year since they started in 2009.

The Emissary,Jens-Uwe Beyer,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0795e6ef95969321f8d/1:1/w_160/87427a8e.jpg,2015-09-17 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21015-the-emissary/,Kompakt,"Cologne's Jens-Uwe Beyer has a thing for big statements: His 2012 recording Red Book drew out a single, unbroken techno groove to nearly 80 minutes—a metaphorical ""journey by DJ"" that could, in fact, accompany a moderately lengthy journey, or at the least one hell of a commute. But he's equally a fan of far more modest statements. Since 2005, his annual contributions to Kompakt's Pop Ambient series have typically taken the form of bite-sized reflections on a single mood, texture, or tone. Now, on The Emissary, he strikes a balance between these approaches. It is an invitation for the listener to travel but as travelogues go, The Emissary features no panoramic views, no grand vistas, no monuments, no scenes of splendor. It's more of a soothing blur flashing past, as seen from a comfortable seat aboard the bullet train. There are two principal modes at work across the album's nine tracks: pulse and echo. ""It Started on Wednesday"" uses both at once, and it's serene to the point of detachment, in which patient bass notes dissolve into reverb trails so thick you could smear them with a putty knife. In ""Moonshine Tangerine"", quarter-note taps are fed through filters and delay, gradually building up into interlocking shapes with a debt to Robert Hood's brand of ultra-minimal techno, but drum-free and dew-bubbled. ""The Life Of"" also brings to mind techno rendered in water droplets. The pulse-oriented productions aren't always so regular, however. The opening ""St. Pop"" is comprised of short, monophonic synthesizer bursts, first fast then slow then fast again; they suggest neurons firing in some post-cryogenic scenario, and they feel both melancholy and slightly numb. In ""Hands"", a three-note piano figure reminiscent of new age pianist George Winston runs in unsteady cycles, its shifting accents conveying a simultaneous sense of stillness and movement. The same goes for ""Water Dancer"", a duet for looped guitar and sloshing waves that evokes Grouper's method of traveling without moving. The remainder of the album is more placid—""About Turn"" hangs glowing in the air like a fog that veils the sun, while ""Trip the Light Fantastic"" slows a sense of ecstatic wonder to a deathbed crawl with a minute-long fadeout. These tracks aren't terribly sophisticated; as per Kompakt's Pop Ambient dictate, the album is content to take a pretty simple idea—ambient music as comfort food—and stretch it as far as it can. But there are also promising signs that Beyer isn't quite content to leave things there. As ""Moonshine Tangerine"" fades out, a scrappy guitar figure, run through tremolo, pops up from out of nowhere, and the same thing happens at the end of ""The Emissary"", this time with a tentative little piano prelude that runs for nine-and-a-half bars and then breaks off, silenced by a sigh in the background. These codas feel like riddles, hints of wormholes to other worlds that lie just out of reach of the album's sheltering ambient cocoon. They're reminders, maybe, that every journey is also the story of a journey not taken—teasing snapshots of the world beyond the train's windows as it comes fleetingly to rest.","Cologne's Jens-Uwe Beyer has a thing for big statements—see his 2012 recording Red Book, which drew out a single, unbroken techno groove to nearly 80 minutes. The Emissary is in comparison an album of quiet miniatures, with tracks built on pulse and echo.

"Imani, Vol. 1",Blackalicious,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd79d034d5c69bf479c/1:1/w_160/abbd9788.jpg,2015-09-17 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20890-imani-vol-1/,OGM,"For better or worse, the tag ""alternative rap"" comes with many connotations: this rap subverts mainstream politics; this rap has a message; this rap is different; this is #RealHipHop. It’s often a distinction used by rap elitists and purists to separate rap with a supposed intellectual bent from the rap they consider low brow or obtuse. It can be an ugly, divisive term, one that stands at the center of rap’s greatest schism; it has been a defining label in many rap class wars. But sometimes the term categorizes rap acts that truly exist on the fringes of the genre, acts that stretch the boundaries of how rap can sound with progressive and daring compositions. Producer Chief Xcel and emcee Gift of Gab have been one such creative force as Blackalicious, a Sacramento-based project pushing a positive, often Afrocentric message that’s more prudent than preachy over dynamic production. From 2000 to 2005, the tag-team released a trio of strong LPs—Nia, Blazing Arrow, and The Craft—but parted soon after to pursue individual interests. On Imani, Vol. 1, their first album in a decade, Blackalicious reunites triumphantly. With Blazing Arrow—the duo’s seminal work—Blackalicious offered up one of the greatest alternative rap records of the last decade, a complex opus that felt seamless and simple with Gil Scott-Heron’s barreling profundity, Questlove’s drums, a DJ Shadow interlude, Zack de la Rocha’s anarchist shouts, and rapid-fire rapping all arranged carefully on a funky sonic canvas. The pair’s last album, 2005’s The Craft, lived up to its title with a yeoman's approach to lyricism and a tinkerer’s mentality toward innovation, but in its quest to be an experimental marvel, it over-thought its thesis, occasionally doing too much, sonically and technically. The first of a projected trilogy, Imani, Vol. 1 takes important lessons from both, tempering its big ambitions with subtler arrangements and careful pacing. Blackalicious is most effective when Gift of Gab’s knotty multisyllabic schemes unspool without decryption and nestle neatly in the nooks and crannies of Xcel’s soulful romps, and on songs like ""Ashes to Ashes"" and ""I Like the Way You Talk"", they lock in. Gab, one of the most underrated technicians of his time, can still trade bars with the best of them, but what makes Imani, Vol. 1 particularly powerful—and what separates it from the duo’s work outside of Blackalicious titles—is its warm energy and its infectious groove. Imani is the Swahili word for ""faith"" and on the opener of the same name Amde of the Watts Prophets spells out the album’s mission statement: ""Never let life’s troubles block your flow/ Have faith and get where you’re trying to go."" Blackalicious has always promoted positivity, but here it seems less like a cultural critique and more like general life-coaching. Throughout, Imani, Vol. 1 is driven by an underlying spirituality and palpable chemistry. It’s often about connection. The duo has joined forces once more in an effort to overcome personal trials, and Imani is no different: Gab suffered kidney failure just as the duo started preparing to make the record in 2012, and a ""borrowed time"" narrative punctuates many of Vol. 1’s loose ideas, particularly on ""The Hour Glass"" and ""Escape"". Time is a central theme on the album, especially with nostalgic glimpses into the past, like on rare missteps ""That Night"" and ""Inspired By"". But there’s also a watchful eye on the future, too (""Love’s Gonna Save the Day""). Xcel productions are often rooted in the sounds of rap yesteryear, but they hedge toward the modern. On Imani, Vol. 1, he again bridges the then and now, lining crisp boom bap drums with splitting guitar chords, protruding basslines, and prickling piano riffs. He samples less often than he has in the past, but he still finds time to chop up Lee Perry (on ""Blacka"") and scratch in a vocal fragment here and there (""On Fire Tonight""). His beats aren't game-changers, but he finds new and interesting ways to follow the patented Blackalicious formula. When Chief Xcel and Gift of Gab are both producing at max output, there are few rap duos more capable, and on Imani, Vol. 1 they flex their muscle, showing little sign of rust after the long layoff. What Vol. 1 lacks in memorable hooks, it makes up for with ferocious lyricism. That the album was even made feels like a victory, especially considering it took a PledgeMusic campaign to fund it, but Imani, Vol. 1 doesn’t feel crowd-sourced: It is an intimate piece of work, an inspiring take on conquering personal struggle and coming out whole on the other side. On ""The Sun"", Vol. 1's brightest moment, Gab spins metaphors on the darkness-vanquishing power of light, jubilantly basking in its rays, shining once again.","On Imani, Vol. 1, their first album in a decade, Blackalicious reunites triumphantly. Gif of Gab, one of the most underrated technicians of his time, can still trade bars with the best of them, but what makes Vol. 1 particularly powerful—and what separates it from the duo’s work outside of Blackalicious titles—is its warm energy and its infectious groove.

Savage Hills Ballroom,Youth Lagoon,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0abb1335d7bf169a169/1:1/w_160/84193d38.jpg,2015-09-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21047-savage-hills-ballroom/,Fat Possum,"Youth Lagoon's first two albums felt introspective at the time: Trevor Powers mused about the posters in his childhood bedroom, his first ""it's not you, it's me,"" and driving his parents' car in a meek mewl that come off as conversational rather than performative. He favored post-production tricks that made him either sound trapped in a well or a bouncy castle, but he always sounded alone, and the music bore none of the visceral signifiers of rock. But he'd likely call his previous work ""insular"" now, created at a point when he was lucky enough to talk about love, death, and the societal contract as abstractions and avoid dealing with the real shit going on inside of him. After the release of Wondrous Bughouse, Powers cancelled a run of tour dates after the drowning of a close friend. Up to this point, Powers already seemed like a guy who'd bruise from a stiff wind; Savage Hills Ballroom has him feeling everything with even greater sensitivity. This is first time we can hear what Powers actually sounds like—the piercing clarity of Savage Hills Ballroom has to be a reaction to the muffled bedroom ambience and warped kaleidoscopism that respectively defined The Year of Hibernation and Wondrous Bughouse. And the most immediate revelation is just how aggressive his vocals are. When clouded by reverb and dozens of flange effects, Powers resembled bemused warblers like Dean Wareham and Wayne Coyne. ""Officer Telephone"" and ""The Knower"" present Youth Lagoon as a freak-folk torchbearer gone digital, Powers adopting the keening, incantatory tones of Joanna Newsom or Devendra Banhart (and even a melodic glimpse of Tori Amos' ""Crucify"" on ""Free Me""), though without the same kind of supernatural presence. Powers still sounds barely a third of his 26 years (""we're all babies born too soon,"" he yelps), but it works in the context of his angriest music, since most toddlers don't know much about restraint either when they first discover the world pushing back against them. With the assistance of Ali Chant, who worked on Perfume Genius' similarly glammed-up and streamlined third album Too Bright, Powers equips himself with the instruments of war—Savage Hills Ballroom is full of layered drums, atonal noise, and horn sections used for both melodic counterpoint and blunt force. Even when the loping keyboards of ""Highway Patrol Stun Gun"" and ""Rotten Human"" recall Powers' standard operating procedure, the songs are kinetic, obsessed with forward motion and melodic precision—aspects that are completely new to Youth Lagoon. Savage Hills Ballroom is also the first time we can hear what Powers actually has to say, and that's by far the greatest risk on a record that's already attempting to redefine Youth Lagoon. Powers shows an admirable willingness to engage with broader societal issues, though the accusatory tone of ""Rotten Human"", ""The Knower"", and ""Again"" open him up to scrutiny the often banal commentary can't withstand: ""the clones, they've always said to stay in line,"" ""so we take a pill and trust the doctor's lie,"" ""television soundtrack drones,"" using ""computer"" as a verb. ""Through aisles of cans you walk/ 'Cause you'd rather spend than grow a crop,"" he spits on ""Again""; there's a possibility he's critiquing his own obsessive habits here, but he eventually shifts to the plural first person and becomes the guy on your Facebook feed posting #hottakes about GMOs. While Savage Hills Ballroom awkwardly stretches to make universal points from Powers' personal distaste, his personal heartache results in the most truly resonant moments. Tucked within the civic-minded back half, the exceptional ""Kerry"" is a dramatic elegy to Powers' uncle, holed up in Vegas, on the run from the law and addicted to crack cocaine. Meanwhile, ""Officer Telephone"" finds Powers in a heightened sense of shock while mourning, the ""terrible tone"" of ambulance sirens reminding him of a time when they were too late to help. Both of these songs match the devastating emotional impact of ""July"" and ""Dropla"" while accessing a darkness he couldn't address directly on The Year of Hibernation or Wondrous Bughouse (""I've felt heaviness creep since I turned 8 years old""). Regardless of the subject matter or the production or the arrangements, the most truly self-searching Youth Lagoon album has Powers realizing he perhaps knew his position of strength all along—the inner child set adrift in the adult world, left to figure it out on his own.","The piercing clarity of Youth Lagoon’s third album, Savage Hills Ballroom, feels like a reaction to the muffled bedroom ambience and warped kaleidoscopism that defined Trevor Powers' earlier collections. He worked on the record with Ali Chant, who co-produced Perfume Genius’ similarly glammed-up and streamlined third album Too Bright.

Flying Basket,MerzbowJim O’RourkeAkira SakataChikamorachi,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06e9d034d5c69bf4890/1:1/w_160/d57732cc.png,2015-09-16 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21007-flying-basket/,Family Vineyard,"Akira Sakata is a longtime student of multiple avant-jazz traditions. The piercing intensity of his alto saxophone and clarinet playing occasionally harkens back to the mid- and late-'60s work of John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, and Albert Ayler. But the Japanese musician's simultaneous attention to psych rock and some of the more meditative aspects of global free improv has helped him build a catalog of improvised music that sounds beholden to no school. (He even funked it up with Miles Davis' great fusion-era guitarist, Pete Cosey, on the unmissable 2001 album Fisherman's.com.) His skill as a synthesist is so great that it can sometimes feel self-effacing, with Sakata often appearing more concerned with a given group's success than individual heroics. Given this, it's only fitting that Sakata wound up collaborating with Jim O'Rourke, the unassuming experimental magus responsible for this year's Simple Songs (as well as, in large part, Sonic Youth's late-period renaissance). Their first recorded collaboration—a generally frenetic, double-live 2011 set titled and that's the story of Jazz…—placed O'Rourke's guitar and Sakata's reeds alongside the free-time pulse of drummer Chris Corsano and bassist Darin Gray (the duo known as Chikamorachi). This time, they've added Japanese noise-electronics eminence Merzbow to the mix, but instead of upping the cacophony, the addition results in a frequently spare and considered work. Presented as a 71-minute jam cut in Tokyo, Flying Basket begins quietly, with Sakata lingering over a few notes and phrases. O'Rourke also avoids heading straight for the shredding post-punk that dominated his playing on this ensemble's last recording. Merzbow, too, starts softly; nearly a tenth of the album has passed before his prickly shards pervade the album. This slow, muted intro helps lend weight to the explosions that pop up throughout. The piece tenses and slackens, passing through fits of raw soloing and quiet drones and extended technique texture. The overall feel is graceful; during one passage that finds Sakata on clarinet, he manages the trick of grouping some pinched notes into phrases that sound like charming exclamations. The interplay here, just before the record's midpoint, is so nuanced and powerful that the ""everyone go fully nuts"" ending seems somewhat less impressive than it otherwise might. Still, Flying Basket is another valuable document of a vital, contemporary avant-team-up. Anyone who has been following O'Rourke's varied activity since moving to Japan should want to hear this—along with more of Sakata's own discography.","Akira Sakata, Jim O'Rourke, and Japanese noise-electronics eminence Merzbow form the core of this experimental jazz group. But instead of upping the cacophony, the addition of Merzbow results in a surprisingly spare and considered work.

The Pattern of Electricity,Corrina Repp,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0709d034d5c69bf4895/1:1/w_160/154bceb1.png,2015-09-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21008-the-pattern-of-electricity/,Caldo VerdeDiscolexique,"Of all the words that could have been used to describe Corrina Repp at the start of her career—singer, songwriter, folkie—""performer"" wasn’t the first that came to mind. Especially on her first albums for Hush Records, which seemed to take the label’s name literally, with Repp singing as if in a library, cushioned by stray guitar strums and murmured electronic tones. The Pattern of Electricity is Repp’s first solo release since 2006’s deeply lonesome The Absent and the Distant, and despite the nine-year gap, her slow, subdued music hasn’t changed all that much. What has changed, however, is her voice. Far from a whisper, it now rings out. She’s performing. Credit her time in Tu Fawning for that enhanced presence. During her solo hiatus Repp dedicated herself to that Portland band, which began as a freewheeling outlet for whatever whim captured the fancy of her and co-lead Joe Haege, be it droning psychedelia or freakish jazz. By 2012’s A Monument the group had discovered some discipline, playing in line with the percussive thrust and theatrical bombast of bands like the Black Keys and Florence and the Machine. It was a solid record, and so conveniently in sync with popular tastes that the group must have had high hopes it. In live footage of the group from around that time, Repp almost seems to be practicing for bigger stages. The band never made it that far, though. They dissolved soon after, along with Repp’s romantic relationship with Haege.
 
The Pattern of Electricity is a breakup album, albeit one a bit removed from the initial sting of the split. After Tu Fawning unraveled, Repp stashed her guitar in a closet and spent a year away from music to collect herself. These songs reflect that cooling off period, capturing the early healing stages of heartbreak, when resentment and grief begin to give way to thoughts about picking up the pieces. ""Woman, shed yourself again,"" she commands herself on opener ""The Beast Lives in the Same Place"", as if recovery is something to be willed. She sings song after song with the wounded determination of somebody who understands on a rational level they’ll be all right, even if her gut doesn’t fully believe it yet. That same hard-fought resolve carries through even the album’s most sorrowful moments, like the hymnal-esque ""Woods"" and the organ-washed ""Long Shadow (with Pb)"", but Electricity resists wallowing in the darkness just for the sake of it. Repp smuggles some genuine dazzle into the album’s showiest number, ""Pattern the Cuts / Calm Ass Mofo"". From its minimalist opening pulses, that seven-minute song blossoms into a dapper orchestral pop suite with shades of Grizzly Bear’s Veckatimest. ""I haven't been this calm before,"" she sings, ""and now I know I want more."" Like much of the album, it’s a song about trying to channel heartache into something productive, a search for a silver lining. These songs may grieve, sometimes toughly, but they never mope.","After a romantic and musical breakup, Corrina Repp stashed her guitar in a closet and spent a year away from music to collect herself.

Noctunes,Willis Earl Beal,by: Marcus J.

He visits a church and a strip club, soaking in the city by himself. Beal’s recent work feels born out of that movie, its meandering pace and self-assessing narrative a direct complement to the flick’s equally meditative theme. In Memphis, Beal’s character hits a minor breakthrough, his face bathed in blue light as he sings in one of the film’s pivotal scenes. Beal never achieves such catharsis on Noctunes, his latest album. Instead, he casually floats by in a billowing wave of airy soul that never quite lands. Noctunes, Beal’s seventh album in five years, moves slowly—very slowly—as he tries to channel the same ethereal ambience Marvin Gaye once did. Like the album title suggests, these are evening tunes. That they induce sleep if played at low volume is perhaps on purpose. The music just sort of hangs around without any progression, making the album seem longer than its already not short 63-minute runtime. This is a bedroom recording in the truest sense: as it plays, you can almost see Beal sitting in a dark room, calmly peeling off each note. That makes Noctunes a pretty heavy listen, except these songs aren’t as structured as previous efforts. The light melodies accentuate Beal’s best feature—his dynamic, gospel-inflected baritone—as he sings about personal struggles. And while he draws you in by the sheer magnitude of his timbre, Beal gets lost in the tracks too often, making Noctunes tough to sit through. He’s got plenty to talk about, though: In August, Beal was arrested in Portland, Ore. on charges of criminal mischief and harassment. He’s struggled with alcoholism, been homeless, and was plagued with health complications that forced him from the Army. Last year, Beal had a very public fallout with his then-label, XL/Hot Charity, and spent time couch surfing on the West Coast following his divorce. He addresses those romantic perils toward the middle of Noctunes—on consecutive tracks ""No Solution"", ""Stay"", ""Say the Words"", and ""Love Is All Around"". On ""No Solution"", in particular, Beal sounds especially contrite. He references a ""lost"" wedding ring and the dissolution of his marriage. By ""Love Is All Around"", he gives in to some sort of finality: ""Those haunting words that she said/ ‘Go the fuck away.’"" The singer processes these emotions on Noctunes, though his thoughts don't always shine through, given the album's milieu and paltry backdrop. These should be great deep blues songs, but they’re missing the cohesion of that genre at its best. Noctunes is muddy and unfocused, and not inspirational at all. Instead, the tracks are drab and make the album almost impossible to endure. Beal's output has never been polished, but at least on his fascinating debut, there was a certain earnestness to his music. With Beal, there was something alluring about the lo-fi hiss of ""Sambo Joe from the Rainbow"" or ""Too Dry to Cry"". Noctunes resembles a half-baked effort to recapture some sort of personal peace. A noble exercise, but in Beal’s attempt to exorcise old demons, the LP comes off way too moody and far too methodical to resonate long term.","Willis Earl Beale's Noctunes is a bedroom recording in the truest sense: as it plays, you can almost see Beal sitting in a dark room, calmly peeling off each note.

Thank You for Your Consideration,Venetian Snares,by: Nathan Reese,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0ea13d197565213a540/1:1/w_160/10172373.jpg,2015-09-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21067-thank-you-for-your-consideration/,self-released,"""I am suddenly in very serious financial trouble,"" Aaron Funk, better known as the producer Venetian Snares, posted on Twitter and Facebook at the end of August. ""If you've ever enjoyed my music, I badly need your help asap."" Two weeks later, his fans had delivered and, shortly thereafter, so did Funk. At face value, Thank You for Your Consideration could be seen as Funk's version of ""pulling a Beyoncé""—which, as of 2015, is often shorthand for the way new music is released. But unlike Bey, or Drake, or Björk, the Winnipeg producer's new record was neither accompanied by a plea for remuneration (fans had already donated without any promise of a reward), nor was it part of a larger marketing scheme (the album was posted on Bandcamp, rather than released via Funk's longtime label, Planet Mu). Instead, like much of Funk's work that came before, Thank You for Your Consideration's release was enigmatic, raw, and, one must assume, sincere: ""Thanks for having my back and caring about me and the music I make,"" he wrote. For about a decade beginning in the late '90s, Funk was a restless creative force—dropping album after album of breakcore beats in a deluge that resulted in some of the decade’s most arresting electronic music. At his creative peak—arguably 2005's ambitious, classically-inspired Rossz Csillag Alatt Született—it wasn’t uncommon for Funk to issue several releases a year. But eventually, his output slowed to more human levels. Four years passed between 2010’s My So-Called Life and 2014’s My Love Is a Bulldozer and, in that time, Funk himself seemed to cede momentum to artists whose own sounds softened or refined parts of the one he helped create (Death Grips, Gobby, the Range, and the Vaporwave aesthetic all owe much to the road he paved). One might guess, then, because of the nature of its release and Funk's prolific recording schedule, that Thank You for Your Consideration is cobbled together from different stages of his career, or simply a collection of tracks he never planned to release at all. As he told XLR8R last year: ""I think I still make the same amount of music, I just barely show it to anyone anymore."" While that may be the case, unlike other odds-and-ends albums, Consideration's 14 tracks come off as remarkably—and appropriately—considered when taken as a whole. While last year's My Love Is a Bulldozer saw Funk experimenting with his own vocals to beguiling results and this year's Your Face showed a more condensed side to Snares' sound, Thank You for Your Consideration bursts with the explosive strangeness and mathematical focus that defines much of his best work. The album's intricately programmed drums have the loose feel of much of his mid-2000s aesthetic and Funk's dynamic time signatures spin like rogue gyroscopes feeding off their own entropy. The album opens with ""Smersonality"", a wobbly production whose groove is driven by spazzed-out synths and jazzed-up beats. For longtime fans, it's a return to form; for newcomers, it may recall Zach Hill by way of Aphex Twin. Venetian Snares' music is often purposefully difficult to swallow in large doses, but more often than not there's a cleverness and humor that rewards deeper listens. ""Koopa Cookies"", whose name portends the glitchy chiptune that erupts from the song's placid opening, plays like a boss battle where Mario's mushrooms aren't of the legal variety. Further down the road, ""Thousand Mile Stare"" is a jungle track with a vocal sample as sinister as its razor-blade synths. Funk has also always been capable of tempering high-octane drum and bass with less combustible fare. ""Beside the Past by a Lake"", for example, uses a retro-futuristic palette to paint a scene that's as soothing as it is unnerving without feeling disjointed. While the unnamed circumstances that led to Thank You for Your Consideration are no doubt terrible for Funk's personal life, the fact that a plea can be answered, and that an artist can return that favor in kind just weeks later, is the sort of story that illustrates the adaptability of the Internet. While jaded listeners may view each new leak and mixtape as the next piece of a perpetual PR machine, Consideration is an argument for a more human view of technology. (As is clear from a recent FACT interview, there's perhaps nobody more jaded by the music industry, or music criticism, than Funk himself.) From the patient, apocalyptic drone of ""09sept09"" to the synapse-sizzling electro of ""Ötvenöt 3"", Thank You stands for itself. But it's difficult to ignore the context: ""Still royally screwed, yet you've made me so feel supported and loved,"" he wrote when linking to the album. Like much of Funk's best music, it's a statement filled with tension and contradiction.","After posting an online message about his financial troubles, and then receiving help from his fans, the Winnipeg producer Venetian Snares posted Thank You for Your Consideration on Bandcamp.

Rodeo,Travis Scott,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b07ac0084474cd0c1c63/1:1/w_160/eae6dd69.jpg,2015-09-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21016-rodeo/,Epic,"There are few emerging artists more polarizing than Travis Scott, he of the dual deals (Grand Hustle as a rapper and G.O.O.D. Music as a producer) and the punk rock antics, a Kanye West progeny who is continuously changing shape. One minute he’s Kid Cudi, the next he’s Young Thug. The rager has made a living parlaying aesthetics into musical capital, but there’s value in his ability to repackage styles and sounds into something that requires little to no unpacking. After releasing a solid buzz-building free studio album, Days Before Rodeo, last year, Scott follows it up with his long-awaited major debut, Rodeo, a master class in the pyramid scheming of rap industry politics. Travis Scott studied carefully at the Kanye West School of Maximalism, where sounds are expensive and songs are sumptuous with rich, interlocking details and meticulously selected guests. Since releasing his debut EP, Owl Pharaoh, in 2013 (and perhaps even before) he’s been honing a sixth sense for emphasizing gravitas. His greatest trick is making songs feel big and important. But Scott has cobbled together a composite identity to compensate for lacking his own. He’s quickly earned a rep as a shameless biter, an aesthetic bender with no regard for ownership or authorship—a claim given credence by Rodeo’s second single, the Swae Lee-imitating ""Antidote"". This has become the enduring criticism of Scott’s work so far: That he’s a skilled impersonator posing as a creative, a mime playing puppetmaster. (There are at least three alleged reports of creative theft, which led to this takedown in Deadspin.) But this narrative overshadows the more glaring holes in his music. Travis Scott isn’t good at rapping—he often bawls out clunky phrases that dawdle into banality (""Always hit the gas like I broke wind"")—and his self-proclaimed status as an auteur isn’t dictated by his own talent, but by the talent of those surrounding him. ""Who do I owe? Nigga, no one,"" he boasts on opener ""Pornography"", when he’s actually deeply indebted to those in or adjacent to the Kanye Think Tank and the others he’s wrangled based on that affiliation. One thing Scott does very well is squirm through openings onto bigger platforms, which is a talent in and of itself. He is one of rap’s premier young capitalists, an opportunist deft in the use of social currency, turning a friendship with Illroots creator Mike Waxx into a relationship with T.I. and finagling a meeting with Kanye West out of networking with his engineer, Anthony Kilhoffer. The strength of his catalog is almost exclusively dependent on the strength of his connections. Rodeo is the culmination of Travis Scott’s amassed networking efforts. The credits are a Who’s Who of the big names in rap and its neighboring genres: Narrated by T.I., it tells a nebulous tale of Scott’s meteoric rise and the perils of fame. The lush and often gorgeous production comes courtesy of current league leaders in rap hit-making Metro Boomin, Sonny Digital, and Zaytoven, with add-ons and attachments from a host of heavy hitters like Mike Dean, DJ Dahi, Hit-Boy, Wondagurl, Southside, FKi, and TM88. There’s standout work from Frank Dukes and Allen Ritter. Sometimes, like on ""Oh My Dis Side"" or ""90210"", beats jack-knife in two, revealing stunningly posh second acts. Sometimes, like on the nearly eight minute epic ""3500"", they have shimmering piano outros. The Pharrell-produced ""Flying High"" fastens a surging, slow-rolling coda onto a wailing beat. The sound is a kind of big-budget alt-trap with lots of accents and gloss, like if Future’s Dirty Sprite 2 was executive produced by 2010 Kanye, and it often pays big dividends. Many of those dividends, though, feel as though they arrive in spite of Scott. He’s easily outmaneuvered by charismatic rappers of note Juicy J, Quavo, and 2 Chainz (""Crib bigger than your imagination""). Pop singers the Weeknd and Justin Bieber both steal the show with singsong rap-like verses on their respective features. Even Chief Keef and Toro Y Moi make their presences heavily felt, upstaging the Houston rapper in the process. Travis Scott’s verses are often without substance and chock full of choppy cadences, and songs without guests, especially ""I Can Tell"", are undone by the monotony. To be fair, Scott isn’t without his merits. He is most effective when he harshly distorts his vocals to create texture, and in the company of others he can serve as a welcome change of pace. He has an ear for programming. But Rodeo’s best songs—""Maria I’m Drunk"" and ""Nightcrawler""—mostly succeed because they overcome his contributions. He's still a middling talent, and comes across as rebellious youngster that’s been given the keys to dad’s Porsche and simply asked not to wreck it.","There are few emerging artists more polarizing than Travis Scott.

Parting Glances,Air Waves,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b074b1335d7bf169a108/1:1/w_160/43cd9645.jpg,2015-09-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21011-parting-glances/,Western Vinyl,"For all the characters Nicole Schneit slips into on Parting Glances, all the lives she touches upon and then runs from, she can never seem to sing her way out of her own head. The Brooklyn songwriter’s second record as Air Waves jettisons some of the twang that marked 2010’s Dungeon Dots, opting for urban chug over playful Americana but still holding fast to the guitar as a nucleus for her songwriting. And though she brings on collaborators like Lower Dens’ Jana Hunter and Ava Luna’s Felicia Douglass, Schneit winds up streamlining her sound instead of expanding it. Parting Glances hones in on her laconic delivery and dry touch on the fretboard, never losing its poise but rarely getting too visceral, either. As a lead vocalist, Schneit also keeps her cool. Her sandy, stoic timbre mingles easily with the treble- and cymbal-heavy orchestrations she wraps around it with her three bandmates. When she sings over Hunter’s low harmonies on opener ""Horse Race"" and centerpiece ""Thunder"", it’s like we’re hearing two sides of the same artist. The voices twin each other, leaving just enough space to cast shadow in the valley between them, and lending an extra slice of depth to a sound field that tends to skew flat. The lyrics on Parting Glances err toward the simple, too, but even the most well-worn lines work when folded into their surroundings. When Schneit sings ""Someone take this pain away from me"" in the first few measures of ""Fantasy"", she cracks the last word into two syllables, two notes, like the pain itself can’t be contained inside the words she uses to alleviate it. ""I’m not sure what it’s about/ 'Cause the meaning never came,"" she sings, and she doesn’t plumb further. Her pain and its weight never resolve themselves; they just circulate in an endless four-chord progression while she sings like she’s trying to keep her head above water. ""I’m a bad man for coming around/ But you invited me here,"" Schneit proclaims on the enigmatic ""Frank"", one of many songs where she traces only the shadow of a character and lets us do the work of filling in the rest. Most of Parting Glances works invisibly like that—the album won’t stand out for its depth or its guts, but finds its stride in its smarts, in Schneit's knack for elliptical storytelling. These aren’t the richest stories you’ll ever hear, but they're enough to hook you along for the ride.","On her second album as Air Waves, Nicole Schneit jettisons some of the twang that marked her 2010 debut, opting for urban chug over playful Americana.

Wald,Pole,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc4b1335d7bf1699fd6/1:1/w_160/5aa263f1.jpg,2015-09-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20880-wald/,Pole,"Wald marks a new beginning—maybe even a new new beginning—for Pole, the solo alias of the Berlin producer and mastering engineer Stefan Betke. It is his first album in seven years, and its predecessor, Steingarten, was itself a kind of reboot. Early on in the Pole project, Betke was remarkably productive: In just six years he recorded five albums, and the first three of those were instant classics, despite the fact that they were all essentially variations on the same theme—an alchemical fusion of dub bass and static crackle. But with albums four and five, as Betke sought to escape the strictures of his own signature, he seemed to find only detours rather than a viable way forward (2001's R, featuring remixes from Burnt Friedman and Kit Clayton, has held up rather well; 2003's Pole, featuring the rapper Fat Jon, has not). A four-year break followed, and it must have done him good, because Steingarten, in 2007, was among the best work of his career. Abandoning the midrange murk and omnipresent white noise in favor of crisp sounds, elastic rhythms, and vast space, it felt like vacuum-sealed krautrock, and as a celebration of texture and tone color, it was exhilarating. Perhaps Betke's unwillingness to repeat himself explains why he followed Steingarten with yet another extended silence, one broken only in 2011 with a trio of EPs, Waldgeschichten (German for Forest Stories). That title, like Wald, refers to the walks in the woods where Betke apparently looked for inspiration. That image may bring to mind Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project, whose foggy swirls of classical samples were inspired by the Black Forest and its role in German Romanticism. But the two artists' impressions of the woods couldn't be more different. Where Gas is either dark and claustrophobic or starlit and idyllic, Pole's Wald evokes porous thickets and branches stripped bare by the elements. As is customary in his work, texture reigns supreme. Instead of melodies, there are clusters of tone—glassy drum-machine pings, brushed metal, scraped flint, the atonal shimmer of a guitar being strummed above the nut. In ""Käfer"", a junkyard guitar provides the semblance of a through-line across a landscape of crickets and electrical interference; a synthetic melodica takes the lead in ""Moos (Live)"", and wheezing organs lend both color and a viscous sense of substance to many of the album's tracks. Only in ""Myzel"" and ""Fichte"", whose chiming leads are faintly reminiscent of Autechre, does a melodic sensibility begin to creep back into the heavily abstracted landscape. The three songs designated as ""Live"" aren't concert recordings, but live-in-the-studio updates of tracks previously released on the Waldgeschichten EPs. That method—recording in real time, both hands on the mixing desk—is Betke's enduring debt to dub. Those dub mechanics have a lot to do with the music's flexible rhythms and odd syncopations, which contribute to the mercurial sense of flow: There are almost always more elements in play than you can track, and whatever silvery filament you choose to focus on, your attention will soon be hijacked by something else. Still, there's nothing hectic about the listening experience; thanks to its relaxed pace and gently abstracted shapes, Wald is every bit as contemplative as the forest walks that inspired it. It has an unfettered sense of motion that, for an artist who was once, by his own admission, stuck in a rut, sounds like the sweetest kind of freedom.","Wald marks a new beginning for Pole, the solo alias of the Berlin producer and mastering engineer Stefan Betke. His early albums from the last decade were dub-inspired ambient landmarks, but his new music is more spacious and open, though texture still reigns supreme.

Pagans In Vegas,Metric,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06dc0084474cd0c1c4c/1:1/w_160/b5e36e34.png,2015-09-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21006-pagans-in-vegas/,MMI / Crystal Math Music,"Over the past decade, Broken Social Scene alumna Emily Haines has played the role of post-Internet philosopher, struggling to retain her individuality in a world growing more developed and technologically dependent by the day. The binary between authenticity and artificiality has remained a perennial interest for the Toronto-based musician, and it comes up yet again on her band Metric's latest album Pagans In Vegas with zero subtlety. In one corner waits the natural, manifested in dressed-down guitars and Haines’ lilting soprano. In the other, the machines state their case through forays into disco drudgery, stiff synths and Siri singalongs. Over the course of 13 tracks, these two forces collide, with the latter ultimately winning out. Pagans in Vegas deepens the new-wave  dalliances of its predecessor (2012's Synthetica) with their slinkiest, slickest palette to date. Depeche Mode’s influence is impossible to ignore – opening track ""Lie Lie Lie"" and mid-album highlight ""Too Bad, So Sad"" take their rhythmic cues from the bluesy strut of ""Personal Jesus"", while ""For Kicks"" channels the nocturnal throb of ""Precious"". The cartoonish 8-bit bleep-bloops adorning tracks like ""The Shade"", meanwhile, belie a quirkier, '80s-arcade inspiration. This gives listeners the chance to experience Metric in an unprecedentedly cheery context, but in the case of ""The Shade"", it comes at the cost of stirring up traumatic memories of Adam Sandler’s god-awful video game movie Pixels. Fortunately, the group make up for it with lead single ""Cascades"", a glitched-out dance track that casts Haines as some type of forlorn, sleep-deprived android, whispering against the percussionists’ paranoid, thumping percussion. It’s the perfect synthesis of Fantasies’ meaty fretwork and Live It Out's glossy electronics, as well as a rare moment of stylistic equilibrium. As with past albums, Haines continues to seek lyrical inspiration from everyday Sisyphean struggles. On ""Too Bad, So Sad"", she finds herself in a restless transit ""back and forth between the desert and the sea"", qualifying it with a shrug: ""who I was and I will always be"". Love proves an equally futile endeavor; on ""For Kicks"", Haines offers the least-comforting parting words imaginable to a former interest, cooing that she’d stay true ""if it was easy"" (par for the course in the Tinder age). ""I want it all!"" she crows on ""The Shade"", and as the album progresses, Haines’ self-awareness emerges as the most intriguing aspect of the album's character. In a recent interview with SPIN, Haines revealed that Metric have already prepared an answer to Pagans In Vegas: a follow-up album recorded entirely with all analog instruments. Up to this point, the band’s maintained a long-lasting marriage to the zeroes and ones, but that appears to be changing. The shift would be more compelling if it didn't feel so literal. In Pagans in Vegas, humans and machines exist in a binary relationship. The reality is both more nuanced and fertile than that.","Pagans in Vegas is Metric's slinkiest, slickest album to date. It deepens the new-wave  dalliances of its predecessor (2012's Synthetica), exploring the binary between authenticity and artificiality with zero subtlety.

What the World Needs Now...,Public Image Ltd,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0bb5e6ef95969322001/1:1/w_160/c9d686d6.jpg,2015-09-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21058-what-the-world-needs-now/,CargoRed Eye,"John Lydon doesn’t seem like the jealous type. But I like to imagine that when he relaunched Public Image Ltd. six years ago, he saw the extended careers of peers like Mark E. Smith or David Thomas—iconic singers who can make interesting music with pretty much anyone—and thought, ""Shit, I can do that too."" He’d likely snort at the suggestion, but whatever his motivation, the two latest PiL albums are similar to recent Fall and Pere Ubu efforts: They’re solid not because of the songs, but because of the singer. What the World Needs Now… is an improvement on 2012’s This Is PiL primarily because Lydon’s vocal theatrics and calisthenics are even more entertaining this time. He rants, spits, croons, screams, gulps, and whispers, all with equal commitment. In the process he injects tension into even the most predictable music. And much of What the World Needs Now… is musically predictable, but not in a bad way. At their best, PiL—again like the Fall—construct sturdy grooves and momentum-building loops that Lydon sprays his voice all over like graffiti splattering a wall. The moments when the music matches the intensity of Lydon’s singing are exhilarating. Fiery opener ""Double Trouble"" is so cartoonishly angry it sounds like a Sex Pistols parody, until you realize Lydon’s in on the joke (the lyrics recount a mundane argument with his wife over toilet repair). Even sharper is the delirious ""Know Now"", where it sounds like Lydon got dizzy trying to keep up. This synergy works on some mellower songs too, such as the shuffling ""The One"" and the soaring ""Spice of Choice"". Other mid-tempo tunes on What the World Needs Now… don’t fare as well. The line between compelling repetition and tedious wheel-grinding is pretty thin for this group, and though Lydon always battles valiantly to breath life into flatter songs, he can’t save them all. Things never quite fall apart completely, though it does become tough to find a heartbeat inside the fuel-deprived ""Big Blue Sky"". It doesn’t help that the tune’s disengaging loops and arena-rock choruses last for over eight minutes. Those kinds of struggles come during What the World Needs Now...'s second half, which makes the album feel a bit like a five-mile race run by a sprinter. Things end on a pointed note, though, as Lydon solves the riddle of his own album title: ""What the world needs now/ Is another fuck off!"" Anyone ensnared by Lydon’s past work will find enough here to hope he and PiL continue to seek those kinds of answers.","Public Image Ltd.'s second reunion album is solid not because of the songs, but because John Lydon is their singer.

Sun Coming Down,Ought,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff513d197565213a396/1:1/w_160/2dff0bfc.jpg,2015-09-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20913-sun-coming-down/,Constellation,"Pop music was built on a whole lotta ""yeah."" Because saying ""yeah"" is the most casual, innocuous form of rebellion—there is no easier way of showing you don’t give a fuck than abdicating the responsibility required to enunciate the ""s"" in ""yes."" Seeing it through to the end is a show of diligence and commitment. So when Ought singer-guitarist Tim Darcy drops a fulsome ""yes"" in the middle of ""Beautiful Blue Sky""—the spectacular centerpiece track of his band’s sophomore album, Sun Coming Down—he’s sure to savor it. Amid a song whose chorus reads like a laundry list of 21st-century blights (""Warplane/ Condo/ New development"") and excruciating water-cooler chit chat (""How’s the family?/ How's your health been?/ Fancy seeing you here!"")—Darcy declares, ""I’m no longer afraid to die/ Because that is all that I have left/ Yessssss,"" stretching out that last letter like pizza dough on a woodblock. It’s an alarming admission, one that reads like the last will and testament of somebody who’s been so numbed by the dispiriting, clockwork demands of modern life that choosing death feels like the only empowering, self-actualizing move at their disposal. But Darcy invests his ""yes"" with an ecstatic sense of clarity, as if he was John Lennon meeting Yoko Ono for the first time. Though Darcy is a poet whose voluminous verbiage often overwhelms his melodies, it’s no insult to say that simple ""yes"" is the greatest lyric he’s written—because it so perfectly crystallizes his band’s essence and purpose. Ought make indie rock that sounds like how urbanity makes you feel: nervous, antsy, sometimes hostile, yet intoxicatingly vibrant. And Darcy, likewise, gesticulates like a dutiful office drone who’s played by the rules his whole life but just can’t take it anymore. Ought’s 2014 debut, More Than Any Other Day, was an album of slowly unfurled epiphanies, stoking simmering tension into fiery, exultant release. Those sort of affirming moments are a little harder to come by on the more chaotic and caustic Sun Coming Down, but the album’s relentless drive and uncompromising attitude constitute their own special kind of thrill. If More Than Any Other Day was about the hard-fought, triumphant ascent, Sun Coming Down is the giddy, daredevil ""wheeeeee!"" down the other side of the peak. A lot has changed for Ought since the release of their first album—not the least of which is their lead singer’s surname. (Darcy was billed as Tim Beeler the last time out.) More significantly, what was once a casual project among university roommates was promoted to workhorse touring act, and Sun Coming Down sounds like the sort of record that was hastily hashed out in between transatlantic jaunts. But that’s not to suggest the album sounds unfinished or is lacking focus—rather, the new album takes full advantage of Ought’s fully revved, road-tested engine and increased horsepower, in a strike-while-the-iron’s-hot move. Gone are the hazy ambient ballads, quirky congeniality, and taut goose-stepped grooves that, on More Than Any Other Day, counterbalanced the band’s wiry freneticism. Here, Ought doubles-down on their oft-cited early-'80s Fall and late-'80s Sonic Youth reference points, handily destroying any inkling you might have had about this band following the likes of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah or Vampire Weekend into big-tent-indie territory. Sun Coming Down’s more aggressive attack pushes Darcy out of his usual agitated-everyman mode to deliver more cryptic narratives in a theatrical snarl that, at times, verges on Mark E. Smith karaoke. But while Ought’s influences may be obvious, you’re never really sure where they’re taking them: the fearsome rapid-fire rants, clanging guitar tangle and jackhammered drums of ""The Combo"" turn oddly celebratory in the wake of the song’s surprisingly cheery chorus (""Jubilation, darling!""); the bee-swarm buzz and frantic accelerations of ""Celebration"" are undercut by Darcy’s wonderfully fey, Fred Schneider-worthy exhortations (""Okay... let’s do it!""). Other songs are subjected to more abrupt change-ups: ""On the Line"" alternates between ponderous tone poem and garage-punk rave-up, before settling into a sublime third act that recalls the steady, galloping build-up of Patti Smith’s ""Gloria"", while ""Passionate Turn""—the only time here Ought attempt to channel the nocturnal grace of More Than Any Other Day’s knockout ballad ""Habit""—turns from swooning, stumbling serenade into a menacing, militaristic march for its final verse/chorus run. Even the songs that remain locked into formation undergo subtle yet substantial mutations. The opening sprint of ""Men for Miles"" sees Darcy rewriting his verse melody with each pass and, as the band lean their full weight into the song’s motorik momentum, his unyieldingly abrasive guitar noise gives way to hypnotic, third eye-prying bliss. And the aforementioned ""Beautiful Blue Sky"" may initially sound like Ought’s answer to ""Marquee Moon"", but spiritually speaking, it’s their ""Once in a Lifetime"", a song that paints a vivid picture of cubicle-bound 9-to-5 conformity before providing you with the sledgehammer to smash it. The transmission may be a little more distorted this time out, but, with Sun Coming Down, Ought’s underlying message is the same as it ever was: you have the power within you to change your lot in life. When you feel like there’s no way out, just say ""yes.""","Ought’s 2014 debut, More Than Any Other Day, was an album of slowly unfurled epiphanies.

Over and Even,Joan Shelley,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af029d034d5c69bf4643/1:1/w_160/d82f644f.jpg,2015-09-14 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20930-over-and-even/,No Quarter,"During the final verse of ""Over and Even"", Joan Shelley discovers the ceiling of her evocative voice and dares to test it. The title track of the Kentucky singer-songwriter’s beguiling third album, ""Over and Even"" is a gentle canter. Cymbals splash idly against a steady electric guitar, and a banjo babbles in the distance, as though it soon hopes to join Shelley’s fireside chat. The song itself, though, is an anxious number, where images of domestic bliss disintegrate into feelings of longing. At first, Shelley offers scenes of nesting bliss in her warm contralto—smoldering embers and full cups of coffee, handwritten letters and thoughts of friends. But during every other verse, her voice becomes a thin and nervous soprano, as if she’s barely able to utter her own words. With the song's last words, she admits to an abiding loneliness: ""I miss your scent and sight,"" she sings, her voice about to break. ""How can I write this?"" Shelley weaves that feeling of vulnerability throughout the dozen songs of Over and Even, an album that is alternately more confessional and prismatic than her previous output—and better for it. Shelley comes from an American folk background, with a history singing songs endemic to her rural region. She records, for instance, with Maiden Radio, a trio that works through standards with traditional instruments and commingled country voices. While her earliest solo records spoke to that pedigree, last year’s Electric Ursa took bona fide compositional risks. ""Something Small"", for instance, grew like a post-rock phoenix, while ""Remedios"" suggested a lullaby bound forever in hypnagogia. She embraced elliptical songwriting, too, webbing together evocative phrases to suggest a story more than share it. If Electric Ursa began with a folk core, it ended with folk in fragments. On Over and Even, however, Shelley returns to her roots without fully retreating beneath them. Accompanied by fingerstyle guitarist and musical archivist Nathan Salsburg, she favors a refined simplicity. ""My Only Trouble"" is a duet for strummed-and-picked acoustic guitars and her leaping-and-diving voice, while ""Easy Now"" is a big-chord ballad, where reassuring piano lines offer support behind lithe, bluegrass-like runs. Even the more fully produced numbers, like the organ-lined and electric ""Ariadne’s Gone"" or the Will Oldham-backed beauty ""Stay on My Shore"", seem only to dress up simple structures, to cast them in a full studio glow. The lyrics follow suit, too, with Shelley letting listeners in as she previously didn’t—hence, the hint of unease that ends ""Over and Even"". ""My Only Trouble"", for instance, is sensual but bothered, with confessions of intimacy chased by admissions of worry. Likewise, ""Stay on My Shore"" betrays a human neediness that Shelley might have once clouded or cloaked. As Oldham chases her through the verses, their musical push-and-pull reinforces the give-and-take of any good relationship or, as they sing with their last shared breath, ""the pages of our story."" That clear lifetime theme returns during the gentle ""Not Over by Half"". Meant both as a mournful dirge and an anthem of expectations, the song positions a death as a reminder that everyone else still has the chance to live. ""Here on the mountain I’m thinking of you,"" Shelley sings in one of her most vivid bits of writing yet. ""The birds are all singing, screaming of youth."" She keeps the listener almost as close as the subject. This tension between plain old songs and structures and an interest in omitting details and accessorizing sounds enlivens Over and Even from start to finish. Shelley started with folk and then pushed away from it, to Electric Ursa’s spectral and soft version of roots-rock. But now in the middle, where the songs are direct but bent just so, she’s more compelling than she’s ever been.","Though Joan Shelley is a folk traditionalist, she's spent her career playing with its form. On Over and Even, her third and best album, she returns to something closer to her origins to make as compelling a record as that genre has seen.

Prom King,Skylar Spence,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04c13d197565213a43e/1:1/w_160/2f90b548.jpg,2015-09-14 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20977-prom-king/,Carpark,"""I was working, tried my hardest,"" Ryan DeRobertis, aka Skylar Spence, sings on Prom King’s disco-tinged ode to self-love ""Can’t You See"". ""Slowed some music down and called myself an artist."" The lyric is a recognizable jab at the musician’s own past, a career built on choppy dance remixes of pop songs labeled as ""experimental"" or ""vaporwave,"" collected and stacked up like bricks in a well-supported corner of Bandcamp. But now DeRobertis has made moves to ground himself. He signed to Carpark Records, ditched his previous corporation-provoking moniker, Saint Pepsi, and started singing himself instead of simply remixing others voices. While ""Can’t You See"" is directed at grabbing the attention of a girl, as DeRobertis’ first statement on the record it's pointed just as much at his fans. And Prom King is his slickest project to date, brimming with as much confidence as its title suggests. This is dance music that’s almost a late-'00s throwback, with the record’s synth arrangements and affinity for Chic basslines more in line with the early music of artists like Miami Horror, Neon Indian, and Cut Copy than what clubs are playing now. No bass drops, no house revival, no costumed persona; this is highly warped nu-disco that’s frantically aggressive in its pacing and composition. Prom King vibrates at all times with hyperactivity. On songs like ""Cash Wednesday"" and ""Bounce Is Back"" it sounds like someone restlessly flipping between radio stations, with violins, new wave synths, and fluttery sampled R&B vocals rolling into one another. ""My album is sort of about the narcissism that comes with nostalgia,"" DeRobertis said in an interview. ""You have to have some sort of audacity to claim a certain time as ‘the best’ and throw out everything in the present and everything in the future."" In this sense, Skylar Spence isn’t making pop music, but making music about pop. You don’t just hear it in how he mixes his songs, but also in how he writes them. ""Oh darling, won’t you believe me,"" DeRobertis’ sings on the infectiously groovy, ""Degrassi""-referencing ""Fiona Coyne"", first released as a single last year. ""I’ll love you ‘til the record stops."" And every ""I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love"" on ""Can’t You See"" is directed at his own reflection in the mirror. DeRobertis could plausibly have built an album of could-be radio hits like ""Fiona Coyne"" if he toned down the freakiness of the music beneath him, but that doesn’t seem to be his objective. The spliced-together samples and glitchy collages makes Prom King distinctive, although sometimes it feels over-indulgent. Even with DeRobertis’ distanced, conceptual take on pop nostalgia, he's still made a great pop record in itself. It doesn’t matter what noises or instruments he’s appropriating from, in his hands it’s all good to dance to right now.","Ryan DeRobertis, aka Skylar Spence, has ditched his previous corporation-provoking moniker, Saint Pepsi, and started singing himself instead of simply remixing others' voices. Prom King is his slickest project to date, brimming with as much confidence as its title suggests.

Cut With the Cake Knife,Rose McDowall,by: J. Edward Keyes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff49d034d5c69bf47c3/1:1/w_160/6d83c614.jpg,2015-09-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20912-cut-with-the-cake-knife/,Sacred Bones,"Everything you need to know about Strawberry Switchblade, the Scottish duo of Rose McDowall and Jill Bryson, is right there in the name. The group, who grew out of the late '70s Glasgow punk scene paired brightly-colored, synth-driven new wave melodies with lyrics that often spoke of sadness and loss. That polarity between light and darkness became even more apparent in the group’s acrimonious dissolution in 1986, just five years after they started. MacDowall had always nursed an interest in the occult, but over the course of the duo's brief run, it deepened, moving beyond a childlike fascination with fairies into the realm of straight-up black magic (in one oft-repeated story, she was so furious with a bad note during the recording of ""Let Her Go"", she allegedly stared at the tape machine and willed it to burst into flames). Her curiosity only intensified after she and her husband fell in with Genesis P-Orridge, which led to even darker pursuits—in an extensive interview, Bryson claims McDowall developed an obsession with Nazi history, going so far as to hang a Nazi flag in her apartment. While McDowall emphatically denies the claim, her collaborations with suspect artists like Boyd Rice and Death in June in the intervening years seem unwise at best. Fortunately, none of these matters surface on Cut With the Cake Knife, which McDowall recorded in various locations around the UK in the 1980s, shortly after Strawberry Switchblade’s breakup. Instead, the album’s 11 songs follow the same blueprint that made McDowall’s previous group so bewitching, pairing bleak—and, at times, violent—lyrics to the kind of sugary music that might soundtrack a particularly rambunctious children’s show. Drum machines whirr and rattle, keyboards blink like buggy Lite Brites, and McDowall’s somber alto winds its way through the center like a serpent cutting a path through cellophane Easter grass. On the opening track ""Tibet"", she seems to be wrestling with Strawberry Switchblade’s breakup, sighing ""I don’t want you to go/ But can’t ask you to stay/ I wish I could change your mind/ But wishes sometimes die."" The music that surrounds it is a kind of ersatz calypso, with charmingly chintzy rhythms and gurgling keyboards, but the vocal melody is so assured and clear-eyed that the song never feels cloying or saccharine. ""Sixty Cowboys"" dabbles in the kind of synthetic country that the Magnetic Fields would master on Charm of the Highway Strip, with brittle keyboards filling in for banjos and McDowall’s lonesome voice floating upward like campfire smoke. And while the title ""Crystal Nights"" takes on an ominous meaning in light of the allegations about McDowall’s hobbies, the song itself harbors no questionable subject matter. Instead, it depicts her in bed daydreaming about her lover as keyboards spiral like fireflies around her. While its ingredients are undeniably basic—all of the songs are built from a few period-appropriate keyboards and chugging drum machines, and that’s mostly it—what makes Cake Knife so consistently endearing is how effortless it all sounds. That the only bum note is a chirpy cover of ""Don’t Fear the Reaper"", which comes off like the theme music to an old Commodore 64 game, speaks to how strong the rest of the record is. On Cake Knife, McDowall has created a kind of aural Candy Land, one where she can break off vanilla bark from Jujyfruit trees while she sings about death and despair. The title track—which was originally intended to be a Strawberry Switchblade song—takes that m.o. to its logical extreme. While a comically cartoonish bass and hyperactive synths jitter and pop around her, McDowall beckons a lover closer before announcing in its deliriously euphoric chorus, ""I will take you by the hand and lead you/ To my sunny side and I will/ Cut you with the cake knife/ Right between the eyes."" In McDowall’s world, cake and chaos go hand in hand. She’s the witch at the door of the gingerbread house, beckoning you inside.","Though she makes the kind of sugary music that might soundtrack a particularly rambunctious children’s show, Rose McDowall will also ""cut you with a cake knife."" This reissue of the former Strawberry Switchblade singer's '80 solo material is good for murder sprees and/or cuddle sessions.

Grind,DJ Richard,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc39d034d5c69bf477a/1:1/w_160/9388f000.jpg,2015-09-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20878-grind/,Dial,"From its cover, DJ Richard's Grind looks like a certain bombed-out species of noise record. It's got a black-and-white color scheme and an elegantly austere design, in the center of which a neatly centered photograph of a bridge rises, bleached and brittle as a wishbone, from a wintry thicket of trees. Those familiar with Rhode Island may recognize the structure as the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge—and what is Rhode Island if not a longstanding hotbed of unorthodox electronics? But Grind is not a noise record, even though its darkly lustrous synthesizers could probably serve as the foundation for a pretty blistering Prurient track. Like the Rhode Island native’s previous EPs for New York’s White Material label, DJ Richard’s debut album strikes a balance between house and techno: analog in feel, melancholy in mood, and rough around the edges, yet still unmistakably elegant. More than his previous singles, Grind serves as a bridge between European and American styles, perhaps as a result of his relocation to Berlin. Its patient, four-to-the-floor rhythms, consonant tones, and twinkling details are of a piece with German producers (and Dial regulars) like Lawrence and Roman Flügel, and the wistful shimmer of ""I-Mir"" and ""Vampire Dub"" echoes Kompakt’s resident sentimentalist, Superpitcher. But his unvarnished drum machines and torn-up textures have more in common with the brawnier approach favored by scrappy domestic crews like L.I.E.S., while his crisply jacking grooves go straight to the Midwestern root. Far more than a formal exercise, though, the album is as expressive as techno gets, tracing a path from sullen mood pieces to bittersweet melodies to something that feels cathartic. It was recorded after two years spent living in landlocked Berlin, which might explain the vaguely coastal theme that surfaces in titles like ""Savage Coast"", ""Waiting for the Green Flash"", and ""I-Mir"" (the latter two are references to an atmospheric optical illusion occasionally seen at sunset). Above all, Grind comes across as a meditation on homesickness and distance; that’s particularly true of the album’s bleakest tracks, which are rooted in coldwave and dark ambient. The album opens with a lowing foghorn dirge that brings to mind the bilious drones of Christoph de Babalon’s 1997 album If You’re Into It, I’m Out of It. It's one of several beatless, atmospheric tracks that help set the album's pensive tone: ""Waiting for the Green Flash"" sounds like a pitched-down approximation of the beatless closing minutes of Sonic Youth's ""Expressway to Yr Skull"", all brooding bell tones and trembling harmonics, while the monolithic ""Ejected"" sounds like a synth player's tribute to microtonal minimalists Tony Conrad and Phill Niblock. At first blush, these tracks might seem static, but turn them up loud enough and zero in on the shifting contours of their frequencies, and they truly come alive. His beat-oriented work benefits from the same richness and subtlety. ""Nighthawk"", ""Savage Coast"", and ""Bane"", in particular, are examples of how to sculpt and layer relatively simple analog sounds so that they really sing. Richard's taste in synthesizers leans towards soft pads that beg you to sink into them, and he has a knack for contrasting those airy patches with tough, cutting drum hits that leave welts where they land. On ""Nighthawk"", a stretched and sandpapered wail in the background is both harsh and enveloping—a tactic that goes to the heart of the producer's keen sense of balance. He favors stuttering drum programming that suggests a mechanical kind of funk, and he is skilled at arranging contrapuntal lines into complicated but elegant orbits. Despite the outward simplicity of his productions, there's always something to tip their intensity levels subtly into the red. On ""Screes of Gray Craig"", it's the slight detuning of three or four separate synthesizer parts, so that they vibrate wildly in combination. And in the closing ""Vampire Dub"", a relaxing cut suffused in dreamy chords, it's the eerie, atonal bleating that burbles on like cosmic background radiation. Still, even at their most roiled, Grind's waters invite extended immersion. It's both one of the year's most sumptuous techno long-players and a masterful example of an unusual, bare-knuckled strain of ambient music.","DJ Richard's debut LP is one of house and techno's best records of the year. Equal parts American and European, analog in feel, melancholy in mood, rough around the edges, and yet still unmistakably elegant, Grind is as expressive as techno gets.

Ones and Sixes,Low,by: Corbin Reiff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0529d034d5c69bf4861/1:1/w_160/116c89e7.jpg,2015-09-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20982-ones-and-sixes/,Sub Pop,"Low will always be considered the quintessential slowcore band, but their real mastery, and the secret to their decades-long vitality, lies in something more intangible than tempo. They have a preternatural mastery of arrangement and dynamics, an instinct for when and how to pick the exact right moment to lift the volume a bit, to accent a repetitive moment with this synth line or that fuzzed guitar. The steady pace and the melancholy atmospherics are important, but without their keen ear for detail, the music would simply be a haze. Admittedly, Low’s last album The Invisible Way, produced by Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy and released in 2013, could have benefited from a few more of those lively punctuations. But it seems as though the fallout from that experience woke the band up, and Ones and Sixes is a far more interesting record for it. To create their new one, the members retreated deep into rural Wisconsin with producer BJ Burton and recorded at Justin Vernon’s April Base Studios in Eau Claire. It’s hard to tell what might have triggered it, but the band hasn’t sounded this lively in years; maybe not since its Sub Pop debut The Great Destroyer from a decade ago. The opening track ""Gentle"" is a discomfiting funeral dirge that sets an unnerving mood early on. The instrumentation combines static-y bits of industrial percussion with rich, elegant keyboard accents, as Mimi Parker’s near-falsetto flutters in and out, sometimes multi-tracked and sometimes padded out with as much reverb as can conceivably be applied. The song's verses feel like free-associative jumbles of words like, ""gentle, battle, torture, stable and silence"", underscoring the song's fitful, uneasy energy. That mood settles into the album, which otherwise doesn't offer dramatic shifts. Airy, luscious backing vocals and sparse, gritty instrumentation remain the mainstay of Low’s sound, and they are used to wondrous effect on the nearly 10-minute long penultimate track ""Landslide"". But there’s a real immediacy and liveliness to Alan Sparhawk's vocals and playing there that’s been missing from the group’s more recent records. His singing is so full and present on songs like ""Spanish Translation"" and ""Lies"" that it feels like a renewed bid for your undivided attention. And as much as they are able to make a conventional ""pop"" song then ""No End"" is it. For all intents and purposes it’s a pretty standard, under three-minute, get-in and get-out love song, and based on the words alone, a very treacly one at that: ""I couldn’t wait to come back through/ To you."" Not exactly a left-turn, but a welcome, additional flavor. Most bands don’t have either the stamina or the creative drive to make it up to and past the 20-year mark. The ones that do rarely find new things to say. As its enters its third decade making music, Low has reached a comfortable but engaging stride creating music that consistently seems to be at odds with itself. Ones and Sixes is all at once beautiful, ugly, tense, warm, inviting and repellent. It’s an emotional and sonic juggling act where even the slightest bum-note would draw attention to itself. As always with Low, the beauty is all about the details.","The members of Low retreated deep into rural Wisconsin with producer BJ Burton and recorded their latest album at Justin Vernon’s April Base Studios in Eau Claire. The band hasn’t sounded this lively in years; maybe not since its Sub Pop debut The Great Destroyer from a decade ago.

Too,FIDLAR,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0e4ea9e61561daa66bf/1:1/w_160/26277787.jpg,2015-09-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21063-fidlar-too/,Mom + Pop,"For a band like FIDLAR, the idea of artistic growth seems kind of oxymoronic, or for anyone familiar with the L.A.-based punk dirtbags, maybe just plain moronic. On the jokily earnest, chillaxed last few strummed seconds of ""Punks"", the second track from their sophomore LP Too, frontman Zac Carper muses, ""Relationships are fucking wack/ They make me want to smoke crack/ And girlfriend or boyfriend can suck my dick/ Masturbate, let's make it quick."" It's a perfect encapsulation of FIDLAR's outlook (the band name is an acronym for Fuck It, Dog, Life's A Risk), one that they already cemented on their enjoyably party-hardy self-titled debut, a hormonal love letter to getting fucked up and fucking up. And while a title like Too might lead you to believe that FIDLAR are wisely committed to not fixing what isn't broke— there are more scuzzy guitars and songs about bad medicine, bad habits, and stupid decisions (all of which happen to be song titles)— it seems to have bigger things in mind for itself. FIDLAR were initially met with the obvious-but-apt comparison to kindred West Coast spirits Wavves, and Too seems to greatly admire Nathan Williams' transition from disaffected skate rat to pop-punk Beach King. It's a crisper, almost radio-friendly effort that's feels slightly jarring in comparison to FIDLAR. Part of this shift can be chalked up to the fact that in the past two years, FIDLAR have made a concerted effort to clean up, as Carper has since kicked everything from heroin to booze after a band intervention. The result is a more levelheaded FIDLAR, an incarnation that likely won't scare away too many fans as it aims to convert new ones. Gone is the feral scrap and the forays into sunburnt surfabilly, replaced by a more MTVU-friendly approach that only feels ""grown-up"" in the sense that it's graduated from 40s in the high-school parking lot to Smirnoff in the frat house basement. It's too bad Too doesn't boast more numbers like highlight ""West Coast"", a song about getting wasted on the road. But FIDLAR aim a little lower, offering dated-sounding blues stompers (""Punks""),  Black Lips-lite junkie laments (""Overdose""), interminably bratty nose-thumbing (""Sober""), questionable arena rock (""Bad Habits"") and a weird little detour into the British Invasion (""Why Generation"", which is hopefully supposed to be taken as tongue-in-cheek). The hooks feel forced this time, a byproduct of their desire for a broader audience that dilute the essence of what made them appealing to begin with. But it's undeniable that Too comes from a good place. Most of the record revolves around Carper's road to sobriety, and the many inherent pitfalls and setbacks faced along the way. ""I figured out when I got sober that life just sucks when you get older,"" he sings on ""Sober"", and it's a brief but affecting peek inside the head of a guy on the other side of addiction and staring down his thirties. A song like ""Leave Me Alone"" carries more weight when you realize it's about Carper's intervention, but too often, the songs break down into digestible little nuggets of stoner wisdom. So while Too is at times brave, that doesn't necessarily make it compelling.","FIDLAR's second record continues the hormonal, party vibes of their enjoyable debut, but seems to have bigger things in mind for itself.

Ugly Cherries,PWR BTTM,by: T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af885e6ef95969321e09/1:1/w_160/498af577.jpg,2015-09-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20829-ugly-cherries/,Father/DaughterMiscreant,"For those of us queer music lovers who came of age in the 1990s seeing Pansy Division—one of the few visible gay punk bands of that era—opening for Green Day on 1994’s Dookie tour was a kind of surreal, watershed moment. Though it seemed crazy at the time, it actually wasn’t the world’s most unusual pairing—both bands had at one point shared a label and each made pop punk songs that were equal parts snotty and catchy—but Pansy Division were an overtly and aggressively gay band with a cult following, while Green Day were riding high on their mainstream major label breakthrough. Even though Green Day's audience seemed flummoxed by Pansy Division—I remember people around me asking ‘Are they serious?’—the fact that it was happening at all felt pretty revolutionary. Indie rock was still mostly the unwelcoming domain of straight white dudes. With the occasional exception of seeing Pansy Division, God Is My Co-Pilot, or the mighty Team Dresch, being an openly queer person at a mainstream rock show still felt like an open invitation to getting your ass kicked. It’s hard not to think about Pansy Division when listening to PWR BTTM—the gloriously queer garage punk duo of guitarist Ben Hopkins and drummer Liv Bruce. Formed after the two met at Bard College in upstate New York, queer-identified PWR BTTM make very loud and occasionally very messy music without ever adopting some kind of faux masculine posturing. In fact, that band pretty much eviscerates said posturing with their live sets, in which the two loudly rip through their arsenal of pop-punk missives while flaunting a very rudimentary kind of drag—thrifted dresses, globs of glitter, and kabuki smears of makeup. What saves the whole enterprise from just being a well-played bit of cultural commentary is PWR BTTM's music—they write really catchy songs and they play the shit out of them. The eleven tracks on Ugly Cherries, PWR BTTM’s full-length debut, mostly vacillate between two-minute rave-ups about boys (""I Wanna Boi"", ""All the Boys"") and two-minute ruminations on the lack thereof (""West Texas"", ""C U Around""). On ""I Wanna Boi"" Bruce recites a list of needs for potential partners (""I want a boy who thinks it’s sexy when my lipstick bleeds/ I want a boy who can go all night without stopping/ I want a boy knows exactly what he needs"") against a stomping guitar/drum track that wouldn’t sound out of place on an early White Stripes record. He even goes as far as to share his email address just in case any qualified applicants want to get in touch. The song, like much of the rest of Ugly Cherries, is certainly funny, but it isn’t a joke. In fact, the record is hearteningly earnest. The band’s best songs are about articulating the goofy, anything-goes joy of being young and open, quite literally, to anything. And while the basic guitar/drum setup doesn’t allow for much subtlety, Hopkins and Bruce manage to wring impressively dynamic tunes out of the most basic power riffing. ""We can do our makeup in the parking lot/ We can get so famous that we both get shot,"" Bruce sings on ""Dairy Queen"" as the song morphs into a loud/quiet/LOUD jam. On ""1994""—a track that, not coincidentally, sounds like it could have been recorded in 1994—Hopkins sings that ""These days it pays to be so strange and I’m like nothing"" before the song cracks open into a series of falsetto’d ""ooohs,"" handclaps, and arena-size guitar shreds. And though it all seems simple and sweet enough at first, Ugly Cherries’ real strength lies in the way it addresses the fears and foibles of the young and queer-identified, both for better and for worse. While the glee expressed on the record feels like a middle finger aimed directly at the hetero establishment, there is an endearing vulnerability at work as well—an understanding that the world is not always your friend. On ""Serving Goffman"" the duo celebrate the merits of being unafraid to make a fool of oneself in the name of making art and finding love, while acknowledging that it comes at a cost. ""I held my breath in a suit and a tie because I didn’t know I could fight back,"" sings Bruce, ""I wanna put the whole world in drag but I’m starting to realize it’s already like that."" Elsewhere he notes that ""I found out people aren’t that mean but it still feels like they're laughing at me/ When they're just saying hello."" The world has certainly changed, but there is still always a price to be paid for simply being yourself.  Their songs aren’t just a prolonged wink and a nod, but rather complicated statements on what it means to be young and queer and confused and somehow othered. ""Why are you so handsome, gaymazing, and nice?"" asks Hopkins of a lover on the record’s closing track. It’s the kind of question that might have been impossible to ask in a non-ironic way back in 1994 and it’s exactly the kind of thing that makes Ugly Cherries such a special listen. The record is not only catchy as all hell, but it’s also sweet and openhearted and not one bit cynical. It’s a queer record to be sure, but mostly it’s just a really fun rock record—and one would hope that at this point in time, those two things shouldn’t be mutually exclusive.","PWR BTTM is a queer-identified garage punk duo of guitarist Ben Hopkins and drummer Liv Bruce.

Southland Mission,Phil Cook,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03bea9e61561daa65bd/1:1/w_160/651997c1.jpg,2015-09-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20964-southland-mission/,Thirty TigersMiddle West,"Phil Cook’s second solo album opens with an expression of the truest contentment. But first, ""Ain’t It Sweet"" spends a full minute stretching out: A steady guitar chug beckons a Wurlitzer’s gap-tooth whistle; low fiddle dips around skittish piano notes, before everything whips to a gentle crest. Only then do Cook, his brother and Megafaun bandmate Brad, and Justin Vernon blast the title, exalting like sunflowers at dawn—or a rural bar band toasting a lock-in. The sweetness is Cook’s comfort in knowing that, ultimately, he and his wife will lie together in the ground. He’s not singing about heaven, but turns the gothic foreboding of death-do-us-part into radiant, secular gospel: ""Well we’re wide awake then we’re dead and gone/ But we find a way just to carry on."" That’s the stuff, right there—not that carrying on is as simple as just saying so; Cook spends much of Southland Mission attempting to find the way, just as the path to this he record was its own calling. ""It had to come out of me,"" he has said. ""I didn’t realize it had to come out of me, but it had to."" A decade ago, Cook moved his family from Wisconsin—where he was a member of Bon Iver’s orbit—to North Carolina, lured by the music of the Delta, Bayou, and Appalachia. He played gorgeous, doleful folk rock in Megafaun, complemented the cohorts of Matthew E. White and Hiss Golden Messenger, acted as bandleader for the Blind Boys of Alabama, and produced for Indigo Girls’ Amy Ray. In 2011 he released Hungry Mother Blues, a low-key solo instrumental record that chased Ry Cooder and John Fahey. Southland Mission is a more full-bodied commitment. Whether simple banjo fare, outlaw stompers, or reeling strut, each one of Cook’s modes is an easy and infectious exertion. And like any good missionary, Cook’s fervor is infectious. Although Southland Mission is studiously steeped in tradition, it wears it lightly. Recorded in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the warmth of the Durham, N.C. community behind the record (the likes of Matt McCaughan, Mountain Man’s Amelia Meath) beams through as its own kind of congregation, though there’s occasionally a homespun gospel duo here, too, in the golden tones of Sophie Blak and Jeanne Jolly. They’re crucial to the record’s two-part centerpiece: chastising Cook for procrastinating on ""Sitting on a Fence Too Long"" before coming to ""Lowly Road"", a bluesy spiritual reckoning, which ends with a call-and-response as the duo welcome him home. Like Hiss Golden Messenger’s Lateness of Dancers, Southland Mission handles doubt with the possibility of redemption, reinforced by the record’s persistent, joyous uplift. Cook navigates the extremes of the squeezed middle class on Southland Mission, staring down what it looks like to fight or flee. ""1922"" is a cover of a Charlie Parr song about the Piedmont musician’s parents’ Depression-era experiences, where ""ain’t it sweet"" becomes ""ain’t that the way it is."" Fed up of giving all his money to the government, a boy leaves his dead end job, gets beat up in a new town, and, dead broke, has no choice but to go back home: ""Times are hard here and I can’t roam/ But I ain’t got nothing more."" Every verse ends with Cook addressing some ""boys,"" like it’s a tale of bar stool bravado, though choice is never treated as an act of heroism on Southland Mission. ""Nothing sacred, nothing saved/ Get your ass on the morning train or get the hell out the way,"" he sings on ""Great Tide"", an empathetic epic that swings between tender moments and brisk, reeling jubilation. Ultimately, choosing to stay and stoke life’s intimacies wins out over fleeing. ""Anybody Else"", a duet with Frazey Ford, sees Cook resisting easy reassurances in favor of a deep and nourishing love. ""Gone"" is a parable about how you might as well give it all you’ve got when you can’t take anything with you. To have is not necessarily to hold, and when possession is transient, belonging is all you have. Southland Mission lights up tradition with rare and overt joy and palpable gratitude. It’s an open invitation from a man who’s found home. Say yes.","Phil Cook, Megafaun member and orbiter of Justin Vernon's universe, turns in a passionate solo album forged out of love for Southern blues and raggedy Blue Ridge folk. He's preaching and, like any good missionary, his fervor is infectious.

The Isley Brothers: The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters,The Isley Brothers,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05b9d034d5c69bf486c/1:1/w_160/c7356446.jpg,2015-09-11 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/,Legacy,"The Isley Brothers first appeared on Billboard in 1959, when ""Shout (Part 1)"" made its way to 47 on the Hot 100. They last cracked the charts in 2006, with ""Just Came Here to Chill"" petering out at 25 on the R&B charts. Few other artists can match that kind of longevity and, fittingly, the band's biggest hits still resonate. ""Shout"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""It's Your Thing"", ""That Lady"", and ""Fight the Power"" all arrived during the glory days of Top 40 in the '60s and '70s, enduring hits still heard on oldies radio, movies, television, and commercials. The Isleys also are a bottomless well for samples in hip-hop. ""Fight the Power"" provided Public Enemy with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, Ice Cube based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for the Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated Beastie Boys' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in Kendrick Lamar's recent ""i"". Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for The RCA Victor & T-Neck Album Masters, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's Live at Yankee Stadium, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's Inside You and 1982's The Real Deal, and the first-ever release anywhere of Wild in Woodstock, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&B hits but never seeing crossovers. In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's Shout!, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: 3 + 3, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later The Heat Is On became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's Go All the Way and racked up platinum albums until 1983's Between the Sheets, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam. Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Sly and the Family Stone, Al Green, or Curtis Mayfield were. They never had an album place on Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. A close listen to The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's The Real Deal as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's Shout! emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s. This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives Shout! a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation In the Beginning. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—In the Beginning crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's This Old Heart of Mine. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. With this 1969 hit, along with the It's Our Thing album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the now of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's The Brothers: Isley, 1970's Get Into Something) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP Givin' It Back, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. Givin' It Back coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—Brother, Brother, Brother bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the 3 + 3 makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk. 3 + 3 is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals & Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's Live It Up, whose title track went to four R&B while a cover of a Todd Rundgren ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's The Heat Is On. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience. The Heat Is On proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's Harvest for the World, 1977's Go for Your Guns, and 1978's Showdown all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After Showdown, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's Winner Takes All, 1980's Go All the Way, 1981's Grand Slam and Inside You, 1982's The Real Deal, 1983's Between the Sheets—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&B case study in his revelatory book Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, The RCA Victor & T-Neck Album Masters does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—3 + 3 and The Heat Is On come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety.","The RCA Victor & T-Neck Album Masters, a brick of an Isley Brothers box set, contains 21 albums from the beloved vocal group, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities. A close listen to the collection underscores how they may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends, and hearing these albums back-to-back underscores that progression.

Black Dollar,Rick Ross,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b08813d197565213a4a6/1:1/w_160/3c4b2e5b.jpg,2015-09-11 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21025-black-dollar/,Def Jam,"Rick Ross's unlikely ascendance from one-note joke to kingpin was dazzling to watch, but all commercial rap empires end, and the sun seems to be setting on the once-untouchable Maybach Music Group. 2014's Mastermind debuted at #1, but the hot air balloon of confidence that powered his best records felt deflated. Leading up to its release, he got more press for his loathsomely tone-deaf justifications of ""U.O.E.N.O""'s rape lyric, which cost him his sponsorship with Reebok, than he was for radio hits. Besides ""Sanctified"", an album cut featuring Big Sean and Kanye West, little of Mastermind has lingered in the public consciousness. As for *Hood Billionaire—*the second album Ross released that year—did you recall that existed? Times are tough for rap supervillains, it seems: even Rick Ross's nemesis 50 Cent is declaring bankruptcy. And Black Dollar, Ross' first new project in a year, feels slightly recalibrated to reflect the new hard times. A ""grounded"" Rick Ross would be unthinkable, but he has scaled back, mostly on the production, which leaves behind the booming, slow-moving productions of Lex Luger and his many imitators. ""Foreclosed on my past life,"" he bellows on the opening track ""Foreclosures"", an early highlight and the most compelling music he's made since his Rich Forever peak. The song offers the welcome surprise of hearing Ross treat money as something that eats away at relationships and breeds distrust, instead of green rectangles he enjoys tossing out of helicopters. There are not-so-veiled references to contract issues with his own artists: ""That paper get funny when publishing's involved/ Mechanicals never matter, 'cause that was your dog."" Rapping about music-industry arcana like ""mechanicals"" and publishing is not a surefire recipe for excitement, but Ross' sonorous voice still breeds drama. His delivery is so convincing that the man who once air-lifted his mansion from Miami to Boca Raton sounds halfway-believable as a financial advisor: ""I never met an artist who fully recouped/ These the deals the deal dealers wanna deal to you!"" he raps through gritted teeth. That voice of his, and the way he makes it leap and tremble with joy, can momentarily make you believe anything. At his best, Rick Ross isn't just a fantasy-fulfillment rapper, or a maximalist hitmaker: He's a performer, in the purest sense of that word. On ""We Gon Make It"", his voice climbs in excitement, and the gusto, the control, and thunderous conviction of his performance recalls the promos cut by the greatest WWF wrestlers. There is a trace of Dusty Rhodes in how he savors pauses, pounces on ripe-sounding words, sometimes at the expense of intelligibility. On ""Turn Ya Back"", he spits every repetition of the word ""back"" like it's a mouthful of poison. ""Money and the Powder"" repurposes the chanted chorus from Scarface's classic ""Money and the Power"", and by the time Ross is done with it, the phrase has melted into simply ""money and the POWWW!"" This energy has always been the electrifying current enlivening even his silliest lyrics—on ""Bill Gates"", he reiterates his dearly held dream of a world with ""Wing Stops on every corner."" It is what allows him to somehow to diss ""Freeway"" Rick Ross—the very real gangster whose identity Ross co-opted—and 50 Cent in the same bar on ""Geechi Liberace"". There are dull, rote spots on Black Dollar—""Money Dance"" retreats into a soft-focus world of bowties, marble floors,  and cocktail-jazz pianos that is about as exciting as eavesdropping on senior executives. And the reduced ambitions also mean that there are no calling-card songs here, no tarmac-sized beats or immediate chanted hooks. It's clear that Ross is regrouping. But the project serves as a reminder: This a good energy to have around, still.","Times are tough for rap supervillains, it seems—even Rick Ross's nemesis 50 Cent is declaring bankruptcy. The surprisingly strong Black Dollar, Ross' first new project in a year, feels slightly recalibrated to reflect the new hard times.

Imagori,Mueller & Roedelius,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06bb1335d7bf169a0f8/1:1/w_160/dc69aaae.jpg,2015-09-10 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21005-imagori/,Grönland,"Music continues to pour out of krautrock figurehead Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who, at 80, shows no sign of pulling back from his work anytime soon. Still, Imagori comes at a difficult time for him, having recently lost his old sparring partner in Cluster and Harmonia, Dieter Moebius, who passed away in July. It’s unlikely Roedelius would let sentiment cloud his vision—much of his recent output is marked by a strict adherence to precision, culminating in works that feel like they were finely shorn down with an X-Acto knife. Imagori continues in that vein, with Roedelius linking up with Gotan Project member Christoph H. Müller. Over 10 tracks, the pair work around weighty, impenetrable electronics, dispensing with any loose ends and producing an overall sound positively suffocating in its density. The genesis of Roedelius and Müller’s collaboration lies in a series of concerts undertaken in Paris in 2012, where the pair improvised on stage together. Video footage of the events show the men bathed in stark white light, sharply dressed and fully focussed on the machines at their disposal, including a grand piano. Imagori is less tender than those performances, with the pair retreating into darkness in the studio. There’s a morbidity that eats away at the corners of these tracks, forming an atmosphere not far from the rolling banks of angst that blanketed Massive Attack’s trip hop classic Mezzanine. Trip hop may seem an odd reference point for Roedelius, especially as it possesses an emotional weight he’s rarely approached in his career. Müller's work in Gotan Project veers far closer to the genre's environs, although this album lands some distance away from his output there. Instead, Imagori finds Roedelius and Müller setting genre ideas in the abstract, linking classical piano embellishments to twists of bass synth reminicent of Mezzanine’s ""Risingson"" (on ""Time Has Come"") and letting ripples of piano form an echo back to Protection’s ""Heat Miser"" (on ""Valse Mecanique""). The album contains an overall sketch-like quality, executed from shards of thought—not necessarily a bad thing, but not conducive to producing a work as enveloping as Harmonia’s ""Watussi"" or Cluster’s ""Caramel"". There’s a cameo from Brian Eno buried deep in Imagori, on a track about the process of recording music that's appropriately titled ""About Tape"". It’s a standout, largely because it forgoes the thickness that encases much of the album, instead working through glassier layers of electronics, plus a half-spoken, half-sung vocal from Eno that adds a welcome measure of eccentricity to an otherwise rather dry record. Its nadir comes on ""The Question"", where a Kraftwerk-like robo-voice peers from its slowly shifting groove—an idea that feels a little too rote for someone of Roedelius’ stature. Imagori is perfectly serviceable as a piece of background noise, but it doesn’t work in the multifaceted way that Cluster and Harmonia albums can, where they either prick the attention or provide a soundtrack to other things going on. This just drifts along in its immaculately chiseled way.","The krautrock master Hans-Joachim Roedelius continues—at 80!—to experiment across genres, here dipping into trip hop with Gotan Project's Christoph H. Müller. Though it's often as ominously dark as Massive Attack's best work, Imagori is marked by a strict adherence to precision, culminating in works that feel as though they were finely shorn down with an X-Acto knife.

Ad Infinitum,Telekinesis,by: Pat Healy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af93ea9e61561daa6496/1:1/w_160/1e369867.jpg,2015-09-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20837-ad-infinitum/,Merge,"Michael Benjamin Lerner spent two years learning about vintage synthesizers and forgetting about guitars and drums, but the resulting Ad Infinitum sounds surprisingly like classic Telekinesis. Lerner's flirtation with synths and machinery began on his 2013 album Dormarion, hinting that that he might someday trade indie pop for synthpop. As far back as his 2009 debut, he pled for the attending physicians of ""Calling All Doctors"" to ""replace my heart with a machine."" With Ad Infinitum, the operation is complete. Detailing his transformation in a piece for Medium, he says he spent much of the past two years amassing and learning how to use a collection of vintage synths, as well as hook them up with newer technology to make new music. ""This proved to be incredibly time-consuming and, at times, a ridiculously difficult task,"" he writes. All of that ridiculous difficulty was time well spent: he has made some beautifully textured music with moods that recall the original '80s heyday of synthpop. ""Edgewood"" sounds like an outtake from Speak & Spell and the instrumental ""Ad Infinitum, Pt. 1"" recalls the grandeur and evocative melodrama of the first side of Disintegration. Lerner also produced the album—a first for him—with some assistance from Eric Elbogen of Say Hi. But the problem with taking on so many new responsibilities is that something's got to give. In this case, it's the lyrics. They're often vague and seem like they were the final pesky pieces that he fit into the process. He utters the word ""forget"" in more than half of the songs with lyrics, and ""future"" on three separate occasions. Though Lerner has learned well how to make these sounds, he doesn't elevate the form enough. ""Sleep In"", with its light hip-hop beat and elfin ba-ba-ba-ba-ing is Ad Infinitum's most innovative track. Lerner gets in his own way on this song though, when he employs an actual Speak & Spell machine. Whether it's a nod to the aforementioned Depeche Mode debut or not, it feels forced. (Though it doesn't induce as much of an eye roll as Limp Bizkit's Speak & Spell experimentation, it's not quite as cool as what Robyn and Röyksopp do with the machine.) Despite all of this, the songs still sound very much like Telekinesis. Lerner's songwriting is direct and even with all of this gadgetry he has a knack for a simple, effective melody. The harmony on ""Farmers Road"" is locked in tightly, and ""Ad Infinitum, Pt. 2"" feels like it's threatening to break into ""Shining Star"" in the chorus. The tunes are sturdy, and depending on how ambitious Lerner is with this tour, he could easily put any of these songs into his comfortable power trio arrangement. He could even do them on an acoustic guitar, as he is wont to do. Lerner has reportedly said that he started collecting vintage synthesizers because he felt like he had already gotten all of the songs out of the guitar that he could. The songs he summons from the synths offer proof that there were more songs left in him, but he's still digging in the same mine. Ad Infinitum might be the sound of an artist challenging himself, but it's not the sound of an artist challenging his listeners.","Michael Benjamin Lerner spent two years learning about vintage synthesizers and forgetting about guitars and drums.

La Vie Est Belle / Life Is Beautiful,Petite Noir,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b075c0084474cd0c1c57/1:1/w_160/306b06ea.jpg,2015-09-10 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21012-petite-noir-la-vie-est-belle-life-is-beautiful/,Domino,"South African singer-songwriter Yannick Ilunga, aka Petite Noir, appeared on the Solange Knowles-curated Saint Heron compilation, but even with the alt-R&B scene growing broader as it grows larger, he still doesn’t quite fit in. There are elements of dance music, rap, and rock scattered throughout his debut album,  La Vie Est Belle / Life Is Beautiful, but none of those labels quite describe his sound. And while Ilunga frequently incorporates elements of his half-Congolese, half-Angolan ancestry, his music shouldn’t be shoved off into that condescending, colonialist hangover, ""world music."" ""Psychedelically-tinged baroque contemporary African pop with heavy goth undertones"" is a mouthful, so ""noirwave,"" a descriptor coined by Ilunga himself, works as well as anything. Ilunga introduces us to his sound with a literal fanfare. Following an impressionistic, semi-abstract intro that sets up Ilunga’s predilections for complex rhythms and sensual modulated textures, La Vie Est Belle explodes with the chorus to his first single, ""Best"", which tops an achingly cathartic post-punk hook with an off-kilter brass arrangement that comes in from out of nowhere to flip the song’s buttoned-up synthpop mood on its head. The horns are jarring, bracing, and just dissonant enough to add a manic edge to the song. They sound like maybe they were inspired by Ennio Morricone, or maybe by Neutral Milk Hotel, or maybe by any number of brass bands you can find playing on streets from New Orleans to Kinshasa. For listeners of a certain persuasion, trying to trace La Vie Est Belle’s sounds back to their influences can be a distractingly entertaining way to appreciate the record, especially when the trail gets as intriguingly ambiguous as that horn part. (Such as Ilunga’s supple, swooningly expressive baritone, which can sound a little like Dave Gahan and a little like David Bowie’s more lucid moments of the '80s.) It’s a tough game to keep up, though. All those different pieces come at you at a rapid pace, and it’s hard to keep an eye on the individual threads when Ilunga keeps pulling your attention back out to the entire tapestry. In a pop music landscape where eclecticism has become the status quo, Ilunga’s not only pulling from a broader range of sounds than all but a few other players in the game, he’s able to synthesize them into a seamless sonic entity that stands entirely away from the pack. La Vie Est Belle is a gorgeous, complex trip, not just aesthetically but emotionally. By turns, it’s abysmally abject, bravely hopeful, unguarded, canny, sexy, and profound—the kind of richly, messily variegated album that only comes around a few times a year. Yannick Ilunga feels like pop music's future—borderless but deeply rooted, challenging but pleasurable— and La Vie is strong enough to have earned Ilunga the right to call his revolution whatever he wants.","South African singer-songwriter Yannick Ilunga, aka Petite Noir, appeared on the Solange Knowles-curated Saint Heron compilation, but even with the alt-R&B scene growing broader as it grows larger, his music is hard to classify.

Repentless,Slayer,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b066ea9e61561daa65fe/1:1/w_160/b6acd326.jpg,2015-09-10 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21001-repentless/,Nuclear Blast,"Repentless, the 12th album from the thrash metal institution Slayer, comes at the most fraught time in the band's career. Founding guitarist and songwriter Jeff Hanneman's passing in 2013 from cirrhosis of the liver looms large; it's impossible to overstate the impact he had on the group. His hardcore influences, and the way these influences warped the group's early NWOBHM style, formed the more extreme wing of thrash that would later inform death and black metal. Hanneman's death is Slayer's greatest concern, but it's far from the only one. Founding drummer Dave Lombardo quit in 2013 allegedly over money concerns, and Paul Bostaph, who played on Slayer's '90s records, returned to replace him. Bostaph is no slouch, but Lombardo is a once-in-a-lifetime talent, whose ferocity set the standard for metal drumming as a whole. The two remaining members, bassist/vocalist Tom Araya and guitarist Kerry King, also seem to be somewhat at odds with the future of the band. King's never short of bluster and says Slayer will soldier on; Araya is a little more apprehensive. How much either's letting on is hard to determine, but there's definitely a rift. There's also a clear waning in popularity. Slayer headlined this year's Mayhem Fest, which was plagued by attendance problems. It was depressing to see a legendary band barely filling amphitheaters and having to downgrade the venue in San Antonio, one of the most solidly metal cities in the States. King was also open with his disdain for the fest's lineup, and his online spats with tour organizer Kevin Lyman kept the metal news site Blabbermouth going this summer. And Repentless is not Slayer's first album to be released on September 11—God Hates Us All came out the day of the attacks. In the case of God, it was an unfortunate but morbidly appropriate coincidence; with Repentless, it seems calculated to appeal to the basest shock values of metalheads. So, yes, it's easy to be cynical about a new Slayer record. Despite all of this, Repentless is solid—far from a classic, but the best possible outcome. King and Araya may be drawing from the same well as they always have, but no one knows how to make a Slayer song like they do. Three decades on from Hell Awaits, ""Delusions of Saviour"" shows they still know how to create a lurching intro, minus Satan yelling ""WELCOME BACK!"" It leans heavy on the wah, but King doesn't overdose on it like Kirk Hammett would. The title track and ""Take Control"" display steadfast worship to their own speed; the product is quality, and Repentless does benefit from focusing on that speed Hanneman fostered. But ""When the Stillness Comes"" recalls ""Spill the Blood"" from South of Heaven and ""Dead Skin Mask"" from Seasons in the Abyss, two of Slayer's slower classics. Araya works within his vocal limitations to complement King's rhythms to honor Slayer's slower side without straining or parodying himself. Sticking close to the Slayer playbook was probably the most sensical move—King and Araya have every chance to overindulge or lose the plot but don't. Most songs on Repentless will remind you of a specific track from Slayer's past, and there's enough diversity within their own style. Losing two key members will irreversibly change dynamics, and Repentless isn't immune. Exodus' Gary Holt, Slayer's live guitarist since 2011, contributes solos, but King played almost all of the guitar here. There isn't the chaotic back-and-forth that Hanneman and King wrestled with in their prime. In fact, the solos are oddly conservative by Slayer standards. They fit, but Hanneman's loose touch is noticeably missing. King is essentially playing off himself—he can't be the more metallic foil to Hanneman's punk ear. Granted, he does wrangle a convincing homage to Hanneman's punkiness in ""Atrocity Vendor"". It's oddly a more fitting tribute than ""Piano Wire"", which Hanneman had a hand in writing. ""You Against You"" is another punky track that could have been slipped in Undisputed Attitude, and that it comes right after ""Wire"" and ""Atrocity"" suggests that Slayer made a little Hanneman suite in his honor. Bostaph is a dependable presence, which is both a compliment and a slight. ""Vices"" and ""Take Control"" could have benefitted a little bit from Lombardo's intensity on the double bass. Still, he came into probably the toughest assignment of his career and knocked it out. Bostaph's return also brought back some of the more groove metal tendencies that Slayer adopted in the '90s, most evident in ""Implode"". ""Implode"" worked as a one-off single before it was known it was goning to be on the album, but it doesn't mesh with Repentless as a whole. It even brings down the second half of the record, which doesn't have a ""Stillness"" to compensate. For a band that made a genre-defining album that doesn't break 30 minutes (Reign in Blood), Slayer have lost a bit of their editing touch. Will they continue after this record? If they do, and they're likely to milk at the very least a couple tours, Repentless doesn't spell their end. If they hang it up, at least they didn't end their career on an embarrassing note. Slayer, even with their recent turmoil, have had good fortune compared to their other peers in the Big Four. Their decline is more gradual, the kind that merely comes with age; they never fell off like Metallica and Megadeth did. They've managed to produce one good record without two irreplaceable members; even so, Repentless doesn't quite answer if they've still got it for the long haul.","Repentless, the 12th album from the thrash metal institution Slayer, comes at the most fraught time in the band's career. But despite the death of founding guitarist Jeff Hanneman and the absence of founding drummer Dave Lombardo, it offers the best possible outcome.

HITNRUN Phase One,Prince,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b089ea9e61561daa663c/1:1/w_160/977e7a45.jpg,2015-09-10 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21026-hitnrun-phase-one/,NPG,"Prince's hype-man instincts defy categorization every bit as much as his vocal and instrumental talents beggar description. Though he's fallen off since the 1980s—who, in his shoes, wouldn't?—it's this artist's strange and frequent urge to over-promise that helps keep everyone harping on Sign 'O' the Times as his apogee. Yet here we are again. An album title like HITNRUN Phase One promises a fair amount, not least the possibility of a concept worth serializing. And that's before the album is announced by its creators as being ""experimental"" in construction. Though after stripping away the promotional language from this streaming-only platter, exclusive to Jay Z's Tidal service (for now), one finds something far less earth-shaking: a casual, slightly-weirder-than-usual release with one very good R&B song (that's reportedly been kicking around in his vault for a while), stranded in the album's penultimate slot. To get to that very good song—at least in the manner that Prince and his young co-composer, producer, and mixer Joshua Welton intend—you'll plug through a half-hour sequence that contains a throwaway intro, a trio of putative party-starters cluttered with the confetti of modern-dancefloor production-debris, two reworked (as opposed to improved) songs from 2014's superior Art Official Age, and a tweaked version of the ""Fallinlove2nite"" standalone single that failed to make that prior album. (Ditching Zooey Deschanel's backing vocals doesn't much elevate that breezy tune's mild charm.) Among the remains, ""Hardrocklover"" would seem to be an opportunity for one of pop's most reliably sensuous guitarists to make up ground. But the song seems strangely subdued and bored with itself. While the lyrics (""Turn my guitar up so I can make this woman scream"") suggest that the inevitable appearance of guitar-heroism will be climactic, Prince's unfurling of his distorto-wail cape feels rote. The loopy-but-hard-hitting funk of ""X's Face"" is initially promising, though it too is thin on development. Elsewhere, the (mostly) instrumental ""Mr. Nelson"" riffs with a modicum of inspiration on remnants from Art Official Age standout ""Clouds"". On a first listen, you might suspect that the album's opening sequence of not-disastrous (but not-terribly-memorable) EDM-influenced jams is going to be the focus of HITNRUN Phase One. Though this, too, is part of a formula: compare Prince's almost-rap flow on ""Shut This Down"" to that of 1992's ""My Name Is Prince"", and it's easy to see that the artist has a template for approaching ascendant pop trends. There are stray, tasty touches in this opening salvo—a brief electric-bass clinic in ""Shut This Down"", the integration of saxophone, rhythm guitar, and digitally programmed curlicues in the last minute of ""Like a Mack""—but experimental this ain't. Not for the artist who wrote and recorded ""Crystal Ball"", anyway. (By point of comparison: Prince has also made newly available some truly chancy and obscure work from the late 1990s—like the extended paranoid-freakout ""The War"" and the mostly-acoustic album The Truth—on Tidal.) Disappointments and missed opportunities aside, it's still great to have an official, Prince-sung version of ""1000 X's & O's"" (an old composition once intended for Rosie Gaines). When Prince sings in an environment unmolested by contemporary cliche, he gives us more than at any other point on HITNRUN Phase One—including that iconic, multi-tracked one-man choir, in addition to lyrics that, while they might not be much on the page, snap with a seductive pull when placed in his mouth (""Every drop of sweat on your brow/ Is well-earned/ So you best believe""). Even if, this time around, you can forget the familiar discographical parlor game of comparing each new Prince record to earlier triumphs—this one isn't his best album in the last twelve months, let alone years—songs and performances like that one show why it remains unwise to count him out.","Prince's new effort, exclusive to Jay Z's Tidal service (for now), is billed as being an ""experimental"" effort.

Into the Air,Cold Beat,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04813d197565213a435/1:1/w_160/2e59d134.jpg,2015-09-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20974-into-the-air/,Crime on the Moon,"Google’s new logo apparently requires just 305 bytes of data to load compared to 14,000 for the old one—and you won’t find a person who gives less of a fuck about that than Hannah Lew. Last year, her label Crime on the Moon released San Francisco Is Doomed, a compilation of local acts—including Thee Oh Sees, Mikal Cronin, and Erase Errata—railing against the Google-led tech boom that’s pushed rents into the stratosphere and made America’s historic counter-cultural capital increasingly unaffordable for starving artists. Meanwhile, Lew used Cold Beat’s 2014 debut length, Over Me, to address the situation in more oblique terms, mining the feelings of dislocation and depression that result when your city no longer feels like home, and everything that once made it special has given way to consumerism and conformity. A glance at the imposing, sterile glass skyscraper on the cover of Cold Beat’s sophomore release, Into the Air, would indicate Lew is still waging war on search-engine ostracization. But, at the same time, the parting clouds above it suggest she’s starting to appreciate the silver linings of her situation. Like Over Me, Into the Air thrives on the oppositional tension between frigidity and motion inherent to the Cold Beat name, through a yin-yang balance of winsome '60s girl-group melodies and icy '80s post-punk. But the synth and drum-machine experiments sprinkled among Over Me’s guitar-battered rave-ups have been given much more room to flourish here. It’s to the point where Cold Beat effectively resemble two discrete bands: an endearingly scrappy garage-rock act and a mechanistic, melancholic electro-pop outfit. However, Into the Air’s savvy sequencing plots a gradual journey between these two poles, lending this seemingly compact 10-song, 31-minute album a more epic sense of scale. Into the Air is frontloaded with the most exuberant pop songs Lew has written to date—in particular, the gleaming jangle-punk jewel ""Broken Lines"", which barrels forth like a joyous, C86-ed take on Blondie’s ""Dreaming"". But by letting in more sun, Cold Beat also produce deeper shadows—after whipping through two breezy verses on ""Bruno"", the song’s propulsive bassline leads us into an exhilarating, stomach-turning descent that makes you feel like you’re rolling down Powell Street on a cable car with broken brake lines. Tellingly, the flow of Into the Air mirrors the very process of gentrification that’s weighed so heavily on Lew’s mind, transforming the opening tracks’ raw and restless energy into a more orderly and austere second act. ""Cracks"" is the album’s key transitional track, pitting Lew’s beautifully sighed chorus and circular-saw guitar noise against synth oscillations and a motorik rhythm track to usher us into the album’s electro-oriented back half. But as her sonic environs turn more chilly, Lew cranks up the heat: she delivers Into the Air’s most captivating performance on the Chromatics-tinted nocturnalia of ""Spirals"", while on ""Ashes""—which evokes a classic David Bowie song in both name and ping-ponged synth squiggle—she renders post-apocalyptic scenes of fiery, floating detritus with an elated, operatic coo, as if gazing wondrously into a snow globe filled with black flakes. The San Francisco she once knew may indeed be doomed, but Lew will be ready to rebuild it from the rubble when the bubble inevitably bursts.","Cold Beat is a San Francisco quartet fronted by Grass Widow bassist Hannah Lew.

Till It’s All Forgotten,Farao,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03313d197565213a412/1:1/w_160/8599f87d.jpg,2015-09-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20957-till-its-all-forgotten/,Arts & Crafts,"Farao, aka Norwegian multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter Kari Jahnsen, could have taken a more predictable road on her debut album. She has the breathy, clear, slightly husky soprano voice that's come to characterize ""indie"" (the genre, not the ethos). She has the right image. She has the instrumental chops. She could have created songs that are more easily consumable than those on Till It's All Forgotten, songs that fit into TV and film montage or title sequences. She could have taken the easy road. We should all be thankful she didn't. Like her countrywoman Jenny Hval, Jahnsen's work defies categorization and commodification at every turn. It's not in the least bit easy to create music that sounds truly like you and nobody else, but Jahnsen manages to do so. The instrumentation on Till It's All Forgotten is rich—electronics, horns, synth strings, piano, a standard guitar-based rock band, vocal manipulation—and though all that layering and texture could feel heavy and cluttered, it rarely does. Jahnsen has an ear for structure, always pulling when the song could have pushed, turning right when it could have turned left, never relying on ABABC to get her through. Opener and title track ""TIAF"" is a perfect example—it's a lush, beautiful song with stacked vocals and a cascading synth that would drift into quirky Starbucks background fare if not for the stuttering, off-time percussion that jars the song out of complacency. The lyrical themes on Till It's All Forgotten always circle back to the gaps in human communication and the desire that grows in those damp, mossy spaces left open between us because we're too scared of our own shadows to look into them. It's an album about slippage, discomfort, unease. ""Bodies"", which was released as a single with an unsettling and intimate video depicting the solitary and intense relationship between two teenage girls as they explore a landscape abandoned by adults, is a dense song even without the visuals, with its military-percussive lope and clot of horn punctuation. Jahnsen has said the song is about ""surrendering to bad decisions and consciously going down the wrong path"", something all of us can relate to but few of us would brag about. It's this commitment to quotidian territory  that makes Till It's All Forgotten so engaging. The delicate ""Hunter"" could read as a love song but is instead about the process of dehumanizing another. The haunting ""Feel"" could be simply about sexuality but is instead about the desire for deep connection with someone else. The sprawling ""Warriors"" refuses to lapse into epic inspirational platitude; it is about the exhaustion of being perpetually ready to fight. Jahnsen takes well-covered general themes and distills something small and strange out of each; her instrumentation is huge and complicated while her lyrics remain resolutely human-scale. Jahnsen played and arranged many of the instruments on the album herself, and the album is like an expansive and bizarre terrarium in which Jahnsen has carefully called for the placement of each element. She places tinny synth microtones next to big wooden piano notes on ""Fragments"", a song about human complications, and she loops her vocals around these basic tones, she demonstrates how naturally complications arise from a simple setup. Arrangements this teeming could be claustrophobic, but Jahnsen exerts firm control over her rich and highly detailed world. It's her mastery and attention that is ultimately what, I suspect, makes her work so consistently complex and worthwhile.","Farao is the Norwegian multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter Kari Jahnsen.

I’m a Lazy Son...But I’m the Only Son EP,Lower,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b06ac0084474cd0c1c48/1:1/w_160/bd9bb513.jpg,2015-09-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21004-im-a-lazy-sonbut-im-the-only-son-ep/,MatadorEscho,"If singer Adrian Toubro had something important to say on Lower's debut EP Walk on Heads, the rest of the band sure did their best to stop anybody from hearing it. The louder he shouted, the harder the band roared back, drowning his words under sheets of blistering squall. Like their Danish neighbors Iceage, however, Lower's overheated punk has cooled down considerably as their scope has expanded. By last year's full-length Seek Warmer Climes, which favored post-punk's slow crawl over hardcore's speed-trial tempos, the singer was no longer locked in bloody competition against the rest of the band. Lower's latest EP I'm a Lazy Son…But I'm the Only Son cements their new pecking order: Now Toubro's voice leads and everything else follows. That voice has earned its place at the front of the mix. It's the band's strongest instrument, and it's never been more expressive than it is on these five songs. On opener ""At the Endless Party"", he croons ""Come on sweetheart, take me as I am/ Drag me to your chamber and toss me around,"" pulling at the word ""sweetheart"" until it becomes an accusation. It's the delivery of a desperate man trying to preserve his dignity in the face of dire need. ""We'll never connect; there's no way around it,"" he mourns. He's not the first guy to sing about using sex to numb the pain, but he may be the first to make the pain sound like the better alternative. ""Endless Party"" introduces the latest evolution in the band's sound, which undergoes a logical shift from post-punk to goth—specifically the booming goth rock of the '80s, when acts like Sisters of Mercy and the Cure recorded in what sounded like cobwebbed dungeons that had been improbably outfitted with high-end studios. The stark, churning bassline of ""Keep Me in Mind"" lurches as if it's weighed down by frost. Lower's commitment to goth's pervasive dreariness is impressive, though as Only Son's unhurried closer ""Nasty Business"" crawls past the six-minute mark it's hard not to pine a little for the speed and brevity of their punk output. The band makes an effort to fill in the track's creaky expanses, coloring it with sober pianos and echoes of muted horns, but really, this is Toubro's show, and it's his poetry of sorrow that drives the EP. ""I deserve something more,"" he broods, ""So much given, nothing given in return."" On song after song, Toubro defends his own honor, demanding to be heard. And he is.","Like their Danish neighbors Iceage, Lower's overheated punk has cooled down considerably as their scope has expanded.

The Original Faces,Helen,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03a13d197565213a41b/1:1/w_160/935bc87e.jpg,2015-09-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20962-the-original-faces/,Kranky,"Liz Harris' music thrives on liminality. Her canny blending of tape loops, field music, and psychedelia strands us somewhere both familiar and strange: Dusty old pianos, chirping frogs, and a defiantly beeping microwave counted as some of the most persistent instrumentation on her last album Ruins. Whether she's releasing new material as Grouper or collaborating with bluesmen and noise savants (Roy Montgomery, Xiu Xiu, and Tiny Vipers), Harris builds up immersive, perplexing landscapes, tearing it all down just as we're starting to figure out where, exactly, we are. For her latest creative venture Helen, Harris has teamed up with Eternal Tapestry drummer Jed Bindeman, bassist/guitarist Scott Simons__,__ and a mysterious, possibly mythic third collaborator (more on her later). Despite its purported origins as a thrash band, Helen's sun-baked ambient lands somewhere between My Bloody Valentine's distorted bliss and Eternal Tapestry's psyched-out experiments. Upon cursory listens, the band's debut album, The Original Faces, appears to be an accessible, if noisy, entry into the shoegaze-pop canon, not unlike A Sunny Day in Glasgow's excellent Sea When Absent. In all actuality, it's a little bit insane. Harris' distorted, manipulated vocals divulge their secrets slowly, after the melodic sweetness wears off.  She plays with our senses and expectations: Listeners must wade through a creaky, corrupted tape sample to reach the triumphant roar of opening track ""Ryder""; when the drums finally kick in on the dreamlike ""Pass Me By"", it's with exaggerated, almost comic force, as though she's acknowledging our impatience. Her more nocturnal, funereal side informs the The Original Faces' best moments, particularly the achingly beautiful ""Violet"", which sounds like a memorial service being held 20 yards away from a Slowdive rehearsal. The other noteworthy member of the band is the album's mysterious, unidentified backup vocalist, whose vocals sound uncannily similar to Harris but are credited separately to ""Helen"". Is she Grouper's alter ego? An unnamed surprise guest? The mythical Greek heroine, a symbol for unattainable, destructive perfection? These are solid guesses, but I'm partial to imagining her as a ghost, who materializes every so often to bestow the music with an otherworldly presence. ""Helen""'s presence is tenuous; on cuts like ""Right Outcome"" and ""City Breathing"" her harmonies pierce the void to carry Harris' leads upward, while on ""Covered in Shade"" and ""Allison"", they're tucked away into the background. Considering the mythical connotations of Helen's namesake, her presence makes sense here as an extension of the album's interest in the divide between delicate beauty and all-consuming din. Whatever else she does, ""Helen"" helps diversify the sound of The Original Faces and injects a youthful spirit into the solemn proceedings. Along with other traces of pop, like the jangly interludes ""Motorcycle"" and ""City Breathing"", she provides a respite from the surrounding gloom. These ninety-second-ish ditties are too gaunt and echo-ridden to stand alone as memorable singles, but within the tempestuous framework of the album, their vulnerability hits like a late-summer thunderstorm.","For her latest creative venture Helen, Liz Harris of Grouper has teamed up with Eternal Tapestry drummer Jed Bindeman, bassist/guitarist Scott Simons__,__ and a mysterious, possibly mythic third collaborator simply named ""Helen.""

No No No,Beirut,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0695e6ef95969321f77/1:1/w_160/74f8b784.jpg,2015-09-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21003-no-no-no/,4AD,"In recent interviews, Beirut singer and songwriter Zach Condon has shed some light on the backstory behind the odd, skeletal sound of his band's new album. Condon had been embroiled in personal and creative despair for a few years, some of it the result of working on a new maximalist opus in the vein of his previous work. He abandoned this material to return to low-stakes jamming in a piano trio format; ultimately, No No No's songs developed out of this approach, and the album was recorded in just a couple of weeks. The resulting nine-song, 29-minute barely-LP, appropriately, sounds like a collection of exposed scaffoldings—a record of a rehabilitative process, more a story of survival rather than a shot at reinvention. It would be easy to assume that reinvention was foremost on Condon's mind. After all, his ethnomusicological interests and motley folk orchestras have next to nothing to do with today's musical landscape. Nine years ago, however, these elements seemed to fit in perfectly, distinguishing Condon from the expanding crooner rank-and-file (Jens Lekman, Andrew Bird, Patrick Wolf, Rufus Wainwright) and aligning him with a broader drift toward prewar—or, to use a once-popular keyword, ""sepia tone""—nostalgia (see also: the shanties and strophic ballads of the Decemberists, the carny/gypsy fusions of Man Man and Gogol Bordello). But it was doubtless Condon's sense of how to make his compositions sound ornate and simple at the same time—through triumphant, sometimes wordless choruses—that truly gained him his fanbase. His 2006 and 2007 releases were full of mild-mannered anthems that stood on their own—mix-CD-ready cuts like ""Postcards from Italy"", ""Elephant Gun"", and ""Nantes"". Unlike this formative work, there's a sense of absence in the music of No No No; sometimes Condon's commitment to simplicity leads to undeveloped ideas. Condon has honed his innate skill as an arranger of chamber horn and string ensembles over the years: The first half of his 2009 double EP, March of the Zapotec, scored largely for 19-piece Mexican brass band, took his skill to its furthest level of complexity, while the follow up, The Rip Tide, found him making a more serious bid for pop/rock crossover success. For Condon to put his big-bandleader chops to the side—so crucial to all of his previous work—on his first album in four years seems like a tacit acknowledgment that the style of his earlier music is no longer in vogue, as well as a need to find a new, less obsessive process. When Condon does employ horns on the new album, they are effective precisely because they are so sparing: The  writing has a punchier, more functional quality that is worlds away from his former brass chorale leviathans. There are no vestiges of the approach that sometimes made it feel as if Condon had built his entire career in the shadow of Neutral Milk Hotel's ""The Fool"". These are horn licks in the tradition of '60s and '70s R&B, and all of the later pop music that bent it out of shape. But though this is all new for Beirut, the charm of the well-chiseled, simplistic grooves is modest, and Condon's strong melodic voice is not always there to create a through line. It floats on top of everything like a decorative descant, which can sometimes be taken or left. The two-minute ""At Once"" pairs an irresolute, maddeningly cyclical four-chord piano progression with a melody that is mostly just one note, and vocals are eschewed entirely on ""As Needed"" (which sounds like we are hearing only the backing track for a ""Surfs Up""-like Smile outtake). It's sometimes easy to wonder what, exactly, Condon was going for when committing so fiercely to such lightly sketched ideas. The answer would seem to be mood, or simply his own pleasure; Condon's own comments articulated how fun the process of making the album was. The greatest joy, however, seems to have occurred when these ideas were germinating, not being formalized and committed to wax. On midtempo flotsam like ""Pacheco"", or even the slightly awkward title track, the passion seems to have already been wrung out of the song. The best tracks are the most uptempo and groove-locked: moments where Condon's initial excitement seems to have seeped into his melodies. The clearest examples are ""Gibraltar"" and ""Perth"", with their syncopated guitar rhythms. No No No may sound ineffectual after a cursory listen, but it reveals some subtle pleasures if you keep it in rotation. Even potentially soporific moments like closer ""So Allowed"", with its borderline West Side Story-quoting chorus, are ultimately pleasant, and even poignant. But it lacks the melodic heft out of which Beirut briefly built an empire, and doesn't demonstrate Condon searching for something else to fill that void. While it definitely unifies itself around and gains some affective power from sounding unfinished, it still sounds it.","Beirut's new album was recorded in a piano trio format in just a couple of weeks after Zach Condon scrapped the material he'd been working on for a few years.

Versed in the foreboding thump of Atlanta trap but very much New York in spirit and form, Chinx at his best (the mischievously weird ""I'm a Coke Boy"", from Cocaine Riot 2), suggested that Coke Boys could be more than just French Montana's goon squad. Then one May morning the unthinkable happened: Chinx was killed as shots were fired at his car outside of a venue he’d just performed. He was only 31, married with three children and a fourth on the way. As a method of coping with the loss, his manager and close collaborators gathered to honor their friend the only way they knew how: workshopping the sessions he’d left behind. As a result, Welcome to JFK is a different kind of hip-hop debut. Instead of pointing the rapper toward the places he could go, JFK hint at places he might’ve gotten. From the dejected Auto-Tuned opener ""Experimental"", in which Chinx sings ""I swear I want this to last us a lifetime"", to the foreboding closer ""Die Young"", the specter of mortality haunts the proceedings. Despite all of this, it's a testament to Chinx's still-growing pop smarts that Welcome to JFK is sometimes a lot of fun. ""Experimental""’s mournful opener is quickly offset by a stream of upbeat shots at radio play. ""Thug Love"" and ""The Other Side"" spring for help from outside singers, the former calling Jeremih for the chorus and the latter tapping Ty Dolla $ign in full goon regalia. The real gem of the batch is ""Yay"", a bratty bit of spiteful money counting that is concise and catchy without sacrificing Chinx’s dopeboy veneer. For the stretch of songs from the wistful pep talk ""How to Get Rich"" through the closing Coke Boys posse cut ""Die Young"", Welcome to JFK tenses up and eases off the good times. Chinx walks his audience behind the triumph of ""Go Get It"" and ""Yay"" to illuminate the hard decisions and paranoia that accompant success on the streets. ""Pray"" pairs him up with Chicago Coke Boys affiliate Lil Durk as each ponders mortality and their legacy. In the latter, Chinx raps chillingly about a nightmare in which he gets shot in the head, only to dive into a chorus essentially eulogizing himself. Welcome to JFK doesn’t allow much comfort. The album is by turns a succession of punchlines so snarky it’s upsetting Chinx won’t be around to write more of them and an unnerving trip into a mind coming to terms with the ever-present reality of sudden death.","Over the course of his Hurry Up and Die and Cocaine Riot mixtape series, the Coke Boys-affiliated Queens rapper Chinx pieced together a gruff, promising sound.

Artificial Dance,Savant,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af87b1335d7bf1699f63/1:1/w_160/b7dea902.png,2015-09-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20953-artificial-dance/,Rvng Intl.,"""The intelligence resides in the work, not the individual,"" explains Kerry Leimer in the liner notes to Artificial Dance, a retrospective collection that highlights the unpredictable alchemy of his early 1980s studio project Savant. The Seattle experimentalist is best known for the woozy ambient music he has released as K. Leimer, but Savant’s approach was something like an avant-garde jam band re-imagined as musique concrète. Riffs, grooves, and rhythms were crafted on a wide array of instruments—electric bass, drums, Oberheim DMX, Prophet 5 synthesizer, and objects identified in the credits with names like ""Percussion (Wood, Silver, Plastic),"" ""Guitar (Prepared, China),"" and ""Guitar (Cloud Guitars)""—and then broken apart, looped, layered, run through primitive effects, and reassembled at last by the razor-wielding producer across lengthy spools of reel-to-reel tape. The recombinant approach had something in common with Brian Eno’s work during the period, particularly his David Byrne collaboration My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (Eno, too, was fond of fanciful instruments like “snake guitar”), and the results similarly hovered somewhere between funk, loosely speaking, and more abstracted forms of ambient sound. Debut single ""Stationary Dance"", with its breakbeat structure and a voiceover sampled from an instructional LP, anticipated cut-and-paste artists like M|A|R|R|S and Coldcut by six or seven years, while the watery B-side, ""Sensible Music"", sounds today like a more muscular, lo-fi version of Talk Talk’s later work. Listeners familiar with Leimer’s solo catalog will detect echoes of that music here: the glassy synthesizers of his ambient recordings trace serpentine paths through Savant’s songs, and the rolling, otherworldly drum programming of K. Leimer’s 1983 album Imposed Order bleeds through into the stop-start rhythms of ""The Neo-Realist"" and ""Indifference"". But the bulk of Savant’s catalog sounds like nothing else that had come before. These tracks, where skeletal dub rhythms underpin an array of daubed-on splotches of electric bass and Clavinet and atonal guitar, feel less like ""songs"" than amorphous organisms where a rippling pulse is the only constant. The structure can be hard to follow but in a fascinating way—long and convoluted 10-bar phrases are not uncommon, and it often feels like a rug is being pulled out from under you, even when the bassline plunges deep in the pocket. ""Shadow in Deceit"" begins with a flurry of bells and post-punk bass and gradually transforms, via interlocking marimbas, into a vivid template for Four Tet’s brand of new-age techno. ""Heart of Stillness"", with its unsteady pitter-patter percussion and dripping guitar tones, has an even headier rainforest vibe; it feels like sound just on the cusp of coalescing into music, or perhaps vice versa. Given that the bulk of the album’s tracks were made between 1981 and 1985, it’s harder to judge the final three cuts, all previously unreleased, which date from between 2009 and 2014. ""Facility"" is dark and alluring, and it’s not hard to imagine it appearing on a contemporary label like R&S. But the context differs so radically from the early work that the later songs might as well constitute a different project altogether. But that’s OK—the 11 songs that comprise Savant’s prime output amount to some of the most striking and original American electronic music of that period, so much so that it seems almost inconceivable that it went largely overlooked until now. Had a tastemaker like Detroit’s Electrifying Mojo gotten his hands on Savant’s slim catalog, who knows how things might have turned out. Artificial Dance is enough to make you rethink what you thought you knew about that era—and to make you wonder what else might be out there, just waiting to be rediscovered.","Savant was the early-'80s project of Kerry Leimer, and their recombinant avant-funk approach had something in common with Brian Eno’s work during the period, particularly his David Byrne collaboration My Life in the Bush of Ghosts.

Each new song and each new album expands that universe significantly, implicitly or explicitly adding new chapters to ongoing stories as Finn hangs out off to the side, narrating from the periphery of the scene. It can be forbidding to pick up these narrative strands at this late date, but at his best Finn’s songs swallow you up in that word entirely. His lyrics continually provoke a spark of recognition, as he invites you to connect the dots between a new song and an old one. Listening to ""Sarah, Calling from a Hotel"", from his new solo album, is a bit like eavesdropping on a friend who has landed on rough times. ""Hadn’t seen her since the races at the ending of last summer,"" Finn sings over a sparse coffeehouse strum. ""We watched the horses run up on each other/ She looked pretty."" Is this the unnamed subject of ""Chips Ahoy!"", from the Hold Steady’s 2006 breakthrough Boys and Girls in America, the clairvoyant who ""can tell which horse is gonna finish in first""? If so, the tone of chapter is much darker and more dire than migraines and emotional detachment. Faith in the Future is a character-driven record, even if it doesn’t restore Finn to the heights of his mid-2000s heyday. It’s full of prominent proper names: Sarah and Maggie, Christine and Sandra. St. Peter even shows up, because this is a Craig Finn album. The names are mundane, not exotic. You probably don’t know anyone named Charlemagne, but you’re likely Facebook friends with a Christine. There’s not a single hoodrat on Faith, but there are plenty of people caught between the youthful indiscretions of the past and the adult consequences of the present. That pretty much describes Finn these days. Even during the disastrous Bennigan’s gig in ""Roman Guitars"", he comes across as more grown up, imbuing his narrators/stand-ins with a maturity that pushes them even further into the margins—the fate of all thirty- and fortysomethings. He’s no longer talking to the kids, and he’s not coming up the stairs or coming from the streets. Instead, he has entered what you might call the Peter Wolf phase of his career, when the old band has sputtered out and the frontman tries to re-establish himself as a serious songwriter. And if you don’t know who Peter Wolf is, well, then you’ll realize there is a certain unglamorous anonymity that comes with respectability. The catch, of course, is that the Hold Steady and the J. Geils Band were great groups—exciting and clever and bold and even fun as they wallowed in rock’s less reputable urges. Downplaying riffs in favor of texture, Faith in the Future plays it much safer, which means there’s more emphasis on the words than on Finn’s delivery of them. Finn’s solo debut, 2012’s Clear Heart Full Eyes, attempted to match his songs to amiably twangy arrangements, which in retrospect was an intriguing experiment, but there’s no comparable strategy in place for enlivening these songs. There’s a lot of bland acoustic strumming, as though the austerity of the arrangement were meant to reinforce the slice-of-life songwriting, but anyone who has ever skipped ""Citrus"" or bristled over Live at Fingerprints knows that acoustic isn’t Finn’s best setting. He doesn’t always have to have a rousing bar band behind him, but he does need something that will lend his lyrics more immediacy and higher stakes. The best songs succeed despite the music, not because of it. ""St. Peter Upside Down"" may be the most compelling song of his solo career, a sharp juxtaposition between romantic regret and religious sacrifice that somehow grows more burdened, more beat down with every iteration of its chorus. Finn has, of course, plumbed similar territory in the past, but instead of redundant, it plays like the culmination of his obsession with Catholicism, as though he’s adding an epilogue to his previous spiritual inquiries. As it proceeds, Faith in the Future becomes more and more a benediction for the scene, a goodbye to all that. The perfectly titled ""I Was Doing Fine (Then a Few People Died)"" sounds impossibly world-weary, as Finn gets drunk with an old friend (possibly, hopefully even Sarah herself). ""She said some nights I wonder if anything means anything,"" and the only consolation he can offer is, ""I never said I was Jesus.""","The Hold Steady frontman's second solo album is a character-driven record that's a few shades darker than his last solo outing. It's also driven by acoustic guitar, which puts even more focus on Finn's words.

Brace the Wave,Lou Barlow,by: John Everhart,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01cea9e61561daa6586/1:1/w_160/f0617dee.jpg,2015-09-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20946-brace-the-wave/,Joyful Noise,"Thurston Moore once told me in a magazine interview while discussing the pivotal figures of '90s indie rock that ""Lou Barlow essentially invented lo-fi."" His comment might not be literally true (Guided by Voices, Daniel Johnston, and countless others toyed with a similar level of fidelity), but there was something about the way Barlow made hiss and mistakes synonymous with his personality that made him special. It was part and parcel with the beautiful-loser tag he cultivated throughout his solo work. He wasn't espousing any discernible ideology, except maybe an inclination to find beauty in rough edges, and if to not self-consciously fuck up his work, at very least to accentuate its ugliness at moments. Barlow's work, in other words, has rarely been feel-good, and Brace the Wave, his first new collection of songs since Sebadoh's comeback 2013 LP Defend Yourself, is no exception. This is music for late-night self-reflection, if not quite the self-loathing of the younger Barlow. While the elephant in the room throughout Defend Yourself was the dissolution of Barlow's marriage, Brace the Wave is somehow even more personal, delving into the minutiae of his collapse. On the opener ""Redeemed"", Barlow reveals to a newfound love, ""I need a place to hide/ Somewhere I can bring my thoughts to you/ And be redeemed."" The track builds slowly, hitting its emotional peak as he laments, ""Memories are made of razor blades"", and the gentle acoustic strum turns brittle and forceful. Redemption is a recurring theme throughout Brace the Wave, as Barlow's loves, past and present, collide in dreamlike succession. There is almost a sense that Barlow is watching his life flash before his  eyes: The twitchy ""Nerve"" pines for idyllic times as Barlow mischievously recounts, ""I remember we were hipsters sleeping with our cats/ Young and thin and fucking crazy/ Fine 'til something cracked."" On the stomp and stammer of ""Boundaries"", he disarmingly concedes, ""You made yourself available/ I crawled into your arms."" One of the first songs Barlow ever released, on Sebadoh's Weed Forestin', was ""Ride the Darker Wave"". On the track, rife with wanton aggression, Barlow implores flippantly, ""Hello tomorrow today/ Ride the darker wave."" Contrast this with ""Wave"", the semi-titular track of Brace the Wave, which reads like an ambivalent breakup note, as Barlow enumerates his own defects (""When I'm not home for ages/ I look for ways to fade"") while abjectly entreating ""I leave you alone but don't go"", before accepting the inevitable (""I don't heed the warning signs/ It's our time""). It's a devastating recognition of a relationship long past its expiration date, and like the rest of Brace the Wave, echoes the complexity of ending an adult relationship with dignified resignation. Barlow isn't the yearning aesthete any longer, and he doesn't act like one. But what's most remarkable about this album is, despite the high gravitas of the subject manner, it still manages to capture the yearning and imagination of youth, and never loses touch with the redemptive qualities of interpersonal connectedness. Life and relationships rarely offer easy answers, and Brace the Wave doesn't either.","Brace the Wave, Lou Barlow's first new collection of songs since Sebadoh's comeback 2013 LP Defend Yourself, is music for late-night self-reflection, if not quite self-loathing.

Me,Empress Of,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b04bc0084474cd0c1c07/1:1/w_160/6a1575bf.jpg,2015-09-08 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20976-me/,Terrible,"Lorely Rodriguez's evolution over the past half-decade mirrors the twists and turns of indie rock itself. She first appeared as a member of Brooklyn's Celestial Shore, a quirky art-rock quartet rising in the wake of Dirty Projectors and Vampire Weekend. After debuting her Empress Of alias with a series of color-coded song snippets on YouTube, she released an EP of shimmering synthpop just as kindred spirits like Phantogram, Grimes, and Purity Ring were crossing over. Now, she's stepping up as an avant-R&B auteur with pop star potential—like a Björk unleashing her inner Beyoncé. But each step of the way, Rodriguez has gradually become a more captivating singer, compelling songwriter, and creative producer. And what makes the first proper album from Empress Of so impressive is that it's not just Rodriguez's most outwardly pop-focused work to date, but also her most restlessly experimental and—as suggested by that stark, Horses-style cover shot—lyrically raw. It's that last point that provides the real revelation on Me. True to its title, Me is a vessel for Rodriguez's most personal thoughts; she wrote these songs during an extended sojourn to central Mexico, where she lived alone for five weeks at a friend's house in a remote small town. The intense isolation provided the opportunity to reflect upon her life back in Brooklyn with great clarity, as she laments the financial hardships of trying to make rent in a gentrified city (the steamy slow jam ""Standard"") while acknowledging the luxury of living in a country with potable H20 (the rippling house of ""Water Water""). But for the most part, Me is a requiem for a doomed romance, and the greatest measure of Rodriguez's confidence is just how candid and vulnerable she allows herself to be here. The bulk of Me forms a concept album of sorts documenting the life cycle of a relationship. She takes us from the sloppy hook-up sex of ""Make Up"" (""Nothing comes between us/ But a piece of latex/ When you tear my clothes off/ Like I was a paycheck"") to the obsessive dependency of ""Everything Is You"" (""All I want to be is you""). She chronicles the lapse into domesticity on ""Need Myself"" (""Can we stop watching the TV?/ Can I get up off of my knees?"") to the intoxicated post-breakup haze of ""To Get By"" and the heartache-induced insomnia of ""Icon"" (""Close my eyes/ I see your face/ I just keep myself awake""). Rodriguez's writing is loaded with vivid details (""I can hear you grind your teeth/ When you're laying fast asleep""), but the scenery will feel familiar to anyone who's languished in a partnership after the thrill is gone, and agonized over the decision to break free. If the songs on Me resemble diary entries, the pages have been torn out and shuffled, so that events fall out of order. We are continually shifted between pre- and post-breakup experiences, which mimics the experience of sorting through a failed love. After all, our memories rarely materialize in chronological order—a fleeting fond reminiscence of an ex has the power to momentarily override the longing and pain that fueled it. The narrative goes beyond Rodriguez's candid lyrics into the production itself, which offers dramatic commentary or reinforcement. When she confronts some cat-calling bros on ""Kitty Kat"", the track responds to her simple plea of ""let me walk away"" with a cluster of claustrophobic synth jabs. And the tripped-up groove of ""To Get By"" comes off like a bad trip in the middle of a nightclub, where your stomach turns queasy, knees wobble, and the faces of the dancers around you become slow-motion psychedelic smears. But Rodriguez is equally adept at channeling her inner turmoil into euphoric release, like on the Herculean house romp ""How Do You Do It"" and the pitch-shifting space-disco delirium of ""Threat"". On the latter track, Rodriguez effectively coins Me's don't-look-back mission statement by declaring ""our memories are a threat""—and by the time that chorus is punctuated by the blare of synthesized trumpets, her troubles are already forgotten. Rodriguez may spend much of Me inside her mind, but it’s as much an invitation to get out of our heads.","Empress Of is the alias of Lorely Rodriguez.

Apologues,Masayoshi Fujita,by: Raymond Cummings,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00b13d197565213a3ba/1:1/w_160/b23de099.jpg,2015-09-07 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20931-apologues/,Erased Tapes,"Think of Lionel Hampton’s bright streaks enlivening Charles Mingus’ late 1970s vamps, the sly warmth Teddy Charles brought to Miles Davis’ Blue Moods, the titillating sonic vertebrae various members of Tortoise added to albums like TNT and Millions Now Living Will Never Die. Such is the lot of the vibraphone, that of a supporting instrument regularly submerged by voices, guitars, strings, horns, and drums. The career of Japanese vibraphonist Masayoshi Fujita seems, at times, to represent a rebuke to this notion. While collaborative releases with German experimentalist Jan Jelinek and from his El Fog solo project filtered his lithe performance through a sieve of effects, the two albums Fujita has issued under his own name—2013’s Stories and 2015’s Apologues—promote a soaring classical purity, as though by rejecting electronic interference, he’s learning how to stay out of his own way. By turns jaunty, shrill, and subdued, Stories found cellist Arturo Martínez Steele and Tangerine Dream violinist Hoshiko Yamane accompanying Fujita. The pair return for Apologues, joined by accordion player Motomitsu Maehara, snare drummer Masaya Hijikata, French horn player Tomonobu Odai, clarinetist Yoko Ozawa, and flautist Mio Suzuki. The collaborators’ massed whorls—tender, nuanced—act as painterly, accommodating foils or accents to Fujita’s playing, which invariably conveys a startled, improvisatory sense of wonder. Awe and sorrow wash through opener ""Tears of Unicorn"" in equal, alternating measure, as strings saw-circle a series of melodic constellations so impeccably gorgeous that they ache; blink and you’ll miss the fleeting quote of ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"". As Fujita metes out tight, teasing trills on ""Moonlight"", strings yawn as woodwinds pipe along in harmony. ""Puppet’s Strange Dream Circus Band"" and ""Flag"" introduce perceptible jolts of urgency, with the former favoring a courtly, in-the-round gait and the latter’s sleeting tones and orchestral sweep midwifing a thrilling friction. An outlier, ""Beautiful Shimmer"" swaddles a spare Fujita motif in waves of reverb. A pristine dream magic seems to inform Apologues—the fluid serenity of the music projects a lulling, murmured unreality that suggests that the album is a figment of the listener’s imagination even while it is in play. It’s not whimsy exactly, but an anesthetizing innocence primed for comfort and nostalgia alike—savvier, music-box sweetness summoned into being by a vibraphonist.","The career of Japanese vibraphonist Masayoshi Fujita seems, at times, to represent a rebuke to the notion of vibraphone as a supporting instrument.

When the Rainbow Disappears: An Anthology 1965-68,The Kitchen Cinq,by: Corbin Reiff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05e13d197565213a45c/1:1/w_160/9042ab1f.jpg,2015-09-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20992-when-the-rainbow-disappears-an-anthology-1965-68/,Light in the Attic,"The mid-to-late 1960s were awash in regional bands hoping to become the next Beatles or Rolling Stones. Not all of them were good, but many—the Wailers from the Pacific Northwest, the Music Explosion from Ohio, the Barbarians from Mass., the Chocolate Watchband from Calif.—were doing interesting enough work to merit a larger amount of exposure than they received. Some of these groups ultimately enjoyed a latter-day career re-examination due to compilation releases like the seminal Nuggets, but most, like the Kitchen Cinq, a psychedelic rock group hailing from Amarillo, Texas, have been lost to history. The Kitchen Cinq released just one full album, Everything but…the Kitchen Cinq, in 1967 and a fistful of singles for LFI and its distribution partner Decca before ultimately calling it a day in 1968. Assembled by Light in the Attic, this anthology of their work is like a survey of popular '60s rock and pop sounds. You can hear jangly traces of the Byrds on ""If You Think…"", the exquisite vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys on ""Still in Love With You"", the abrasive fuzzed out tones of the Yardbirds on ""Solitary Man"", the then-fashionable Eastern sounds on ""Dying Daffodil Incident"", and then there’s of course the near-obligatory cover of the Them garage rock anthem ""Gloria"". There’s even a dynamic, pushed-to-the-brink take on the Beatles’ ""Run for Your Life"". Heard without any background or context, it’d be difficult to tell whether the band was on the cutting edge or merely chasing trends, but they certainly had a keen ear for what was happening in the world around them. The real strength of the Kitchen Cinq as a group lies not in songwriting but rather in the way they arrange and perform the music. Their voices intertwine and harmonize in a way that adds real weight to the chorus section of the songs, and those harmony parts, deployed to their fullest effect on ""Figareux Figareux"" and ""You’ll Be Sorry Someday"", distinguish the group’s general sound from any number of other '60s pop and rock bands. And while Mark Creamer is no Jeff Beck or Jimmy Page, his guitar work had style—the solos on ""Need All the Help I Can Get"" and ""Searchin’"" are particularly thrilling. It’s easy to dismiss collections like this one as nicely packaged cash-grabs marketed to the musically curious in search for an obscure outfit to champion, but the Kitchen Cinq are one of those rare acts like Sixto Rodriguez or the Sonics who merit another look. Maybe they didn’t catch the breaks they needed when they needed them, maybe their label dropped the ball or didn’t push them hard enough to the tastemakers, or maybe, as band member Jim Parker has suggested, the scene in L.A. simply chewed them up and spit them out. The music on When the Rainbow Disappears deserves another chance to be heard.","The Kitchen Cinq released just one full album, Everything but…the Kitchen Cinq, in 1967.

All Yours,Widowspeak,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0565e6ef95969321f59/1:1/w_160/e74868d8.jpg,2015-09-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20986-all-yours/,Captured Tracks,"Widowspeak unabashedly and openly take bits and pieces of rock, folk, and country history to make a pop Americana sound that feels antique. The band’s last full-length, Almanac, showcased a lively, psychedelic strain of '70s rock'n'roll, and their following EP, The Swamps, was a bluesy, banjo-plucked ode to the Southeast. But Widowspeak's third record, All Yours, seems to strip away the group's hyper-referential past sound to something more sparse. All Yours is committed to a sunbaked, blissed-out pop rock sensibility that is noticeably lighter than their previous work. There’s no big concept here or specific inspiration behind it other than making something that sounds pretty and easy to listen to. And where there first two records were dark and haunted, filled with Morricone-style guitars, All Yours is all lightly shaken maracas, dreamy acoustic melodies, and getting so stoned the world feels like velvet. Which isn’t to say this record is all feel-good music to string daisy chains together. Singer Molly Hamilton has said that for All Yours the band wanted to focus for the first time more on ""writing songs about what we’re thinking,"" and you can hear that in the lyrics. From blaming the stars on ""Cosmically Aligned"", to being too young on ""Girls"", to not being able to read the lines in a palm well enough to know on ""My Baby’s Gonna Carry On"", the band runs vaguely through all the reasons why love can go to the wayside. The rollicking ""Dead Love (So Still)"" is a Fleetwood Mac wannabe, its jangly guitar almost masking the record’s most devastating inquiry. ""Dead love, you’re so still,"" Hamilton sings. ""Are you just sleeping in?"" There’s a sort of rolling movement to every track on All Yours, partly owed to Hamilton and Robert Earl Thomas’ steady and unfussy guitar work but mostly to their songwriting, which lays heavy on fleeing scenes. It's a road trip album, less for the heartbroken crowd and more for the heartbreakers (and every runaway and hitchhiker ditching a promise.) ""You know that I’m always worried that I can never pay my debt,"" Earl Thomas sings for the first time on ""Borrowed World"". ""Always feel like I’m running and they haven’t caught me yet."" Though it’s clear the band is refining their songwriting and getting more personal in the process, the record feels wilted instrumentally compared to their previous releases. All Yours has its gorgeous moments, but when you hear the band’s older tracks like Almanac’s ""The Dark Age"" or The Swamps' ""Smoke and Mirrors"", you have to wonder where that fiery spark went. Seems like Widowspeak is ghosting from something more than just an unpaid debt or an old flame, and it might be a step backward instead of forward for the duo.","Widowspeak take bits and pieces of rock, folk, and country history to make a pop Americana sound that feels antique.

Empire,Unwound,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0a2b1335d7bf169a158/1:1/w_160/b9d0b258.jpg,2015-09-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20891-empire/,Numero GroupNumero Group,"By the late '90s, Unwound were asking themselves whether the band was worth fighting for. The trio had invested more time and money into their 1998 album Challenge for a Civilized Society than they had any other, and they’d never been more disappointed by the returns. Trading the unrelenting roar of its predecessors for hit-or-miss studio experimentation, the album alienated longtime fans and halted any career momentum the group had gained from their 1996 near-breakthrough Repetition. ""I remember playing Challenge for a couple of friends in Olympia after we finished it, and them just kinda starting at the ground,"" drummer Sara Lund recounts in the liner notes for Empire, the final of four box sets exhaustively chronicling the band’s career. ""It’s my least favorite of our records,"" says bassist Vern Rumsey. If Unwound had split up after Challenge—and they came close—the band would have ended on an off note, but their legacy would have been secure. The trio had so perfectly refined their chaotic noise rock over their first five albums that they’d forever be remembered; while they’d never be celebrated as widely as Nirvana or Fugazi, their DNA would live on for generations as young punk bands discovered and learned from them. Instead of disbanding, though, they pushed on a little longer, holding out against mounting personal troubles and growing geographic and emotional separation long enough to muster a magnificent final statement, 2001’s Leaves Turn Inside You, a hauntingly beautiful double album that upended every preconceived notion about the band. Leaves Turn Inside You, out of print on vinyl for over a decade, is Empire’s main event, the career high this entire box set series has been leading up to. But despite its low standing in the band’s discography, Challenge for a Civilized Society is worth revisiting, too. It’s Unwound’s End Hits, a transitional work from a band chaining themselves to the studio in hopes of forcing inspiration, and occasionally succeeding. Even though they don’t cohere, the songs reveal a range the band’s previous albums had never hinted at. The opening throes of the nine-minute ""Side Effects of Being Tired"" are scribbled with gnarly free-jazz saxophone. The techno diss ""NO TECH!"" pillages the wiry rhythms of post-punk acts like Swell Maps and the Pop Group, while the boozy, blustery guitar licks of ""Meet the Plastics"" imagine what an Unwound Jon Spencer Blues Explosion covers album might have sounded like. On an album of curiosities, one stands out as a clear success: ""Lifetime Achievement Award"", a ghostly dirge composed over a found recording of ""Happy Birthday"" played backward. Hypnotically paced and chillingly sad, it’s the one moment on Challenge where everything comes together: the performance, the songwriting, the phantasmal production, the overall feel; everything about it feels piped in from a different record. Three years later, they’d actually release that record. Leaves Turn Inside You took all the right lessons away from its predecessor’s hits and misses. This time the band wasn’t tossing spaghetti at the wall. They had focus. Though Challenge’s sales were lackluster, a publishing deal with BMG afforded the band enough money to get started on a project they’d long dismissed as a pipe dream: building their own studio. They assembled it piece by piece in the basement of an old farmhouse, borrowing equipment they couldn’t afford from Calvin Johnson and teaching themselves how to use it. The band had never self-produced an album before, but the challenge invigorated Rumsey and singer/guitarist Justin Trosper, who spent weeks obsessing over technical details, figuring out the best ways to capture interesting sounds and texture. Traditionally the band has worked fast and shrugged off mistakes. Now they were discovering the luxury of time. Midway through their sessions, the band’s old producer Steve Fisk visited their farmhouse to check their progress. “I thought, ‘God, what a terrible, depressing, sad place to be putting a record together,’” he recalls in Empire’s liner notes. That house casts a long shadow over Leaves. On ""Below the Salt"", a fractured, 11-minute lament paced like a séance, you can almost hear the foundation settling between notes. The similarly sprawling ""Terminus"" begins as a statement of defiance before succumbing mid-song to an orchestra of despair, led by a spectral cello that seems to sweep in and out of the studio walls. The whole record exists in a permanent November, condemned to those waning days of fall when all the color has been drained from the skyline, and all that’s left are barren trees and an isolating chill. Yet for all its melancholy, Leaves is also an album of uncanny splendor. Opener ""We Invent You"" follows a full two minutes of cautionary drone—the band’s way, perhaps, of weeding out old-guard fans unwilling to take the album on its own terms—with an outpouring of mammoth, multi-tracked psychedelia. Trosper had recently discovered Led Zeppelin III; this was his homage. Friend of the band Janet Weiss, a few years away from letting her own classic-rock flag fly on Sleater-Kinney’s The Woods, lent backing vocals to the closest thing Leaves offered to a pop song, ""Demons Sing Love Songs"", a gorgeous respite from the album’s prevailing unease. Leaves Turn Inside You didn’t happen in a vacuum. Around the turn of the century, indie acts as varied as Radiohead, the Flaming Lips, Wilco, and Modest Mouse were also embracing the studio, pouring considerable time into risky albums that ultimately proved high watermarks. But where those bands carried on with those victories under the belts, Unwound didn’t stick around to bask in their achievement. There’s a generous way of contextualizing the group’s breakup: They put everything they had into one last, great album and called it a day. But the reality isn’t quite so romantic. Instead, the band resumed their slow process of breaking down. A tense tour behind Leaves had been cut short during its key stretch by September 11, and Rumsey’s worsening alcoholism had made it impossible to carry on like nothing was wrong. They announced their split 10 months after the album’s release, with an unceremonious post on the Kill Rock Stars website. Fourteen years later, Leaves Turn Inside You has lost none of its wonder, but it feels like a broken promise. Though the members of Unwound have bounced around between new bands, nothing they’ve recorded since has approached that album’s creativity or ambition. They teased a world of new directions, but never followed up on them. In Empire’s liner notes, Trosper comments that in hindsight he realized some of his free-association lyrics on Leaves were about the troubled state of the band. The group hadn’t been on solid footing for a while; the writing had probably been on the wall even before they started recording the album. Perhaps that’s part of why it’s such a powerful work. It’s a last gasp, an album about ghosts by a band that on some level understood they were becoming one.","The final of four box sets exhaustively chronicling the seminal post-punk band Unwound's career features 1998's Challenge for a Civilized Society, which alienated fans at the time with its studio experimentation, and 2001’s Leaves Turn Inside You, a hauntingly beautiful double album that upended every preconceived notion about the group.

Anthems for Doomed Youth,The Libertines,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb8c0084474cd0c1b0f/1:1/w_160/17b8e965.jpg,2015-09-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20881-anthems-for-doomed-youth/,HarvestVirgin EMI,"Over a decade after their heyday, the Libertines are still the only post-Britpop British indie band with an enduring mythology. That mythology began before the band even existed, written into being in Pete Doherty's journal. Like a lovelorn teenager, he scrawled ""Doherty/Barât"" across countless pages, in which he also laid out his and Carl Barât's poetic ambition: ""To gain a measure of immortality in the plastic bubble of popular culture. A tricky task—unless one happens to be equipped with the belief, the talent, and the fervour."" Such was the price of admission into the world of the Libertines. You didn’t need a military jacket and crude tattoo stick'n'poked in a Camden bedsit, just the belief that belief itself was enough to transcend unfavorable circumstances, whether class or humdrum surrounds. They called this state of mind Albion, framed as a fantasy of a kinder England rooted in kitchen sink drama and Galton and Simpson comedies. But Doherty knew it couldn't last. ""Look at the Sex Pistols,"" he said in 2002, before the Libertines had even released debut Up the Bracket. ""They split up and there’s bitterness and sourness."" He told Barât that they would meet the same fate, and they did.  Their Albion became oblivion. Considering the interim decade of hubris (Barât's truly awful solo records) and reckless devastation (the crimes resulting from Doherty's enduring addictions, now supposedly kicked), it's a huge surprise that the Libertines' unlikely third album doesn't reprise old glories. On Anthems for Doomed Youth, the immortal Albion dream is dead, their erstwhile fantasy mocked and incinerated like an effigy on bonfire night. Anthems is littered with fragments of various past demos, but one old song appears wholesale. ""You're My Waterloo"" dates from 1999, a smoky piano ballad about the blossoming all-but-physical romance between Doherty and Barât. As lovely as it is, the intervening 16 years make tragic lines like ""I'm so glad we know just what to do and everyone's going to be happy"" just sound mawkish. Sharper is ""Fame and Fortune"", a shanty about Camden good old days that would be self-aggrandizing if it wasn't so self-mocking. ""Dubloons down for a double bluff/ Dip your quill or your bleeding heart and sign there and there and there,"" Barât sings, sending up the naivete of bohemians doing business. For fans, it's always galling to see a band dismiss the parts of their past that they fell in love with. But Anthems isn't bitter or dismissive. Opener ""Barbarians"" is a gimlet-eyed spaghetti western rallying optimism for the broken. Lifting the guitar from Sixpence None the Richer's ""Kiss Me"", the title track starts out as a grand proclamation about the futile spoils of war and revolution, espoused with Barât's typical camp flair. But then he shreds the glorious fantasy, revealing an ignominious reality with a comic turn of phrase: ""In the pub that night, racking out the lines of shite/ Putting to right all of the world's great wrongs."" When righteous belief is its own life force, an array of beer mats is as good a map to conquer as any. There's no romance in the songs where the duo confront their demons (Barât has also struggled with addiction and depression), but they're still full of fight. On ""Belly of the Beast"", Doherty sounds as if he's trying to slap himself out of the fug with every syllable of ""It was a smacked-up, cracked-up, bone shark smacked -down day."" Single ""Gunga Din"" has a reggae lilt, and Doherty's portrait of the cycle of veins, drinks, panic, and suffering is flinty, in stark contrast with the chorus' sloppy, rueful rush about having weak moral fiber. On ""Heart of the Matter"", the guitars echo ""Don't Look Back Into the Sun"", but whereas that classic praised a chancer's luck, here the pair express sad surprise that they're still going, having made it this far on a ""crooked little smile."" It's a reminder of the beguiling poetry of the Libertines, the world of Biggles and Bilo, ships and maidens, which they indulge on ""Fury of Chonburi"", a tale of conflicted, enduring devotion among ""pig men"" (their mutual pet name). It's one of the only ragers here, alongside ""Glasgow Coma Scale Blues"", tumbling pub rock with a brash theme tune quality. Anthems is an absorbing listen front to back, but lacks the iconoclasm of Up the Bracket and 2004's self-titled record. Still, it's rich with mood and gorgeous melodies, and a pervasive doomy streak. The record's two love songs that don't concern Pete'n'Carl are both PSAs about the danger of believing in eternity: ""Iceman"" showcases their Kinks-y knack for storytelling in an acoustic yarn about a figure best avoided; ""Dead for Love"" is affecting noir cabaret that warns that death is the only true forever. Given how easy it is to hate what the Libertines became, it's strange how endearing they remain, how magnetic Barât and Doherty's deep, despairing love. And how successful: The music that the two frontmen made apart was often disappointing—Barât’s knees-up theatrics (""je regrette, je regrette that I haven’t had you yet"") more than Doherty’s occasionally lovely work alone and with Babyshambles. Yet their enduring facility together—as much as their third record swears off such cosmic promise—is almost, just almost, enough to make you believe in soulmates.","A third Libertines album once seemed about as likely as a fifth Smiths LP. Like recovery, Anthems for Doomed Youth takes things one step at a time. It's an absorbing listen front to back, rich with mood and gorgeous melodies.

Turkey,Mike Krol,by: Pat Healy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01913d197565213a3de/1:1/w_160/df52f310.jpg,2015-09-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20944-turkey/,Merge,"The title of singer/guitarist/drummer Mike Krol's third album is a bowling reference, used for when you get three strikes in a row. On a poster in the liner notes, he is pictured holding two gold records, with tags beneath each reading, ""to commemorate the sale of no more than 500 copies."" Clearly, Krol has a sense of humor about himself, and his position. But his Merge debut isn't hangdog at all. It has a do-or-die desperation: The sound is scuzzy, but the energy is pure, bristling with the aim to be stronger and more memorable than the two that came before it. When Krol whines and shouts lines like ""you've been warned that I'm not fooling around,"" you believe him. The song that line comes from, by the way, is called ""Neighborhood Watch"", and it's sung to somebody who stole his bike. This is one of Krol's strongest suits; taking a small and seemingly silly premise, making it universal and hiding at least one line in each song that could be pulled from it to form a mission statement. ""The world can't stop me now,"" he sings in ""Cactuses"", a song about being mad at the pain that a cactus has caused him. Krol recorded Turkey in just four days, co-producing with Elliott Kozel, who also plays piano and synth on the album. Engineer Beau Sorenson improves upon the sound of Krol's first two albums, without compromising any of the shambolic glory. Instruments are panned hard, handclaps occasionally emerge through thick fuzz and squalls of feedback, and at the center of it all is Krol's nasally voice, singing sweet melodies through a guitar amp and hitting effects pedals at just the right time. He sings with the uncontainable excitement of an underdog finally realizing his dreams, and the album courses with the adrenaline of newfound confidence. It's hard to resist comparing Krol's voice to John Dwyer or King Tuff, and Krol seems ready to dispel any accusations of bandwagon-jumping. ""I feel left out of every city and scene I belong to,"" he sings on a track that is unambiguously titled, ""Left Out (ATTN: SoCal Garage Rockers)"". If Turkey  just misses greatness, it's because it's just too short. The whole thing is over in 18 minutes. This is the downside to spending only four days recording. And with the way that Turkey is sequenced, you can feel the slow deflation of the world-conquering drive. The album is front-loaded with biting rock that eventually devolves into ""Piano Shit"", a song which is just a Dustin O'Halloran-ish re-working of the previous track. (It's called ""Less Than Together"", and Krol's singing is less-than-in-tune on it.) The song ""Save the Date"", where Krol anticipates an invitation to the wedding of an ex, hints at deeper moods, but it, too, is over too quickly, a verse shy of poignance. You can hear Krol's asides to the engineer on Turkey, just as you can in his previous releases, and they hint at his gradually expanding ambition. His 2011 album, I Hate Jazz, ends with him simply asking, ""Did that sound even close?"" Turkey finds him zeroing in: ""Did that sound better?""","On his third album and his Merge debut, garage rocker Mike Krol plays and sings with the uncontainable excitement of an underdog finally realizing his dreams, and the album courses with the adrenaline of newfound confidence.

Anesthesia,Verbal Kent,by: J. Edward Keyes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff3ea9e61561daa6537/1:1/w_160/1f83ed22.png,2015-09-04 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20932-anesthesia/,Mello Music Group,"About two minutes into ""Illustrate"", Dan Weiss, the Chicago rapper who records as Verbal Kent, raps the following: ""Examining the fabric of life, the life scientist/ Put my foot in your ass, it's shitty for podiatrists."" The line raises a lot of questions. Given the context, wouldn't it, in fact, be Kent's podiatrist that this was shitty for? Would he go to the podiatrist immediately after administering the ass kicking? Is he going to the podiatrist as a result of the ass kicking? Is he barefoot? Can't he just take a shower? Yes, this is devoting a little too much thought to a throwaway bar, but it illustrates the most frustrating issue with Anesthesia, Kent's seventh solo record (not counting an excellent 2013 collaboration with Red Pill and Apollo Brown as Ugly Heroes). His rhymes are lean, his delivery is hungry, and he has excellent taste in collaborators—Freddie Gibbs, Torae, and Red Pill all show up here—and producers. He has a knack for lining up consonant syllables and rattling them off in a staccato morse-code delivery that renders every line tense and jagged. But for the most part, Anesthesia is a thicket of non sequiturs, a ""Family Guy"" pile-up of unrelated images and decontextualized half-puns, free of any organizing structure that might lend them impact or meaning. Absurdism in hip-hop has its place—in the late '90s, Kool Keith and Ghostface were masters of it, as was Cam'ron circa Purple Haze. The difference is that they were also expert world-builders, so even their stranger asides felt like they were obeying a certain internal logic. Kent's verses just feel like clumsy free-association: In the heavy-lidded ""Add Anesthesia"", which features sinister music-box production from Kaz 1, Kent says, ""One-hitter in the parking lot/ Anne Frank with the discreet smoking/ Hid her in the parking lot."" Later in the same song, he offers the even-more-baffling ""Huddle up and nurse from the nipple/ Suck on the same tit, so when effects ripple/ It's a simple thing to solve."" Traces of a stronger record turn up throughout Anesthesia, and when Kent manages to follow a train of thought from start to finish, everything suddenly clicks. On the breathless ""Suit Case Switch"", he trades motor-mouthed verses with Freddie Gibbs, running roughshod over Apollo Brown's beautifully woozy, '70s-soul-quoting production and nicely working a protracted heist metaphor. In the album's latter half, Kent briefly dabbles in autobiography, and the emotional grounding focuses him. In ""Notes"", he struggles with the news that he's about to become a father and, aside from a nonsensical digression about albacore tuna, it's poignant and striking. And on the soft, soulful ""Is This My Life"", Kent seems to be alluding to either substance abuse or the 2003 stabbing that almost took his life when he declares, ""Recovery's a myth/ Because you don't ever really return/ You just become a new version of the person you were/ And those of us that make it out a little wiser/ Instead of more bitter, get to shine a little brighter."" Those few flashes of earnestness and coherence suggest the album Anesthesia might have been. Its title, along with a few pointed, passing references to self-medication, imply that Kent had some desire to explore the ways people choose to numb themselves. But none of those ideas are ever fleshed out; instead, Kent keeps falling back on stuff like, ""Teach and grade my own masters' thesis/ Hot chili pepper temper, Flea pleading with Anthony Kiedis."" The line makes a kind of sense, inasmuch as both Flea and Anthony Kiedis are in a band called the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Otherwise, like so much of Anesthesia, it's about as resonant as a Wikipedia entry.","The Chicago rapper Verbal Kent has a lean, hungry style and a knack for lining up consonant syllables and rattling them off in a staccato delivery.

The Gold Standard,Marrow,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b047ea9e61561daa65d3/1:1/w_160/7f331391.png,2015-09-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20973-the-gold-standard/,self-released,"Marrow have been making the rounds in Chicago venues for a few years now, and even though they're still in their very early twenties, the band's members have impressive resumes. Lead singers Macie Stewart has toured with Chance the Rapper and Liam Kazar with Tweedy, and both were members of the now defunct hip-hop group Kids These Days. Still, even with their city’s cred behind them, Marrow is very much a blank slate. The Gold Standard doesn’t feel like a cohesive debut statement by any means. You get the sense the band was trying to display range, settling for writing an album filled with certain types of songs rather than a unified collective vision. They can do classic rock on ""She Chose You"", they’re Edward Sharpe-leaning faux-folk on ""Ocean of Glory"", and then spinning apocalyptic, Hozier-sounding ballads with songs like ""Cities"" and ""Leave Grounds Stay"". Marrow tout themselves as being schooled in jazz and classical, and it’s something you can hear consistently in how they compose their songs. The group likes using a diverse smattering of instrumentals, from horn arrangements to classical piano to violins and harp. It’s like they made a list of what sounds they wanted on the record and then ordered them up like a diner’s Hungry Man Special, though it doesn’t feel like overkill. There’s an authentic-sounding tinkering, improvisational quality that emanates throughout The Gold Standard’s instrumentals; music boxes break down on ""Darling Divine"", cowbells ring and guiros scratch at the tail end of the ""Mother of Maladies"", a xylophone dings under an electric guitar solo on ""Quarter to Three"". Though, this improv quality becomes their downfall when it sounds like they got stuck in a groove and couldn’t get out. ""Corsicana"" plays like a completely anonymous and derivative piano ballad and the nearly six-minute ""The Gold Standard"" is severely tedious, coming off like a somber pre-performance guitar tuning with slow percussion before erupting into repetitive, roaring guitar solos. Still, there are diamonds here. The album’s lead single ""Paulson"" is a furious, head-banging, shred-heavy rock song with Stewart’s voice like a bolt of lightning; you can practically see the spotlight on her. The charming ""Mother of Maladies"", carried by a peppy organ melody, is sweet, waltzing in a sort of theatrical romance as Stewart sings of how love feels. ""Every night I am with you, I feel it/ Every night’s not every night enough,"" she sings. And as ho-dunk as ""Ocean of Glory"" might be (""You could make love to me when I’m older/ You’re a bootstrap, I’ll pull you closer,"" Stewart and Kazar sing), at the five-minute mark the song feels like opening a trap door and finding a party as it wigs out into frantic psychedelia. You wonder why they didn’t make a whole new song; then again, letting a saccharine, cult-evoking sing-along dissolve into a shrilly-sung wacky trip isn’t an entirely bad move either. Still, on the whole, The Gold Standard feels like Marrow are in the midst of trying to define their sound, throwing things at the wall and seeing what will stick. They're a band that can build a great three-minute song, but they lose themselves in the construction of anything bigger.","Marrow have been making the rounds in Chicago for a few years, and even though they're still in their very early twenties, the band's members have impressive resumes that include work with Chance the Rapper and Tweedy.

Crosswords EP,Panda Bear,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05c9d034d5c69bf486f/1:1/w_160/fe618fbe.jpg,2015-09-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20991-crosswords-ep/,Domino,"Ever since his proper debut, 2004’s mostly forgotten (but still quite good) Young Prayer, Noah Lennox’s solo work has followed relatively narrow parameters. Where his first record was acoustic and much of it was recorded live in a room, his music since has mostly consisted of him singing over loops, constructing songs from other songs. The fact that the backing tracks mostly consist of processed samples gives Lennox a wide palette to work with, and he’s able to keep his music varied by how he approaches texture and arrangement. He’s also good at making music in this format, no question. But there are limitations to the approach, in terms of dynamics and song structure—the amount of empty space and variations in terms of volume are kept to a minimum, and when Lennox’s melodies are less engaging, his songs tend to bleed together. Melody was decidedly not a problem on Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper—in fact, it was the most tuneful Panda Bear album, filled with songs that felt familiar because they sounded like classics that somehow also managed to be surprising. But the Crosswords EP, consisting of one song from Grim Reaper remixed, an updated version of a bonus track from 2012's Tomboy, and three songs from the Grim Reaper sessions that didn’t make the cut, isn’t up to the same standard. It’s reasonably pretty and it’s always welcome to hear new material in this style, but songs like ""No Man’s Land"" and ""Jabberwocky"" don’t stand out in a catalog that is by now pretty extensive; there’s never a moment where you stop breathing for a second to zero in on the way Lennox skips up an interval, no tunes that won’t leave your head. These are solid and enjoyable tracks in Panda Bear’s style, and hearing them here, untethered from an album that has more of an arc, they never become much more than that. When working as Panda Bear, Lennox essentially makes comfort-food music, songs that come off as gentle and created with care that bring warm feelings, so it feels wrong to use the word ""comfortable"" in a pejorative sense when discussing his work. But the five songs on the Crosswords EP sound like tracks that come easily to him, songs he knows how to make without stretching himself. The most distinctive is the closer ""Cosplay"" whose lyrics, oddly enough, mostly consist of Lennox singing variations of ""Marijuana makes my day."" Live versions of it floated around last year, and it’s been stripped of some of its initial samples but still retains an appealing bubbly texture. Even though the words are goofy and obvious (has any Panda Bear fan ever thought otherwise?), it’s the one place where the album stops being good background music and makes you take notice.","Panda Bear's Crosswords EP consists of one song from this year's Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper remixed, an updated version of a bonus track from 2012's Tomboy, and three songs from the Grim Reaper sessions that didn’t make the cut.

Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz,Miley Cyrus,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b083ea9e61561daa6632/1:1/w_160/03e71621.jpeg,2015-09-04 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21023-miley-cyrus-and-her-dead-petz/,self-released,"Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz dropped from the sky to cap off last weekend’s Cyrus-hosted VMA Awards like so much phallically-deployed glitter. The free 23-track album, written and recorded outside the governance of Cyrus' label and co-produced in large part by Wayne Coyne and other Flaming Lips members, appeared on Sunday accompanied by a New York Times interview where Cyrus detailed its making. In it, she recalls being told by her team that the album was too long. She proceeded to add ""Miley Tibetan Bowlzzz"", as an impetuous reminder that Cyrus plays by no one’s rules but her own. That pretty much says it all: Dead Petz is the definition of a vanity project, an indulgent collection of experiments that exist for no other reason than because they can. It would be hard to imagine Cyrus and Coyne’s talents combining to worse results: there’s nothing here as pleasant as her appearances on the Flaming Lips’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band cover album last year, nor are these collaborations audacious enough to fail in exciting ways. Mostly they are tossed-off Diet Yoshimi detritus, the kind of music these guys can fart out in their sleep. There are bright spots, many of them via former mentor Mike WiLL Made It’s handful of productions. But on the whole Dead Petz is a borderline unlistenable slog through dorm-room poncho bullshit and blissfully ignorant acid koans (""Can’t you see, all the clouds are dying?""), delivered earnestly from an ex-child star seemingly unaware of how fundamentally inseparable her own privilege is from her ""do whatever the fuck you want all of the time"" ethos, and enabled by a 54 year old who should know better. Take ""Dooo It!"", the album's single of sorts. There's a lot going on in the track—weed, flying saucers, queries about the origins of the moon—but the part I keep coming back to is Cyrus proclaiming, ""Peace, motherfuckerz! Do it!"" Far be it for me to dash the idealistic, psilocybin-fueled dreams of a 22-year-old multi-millionaire whose emancipatory phase has swerved from ratchet-lite twerk ambassador to proudly pansexual LGBTQ advocate and Wayne Coyne bestie: she’s figuring it out, as 22-year olds do, though rarely from such a precipitous platform. But still: ""Do it!"" As if it were just that simple. But that’s why having an editor is important, and why ""No parents! No rules!"" is almost always better as a slogan than as a creative mode. ""Self-control is not something I am working on,"" Cyrus trills on Mike WiLL cut ""Slab of Butter (Scorpion)"", and while she seems to be having a blast, we are left with the utterly pointless witch-house skid mark ""Fuckin Fucked Up"" (not to be confused with ""I’m So Drunk""), and ""BB Talk"", a rambling monologue that wastes one of the album’s few salvageable hooks. ""1 Sun""  namedrops Grace Jones alongside tuneless invocations to ""Wake up, world! Can’t you see the earth is crying?"" There is a twee piano ballad about a dead blowfish friend, who her human friends eat at sushi dinner. The circle of life, man. (She fake-cries at the end.) Presumably, Cyrus will look back on all this and laugh, having learned something about herself and about making art, and move on, as she seems to have done with 2013’s Bangerz. And there are moments of promise here—most often, when Coyne backs off a bit. She’s much better at love songs than drug songs. ""Space Boots"" streamlines the album’s cosmic vibes into an electro pulse somewhere between Kavinsky and Rilo Kiley, with sweet, direct lyrics that pierce through the fog of bullshit: ""I get so high cause you’re not here smokin’ my weed/ And I get so bored/ Cause you’re not here to make me laugh."" Best of all is ""Lighter"", a stunning, '80s-nodding Mike WiLL ballad that poignantly redeems the general ""whoa, dude"" vibes: ""We never get to see ourselves sleeping peacefully next to the ones that we love,"" she sings. It’s genuinely moving. Cyrus returns to idealized depictions of sleep and dreams often here, and given how hyper-regimented most of her life must have been, her attraction to relinquishing control to drugs or the subconscious makes sense. But for all the Instagram nudes and real talk about gender and sexuality in the press, very little of Dead Petz reveals much about Cyrus beyond the bacchanalia and non-sequiturs. I can’t shake the sense that Dead Petz exists more as a glorified VMA party favor than as a work that can stand on its own. Speaking of: the biggest irony of Cyrus’ clash with Nicki Minaj is that if Cyrus were to pay closer attention, she might recognize Minaj as a trailblazer for the career path she's trying to take—a massively famous woman who does things the ""wrong"" way, pisses a lot of people off in the process, and refuses to give a fuck. As far as surrealist pop albums this decade, it doesn’t get much ballsier than Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. But the stakes there were huge, and there is literally nothing at stake for Cyrus here. In a way, Dead Petz is a fascinating milemarker of pop music in the post-album, post-Internet era: a major pop album that lands with a splash, then sinks like a brick, as ephemeral as the Tumblr culture Cyrus draws from. Maybe that’s the most visionary aspect of Dead Petz: it feels like it was built to disintegrate.","Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz is a free 23-track album—written and recorded outside the governance of Miley Cyrus' label and co-produced in large part by Wayne Coyne and other Flaming Lips members.

Seven years later, mentor Pharrell Williams appeared on The Decadence, a nimble set of club bangers designed to introduce Christian Rich to a bigger audience. Along the way, they've crafted beats for Childish Gambino on Because the Internet’s ""Crawl"", and for J. Cole, on Born Sinner’s ""Sparks Will Fly""; in 2013, Christian Rich landed four tracks on Earl Sweatshirt’s breakout Doris, and most recently, the duo composed ""Señorita"", the menacing lead single from Vince Staples’ exceptional Summertime '06. On the surface, their production work hasn't been particularly groundbreaking, and their debut album, FW14, doesn’t make an immediate impact. But midway through the record, near the end of the JMSN-featured ""Fast Life"", a bright flurry of drums move FW14 from mostly contemporary fare to an international sound closer to their Nigerian roots. It's another subtle shift for a group that's built a strong career on understated creative turns. The album is loosely conceptual, with references to traveling through space and time and a premise derived from sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick’s VALIS trilogy and We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, and director Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film, Interstellar. Musically, FW14 brings to mind The Love Below, the André 3000-led second disc of OutKast's award-winning LP. The pace and influences are similar, and both albums take their time reaching their destination. It drifts comfortably through the cosmos, and a song like ""FACE"" benefits from a wafting ambience. The album thrives on a technical prowess that grows more refined over its length. FW14 features several collaborators whose names might be more recognizable than the group's, even if they've spent several years crafting hits for Top 40 radio talent. But on FW14, and working with Vince Staples and singers Jack Davey and Niia, the group chops their vocals and re-filters them through the arrangements, keeping the producers at the forefront. The music centers on glossy EDM grooves while mixing in jazz, global dance, and '70s funk. Thematically, FW14 feels like a romantic jaunt through the universe, following the ups and downs of a couple with common relationship struggles. Through songs like ""Real Love""—a nostalgic R&B number featuring vocalist Angela McCluskey—and the GoldLink-assisted ""Compromise"", there’s a prevailing intimacy in the album’s second half. The aforementioned ""FACE"" delves into unconditional commitment: ""Let’s go half in life,"" goes a line from the track. ""I don’t need so many things to myself."" FW14 has a gentle touch that grows more intoxicating with each listen, an album that moves calmly without much commotion, gradually taking shape.","Twin brothers Taiwo and Kehinde Hassan, aka production duo Christian Rich, have crafted beats for everyone from Vince Staples to Earl Sweatshirt to Lil' Kim.

They’ve performed as David Kilgour of the Clean’s backing band, and they instantly and seamlessly fit into the legacy Kilgour helped establish; their debut album, Metalmania, feels less like an homage to New Zealand’s 1980s underground and more like a lost release from that time period ready to be unearthed by the record collectors of the future. When Metalmania is good, it's nearly transcendent, as much as a pop album can be. The melodic kick in the last minute of opener ""Here's No Use"" is as bracing as sunlight slanting through dust-motes on a beautiful day, and ""Dream Date"", the album's first single, is driving, energetic, and charming. Later single ""No Taste Bomber"" is perfectly noisy, just so slightly psychedelic, one of those songs it’s impossible not to nod your head to on first listen (and it only gets further under one’s skin the more one listens). ""I’m a Mountain"" is crafted so tautly that the chanted lyric ""I won’t let you fuck it up"" takes on new dimensions with each repetition. ""Hit Her and Run"" takes a while to build: though it feels like initially it might grow into a Byrds-like California country song, it turns on its heel into a thick wall of distortion. What Metalmania is slightly short on is the underlying grit present in much of the work of Salad Boys' forebears, one of the elements that kept even the poppiest of the Flying Nun bands (the Bats, the Chills, Able Tasmans) from sounding too cloying. Existential sadness haunts so much of New Zealand’s indie pop but there are three or four tracks on Metalmania that feel like dreamy filler, tracks so airy that they never quite make the emotional impact they could or should. There isn’t quite enough dissonance to them, not enough low end, not enough movement, not enough curiosity. Having similar tempos and chord structures, these filler songs bleed into one another; their grounding is too stable, too comfortable. Since the memorable tracks on Metalmania are so good, the tracks that don’t quite rise to the occasion feel all the more frustrating. Yes, this is a debut album for a relatively young band (they’ve been around less than three years), and to hold Salad Boys to such a standard might feel a little unfair, but they’ve proven themselves capable of holding their own with the best indie pop their country has to offer. The fact that they’ve set the bar so high for themselves is, in the end, a testament to how exquisite their songwriting at its best can be.","New Zealand's Salad Boys are precisely what you'd expect from the land of Flying Nun—a jangly, cerebral, experimental pop group, a bit shambly, with understated vocals buried in the mix and the bright guitar work pushed to the front.

Kicking Every Day,All Dogs,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b036c0084474cd0c1be2/1:1/w_160/bd347f9f.jpg,2015-09-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20961-kicking-every-day/,Salinas,"When All Dogs' debut tape started getting noticed in summer 2013, it felt as if the Ohio four-piece, fronted by indie-rock lifer Maryn Jones, were on the crest of something. Katie Crutchfield had just released Cerulean Salt, her breakthrough second album as Waxahatchee. Northampton's Speedy Ortiz would soon release their debut, as would Wales' Joanna Gruesome, while Courtney Barnett first broke beyond Australia that August. All received some degree of international mainstream acclaim; the plainspoken, fuzzed-up frontwoman was being widely celebrated for the honesty that would likely have been dismissed as typical confessional singer-songwriter chick fare a decade, or even half a decade, earlier. While the links to forebears like Liz Phair were clear, their simply stated, often brutal honesty felt somehow new. Two years later, as All Dogs finally release their debut album, its 40 minutes of grungy intimacy feel, in a sense, relatively commonplace, though that's good. Praising young female lyricists for the simple candor with which they confess complex emotional devastation as if they didn't expect to be heard is a trope by now, but the growing audience and respect for a woman's internal life should be relished. And even if Kicking Every Day firmly inhabits a sound and type, that doesn't mean that it has nothing new to offer. The female trainwreck is having a pop cultural moment on the big and small screen, but all too often these figures are reduced to their perceived or self-professed limitations. Jones (who is also a member of Saintseneca and plays solo as Yowler) deals with the constant mutability of experience, refusing to let a single interpretation of an event define her. It's appropriate to an age where everyone is the editor of their own life, when self-love and self-loathing go hand-in-hand online. Back on ""Love Song"", from that debut 2013 tape (a split with fellow Columbus band Slouch), Jones warned a potential partner not to give her a chance because, she admitted, she'd only fuck it up, ""just wait and see."" Across Kicking, she confesses to being driven by anxiety and self-loathing, maintaining on ""Skin"" that ""every darkness I push through/ There is a quiet familiar feeling/ And in it I am always waiting for everything to fall/ Just like I always make it so."" ""That Kind of Girl"" starts with her mid-sentence, aware that she's as destructive a force in someone else's life as she always imagines herself to be. But the minute some unknown third party warns her lover off ""messing with that kind of girl,"" she starts burning with rage, demanding transparency and explanation over a fiery squall and bass that drones and sparks like an anchor towed down a gravel road. On paper, Jones' lyrics can scan a little sad-sack; on record, she delivers them with the joyous belligerence that befits a band who often sound like early 2000s Guided by Voices, all mid-fi production, hectic drums, and fuzzy power chords hewing euphoric hooks. They play arena-sized in basement studios, their reach infectious. Jones spends much of Kicking bristling against her own limitations as well, aware of the way her self-defeating impulses play into depression's toxic loop. ""I will find a way to justify my pain,"" she sings on ""Skin"", and asks any friend that finds her on the floor to check if she's alright, but not to tell her otherwise on ""Sunday Morning"", a Lemonheads/Sundays-y bundle where she's caught adrift in the routine-less routine of touring. ""How Long"" is a triumphant-sounding portrait of self-loathing where she gives the Joan Didion edict about staying on good terms with your past selves a nightmarish inversion: ""All these people that I've been hold knives."" Her lacerating lyrics offer the potential for deadening recognition, but also empathy. ""Your Mistakes"" has a softer touch, as if Sharon Van Etten had started releasing records as a drunk 19 year old in a garage, and offers a friend comfort for the way that enduring regrets tend to obliterate the mind. Jones makes shame corporeal and emptiness vast, giving these songs gut-punching impact beyond the lingering melodies. split tape w/slouch and November 2013's 7” both saw All Dogs moving at breakneck speed, stretching out power-pop with fiery yearning. Towards the end of Kicking especially, things take a calmer, darker, turn, the drums often fading away. The stillness suits them. Standout ""Leading Me Back to You"" has the tainted romance of American Football or Mineral; before the defiant chorus kicks in, ""Skin"" could be a relic from 1990s Louisville, and the warm hiss of ""The Garden"" suggests that it's Jones' original demo. It's a softly strummed plea for someone to hold tight, because parts of her are going to disappear by the time she returns from some sojourn—not through collapsing in on herself as in opener ""Black Hole"", but by heeding the warning she set out in the careening ""Flowers"": that you'll never find satisfaction ""if all that you grow are gardens of longing for things you don't know."" Kicking Every Day spends a lot of time trawling the murk, but recognizes that, ultimately, it's down to the individual to dig herself out; it's a warm thump of encouragement from an equally grubby hand.","On their debut, the Columbus, Ohio, four-piece All Dogs offer 40 minutes of grungy intimacy. Maryn Jones (who also plays solo as Yowler) delivers her words with joyous belligerence over hectic drums and fuzzy power chords hewing euphoric hooks.

The Meth Lab,Method Man,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0075e6ef95969321ee1/1:1/w_160/cbb09730.jpg,2015-09-03 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21000-the-meth-lab/,Tommy Boy,"If you've been keeping up with Method Man over the past decade or so, the question isn’t whether he will make embarrassing ""Breaking Bad"" references on an album called The Meth Lab, it’s how many times will he make a reference, the likely range being ""too many"" to ""far too many."" This is how Johnny Blaze does nowadays—after kicking off 8 Diagrams with a promise to ""bring the sexy back like Timbaland and Timberlake,"" he’s followed with countless other, similarly demoralizing punchlines that are at least a year past their spoilage date. Method Man has always been expected to be Wu-Tang Clan's mainstream emissary, and his lyrics mirror their currently tangential relationship with relevancy. If that doesn’t kill your vibe, look at the tracklisting of The Meth Lab: of the 19 tracks, only three are credited solely to Method Man. One is the intro, another is the outro, and the other is fittingly called ""2 Minutes of Your Time"". This actually works out quite well for the Method Man brand—if hip-hop has completely passed him by, Method Man can always surround himself with rappers more out of step than himself. Though it doesn’t advertise as such, The Meth Lab is a throwback to Wu-Tang’s mid-2000s wilderness period where the leading figures tried to establish independent fiefdoms outside of RZA’s view—even if Hanz On, Eazy Get Rite, Mack Wilds, Chedda Bang, Dro Pesci, Kash Verazzano, and Hue Huf aren’t given the dignity of a crew name, The Meth Lab is a posse record in practice, very much in the lineage of Theodore Unit's 718, Polluted Water, or the ultimate in Wu-Tang marginalia, Ugodz-illa Presents the Hillside Scramblers. Pity these dudes if you want—Method Man is still a household name. Based on their handles alone, you can’t possibly imagine the aforementioned involved with pertinent rap music in 2015. Not that they want to anyway—beyond the likely deathless #hashtag and ""no [RAPPER OF INTEREST]"" kickers, Meth Lab's foot soldiers have a stylistic cut-off point around the most recent Method Man album, and that came out in 2006. They favor broadly-drawn street journalism and humorless punchlines, less derived from Method Man than the still-down-for-whatever Streetlife, who appears on over 1/3rd of The Meth Lab. The production complements the rapping—you likewise get Wu-Tang’s second tier (4th Disciple, Mathematics behind the boards, Killa Sin and Carlton Fisk on the mic), and the occasional ""oh that guy!"" from any number of ""bring New York back!"" waves. The biggest outside appearances come from Corey Gunz and Uncle Murda—both are technically major-label rappers, though it feels like a matter of time before Epic or one of the four imprints currently sharing Gunz fixes the glitch. Likewise, you get a beat from Ron Browz, who no longer refers to himself as Etherboy. Seven tracks are helmed by Pascal Zumaque—the first thing that pops up in a Google search of his name is his LinkedIn page. Otherwise, you know Meth’s steez—Wu-Tang’s for the children, other rappers need to pull their pants up, hip-hop peaked when you could still hear Method Man songs on the radio. He’s basically turned into Redman now—except when Redman stays making O.J. references in 2015, he’s at least staying in character as hip-hop’s favorite knucklehead uncle. Method Man just sounds like a guy who got set up with a Twitter account and has no initiative to use it, making jokes to himself while watching TV. Sift through the verses for proper names and the likes of Michael Vick, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, and Rappin’ 4-Tay emerge. Yet, here’s the one that I find most fascinating—""I’m here to analyze your shooter like I’m Kenny Smith."" Just think about that one for a second—what exactly is Method Man trying to express here? I know what he means, but it also makes no goddamn sense. This is undeniably the result of Method Man’s mind drifting while watching ""Inside the NBA"" and as far as rapper/actors clowning on the Jet, he now ranks below Shaquille O’Neal. To Meth’s credit, he hasn’t fallen the fuck off as hard as Inspectah Deck, who shows up on ""The Purple Tape"", a highlight by default because it also features Raekwon—the one guy left in Wu-Tang Clan who really hasn't fallen off at all. His F.I.L.A. record from earlier this year didn’t leave much of a mark either, but the appearances of Rick Ross, A$AP Rocky, and French Montana didn't feel like desperate grasps at Hot 97 airplay; those guys likely showed up on their own volition, an acknowledgement that Rae’s style has aged well because rapping in code about selling drugs and fly gear has never gone out of style in hip-hop and never will. All you can really do with The Meth Lab is contemplate its reason for existence— if anything, the fact that it's being released on Tommy Boy might get a chuckle out of GZA... provided you can get a chuckle out of GZA. But if you make it to the end, you find out that this is actually a prelude to Method Man’s real solo album. Which will be called Crystal Meth. So really, we’re right back where we started.","Method Man's first solo album since 2006 is a throwback to Wu-Tang’s mid-2000s wilderness period where the leading figures tried to establish independent fiefdoms outside of RZA’s view.  Raekwon and Inspectah Deck guest.

Poison Season,Destroyer,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aee45e6ef95969321d00/1:1/w_160/6c7895a5.png,2015-09-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20706-poison-season/,MergeDead Oceans,"Dan Bejar's intellect is so formidable it feels like an event, and Destroyer has, for 12 years or so, been indie rock's most rewarding intellectual project. You listen to Destroyer to hear the smartest person at a party mutter funny and erudite things in your ear. Even by 2006, Bejar had generated a world deep and manifold enough that fans of his made, and passed around, a Dan Bejar lyric generator. His mind, and the music he's made exploring its contours, is a minor zip code in independent rock music. Kaputt from 2011 exposed that zip code a little bit, briefly subjecting Bejar to the indignities of mid-level festival-touring success. It was the most immediately beautiful record he'd ever made, but it also accidentally coincided with a rising interest in the soft rock of the 1970s and '80s, which meant that Bejar, long the wry bridge troll beneath the zeitgeist, momentarily represented it. The story is important to Bejar's career, but it feels like an ancillary concern to Poison Season, his new album. The point and pleasure of Destroyer's world, after all, is that it motors away on its own  juice, irrespective of others.  The world is a big place, his records seem to say, and it can be wearying and demanding, but your thoughts are a republic entirely within your control. As he memorably put it on Destroyer's Rubies' ""Painter in Your Pocket"": ""You looked OK with the others, you looked great on your own."" Poison Season retains the sumptuous melancholy of Kaputt, leavening it with the elegant swoon of Nelson Riddle-era Frank Sinatra. There are string arrangements all over Poison Season, and they are gorgeously recorded: the orchestra on ""Girl in a Sling"" sounds like 180-gram vinyl even while in earbuds. Destroyer has always partly been a nostalgia project, even when Bejar's nostalgia was decidedly ersatz—his records aim to stir the feelings that classic recordings arouse in us. Streethawk hearkened back to glam-rock Bowie even if the resemblance was off, and the magic of Kaputt was partly that of a peculiar and gnomic figure like Bejar conjuring the jaded romanticism of Bryan Ferry. On Poison Season, he visits a different section of his record collection, one that predates rock'n'roll, and he applies all the studied love and imagination to the endeavor we've come to expect from him. Bejar uses his voice in new ways here, stretching words out generously on the two-part story-song ""Bangkok"" so that we feel the beauty of the melody but also don't miss the bumps and crags in his throat. There's a basic tenderness that communicates itself beneath the vermouth of his words, and they remain a joy to soak in, a purposeful blurring of sense and sound. Lines like ""The writing on the wall/ Wasn't writing at all"" or ""It sucks when there's nothing but gold in those hills"" resist interpretation and invite savoring—the Destroyer-lyric-generator couplet here would probably be ""The ass king's made of asses, the ice queen's made of snow,"" from ""Archer on the Beach"". But my favorite moment might be Bejar muttering ""aw shit, here comes the sun"" on ""Dream Lover"", the Bruce Springsteen-style rocker that, as he told Pitchfork, he didn't even want to make. The juxtaposition—a curmudgeon swearing under his breath as the horns and drums he's arranged around him power the record up to transcendence—is, as he Bejar noted with some self-deprecation in that same interview, ""Destroyer 101."" In fact, there are moments on Poison Season where Bejar's formidable mind threatens to drag the proceedings down a bit. The swooning '50s strings sometimes collides awkwardly with the '70s pop gestures—the funk bass line that peppers ""Midnight Meet the Rain"" mostly serves to underline the sleepiness of the album's last third. ""Hell"" lurches between ponderous chamber pop and a swinging beat, capturing the album's uncertainty about exactly what kind of dance it's doing. For an album that took an unusual amount of time for Bejar to make—the four years separating Poison Season from Kaputt represents his longest stretch ever—it feels tonally hesitant, jets of cold water and warmth doled out in furtive and uncontrolled doses. He has never made, and will probably never make, a bad album—he's far too accomplished, intuitive, and literate for that. But on Poison Season, you can occasionally detect the dismaying sound of indie rock's greatest intellect second-guessing itself.","Dan Bejar’s intellect is so formidable that it feels like an event in itself, and Destroyer has, for 12 years or so, been the most rewarding intellectual project in indie rock.

Badlands,Halsey,by: Nathan Reese,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b02b13d197565213a403/1:1/w_160/7bbf0819.jpg,2015-09-02 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20951-badlands/,Astralwerks,"Halsey is the stage name of Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, a 20-year-old New Jersey native who has cultivated a dedicated following with just one EP to her name, last year's Room 93. With a shock of blue hair and vocal control beyond her years, Halsey arrived with just five songs and a buzzed-about live show. Since then she became the most tweeted-about artist at SXSW, toured with Imagine Dragons, and was the subject of a fascinating New York Times profile that explored her identity as a ""biracial, bisexual and bipolar"" artist. To boot, Halsey's debut album, Badlands' latest single, ""New Americana"", recently premiered on Apple Music's Beats 1 with an enthusiastic endorsement from Zane Lowe: ""There’s a new icon there,"" he said, possibly making it so by fiat. The momentum behind Halsey is undeniable, but Badlands mostly falls flat. At its best, the record plays like a conflagration of a half-decade's worth of alt-R&B—catchy, dark, spottily engaging. But it is weighed down by trite lyrics and stale production: The details of her story wind up far more interesting than the music itself, which is a weird place to be for a superstar-in-the-making. Badlands opens with ""Castle"", an unhurried track with a trip-hop backbone that serves as a meditation on Halsey's growing fame. ""Sick of all these people talking, sick of all this noise,"" she sings, ready to reject celebrity like an industry pro from the get-go. ""And there's an old man sitting on the throne that's saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean,"" she sings, taking a jab at the patriarchy; it's one of the occasional moments on Badlands where Halsey's personality emerges and the knives come out. But sonically, ""Castle"" is dull; a misguided plainchant interlude threatens to derail the track early on and the soupy production never quite congeals. Elsewhere, Halsey's choices are even clunkier. ""New Americana"" reconstitutes Lana Del Rey's Hollywood Babylon-isms and Lorde's tongue-in-cheekiness as a millennial call-to-arms: ""Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire/ Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockafellas,"" Halsey sings, piling on the Gen Y bromides. She runs down a ""big issues"" checklist, from social media fame (good? bad? maybe both!) to wealth inequality (a problem, no doubt!), and her concerns come across as plasticky and surface-level. ""New Americana"" isn't the only time Halsey evokes Del Rey. ""Drive"" hews close to the Lizzy Grant playbook, with saccharine strings and West Coast anhedonia that has Ultraviolence written all over it. The more successful tracks tend to be the ones that feel personal and specific. ""Ghost"", which also appeared on Halsey's EP, gives you a sense of what she can do when the scale is smaller. The track is a sinuous synth-pop love song whose economical runtime plays in its favor; one can almost forgive the music video for being yet another Enter the Void knockoff. ""Hurricane"", a bonus track that doubled as an early single, also has a striking specificity to its unusually bleak lyrics: ""He's got an eye for girls of eighteen/ And he turns them out like tricks,"" Halsey sings, painting a troubling picture of a traumatic youth. Reading interviews with Halsey or scrolling through her Twitter feed, you get the sense of a canny and talented performer, one who legitimately wants to connect with fans. But the public persona only comes through on Badlands in fits and starts, and there isn't a single subversive or original second on the album. ""We are the new Americana/ High on legal marijuana/ Raised on Biggie and Nirvana,"" goes the chorus on ""New Americana."" Like most of Badlands, it's calculated, defiant, and, ultimately, hollow.","Halsey is the stage name of Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, a 20-year-old New Jersey native who has cultivated a dedicated following with just one EP to her name.

Litany,Dead to a Dying World,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8e9d034d5c69bf4727/1:1/w_160/26cc3891.jpg,2015-09-02 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20834-litany/,Gilead Media,"For a moment, you think that the onslaught is over, that after eight minutes of dramatic strings and overdriven guitars, punishing drums and punished vocals, the big Texas metal band Dead to a Dying World will at last offer a respite. After all, they’ve already detailed environmental degradation, screaming lines about nature’s revolt and grand-finale floods as rhythm and riff crack and lash against one another. But when Dead to a Dying World at last pull back during ""Beneath the Loam"", one of four quarter-hour marvels on their second album, Litany, it is only to regroup and instantly return with twice the speed and twice the fury. ""Brittle embers flicker inside,"" screams Heidi Moore, pushing her voice so hard above the sudden black metal melee that she takes full stops between every word. ""Where blasting suns once raged."" It’s a shocking and gripping moment, a jolt applied with unapologetic force and impeccable timing amid what was already a mighty furor. That sort of escalation is exactly what Dead to a Dying World do so well throughout Litany, a vivid hybrid of doom, black metal, and crust punk, buttressed by baroque classical flourishes. Dead to a Dying World’s 2011 debut pursued a similar mix, with doom lunges and black metal surges woven together with string sections and riffs that expanded or contracted based upon the context. The idea, though, often outstripped the execution, so that the transitions between those parts felt threadbare and rushed, the rookie mistakes of an audacious new seven-piece ensemble. Four years later, however, Dead to a Dying World show no such signs of folly. These six deliberate pieces commingle melodrama and momentum, horror and hope, pulling the listener along like some tight-wire suspense flick. To an extent, that’s what it is: Litany deals with the state of the world and its rather grim prospects, delivered in moribund language that suggests we are, as a species, poised at the precipice of our end. The music animates that message, with sweeping arrangements and chiming guitars, washes of distortion and marches of drums shaping a battle between anxiety about our future and hope for it, between infinite pessimism and purposeful optimism. Though the tools are different, Dead to a Dying World suggest the same frisson as the Arcade Fire in their salad days and the same emotional ambiguity as Explosions in the Sky. There is no single style to Litany, just as there are no easy answers about the worries Dead to a Dying World address. For an album that lasts for more than an hour, though, it is at least an easy, alluring listen, largely because so much effort and thought seem to have gone into building it. During 17-minute opener ""The Hunt Eternal"", for instance, Dead to a Dying World volley between invigorating, aggressive black metal passages and stately, alluring doom. They drift into a pensive and patient midsection, where the spectral voice of Sabbath Assembly’s Jamie Myers-Waits hangs like foreboding fog. When at last they reach the end, they funnel all of it together, with the harshness pushing against the heaviness and buoyed from below by viola. Each moment feels bigger and more powerful than the last, so that these epics never overstay their welcome and linger into tedium. The song establishes the rubric for the rest of Litany, a seesaw of dynamics built around a world of apocalyptic images and faint whispers of renewal. Just before the album’s final minute, Dead to a Dying World collapse, exhaustedly, from Litany's blitz, the beat marching along in halftime. His voice fighting above surviving sheets of guitar, Mike Yeager fights to pose one final question: ""Do we choose to follow, or can we break away?"" At times, Litany may feel overwrought, too emotionally loaded and compositionally ostentatious for its own good. But here, at the end, you understand that Dead to a Dying World aren’t being maudlin just for kicks, that they’re not howling about ""a bloodless pillar"" and ""ochre hands"" and intoning lines about the end of days without cause. No, these are real-world worries, written in the extreme patois of heavy metal and cast with the mild panic of environmentalists, climate scientists, and even civil rights activists. Litany reminds me of Paul Gilding’s The Great Disruption, in which he wonders if emergency can force humanity into grand action, or the glaciologist Jason Box, who proclaimed that we might be, as he infamously put it, ""f’d."" Dead to a Dying World’s roots in punk and metal afford these concerns urgency, while their sophisticated sounds lend it magnetism. When Litany ends, not only do I want to hear it again but I also want to follow its lead, to make some change for the better on behalf of the music—to, as Yeager puts it, ""break away."" Litany paints frightening if not altogether-unfamiliar scenes and asks pressing questions of both them and us, bound to music meant to mirror the complexity and precariousness of the world at large.","The Texas band Dead to a Dying World's second album is a hybrid of doom, black metal, and crust punk, buttressed by baroque classical flourishes and focused on the state of the world and its rather grim prospects.

Tetrachromat EP,Daniel.T.,by: Abigail Garnett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b040b1335d7bf169a0a5/1:1/w_160/0d8d8ee2.jpg,2015-09-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20968-tetrachromat-ep/,Young Adults,"Over the past few years, L.A. has spawned an Internet-friendly coven of young dance producers. The growing label Friends of Friends and its offshoot, Young Adults, have helped shape a loose aesthetic, with the sub-label focusing on a more explicitly niche template of chilled-out, lo-fi house music, providing a home for releases from Suzanne Kraft, Marvin & Guy, and slow-mo house deity Mark E. Their latest release is an EP from Daniel.T., aka Daniel Terndrup, a SoCal house upstart who’s also put out a few promising nu-disco singles as one half of Cosmic Kids. Tetrachromat is his sunniest and most musically varied offering so far, painting the producer as an enthusiastic cultural omnivore. Terndrup’s ear is tuned to a certain feel-good, typically Californian frequency: his favored warm and atmospheric sounds connect him to a nebulous lineage populated by Balearic pop, space disco, and SoCal neo-psychedelia. The EP begins with the warmly burbling ""Mission Hill Morning"", a track that calls to mind the gentle late-aughts disco put out by Oslo label Smalltown Supersound, and concludes with the slightly-too-on-the-nose uke-strumming of ""The Sun & the Sky"", which Terndrup fleshes out with genial whistling and sing-song vocals. It’s PCH music for commuting into the city for parties, a ""Ventura Highway"" for the laptop generation. Wisely, Terndrup places his best track right in the middle. The woozy ""Planetesimal"" features the EP’s heaviest build-up and its biggest payoff, in the form of a giddy, insouciant synthesizer line that cascades over the sounds of sputtering engines like a stretch of Rainbow Road. This is exactly the kind of sound that often gets called colorful, and Terndrup seems to know it—the term ""tetrachromat"" refers to a person who possess an extra cone in the eye, leading to an enhanced ability to see color (a less-than-reliable test for the condition was passed around online earlier this year, after a certain meme got the Internet talking about color perception.) After the warm bubble bath of the first half, the chilly ""Laced"" comes as something of a surprise, though Terndrup incorporates enough equatorial flourishes to suggest a strong connection to the rest of the material. Terndrup’s flexibility with his sound can sometimes project a lack of confidence—the title track, a mellow cloud of contentment disturbed by a wildly ebullient melody, suggests a more restless producer than the EP’s general mood describes. Still, the sense that he has further to go in terms of editing and honing his sound doesn’t detract from his ability to filter a wide range of influences into an appealing and well-crafted aesthetic.","Friends of Friends offshoot Young Adults' latest release is an EP from Daniel.T., a Southern California house upstart who’s put out promising nu-disco singles as one half of Cosmic Kids.

What Went Down,Foals,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b044b1335d7bf169a0ac/1:1/w_160/7d250287.png,2015-09-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20971-what-went-down/,Warner Bros.Transgressive,"Unlike Foals’ two previous albums, What Went Down does not require a drawn-out introduction to explain its intentions. ""Blue Blood"" captured the surprising progression of Total Life Forever in miniature, slowly evolving from the pinging, prickly riffs that defined Antidotes to a cloudbursting crescendo. By 2013's Holy Fire, Foals were a legitimate arena act and acted like they've been there before, hence, the four-minute, crowd-stoking ""Prelude"". At this point, Foals have nothing left to prove—they are a big-ticket rock band until further notice, so the opening title track of What Went Down gets right to it with blunt-force, pitch-shifted riffs and Yannis Philippakis promising that you’re gonna hype him up and make him catch a body like that: ""So don’t step to me kid, you’ll never be found."" The lyrical aggression is curious, but the confidence is warranted—after planning on an extended hiatus after Holy Fire, What Went Down came together in relatively quick fashion after something ""clicked"" during preliminary sessions. No surprise that they’re locked in, as Foals are basically a genre of one at this point. This appears more obvious when you consider the bands who’ve ascended to their level in the UK over the past few years; if they’re not adhering to the most obvious NME-bait lad-rock template, they’re following some kind of obvious precedent. Meanwhile, Foals have mastered an arena-funk hybrid that others have only touched on—post-Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me Cure when they wanted to be silly, latter day Red Hot Chili Peppers when they wanted to be serious. But unlike those bands, Foals aren’t fronted by a self-fashioned icon. The presumptive medley of ""London Thunder"" and ""Lonely Hunter"" find Philippakis jetsetting between gigs and considering the ocean as a reflection of his emotional emptiness, the first time he’s directly addressed what it means to be The Guy in Foals. But while Foals are considered the ""thinking person’s alternative"" to most mainstream UK guitar bands by default, the knuckle-dragging of the title track and ""Snake Oil"" isn’t that much more cerebral than Royal Blood or Drenge. More often, Foals are a ""feeling person’s alternative""—""Mountain at My Gates"" and ""Birch Tree"" are defined by an all-purpose spiritual and/or romantic longing and spacious production, meaning they’re walking the same path as Coldplay ca. X&Y with more pep in their step. What Went Down revels in lurid imagery—love is a gun in Philippakis’ hand, he runs through the streets bloodied from a fistfight, his heart is an old pole dancer and an old black panther. In that regard, What Went Down feels like the completion of an unplanned trilogy—Total Life Forever embraced commitment, Holy Fire yearned for liberation, and this is Philippakis recoiling from the blowback. ""Give It All"" initially comes off like an inert songwriting exercise in lyrical juxtaposition, before Philippakis cleverly twists the title into an ironic burn (""Give me the time but not an age/ Give me the look but not the rage...you give me it all""). But by ""Lonely Hunter"", the tables have turned on Philippakis—he gets lost in foreign cities and makes perfunctory late night calls, only to get back and recognize how it’s not the same as being there (""why must I wait in line for what is mine?""). It’s not a particularly unique viewpoint, though it’s unique in relation to other Foals records. In fact, it’s about the only way to truly distinguish What Went Down from Holy Fire and Total Life Forever. There are superficial differences in aggression—slightly more electronic buzzing, harsher vocals, gristly guitars. It’s Foals’ raw record, but it’s still filet mignon tartare, as raw as you can get when your producer’s two other gigs in 2015 were Florence and the Machine and Mumford & Sons. Otherwise, What Went Down is the latest example of Foals’ uncanny ability to make records whose basic musical trajectory and quality are nearly equal regardless of the band's intentions going in. And What Went Downis their most consistent, steady-handed work yet—the distance between their purest pop moments (""Miami"", ""My Number"") and their opulent ballads (""Spanish Sahara"") has virtually disappeared. It's also significantly less exciting than Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, dynamic records because of their unevenness and ambitious strain—while Foals have realized a sound that's truly their own, they sound far too comfortable in it.","The new Foals LP feels like the completion of an unplanned trilogy—Total Life Forever embraced commitment, Holy Fire yearned for liberation, and this is the band recoiling from the blowback. At this point, Foals have mastered an arena-funk hybrid that others have only touched on.

Beauty Behind the Madness,The Weeknd,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b065b1335d7bf169a0f0/1:1/w_160/99bf5594.jpg,2015-09-02 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20999-beauty-behind-the-madness/,RepublicXO,"""My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual/ She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral,"" Abel Tesfaye sings on ""Tell Your Friends"", a revealing highlight from his second major label album. For anyone following the Weeknd since House of Balloons materialized from the ether in 2011, watching him walk on stage at the VMAs to perform ""Can't Feel My Face""—his first number one hit—certainly felt unusual. Not that the song's success was unpredictable. Co-written by Max Martin, ""Can't Feel My Face"" replaced direct references to Tesfaye's favorite things (cocaine and sex) with PG-13 allusions—a Weeknd song that's fun for the whole family.  It was also the catchiest song of his entire career. Tesfaye's pivot from cult lothario to pop star began last year with a guest verse on Ariana Grande's ""Love Me Harder"". Tesfaye scrapped what writers provided him with and tried his hand at something radio-friendly, and the result was his most likeable verse since the hallowed days of the Trilogy. Then there was ""Earned It"", the theme song for 50 Shades of Grey which introduced him to a whole new audience and put his angelic voice over orchestral pomp—a formula that proved hard to resist, even if the song was kind of icky. With that momentum behind him, Beauty Behind the Madness sees Tesfaye hell-bent on stardom, shedding the fat from his disappointing major label debut, Kiss Land. But instead of going the ""Can't Feel My Face"" route, opening up his sound and softening its edges, he returns to what made him great in the first place. Everything we know about the Weeknd is here: the dark, mysterious production where contemporary R&B rubs elbows with post-punk and shoegaze (Tesfaye's OG producer, Illangelo, is everywhere on it); the lascivious lyrics that swing between menacing and laughable; and, most of all, Tesfaye's sinuous vocal melodies. Developed from a childhood spent listening to Ethiopian music, his labyrinthine hooks and ad-libs are more indelible than ever. The album plays like a victory lap, with Tesfaye revisiting past glories and embellishing them. ""The Hills"", with its disaffected croak and horror-movie screams, sounds like a song from the Thursday mixtape on a Hollywood budget. ""Tell Your Friends"" is like ""The Morning"" produced by Kanye West. ""Shameless"" is ""Wicked Games"" from a more knowing perspective, while ""Angel"" wraps the Weeknd's most epic moments—think ""Heaven or Las Vegas""—in a glossy adult-contemporary framework that could house a Celine Dion song (and written with one of her collaborators, Stephen Moccio). And then there's ""In the Night"", a MJ-esque disco stomper and guaranteed hit single that sounds like nothing he's done before. In moments like this, when Tesfaye harnesses his gift, the results are impossible to argue with. But he's still a victim of his own flawed persona. Tesfaye repeats the tired tropes he's been squeezing the life out of since the beginning (take a shot for every time he offers a variation on ""love is pointless""). ""Acquainted"" and the mind-numbingly boring Ed Sheeran collaboration ""Dark Times"" feel like they were written with Mad Libs, and elsewhere, Tesfaye's cruelly misogynist perspective remains jarring and uncomfortable. Sometimes he's underhanded, like on ""As You Are"", which is one long neg disguised as a tender love song, and other times it's skin-crawlingly direct. Thankfully, he has toned it down somewhat —we're miles away from that time he killed a woman in a music video and let the camera pan over her bloodied body. In the end, enjoying the Weeknd requires a certain suspension of disbelief, and that remains true on Beauty Behind the Madness. You really have to buy into his bad-guy persona, and after four years of this stuff, you might roll your eyes at a chorus like ""I only call you when it's half past five""—we get it. But for newcomers, there's a whole world to explore, and on Beauty Behind the Madness it's richer and smarter than ever. It helps that the self-awareness he's flashed in his interviews has begun creeping slowly into his music. Tesfaye has made a career singing nasty things in a sweet voice, but there are moments on Beauty, like ""Prisoner"",  his soul-searching duet with Lana Del Rey, where he finally sounds like he's engaging with this persona critically, making his audience question themselves for singing along so easily this whole time. ""Tell Your Friends"" reflects on Tesfaye's rise over six crystalline minutes that rank among the best in his career.  The themes are familiar, but his voice carries a new authority, and when he sings ""I'm that nigga with the hair/ Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill,"" at the end of the chorus, there is an audible smile on his face. That song restates Tesfaye's defining duality, reveling in the bacchanalian excess of his lifestyle while keeping a hold on its emptiness. When he wrote songs like ""High for This"" or ""The Morning"", Tesfaye was homeless and barely 20, crashing on couches around Toronto and working at American Apparel. On ""Tell Your Friends"", he's a touring pop star with a number one hit under his belt. He's cruising in the West End in his new Benz, hearing his songs stream out of the Queen Street haunts he used to frequent. He uses ""Tell Your Friends"" to look back, reminding us that he's still the same old guy in the face of all the fame, though some things have changed: back then, in 2011, Cali was his mission. Now, it's the whole world.","On Beauty Behind the Madness, Abel Tesfaye sheds the fat from his disappointing major label debut, Kiss Land. The album plays like a victory lap, with Tesfaye revisiting past glories and embellishing them, and when he harnesses his gift, the results are impossible to argue with.

Versions,Idjut Boys,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb513d197565213a31b/1:1/w_160/ed9bd423.png,2015-09-01 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20875-versions/,Smalltown Supersound,"Each generation comes upon Jamaican dub and its stoned spacetime elasticity in their own way. Twenty-first century dubstep fans might have traced that wobble back to the likes of Jah Shaka’s soundsystem while alternative rock fans in the '90s learned about such music thanks to the likes of Tortoise and the Lee ""Scratch"" Perry cover of Grand Royal. But dance music fans were well aware of the mind-altering properties of dub since the days of disco. While hot singles were on the A-side, club DJs often spun the more adventurous and unfamiliar B-sides for their dancers, as that's where producers like François K., Jellybean Benitez, Walter Gibbons, and Tee Scott (to name just a few) went deep into dub elements on their remixes. And as the '80s emerged, such experiments got higher and wilder, the ideal soundtrack for the wee hours at the Paradise Garage. A great many of these experimental American dubs were compiled by Dimitri from Paris on the heady Night Dubbin’ comp, which boasted an hourlong mix from London's Idjut Boys. Ever since their start in the '90s, the duo of Dan Tyler and Conrad McDonell have deployed heavy dub FX on their mischievous house sides, But when the duo finally got around to their noodly debut album, 2012's Cellar Door, that spacey, playful side of them took a backseat to placid, at times flaccid, instrumentals. Versions, presented now as a complete overhaul and re-imagining of Cellar Door, nudges their Balearic soft rock tendencies back toward their dubby fundamentals, offering drastically warped takes on that underwhelming album. Their dub of two-minute acoustic guitar sketch ""Rabass""—now as ""Ambient Rab""—inverts proportions, the acoustic guitar now swinging in and out of earshot amid copious amounts of delay, with great gobs of bass pushed to the fore. But even at twice the length, it leaves me as unimpressed as the original. Things fare far better on the piano-led ""Kenny Dub Headband"", which isn’t so surprising in that ""One for Kenny"" was already the original album’s standout. The driving piano provided by Norwegian jazz musician Bugge Wesseltoft on the original (named for deceased British DJ Kenny Hawkes) now gets run through all manner of effects, making the Steinway sound monstrous as other details: scratch guitar, handclaps, electric gurgles, and snare drums lurch in and out of the mix. By dilating the track to about twice its length (nearly 10 minutes), it gives the Idjuts an ample playground in which to run wild. The longest track on Versions is the 11-minute ""Another Bird"". But rather than swing wildly like ""Kenny Dub Headband"", this is a more gentle, blissed-out Balearic ride, reminiscent of the Idjuts’ subtle and effective remix of this slow-chugger. Full of guitars arcing towards the horizon, it’s perfect for manning a sailboat at sunset. Or as Phil Sherburne recently put it on a round-up of all things Balearic: ""If you're not full-on levitating by the end, you need to check the settings on your stereo."" ""Going Down""’s dub benefits from a few minutes more than the original, which got diluted by the vocals and guitar. Here the Idjuts accentuate the darker turns that got lost amid the nylon-string strums of the original, but it takes a few minutes before the druggy effects take hold. When it does, they push into a far stranger headspace, the echoed female vocal asking ""Why you going down to hell for love?"" particularly effective. And while the driving beat of ""Love Hunter"" was the previous album’s other highlight, in the dub the duo scale it back by three minutes. In narrowing the space and pushing the hand percussion and all its Echoplexed permutations up in the mix, as well as distorting the guitar into alien timbres, the track tarts to resemble the strange productions of Arthur Russell circa ""Schoolbell / Treehouse"", suggesting yet another world of echo still to be discovered.","London's Idjut Boys, the duo of Dan Tyler and Conrad McDonell, deploy heavy dub FX on their mischievous house sides while their remixes are often rendered in a delicious haze of reverb and delay. Versions nudges their Balearic soft rock tendencies back toward their dubby fundamentals.

Garden City Blues: Detroit’s Jumping Scene 1948-1960,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b013ea9e61561daa657a/1:1/w_160/42263088.jpg,2015-09-01 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20938-garden-city-blues-detroits-jumping-scene-1948-1960/,JSP,"John Lee Hooker’s chugging guitar emerges from a swamp of static. An unidentified pianist interjects simple flourishes barely audible above the din of scratches and scrapes on the acetate. But then Hooker’s voice enters, emphatic and sturdy, weary yet randy as he begs a woman to relieve his sorrows. Her name is illegible (Essie Mae? Ethel May?), but the desire borders on desperation: ""I want you to drive my blues away."" ""Rocks"" is not one of Hooker’s best tunes, but it does project a certain charisma that would later come into greater focus. It’s notable for being one of the first recordings Hooker made after leaving Memphis and arriving in Detroit in the late 1940s, a tenure that would produce some of his most famous hits—including 1948's massive ""Boogie Chillen"". As such, ""Rocks"" is the anchor of a new 4xCD set from the UK label JSP Records, a fanfare that set Detroit blues rolling and tumbling for more than a decade. Hooker was the focal point for the scene, and he gets more than a full disc of tracks—35 in all, a number that reflects both his early arrival in Detroit and his heavy studio schedule. Neil Slaven, the producer and historian who penned the liners for Garden City Blues, sounds almost apologetic about some of his cuts: ""There’s none of the personality in his guitar playing that we came to expect. He’s not helped by a pedestrian pianist even more limited than he was at the time."" Especially compared to Hooker’s most popular hits (many of which were recorded in Detroit yet have been omitted from this compilation), these tracks may sound rudimentary, but together they add up to more than just a prologue to his career. Each one indulges some new whim or tries out some new trick: ""Boogie Woogie"" moves with such an exaggerated strut that even the poor quality of the recording can’t diminish its cocky exuberance, and ""Christmas Time Blues"" slows a jingle-bell melody down to a crawl before disrupting the lament with loud, percussive strums. Hooker comes across as a musician of formidable ability and charisma, so it’s little wonder that he played with most of the other artists on Garden City Blues. Eddie Kirkland was his touring partner, Eddie Burns backed him on harmonica. Obviously they all borrowed from him, just as he no doubt learned a few things from them, but they developed their own styles. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this box set is its range: Detroit obviously encouraged a great deal of variation and innovation, such that the rhythms, the structures, and even the lineups vary from one track to the next and certainly from one artist to the next. Some of these artists provide their own accompaniment, picking on a guitar while stomping on the floor, while others bring in one or two other players. Big Jack Reynolds brings in a full band for his sole track, ""Going Down Slow"", recorded sometime in the early 1960s, and his unidentified drummer takes off in the first measure and turns the song into a pounding proto-garage rocker. That loose parameters of the Detroit scene also permits some entertaining oddities, especially the Richard Brothers’ ""Stolen Property"". Recorded in 1959, it starts as a fairly run-of-the-mill blues number, with the siblings lamenting an unfaithful woman and laying down a jumpy blues riff. Soon, however, they veer into a bit of comic playacting, with one brother playing a pistol-wielding husband and the other a movie-house usher trying to minimize the violence. ""Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please, there’s a man in the inside of the theater with another man’s wife, and HE’S OUTSIDE WITH A .45!"" The whole place empties out in just a few seconds, leaving the brothers to deliver the inevitable punchline. It’s an odd bit of humor—part radio play, part vaudeville routine—but nearly 60 years after its creation, it works as a winking parody of the violence so often described in blues lyrics. Despite its subtitle, Garden City Blues doesn’t really chronicle a scene so much as it documents a transitional period in blues history. The early and mid-20th century saw millions of African-Americans leaving mostly agrarian jobs in the South for the promise of work at factories in Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, and other areas thriving in the new industrial era. The Great Migration coincided with great leaps in recording technology, and blues musicians began to gravitate toward electric guitars. This was industrial music before it became a rock subgenre—before rock itself was even a genre—and the new sounds allowed players to do things in urban venues that had been unimaginable in the farmland juke joints many of them had left behind. The shift from acoustic to electric wasn’t instantaneous, but gradual. It took years for ideas to develop and conventions to gel, and the music collected on Garden City Blues documents that period of transition, when old styles and methods mingled with new. As such, the set may not be the best point of entry for anyone unfamiliar with what led to this music and what followed it. (For primers, either of Smithsonian Folkways’ Classic Blues comps is recommended, as is the 1992 box set Chess Blues.) But there is still a great deal to discover and appreciate here: spirited performances depicting a lively city that prized jumpy grooves, idiosyncratic swagger, and dogged innovation above all else.","This 4xCD set offers a look at mid-20th century Detroit blues, anchored by a generous selection of rarities by John Lee Hooker.

Fake Palms,Fake Palms,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b046c0084474cd0c1bfe/1:1/w_160/4f2f7a8b.png,2015-09-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20972-fake-palms/,Buzz,"There are no real palm trees in Toronto, but the city is seeing an uptick in tiki bars—the sort of bamboo-lined spaces with enough beach-scene murals and evergreen faux-fronds to make you think you’ve stepped into a Tahitian resort (at least after you’ve downed four flaming mai tais). But while scuzz-covered Toronto rockers Fake Palms hardly seem like the types to be strategically capitalizing on boutique cocktail trends, band founder Michael le Riche seems well familiar with the sensation of being caught between the world in which he exists and the one he wishes to inhabit. Le Riche represents a bridge between divergent Toronto indie rock narratives. His former band, the Darcys, were signed to Broken Social Scene’s Arts & Crafts imprint, and, prior to a lineup shake-up last year that’s cast the group’s future in doubt, were being groomed as the label’s next-gen art-rock lynchpins. But with his new full-time concern, le Riche takes a detour down the burning-embered trail blazed by local art-punk heroes Metz to join the freak scene at Buzz Records, whose name is as reflective of the label’s rising profile as its raucous roster’s overheated amplifiers. And yet, even as Fake Palms has evolved from le Riche’s bedroom recording project to a veritable Toronto underground supergroup (with Lane Halley of Hooded Fang on second guitar, Burning Love’s Patrick Marshall on bass, and long-time Slim Twig associate Simone TB on drums), the band’s self-titled debut still bears an intensely claustrophobic quality. Le Riche isn’t so much stepping out into the spotlight as fortifying the walls around him, finding sanctuary in noise. Fake Palms are, fundamentally, a dream-pop band that plays with garage-punk aggression, subjecting pristine pop songs to bruising beatings. For them, distortion isn’t a weapon, but the inevitable consequence of a stringent, Dogme 95-worthy approach to recording that emphasizes live-off-the-floor authenticity and forbids overdubs. The in-the-red interaction of le Riche and Halley’s gleaming guitar lines, Marshall’s rhythmic rumble, and Simone’s thwack attack has produced a naturally corroding effect, as if all the sound bouncing off the studio walls formed a storm system that soaked the recordings in static. That shrouding effect can make it hard to grasp exactly what le Riche is trying to express, though the underpinning ennui is easy enough to parse. On the hard-charging opener ""Fever Dream"", the only easily decipherable words are ""my friends""—repeated at the top of each increasingly inscrutable verse line—but they’re delivered with enough audible distress to suggest le Riche is ready to ditch them. The few other soundbites on the album that emerge from le Riche’s foggy cloud of a voice—""I’m not here/ I never was,"" ""Where did my life go/ It’s on the ground,"" ""I need a change""—suggest the singer is trying to retreat from the world even as his band is trying to thrust him to the frontlines. This tug-of-war tension permeates the songs’ very structural DNA, constantly yielding surprising shifts: the deceptively upbeat twinkle of ""Sun Drips"" dissolves into a stalking, slow-motion krautrock strut; the wistful, melancholic verses of ""Melatonin"" are upended by a stomping, storming midsection powered by a twinned guitar line that sounds like broken glass—sparkling yet dangerously jagged. But if Fake Palms’ obfuscating approach threatens to pummel more outwardly melodic, mid-tempo turns like ""Estate"" into sluggish sludge, the pin-pricked riffs of disco-not-disco thumper ""Sparkles"" and ""YTMATLDPH"" poke holes for their fetching ""ooh wee ooh"" falsetto hooks to waft through, like steam rising out of the punctured cellophane film on a microwave TV dinner. Though these songs date back to 2011, Fake Palms has the slight misfortune of emerging mere months after Viet Cong showed us how you can translate similar inputs—goth-schooled brooding, shoegaze haze, needling post-hardcore guitars—into something more expansive and emotionally direct. The structural intricacies and melodic integrity of this otherwise raw recording suggest le Riche is capable of pulling off something similarly bold. But for now, Fake Palms’ ocean-sized ambitions are confined to a grimy fish tank.","Toronto's Fake Palms are, fundamentally, a dream-pop band that plays with garage-punk aggression. Here, Fake Palms has evolved from Michael le Riche’s bedroom recording project to a veritable Toronto underground supergroup, with contributions from members of Hooded Fang, Burning Love, and Slim Twig.

Cranekiss,Tamaryn,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b050ea9e61561daa65dc/1:1/w_160/376ded24.jpg,2015-09-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20981-tamaryn-cranekiss/,Mexican Summer,"Tamaryn’s Cranekiss is a big step for the project, a move out of the denser shoegaze thickets of Tender New Signs and The Waves into a pure, sugary dream-pop world. It features the kind of glossy production made popular in the 1980s and '90s by John Fryer of This Mortal Coil in his myriad productions for 4AD, Mute, and Beggars Banquet—Cocteau Twins, Xmal Deutschland, Clan of Xymox, Chapterhouse. Tamaryn herself is the only constant between her past two albums and this one, changing instrumental personnel (here she works with Shaun Durkan of Weekend) and production credits (Jorge Elbrecht of Violens, who has also worked with Ariel Pink and No Joy) from her previous incarnation. No longer competing for sonic space with a heavy wash of guitar, Tamaryn’s voice, even drenched in reverb, becomes the focus. There are serious pop hooks on this record—opener ""Cranekiss"" has a chorus that will alight inside your skull, flutter its wings a bit, and set to making a nest—and her voice sounds much less constrained, more ebullient and full, than on previous recordings. Many of the songs on Cranekiss are about uncompromising female desire from varying perspectives (the first single ""Hands All Over Me"" and ""Softcore"", which samples both porn simulacra of female orgasms and the peep show scene from Paris, Texas, stand out), a joyous thing in and of itself, and the theme of Cranekiss overall seems to be freedom, expansion, exploration. There are moments when Cranekiss seems a little too hewn to the '80s and '90s ethereal/goth sound it’s an obvious homage to—the sonic Cocteau Twins references throughout the first half of the record can sound a little heavy-handed, and any of the tracks would have fit in seamlessly on the classic Hyperium Records Heavenly Voices compilation. There is value in exploring the particular styles that made you fall head-over-heels for music in the first place, though, and while Cranekiss hardly breaks new ground it has a sense of playfulness to it, a sort of sparkling and infectious enthusiasm. Tamaryn has said that making this album was a ""very, very pleasurable, inspiring, fun experience unlike anything I’ve ever done before,"" and that’s palpable upon hearing it. Amid all the swirl and shimmer, there are some tracks that feel more rooted—""Fade Away Slow"", a goth taffy-pull of a song near the close of the album, probably has the most low end on an album that likes to pull away from the earth overall. It unwinds deliciously, unpeeling layers of itself to nearly break down before spinning into a lovely bridge and a recall chorus. Because some of the tracks are so airy, a call down to close out the record, like closing out a ritual, seems like a necessary respite. Cranekiss firmly establishes Tamaryn’s pop songwriting chops. It also indicates a willingness to play with new instrumentation—the synths, drum triggers, and sampling are all new to Tamaryn's palette—and a willingness to play with established style and form. It's a beautiful, heavily textured, highly sensual record, heady sugar on the tongue.","Tamaryn's new album moves from the denser shoegaze thickets of Tender New Signs and The Waves into a pure, sugary dream-pop world.

Invite the Light,Dâm-Funk,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b018ea9e61561daa6581/1:1/w_160/c16452a0.jpeg,2015-09-01 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20943-invite-the-light/,Stones Throw,"If history has taught us anything about the funk, it’s that the funk is a cyclical thing. Its powers and influence ebb and flow in waves; over the years, funk has ridden out these changes with an easygoing grace, confident in the fact that any low period will be inevitably followed by a swing back up. Right now we’re living in an especially strong time for funk–in fact, it should go down as one of the highest points in funk history. And like the other times like this in the past, we have California to thank for it. Funk’s current comeback has been rumbling out of L.A. since the end of the last decade. There was the Brainfeeder crew breaking hip-hop’s increasingly mechanized mold in order to reconnect it with the cosmic slop that helped birth it. A generation of young rappers that grew up during the city’s gangsta-rap heyday (many of them aligned with Black Hippy and TDE) began preparing for the return of g-funk 20 years after it first developed. Somewhere off to the side, Dâm-Funk began creating massive beats whose invocations of past masters like Roger Troutman and Egyptian Lover underlined Cali’s prominent place in funk’s lineage. Only in the past year or so has it become entirely clear that these aren’t isolated cases, but one immense upswell, as artists from across these different scenes released a string of records that reflected a new level of skill, including Flying Lotus’ You’re Dead!, Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, and Thundercat’s The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam. With Invite the Light, Dâm-Funk’s joined them. Dâm’s always been one of the spacier of funk’s new prophets, which, considering how far-out that whole scene is, is a major accomplishment. He’s always seemed uninterested in making his creative impulses fit in any kind of box, so his records tend to range from relatively straightforward, pop-compatible stuff into more abstract territory hovering in an ambiguous space between funk, electro, and experimental electronic music. Invite the Light is proof that Dâm-Funk’s leveled up on both sides of the equation–the pop stuff’s poppier, and the weird stuff’s more intriguingly weird. On the opening track, former Ohio Player Junie Morrison delivers a staticky distress call from some dystopian time where the funk’s been extinguished and humanity suffers because of it. What follows is a megaton funk bomb that would be more than sufficient to set this alternate universe straight. In his intro, Morrison says that he ""cannot tell you the exact time, day, or year"" that he’s broadcasting from, because humankind’s given up keeping track. Invite the Light’s got the same kind of temporal ambiguity running through it. Dâm-Funk has a particular soft spot for the peak of funk’s analog electronic era (bookended roughly by ""More Bounce to the Ounce"" and ""Egypt, Egypt""), but he seems to be drawing his inspiration here from funk in its entirety. Some of these songs are the catchiest and most direct Dâm’s ever produced, and they all go about it in distinctly different ways. ""We Continue"" has a Zapp-ish electro bass bump, but the synth pads, twinkling pianos, and multitracked vocals layered on top impart a breezy disco buoyancy that suggests matching satin outfits and choreographed dance moves. ""Somewhere, Someday"", meanwhile, has the same sparkle as the soulful midtempo bubblegum Prince makes when he’s not feeling tortured. Even when Dâm gets further out, the album holds together. ""The Hunt and Murder of Lucifer"", as the title suggests, is a deeply tripped out, bloody-sounding instrumental with leads shared by a nastily buzzing bass part and an icier, pitch-bent synth that throws off all kinds of unsettling discordant frequencies when the two combine. And his Ariel Pink collaboration ""Acting"" is such potently blissed-out psychedelia that you’re likely to catch a contact high just listening to it. At its best, Invite the Light manages to bring together Dâm-Funk’s wilder, more experimental side with his newly refined pop side to produce not just some of the strongest material he’s ever made, but some of the strongest material to arise out of the current funk boom. ""HowUGonFu*kAroundAndChooseABusta'?"" comes near the middle of the album, and it feels like the track that everything else revolves around. From different angles, it resembles Snoop when he was trying to sound like George Clinton, or Prince when he was trying to sound like a rapper, or Outkast when they were trying to sound like Prince. Taken as a whole, though, it’s unmistakably new and unique, and it'll make you thankful that we get to live in a world where funk exists.","Dâm-Funk has always been one of the spacier of funk’s new prophets, which, considering how far-out that whole scene is, is a major accomplishment.

M,Myrkur,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8db1335d7bf1699f6b/1:1/w_160/9bdc7e81.jpg,2015-08-31 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20833-m/,Relapse,"Myrkur steps confidently from the shadows on M, the full-length debut from the polarizing black metal project of Danish singer and bandleader Amalie Bruun. Late in 2014, Myrkur emerged with a self-titled debut EP clouded in and catapulted by mystery. Hyperbolically billed by Relapse Records as ""a wholly unique perspective on the genre,"" the seven songs webbed haunting, seraphic singing around tremolo guitars and primitive, rumbling drums. The conceit was intriguing, but the songs were unevenly built, with parts that never quite became a complete puzzle and a force that felt mitigated by some sycophantic need for second-wave credibility. Still, even (especially?) people who dismissed the songs demanded to know just who the unnamed creator of the one-woman black metal band was, a process that begot pernicious conspiracy theories and comment threads devoted to ferretting out the singer and connections that would make her a little less kvlt. Bruun, indeed, had worked as a pop singer and half of an indie rock band signed to Fat Possum, biographical talking points that inspired ire. Days before the EP arrived, Relapse confirmed that Mykur did, indeed, belong to Bruun, setting off another wave of debate about whether or not the anonymity had been a mere promotional ploy. The hubbub was more interesting and accomplished than the music that inspired it, a distraction from the real reason anyone should or should not have been talking about Myrkur. But on M, Bruun is free and clear of any identity drama—and a much more convincing bandleader for it. Myrkur’s animating idea remains much the same on M: Add Bruun’s beautiful voice to brutal metal outbursts, and offset serrated black metal screams with contemplative piano or vocal interludes. This time, though, Bruun has sealed many of the foundational cracks in her compositions and owned the audacity of the project and the form at large. She recruited Ulver mastermind Garm as the co-producer, alongside a rhythm section comprising members of Mayhem and Nidingr and a cadre of horns and stringed instruments endemic to Norway and Iceland. They reinforce these songs, adding flourishes that are both striking and subtle and delivering an instrumental aplomb that Myrkur initially avoided. These songs feel unabashed and fully rendered, neither limited by the codex of a hidebound genre or hindered by the need to prove too much at once. Rather than recede from public view following a sometimes-uncomfortable start, Bruun has pushed Myrkur into the spotlight of big, bright production—a kiss-off to cynical kvlt critics that doubles as a convenient invitation of accessibility. On Myrkur, the relationship between the songs’ varied aspects—the choral singing, the piano pieces, the relentless browbeaters—seemed casual at best, facets of a project that Bruun had not yet fit together. But M works as an album of interconnected miniature arcs, with many songs following the same structure. Bruun flexes here, too: In the past, and throughout much of M, she has meted out her harsh vocals, judiciously scattering them for dramatic emphasis or as textural undercurrents. But on ""Mordet"", the most direct evidence of her increased ambition, she foregoes clean vocals altogether for the first time in her catalog. Her grim voice webbed with echo, she sounds as though she’s hunting an evil tail through the search-and-destroy maze of guitars, drums, and noise. If only for four minutes, she escapes her predictable comfort zone of hard-and-soft counterbalance, becoming the heavy metal force that her past has only suggested. At its most compelling, black metal pits the impossible grandeur of the world against its harsh natural realities. It’s a big, vivid vision, where battles between heroes and villains, the dark and the light, the past and the present come into ecstatic conflict. It’s become so stylized and specific, though, that some of that spirit can often be lost in rote genre exercises or aggressively experimental attempts to re-contextualize it. From the start, it was clear that Myrkur wanted to recapture the essence of those competing forces and the tension they produced. That prospect was always more enticing than who she was or who she wasn’t. At last, Myrkur’s music has started to bear out that promise and to rise above the gossip about her pedigree.","Myrkur steps confidently from the shadows on M, the full-length debut from the polarizing black metal project of Danish singer and bandleader Amalie Bruun.

Automaginary,Bitchin BajasNatural Information Society,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b037c0084474cd0c1be7/1:1/w_160/b2aeb13a.jpg,2015-08-31 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20959-automaginary/,Drag City,"It would be tough to find a more cosmically inspired pairing than Natural Information Society and Bitchin Bajas. So, it’s a happy coincidence that both happen to reside in Chicago. Natural Information Society is a shifting collective led by bassist, composer, and improviser Joshua Abrams. A long-time presence in the Chicago jazz and experimental music community, he's spent the past five years releasing albums—including Natural Information, Represencing, and the recent double LP Magnetoception—that have concentrated on meditative, pulse-driven music. Rather than a traditional upright or electric bass, on these records Abrams favors a three-stringed North African lute called a guimbri. The instrument’s percussive but rubbery tone provides a foundation for fluid and hypnotic embellishments on percussion, guitar, autoharp, and harmonium. Lead by Cooper Crain—of Chicago-based krautrock revivalists, Cave—Bitchin Bajas’ music draws inspiration from the minimalist and new age records of the late '60s and '70s. On last year’s Bitchin Bajas and this year’s Transporteur EP, the group crafted patient and serene zone-out music that made heavy use of vintage synthesizers and tape loops. As a collaboration, Automaginary flatters both parties. Bajas’ music often relies on the embellishment of looped phrases, be they short keyboard figures, guitar riffs, or abstract sounds. Working with an improvising ensemble allows the band—represented here by Crain, Dan Quinlivan, and Rob Frye—the chance to operate in a more dynamic setting. Throughout the compositions musicians drop in and out, switch melodies, or shuffle the phrasing of their riffs, allowing the music to feel organic and alive in a way that’s tough to replicate with a static loop. In turn, Natural Information Society’s scope is expanded through Bajas’ tastefully curated collection of old keyboards, whose hazy tones reinforce the music’s airy and meditative sensibility. On the nearly 20-minute drone opener, ""On No Fade"", bowed upright bass tones slowly give way to humming keyboards and piano flourishes. The music is melodic, but never in a concrete or hummable sense and while it gradually increases in density, the band avoids a clear climax. It’s very peaceful listening. The subsequent compositions are more in line with Abrams’ recent records. The guimbri is at the center of the music, providing a pulse to guide the other musicians. The music grooves, but never quickens—maintaining a steady and consistent energy throughout. There are no solos and while the players wander and evolve their lines, they always remain in complementary positions to one another. Bajas and Abrams both find serenity amid perceived stasis—making music that sounds repetitive, but is constantly undergoing subtle scene shifts and mutations. More than that, both make music that sounds strangely timeless. The lack of complex harmony helps to diffuse Abrams’ relationship to much modern jazz and while Bajas' music pays homage to a certain group of composers, those musicians were looking back toward even older traditions. Automaginary works because both excel at making music that feels thoroughly modern, but also ancient.","Natural Information Society is a shifting collective led by bassist, composer, and improviser Joshua Abrams, and they turn out to be the perfect collaborators for the drifting, new age-inspired Bitchin Bajas.

Dornik,Dornik,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b03fea9e61561daa65c3/1:1/w_160/cbb511e3.png,2015-08-31 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20967-dornik/,PMR,"Jessie Ware might seem an unlikely tastemaker: an artist who exemplifies hushed, unshowy restraint, unassuming craft over buzz. So it only makes sense that the colleagues she has attracted work in a similarly low key. Her labelmates on PMR Records include producer Julio Bashmore, who’s quietly become an innovator in a genre full of professional Xeroxers; Jai Paul, who’s known for compelling music that’s barely released; and Dornik Leigh, Ware’s tour drummer, who’s since embarked on a solo career as languidly paced as his music. Lead single ""Something About You"" came out in 2013 and already sounded timeless, or more precisely out of time: lovelorn neo-soul that shimmers like a late-summer mirage. Subsequent singles ""Drive"" and ""Stand in Your Line"" were much the same, and two years later, Leigh’s proper debut *Dornik—*named for his parents, Dorothy and Nick—already sounds lived-in. It’s hard to hear about Dornik without soon after hearing about his resemblance to Michael Jackson. The comparison is fair—Dornik, like many, idolizes the King of Pop, and does resemble Michael vocally, albeit a less hysteric, more quavery version. (And hey, Dornik is a more compelling idea of Michael x 2015 than Xscape was.) Because Dornik makes sumptuously arty R&B, he also gets the Big Three R&B Comparisons almost every time: Frank Ocean, the Weeknd, and Miguel, none of whom he is anything like. Better comparisons might be Maxwell circa BLACKsummer’s night, or Dev Hynes, or mid-'90s Sade and Everything But the Girl, or for that matter Ware herself. Often, Dornik evokes the brooding side of early-'90s R&B: the cascading-waterfall SFX, reverbed woodwinds, and fuzzy guitar that appear throughout, the haze of synth pads that hangs over most of the album, Dornik’s preference for retrofuturist sounds over modern. All this moodiness is in service of something specific: Dornik rivals E•MO•TION for the year’s most crushed-out album; it’s as if Ware’s ""Imagine It Was Us"" was an entire album of longing bliss. ""Blush"" is full of little synth twinkles and dazed guitar tumbles that sound like smiles creeping upon a lover’s face. ""Mountain"" is an uncannily accurate reproduction of the feeling of lying side-by-side with someone in a meadow by a quarry. ""Stand in Your Line"" might have been an insufferable friend-zone lament from another artist (""I joke and call you my girl, then you smile and you laugh and you call me your boyfriend—oh, if this were true""), but Dornik offers a vocal earnest enough and an arrangement luxuriant enough to hush any complaints. Even the more combative tracks sound as if an hour or kind word would sweep him right back into a swoon. The lyrics rarely transcend pillow talk, but it hardly matters; Dornik leaves the poetry to the arrangements. All this makes Dornik easy to get lost in—and also, to lose track of. Extending ""Imagine It Was Us"" to album length is an amazing idea in theory, but in practice hypnotic becomes narcotic. The sequencing is curious: singles toward the end, midtempo mood pieces toward the front; it makes otherwise sumptuous tracks sound samey, and when Dornik tries to inject levity (the singsong ""Chain Smoke""), it makes for a jolting, unwelcome distraction. In a way, though, even this fits: the album’s like a fog one can drift in and out of for however many exquisite minutes. There are points in summer and in love when nothing else will do.","Because Dornik makes sumptuously arty R&B, he gets compared to Frank Ocean, the Weeknd, and Miguel, none of whom he is anything like.

Pickpocket’s Locket,Frog Eyes,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb613d197565213a31f/1:1/w_160/0121a924.jpg,2015-08-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20876-pickpockets-locket/,Paper Bag,"The past three years have brought a great deal of grief and uncertainty into Carey Mercer's life and music, but these days, the singer and songwriter's demeanor possesses a kind of aloof geniality. In concert, he seems just as content to talk and joke as play, like a charismatic acquaintance regaling you with stories at slightly uncomfortable length. In the muted and gently loping songs on his band Frog Eyes' latest LP, Pickpocket's Locket, too, Mercer playfully mulls over a couple of musical ideas rather than pushing past them quickly or distending them quickly into cracked-mirror reflections of themselves. The approach would have been quite different just a few years ago. The tremulous, haunted tenor of the early 2000s—or for that matter, the percussive, histrionic assaults of  2004's The Folded Palm, or the breathy, epic-poetic narration of Tears of the Valedictorian and *Paul's Tomb: A Triumph—*is a far cry from the more polite and conversational parlance of this album. Pickpocket's Locket’s finds Frog Eyes sounding almost muzzled: The drums are hit with brushes and felt-tipped mallets, the guitars and bass are often acoustic, and a lot of the prime sonic real estate is taken up by bright piano chording and string arrangements from Mercer's erstwhile bandmate and former roommate —Spencer Krug of Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown, and Moonface. Mercer’s vocal is dry and up front, speaking colloquially, and just from the padded studio room instead of from a mountaintop created by delay or cathedral-like reverb. Despite the record's deliberate transparency of production style, though, the musical structures are as hard to parse as they have ever been; the high dramatics and longform organization of earlier, heavier records feels more intuitive, while it can be pretty difficult to determine where verses and chorus begin and end here. This element of the album points to why—despite his close association with consummate ""songwriter"" types Dan Bejar and Krug —Mercer's work calls for a different mode of listening, more like one would use with avant-garde music. Its surface-level structural complexity can add up to a net overarching simplicity, if one hears it first as an inchoate whole before worrying about picking it apart. Eventually, the important musical phrases distinguish themselves; in Mercer's case, in any song, a few distinguishing paeans create signposts. ""Death Ship""s dense, ""Thunder Road""-paced libretto is filled with sneered, ear-catching lines like ""I floated to the New York on the back of a log"" and ""A man shot in the hand from indiscreet fire"" which serve as organizational dividers. The ecstatic closer ""Rip Down the Fences That Fence the Garden"" is built around several belted and bright melodic phrases—""In the dawn, by the river I shall swaddle my wrath!"" The goal in these lyrics is preserving attractive sibilance and meter at least as much as cosmic suggestion. Still, there are powerful shadows of meaning. Pecking at the edges of Mercer's neo-Modernist poetry are images of seediness and criminality— political corruption (""Crystal Blip""), lechery (""Two Girls""), and betrayal (""Rejoinders in a Storm""). But even the darkest moments feel perversely comic; the album lacks, certainly, the staring-into-the-abyss ruminations on mortality and human cruelty of previous releases. In these clearer sections, Pickpocket's Locket proves itself to be increasingly rewarding upon repeated listens, but it still fails to deliver anything particularly remarkable. All of its component gestures can be found on other Mercer projects. The restrained sound palette resembles parts of FE's Carey's Cold Spring, the poppier moments recall Mercer's contributions to Swan Lake, and heavy piano work also anchors excellent Frog Eyes records Valedictorian and 2003’s The Golden River. The main distinguishing feature here is Krug’s string arrangements, but disappointingly, these can feel childishly simple and precious in the same, borderline irritating way as the heavy counterpoint in Krug's own solo work—see the layered, scalar instrumental melodies on Sunset Rubdown’s last two albums, in particular. At their best, Krug's charts here lend Mercer's more modest songs a baroque quality, reminiscent of the modest string work on records like John Cale's Paris 1919 or Robert Wyatt's Shleep (see, in particular, the effective, wry figures in ""The Beat Is Down""). Mercer has long been someone worth keeping up with in indie rock; his voice has, since his early recording, been commanding, immutable, and seemingly impervious to trends. Fans have grown with the subtle changes in his mode of attack, and given the specificity of his style, sometimes it's easy to overlook the significant ways his approach has drifted since his formative releases. It's startling to realize Pickpocket’s Locket is the odd Carey Mercer release you can almost mellow out to. Once you delve deeper than the pleasant aesthetic, however, it's hard not to wish for a few more distinguishing moments to hold onto.","Pickpocket's Locket finds Frog Eyes sounding almost muzzled—it's a quieter, toned-down version of the band. But despite the record's deliberate transparency of production style, the musical structures are as hard to parse as they have ever been.

Stuff Like That There,Yo La Tengo,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b043b1335d7bf169a0aa/1:1/w_160/c3f495d8.png,2015-08-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20970-stuff-like-that-there/,Matador,"Yo La Tengo were essentially the first on-demand music-streaming service. Through the eclectic all-request sets they used to perform for WFMU’s annual fundraising drive and, more recently, their annual Hanukkah shows at Maxwell’s in Hoboken, the band has amassed an infinite jukebox of cover songs spanning golden oldies to underground oddities. It’s almost as if Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley started this band so that they could one day be the sort of tastemaking entity that can rescue forgotten songs from dollar-bin obscurity or subject popular ones to a critical reassessment. But while it’s customary for indie-rock acts to approach bygone pop hits with subversive intent, Yo La Tengo never sound like they’re taking the piss, preferring to acclimatize themselves to the original material’s natural habitat rather than try to radically change the song’s context. And yet, whether they’re covering Sun Ra or Sonny Bono, Yo La Tengo covers sound unmistakably like Yo La Tengo songs, because they serve the exact same function as the band’s best originals: they’re intimate exchanges, the sound of secrets being revealed. And as Yo La Tengo’s latest covers-heavy set attests, that quality becomes all the more amplified when those exchanges are rendered as whispers. Given Yo La Tengo’s well-established karaoke-machine rep, the arrival of acoustic-oriented covers collection Stuff Like That There isn’t as revelatory as their previous acoustic-oriented covers collection, 1990’s Fakebook, which opened up a new dimension to what had then been a pretty straight-forward, scrappy rock band (a primitive state they revisited on 2009’s all-electric complement, Fuckbook, credited to their garage-punk alter ego, the Condo Fucks.) But Stuff Like That There makes perfect sense in the wake of 2009’s Popular Songs and 2013’s Fade, which displayed a gradual drift away from the band’s feedback-blasted extendo-jams toward succinct, small-scale statements. Though the album's sources range from '40s country to '60s soul to '90s alt-rock, the execution here is uniform, all brushed-snare rhythms, tasteful twang, and gentle acoustic strums that permeate the air like a late-afternoon drizzle. The readings are low-key and reverential, but the spirit is loose and playful. The Hubley-led versions of Darlena McCrea’s swooning 1964 single “My Heart’s Not In It”, Hank Williams’ tear-in-beer standard “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry”, and The Parliaments’ psych-soul serenade “I Can Feel the Ice Melting” manage to feel on point and off the cuff at the same time, as if the band were pulling precious seven-inches from their protective sleeves and not giving a fuck if they get scratched. But Stuff Like That There is not just another excuse for Yo La Tengo to show off their encyclopedic knowledge of pop history. At this stage of their career, it also serves as a poignant reminder of the ’80s and ’90s indie-rock peers who never achieved the same level of success, like Louisville contemporaries/collaborators Antietam (a faithfully reproduced “Naples”), Hoboken hero the Special Pillow (the charming, harmony-rich “Automatic Doom”), and R.E.M.-esque Ohio outfit Great Plains, whose jagged ‘n’ jangly anthem “Before We Stop to Think” is given a beautifully wounded reading by Kaplan. By contrast, the album’s lone concession to popular taste—Hubley’s wistful take on the Cure’s atypically sunny 1992 single “Friday I’m in Love”—feels out of place amid the record-collector finds and personal connections that inform the bulk of the tracklist, coming off instead like a novelty that just isn’t novel enough (not to mention a distant second in the pantheon of Cure covers by A-list American indie-rock power trios). Of course, it wouldn’t be a Yo La Tengo covers album without the band covering themselves. But while the trio is notorious for radically redressing its droning noise-rock odysseys as lilting lullabies and vice versa (often trading Kaplan’s voice for Hubley’s in the process), the rustic redrafts of Popular Songs’ “All Your Secrets” and Electr-o-Pura deep cut “The Ballad of Red Buckets” don’t differ all that much from their official takes—the amplifier settings may be adjusted a touch downward, but the essential vibe remains. The major exception is a tiptoed pass through I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One’s swirling centerpiece “Deeper Into the Movies”, though unlike Yo La’s previous loud-to-quiet transitions (like the ambient “Big Day Coming” that opens Painful, or Camp Yo La Tengo’s skiffled take on “Tom Courtenay”) it feels less like a wholesale rethink than a rough sketch that makes you long for the surging force of the original. Thankfully, Yo La Tengo compensate for the superfluousness of these self-covers with two top-notch new tracks: The excellent “Rickety” continues the motorik momentum of Fade standout “Stupid Things”, with the band sounding like buskers on the shoulder lane of the Autobahn, while Kaplan’s “Awhileaway” is a gorgeous moonlit stroll of a ballad. Stuff Like That There may not always intrigue on a track-by-track basis, but, taken as a whole, the record stands as a loving portrait of Yo La Tengo’s vast musical and social universe condensed into a small wooden frame. And at a time when the full-album experience is giving way to the almighty playlist, Stuff Like That There handily reasserts Yo La Tengo’s reputation as indie rock’s consummate curators. Your music subscription service of choice may present you with a hundred different mood-based mixes to complement Sunday-morning sloth, but Stuff Like That There is really the only one you need for a day spent lazing away in your little corner of the world.","An acoustic-leaning covers collection in the vein of 1990’s Fakebook, Stuff Like That There finds Yo La Tengo tackling songs by the Cure and Hank Williams along with a number of obscurities, and also finds them re-working some of their own material.

Music for Dogs,Gardens & Villa,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b042c0084474cd0c1bf5/1:1/w_160/a5f19464.png,2015-08-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20969-music-for-dogs/,Secretly Canadian,"Gardens & Villa are a synthpop band stuck in an existential funk, and we have the Internet to blame. ""[We’re] feeling too connected and yet at the end of the day, disconnected from everything/everyone,"" frontman Chris Lynch recently told Noisey, ""feeling like our modern lives are starting to resemble a sci-fi world."" At this point in their career, the L.A.-via-Santa Barbara group have managed to carve out a psych-ier niche to set them aside from, say, Phantogram, but they’ve got a synthpop reputation nonetheless. The conflict between technological innovation and organic artistry is a given in modern music, but for digitally-reliant acts like Gardens & Villa, the tug-of-war presents a identity crisis. On their new album Music for Dogs, the band grapple with these 21st-century woes but fail to clinch victory. Lynch and company have framed Music For Dogs as the playful, punkish cousin to last year’s similarly anxious Dunes, with guitars and piano that temporally situate the record somewhere on the cusp of the '80s (the lush art-pop of Brian Eno and Roxy Music are the most obvious musical touchstones). Indeed, Music for Dogs sounds more kinetic than past efforts, thanks to the group's incorporation of light-footed, plunky pianos (""Express"") and ever-so-mathy bridges (""Everybody""). At the same time, there’s a lukewarm quality to the jams (which, despite three- and four-minute runtimes, sound twice as long): the guitars are thin, the drum beats flimsy, the vocals frequently obfuscated by a droning synth or a similar effect. It’s as though Ben Folds attempted to create to Eno's Here Come the Warm Jets while under the influence of sleeping pills. Considering their previous revelations regarding the album’s reactionary origins, it should come as no surprise that Gardens & Villa get more introspective on Music for Dogs. Crushing loneliness and urban ennui loom overhead like storm clouds—a compelling thematic juxtaposition against the manic singsongs of ""Jubilee"" and ""Everybody"". Frequently, these themes manifest in the form of dark, moody new wave. ""Alone in the City"" contextualizes a scene of Los Angelean longing in the terms of Tears for Fears, and ""Maximize Results"" sounds like Boy George having a panic attack. Midway through the album on ""General Research"", Lynch turns the mirror on us, lamenting the various ways in which technology has torn art (and life, for that matter), asunder… or something like that. His lines are meant to scan as introspective and metaphorical, but clunkers like ""Working for the blogs/ Searching for the savior/ Music for the malls"" and ""Vaporizing cigarettes/ Reverential productions/ Following down the rabbit hole"" transmogrify any earnestness into hilarity. Gardens & Villa’s self-conscious, spindling attempts at regression and societal contemplation are admirable and occasionally catchy, but there are so many other albums*—Reflektor, Kid A*, even the oft-maligned, ahead-of-its-time *Metal Machine Music—*that navigate the intricacies of technology and society more compellingly and less heavy-handedly that you can’t help but write it off as another brick in the firewall.","The Santa Barbara synthpop group Gardens & Villa are stuck in an existential funk.

Desire Will Rot,Fuck the Facts,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af52b1335d7bf1699f0e/1:1/w_160/458ea51b.png,2015-08-21 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20790-desire-will-rot/,Noise Salvation,"If you'd walked up to even the most ardent extreme metal fan in 1987 and posed the question ""How far do you think this music can go?"" chances are you'd have gotten a blank stare in response. At that time, Napalm Death, Carcass, Unseen Terror, and others had significantly upped heavy metal's ante by combining thrash and death metal with hardcore, crust- and anarcho-punk at inhumanly fast tempos to create what would eventually come to be known as grindcore. This new movement represented a kind of logical endpoint beyond which it seemed impossible to push. After all, how could music get any heavier than the unremitting abrasion of Napalm Death's first two in-studio appearances on the John Peel show? So, as much as this music shook up existing boundaries, it made sense to assume that grindcore would flame out as a novelty trend after about five years due to lack of innovation. And yet, almost three decades later, we have to marvel at the breadth of a genre that has done the opposite of stagnate. Modern acts like Cephalic Carnage, Pig Destroyer, Antigama, and many others have brought myriad new dimensions to the form, and they continue to infuse metal with a sense of limitless possibility. Among them, Fuck the Facts has become so adept at stretching grindcore's parameters that one almost detects a sense of gamesmanship in the way the Ottawa-Gatineau quintet switches styles two dozen times in a single song—often in the span of two minutes or less. The latest Fuck the Facts offering Desire Will Rot begins, seductively enough, in fairly standard full-blast mode. But it isn't long—28 seconds, to be exact—before the band's penchant for nuance rears its head. Double-bass drum volleys, pogo-inducing ""death'n'roll"" crunch reminiscent of Entombed, crossover thrash riffs, powerviolence, guttural hardcore, Yngwie Malmsteen-worthy guitar solos, and jazzy off-time grooves all come to brief fruition before melting away into whatever complementary shade of metal the band chooses next. This segmented approach has typified metal since (if not before) Death’s Chuck Schuldiner employed jazz fusion-loving members of Cynic for 1991’s death-prog classic Human, but it isn’t staggering technical agility alone that distinguishes Fuck the Facts as exceptional. The real coup here is that Desire Will Rot never gives you whiplash because it doesn’t actually contain hairpin turns. Take a moment to let that sink in: to make this music flow to this degree requires an almost supernatural instinct for cohesion. That instinct, on display in spades here, is what arguably positions Fuck the Facts at grindcore's cutting edge. This is all the more impressive considering this album was actually recorded three years ago. Originally intended for release as the main-course companion to the 2013 EP Amer, Desire Will Rot does bear some similarities to the style and tone of Amer’s seven songs, but it leans far less in the straight-ahead melodic-metal vein the band first explored on 2008’s Disgorge Mexico. Even those who are well familiar with Amer or the FTF catalog as a whole wouldn’t immediately think to connect the two releases. Desire Will Rot was conceived and recorded just two years after Fuck the Facts solidified its current five-piece lineup in time to make the joint LP/EP set Die Miserable and Misery (both released on the same day in 2011). The recent split-LP with Fistfuck, released this past May, gives us a glimpse into where FTF might be headed in the future, but it’s easy to see why the band is pushing Desire Will Rot, easily the more expansive of the two titles, as its quote-unquote actual new album. Desire Will Rot captures a band that spent significant time gelling and growing as a creative unit. Where Fuck the Facts started out as a quasi-solo vehicle for bandleader-guitarist-engineer Topon Das, these days every member is expected, even required, to contribute to the writing process. It’s not often that we can describe a three-minute song as ""epic,"" but the winding twists and turns of a tune like ""Solitude"" suggest that a bunch of cooks can work together in the same kitchen without stepping on one another’s toes. Indeed, this five-piece incarnation marks the latest in a series of significant milestones in the band’s history, namely: the addition of frontwoman Mel Mongeon in 2002 and Mathieu Vilandré’s later switch from guitar to drums. Each of these changes has drastically increased the band’s pool of assets. Mongeon, although she now shares vocal duties with bassist Marc Bourgon, remains one of grindcore’s most instantly-recognizable vocalists. Her lyrics hint at a sense of unease within the realm of identity that never explicitly references a worldview shaped by Quebec’s relationships with the rest of Canada and the U.S. Nevertheless, a hazy feeling of clawing for one’s place permeates this music and sets Fuck the Facts’ brand of angst apart not only from other grind acts, but also its own early work, which was characterized more by Das’ sardonic sense of humor. Not to be overlooked, Mongeon’s artwork makes the physical copy of Desire Will Rot worth owning for those who like the music enough to seek additional overtones in her sumptuous—even dazzlingly—grim, visuals. Vilandré, meanwhile, serves as the ultimate dual-threat weapon. Ever since he moved behind the kit for 2006’s Stigmata High-Five, his precise, assertive style elevated Fuck the Facts from a dirty little underground act to upstart world-contender status. On Desire Will Rot, though, his drumming reaches a level of fluidity that’s rare even among the genre’s elite. Vilandré also contributes guitar parts, and his understanding of guitar no doubt contributes to this album’s seamlessness as Das and second guitarist Johnny Ibay’s parts spill forth in an endlessly churning outpour of riffs. By the time the album arrives at ""Circle"", its four-part ambient denoument, those riffs have touched on so many elements that the presence of cello, piano, and noise atmospheres hardly seems foreign or unexpected. Grindcore, as Fuck the Facts prove so ably on Desire Will Rot, can apparently accommodate any ingredients provided the artist has the imagination to support them.","The Ottawa-Gatineau grindcore quintet Fuck the Facts can often switch styles two dozen times in a single song—often in the span of two minutes or less. But the real coup of their excellent new self-released album, Desire Will Rot, is an almost supernatural instinct for cohesion.

Hermits on Holiday,DRINKS,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af2813d197565213a227/1:1/w_160/23f4c2b8.png,2015-08-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20759-hermits-on-holiday/,HeavenlyBirth,"Cate Le Bon has cut an imperious figure across her three solo albums. Her strong Welsh accent puts her at a curious remove, and she allows the guitars and organs that shape her songs to thrash, but only within strictly drawn boundaries, like Television riffs remade as repeating patterns. Her music has the sense of being just so, which seems to be in her nature: 2013's Mug Museum governed memory as a clearly labeled archive. Le Bon moved to L.A. to make that album, enlisting White Fence touring member Nick Murray on drums. Two years later, she's teamed up with his bandmate Tim Presley as DRINKS, a collaboration (that they'd rather bill as a four-legged solo project) born of a lot of time spent ""playing guitar and laughing manically at each other."" Rather than merge their respective psych sensibilities, they've stripped away the pop fabric—White Fence's dusky harmonies, Le Bon's delicate organ refrains—to muck around in primitive territory, recasting themselves as outsiders. As consummate musicians and students of pop, Le Bon and Presley aren't able to revert to Shaggs-like naivete, but they're able to suspend their aesthetes' sensibility in order to embrace chaos, even silliness. There's unmistakable precedent to the sound where they meet, the dub inflections and buzzing guitar welts. Hermits evokes the captivating disconnect of a late-'70s John Peel show, where the Slits and Delta 5 segued into Strictly Personal-era Beefheart's blues-pop abstractions—you half expect to hear Ivor Cutler pop up to recite a poem in between tracks. Opener ""Laying Down the Rock"" is a bit of a red herring. It's the most formed song here, a shaggy but highly strung garage plodder that doesn't shine with the wonder of discovery. “Focus on the Street”, though, begins a process of stretching rock's fabric loose. The verse runs on an insistent buzzsaw riff and clipped vocal incantations, the picture of no-wave austerity. Where the duo should break into some kind of lambasting, art-damaged chorus, they drift into hairy freeform guitar, like hippies pranking a White Columns crowd. ""Cannon Mouth"" sounds like Le Bon impersonating Nico through a snorkel; ""She Walks So Fast"" remakes Faust's ""Picnic on a Frozen River, Deuxième Tableaux"" as splayed British post-punk, Presley yelping ""rock'n'roll!"" amidst the burly twang. True to its creation, humor courses through Hermits, and rescues a few outlandish moments. ""Tim, Do I Like That Dog"" is almost seven minutes of Le Bon repeatedly asking Presley just that, bringing levity to the frankly hard-going music: strangled guitar scribble that thins to a single piercing note. The few audible lyrics that leap out elsewhere are funny, too, if completely inscrutable. The title track sounds like a reedy cuckoo clock, and marks times such as ""Six past the eight—copulate."" A glance at the muddled liner notes makes it seem like ""Cannon Mouth"" could be a song about austerity politics, privilege, and protest (""If you don't know what I'm on about/ Then you'll never want to scream and shout""), but Le Bon and Presley never make anything obvious. Only ""Cheerio"" veers too far into the unknown, stranding the listener among shrill proto-synth explorations. Most of Hermits on Holiday is pretty spontaneous and free-form, but it rarely lapses into the stuff of jam-band nightmares. An interviewer recently asked Le Bon and Presley whether they intended Hermits to be a psych album. ""I don't even know what those words mean anymore,"" Le Bon replied. Instead, the pair play like kids trying to light a fire with sticks and flint: there's a distant possibility something might take, but really it's all about the thrill of scrubbing around in the dirt.","DRINKS is the project of Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon and White Fence's Tim Presley.

Meliora,Ghost,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe35e6ef95969321e9c/1:1/w_160/3d77e6f4.jpg,2015-08-21 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20899-meliora/,Loma Vista,"The engimatic Swedish band Ghost (briefly known as Ghost B.C.) are in an odd place in the metal world right now. They're maybe the only modern metal band to earn accolades from both Darkthrone's Fenriz (one of their earliest supporters as a part of his ""Band of the Week"" feature) and Dave Grohl (who has played with them live and produced their covers EP If You Have Ghost). Ghost's main appeal is not only their throwback sound, but also their presentation, which combines black metal's anonymity with a theatrical, sometimes silly macabre bent only slightly removed from King Diamond. Even if we didn't ask for a new Kiss, Ghost is just that. But if their 2013 sophomore album Infestissumam was supposed to be metal's second commercial coming, there couldn't have been a worse album to place that expectation upon. Opus Eponymous, their unabashedly derivative 2010 debut, at least had solid hooks. There's that whole thing about catching more flies with honey than vinegar, but vinegar is a crucial ingredient of metal. With Meliora, their third full-length, they've dropped the temporary B.C. from their name and returned to a heavier direction, ditching most of the lite Mercyful Fate/Blue Öyster Cult hybrid for more folk and Deep Purple influences. It's far and away a more engaging record than Infestissumam, but still, you have to wonder if Ghost should be metal's new chief representative. Commending a metal record for having an upfront guitar sound seems unnecessary; that said, Andy Wallace's mixing was what Ghost needed, and now their desire for the metal big-time at least has a fitting production. Ghost also stepped up when writing more aggressive material befitting of the menace they wish to breed. While opener ""Spirit"" takes its time kicking in, ""From the Pinnacle to the Pit"" has that drive sorely missing from Infestissumam. The choral breaks and aggressive organ drives, like Purple in their prime, contrast so well, their fullest realization of ""seductive Satanism"" so far. And even if the Rainbow groove and driving bassline aren't anywhere close to new, some things still work decades later for a reason. ""Cirice"" was a wise choice for a first single, a combination of familiar strengths given new life. Again, the contrast of somber acoustic guitars and foreboding strings has been used time and time again, but it's just the launching pad for the song's main riff. In metal, it's very difficult to write a compelling midpaced song—Tom G. Warrior and Dimebag Darrell are among the few to not be cursed—so that Ghost gets that rare boogie right is enough of an accomplishment. ""Majesty""'s intro must have been lifted straight from Deep Purple's Perfect Strangers, oozing blusey swagger that Ghost has never tapped into before. Ghost's presentation works better in a live setting with a powerful PA, and that song has all the potential to become a live staple. Meliora also reveals the limitations of Ghost's vocalist, who this time is the third incarnation of satanic pope Papa Emeritus. (Part of Ghost's gimmick is that each Papa Emeritus ""dies"" and is succeeded by a different Papa Emertius with every album, even though it is, in fact, the same vocalist.) His soft approach to incantations is apt for ""He Is"", which shows off the folkier side of Ghost. Otherwise, it can't keep up with his Nameless Ghouls (the name of the Ghost ""band""). For all of ""Mummy Dust""'s strengths, as it plays with the loud-soft dynamics in a spookier way, a little more drama in the vocals would have really brought it to its full potential. There are plenty of moments where you wish Papa wouldn't just coast on a croon, but would instead let out a maniacal laugh or scream. That goes back to the central problem of Infestissumam: no matter how accessible you want to be, metal is nothing without a little tough confidence. Granted, getting compared to King Diamond must get old by now. That doesn't mean Papa Emeritus III couldn't vary it up, whether he wants to take it up himself or bring in a rival Pope with a different vocal range. (It'd add to the stage show.) In ""Pinnacle"", he brings a little snarl to his delivery, which should have been applied more liberally throughout the record. Papa Emeritus also doesn't add much to closer ""Deus in Absentia"", which makes the song feel twice as long as it actually is, and ends up being the weakest track on the whole. Except for ""Pinnacle"", ""Majesty"", and ""Cirice"", none of these songs feel essential or ready for headlining festival slots. That brings us to the ultimate question around Meliora and Ghost in general: What are they bringing to metal, especially for those who are not super into the underground? Say what you will about hair metal's shred pyrotechnics and blatant bubblegum tendencies, it at least brought something new to mainstream metal. Grunge was not the anathema to metal as is the popular narrative, but actually reaffirmed Black Sabbath's status as metal masters by taking more from them than most bands before. Since then? Most of the innovation and excitement has gone underground. So, what is Ghost doing, exactly? Is metal so desperate for a commercial force that we're willing to accept a crooning Pope as our savior? Is Ghost for Kiss fans who want their kids to have another Kiss, instead of something new? When the cloak comes off—and it will, sooner or later—there may not be much left behind. Ghost don't deserve outright scorn that hellishly opinionated metal fans can dish and dish, and Meliora is a step in the right direction, but their pandering can only go so far, and even then, it might be misguided.","The engimatic Swedish band Ghost's 2013 sophomore album Infestissumam was supposed to be metal's second commercial coming, but it was mostly a bore. With Meliora, their third full-length, they've returned to a heavier direction, and created a far more engaging collection of their seductive Satanism.

Wave[s],Mick Jenkins,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929affeea9e61561daa654e/1:1/w_160/442768ab.png,2015-08-21 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20922-mick-jenkins-waves/,CinematicGood Years,"Mick Jenkins' sophomore tape The Water(s) stood apart in a competitive Chicago scene. With a resonant baritone that telegraphed masculine authority, Jenkins jumped from not mentioned at all to one of his city's most promising rookie candidates. He combined an ear for poetic language with a principled consciousness and a no-bullshit persona, a formula which quickly snowballed into a substantial underground fanbase. Since that time, in numerous profiles and interviews, Jenkins has wrestled with what this sudden success means. His art has been in many ways about seeking truth in a system designed to obscure it, as an uncompromising, conscientious moralist unafraid to cut through the noise. It's a relatable pose, but one that doesn't necessarily lead artist and listener to the same destination. Wave[s] is a new direction, and it may upset expectations, pushing him away from his more strident instincts. Even if it isn't his best, it's probably for the best. What that means in practical terms is a shift from the somber blues and greens of The Water(s) into a more colorful earth-toned exploration of musical possibility. Although his poetic approach and political conscience are still in play, it feels less like a focal point and more a part of the music's texture. With Haitian-Canadian producer Kaytranada and Chicago-based musical collective THEMpeople providing the backdrop, Wave[s] is influenced primarily by a jazzy neo soul—to be reductive about it—sound. In a time when artists have been celebrated for chasing fashionable worlds of influence through a bottomless hard drive, Jenkins has opted to stick to a core set of inputs, a closed circuit of musical inspiration, and is finding himself within that limitation. His more orthodox listening tastes are refreshing, a reminder of how constraints can provide a framework for freedom. So when Jenkins opens up his world, it's for this tradition, one that gives him the grammar to relieve a pressure that had previously driven his work. Thus ""40 Below"" lets him tell a story of lost love that doesn't carry the burden of representing some sort of larger structural critique, or the obligation to wake up the world. Jenkins had painted himself in a bit of a corner, and Wave[s] is a sly sidestep, an exploration of possibility from an artist whose overriding purpose had previously eliminated that opportunity. Jenkins could risk didacticism, but it was his willingness to do so that initially cultivated such a loyal following; Wave[s] gives him an opportunity to shake those who may have valued his work only inasmuch as it provided that function. As a whole, Wave[s] isn't as strong as The Water(s), and may ultimately be seen as a bit minor in Jenkins' catalog. His biggest strength as an artist is his pen: as a writer, Jenkins has a gift for poetic turns of phrase and clever wordplay, delivered with potent urgency. The level of applied skill in his writing—the work that suggests he could one day rival some of rap's biggest names in a larger arena—hasn't quite been applied to his songwriting. His choruses are things like: ""Get Up, Get Out, Get Down!"", bordering on blank cliches in need of workshopping. Even ""Your Love""—the album's far-away highlight, with the potential to cross over—interpolates Lupe Fiasco for its ingratiating hook. Meanwhile, THEMpeople provide a vigorous experimental backdrop, but relative to the style's jazzy vanguard—think the Los Angeles world of Low End Theory parties, Thundercat, Flying Lotus, and To Pimp a Butterfly—the group is still establishing its voice, working toward a unique approach. This is not to suggest that the album is a failure, or that Jenkins' new direction is a bad one; if anything, it points to an artistic flexibility that will pay dividends down the road. The room to grow is there, should he decide to pursue the colors Wave[s] has opened up for him. The artistic success of ""Your Love"" suggests he has the right instincts, even if the execution is, for now, more of an exploration than a destination.","Following the release of his sophomore tape The Water(s), the rapper Mick Jenkins jumped from not mentioned at all to one of Chicago's most promising rookie candidates.

No Stairway,Glassine,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af65ea9e61561daa6448/1:1/w_160/2f2917e5.jpg,2015-08-20 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20803-no-stairway/,Patient Sounds,"No Stairway is an album comprised solely of manipulated field recordings taken from a Guitar Center, and that somehow doesn't even make it unique. There are two such projects currently floating around, both by artists who seem not to have heard of each other before beginning their work. Noah Wall, who has been a conceptual artist since the late '90s, garnered some notice earlier this year for his project Live at Guitar Center, which he recorded by surreptitiously wandering and capturing sounds in his local Guitar Center, archiving the furtive soloing and jamming of the customers testing amps, plinking at keyboards, fumbling out drum rolls. It was a noisy, blasting mess, and purposefully so, meant to evoke the sort of public-space cacophony that could make any agoraphobe tense up. Danny Greenwald, working under the name Glassine, arrived at the same idea, completing his project a full year before Noah Wall's was released. He took his samples from two Guitar Centers, one in Brooklyn and another in Baltimore, where he lives and works, and produced a glimmering, soothing album from the results, with the jokey title No Stairway. The coincidence is remarkable, and Patient Sounds, the label issuing No Stairway on cassette, noted the remarkable fact of the two projects' coexistence in its press release. But apart from the freaky timing, the two albums feel mostly like a testament to the sneaky centrality of a place like Guitar Center to much of young American musical life. For millions of instrument-playing kids, Guitar Center was a sort of local YMCA, an imperfect but important testing ground for life pursuits and passions. If Noah Wall's project felt a bit like an encroaching panic attack in a mall, Greenwald's feels like the dream of someone who fell asleep in the food court bench. It is murmuring, mostly soothing, verging on ambient. Greenwald is a composer, and he treats the samples he has collected as clay, conscripting them into a different context than they came from. Truthfully, you can learn nothing about the nature of Guitar Center, or what it's like to spend time there, from listening to Greenwald's album, and that is a good thing. You can squint at the deep, hollow knocks of percussion on a track like ""Human Shield"" and imagine they came from amps being plugged in, microphones being clumsily brushed. But to do so seems to miss the point of listening entirely. This is an album to dilate the senses, not sharpen them. No Stairway is woozy and dreamlike, a collection of undulant and wordless pieces that pulse gently in free space. If the album has a genre, it would be somewhere between experimental dub—those reverberant percussive hits can't help but evoke sound-system associations—and new age. The fact that all of these sounds were compacted out of an unruly stream of data is impressive, and even a little bewildering, but the knowledge proves unnecessary. The revelation of No Stairway turns out to be hearing how Greenwald coaxes these scuffs and shuffles so that they bloom quietly into pop songs. ""Hornet With a Halo"" and ""Sunruse Bench"" have lovelorn, sighing melodies, and sound like what Caribou might be doing if he worked in lo-fi cassettes. The radiant ripple of keyboards on ""Human Shield"" turn out to be several layers of sound stacked on top of each other, some patched through old synths and played again and some looped. It is a remarkable simulation, built painstakingly from a thousand scraps, but it rings out in space as simple and immediate as a hand pressed down on keys. The major-key melodies are warm, generous, and refracted through a fisheye-lens mix so that they feel slightly love-drunk. If you've ever closed your eyes in a room full of family and friends, letting the chatter blur so that you sense the surrounding goodwill more than you pick out the words, then No Stairway will have an uncannily familiar feel. Like many late-'90s big-box music retailers—Sam Goody, Tower Records—Guitar Center is a relic of a different, largely pre-Internet commercial era. Wandering into one today, you feel the same sense of impending economic doom you get from pushing open the glass doors of a Best Buy or Radio Shack. It has been in grave financial trouble for years, and is on pace to die a slow, ignominious death. Projects like Greenwald and Wall's, then, provide a slight redemptive note to the timeline, quiet reminders that millions of music-loving souls passed through those big doors at one point or another.","No Stairway is an album comprised solely of manipulated field recordings taken from a Guitar Center, and that somehow doesn't even make it unique—there are two such projects currently floating around.

Tales from the Land of Milk and Honey,The Foreign Exchange,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01ab1335d7bf169a068/1:1/w_160/4d4fa35b.jpg,2015-08-20 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20945-tales-from-the-land-of-milk-and-honey/,FE/Hard Boiled,"If you are curious about Phonte and Nicolay’s mindset going into their fifth studio album as the Foreign Exchange, just look at their social media accounts. Phonte, the group’s affable frontman, feeds his Twitter stream with acerbic real talk and hot-take movie reviews. On Facebook, producer Nicolay posts videos of bobblehead dolls in his studio, and jokes about his paltry royalty checks from streaming services. After 11 years together, and several albums of grown folks' soul, it seems the two aren’t taking themselves too seriously. They're having fun and don't mind bringing you into the fold. Tales from the Land of Milk and Honey is a delightful collection of sophisticated R&B and electronic dance, tied directly to the era of Morris Day funk grooves and Teddy Riley’s New Jack Swing. As it plays, Phonte, Nicolay, keyboardist Zo!, and vocalists Carmen Rodgers and Tamisha Waden recall the storied Minneapolis funk sound while staying true to their own established blend of Eurocentric electro-soul. In a way, Milk and Honey feels like a concept record: The press photos resemble a parody of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, and the title track evokes Sergio Mendes’ brand of airy Brazilian jazz. The lyrics pull from Stevie Wonder's songbook of imagined utopias and peaceful horizons. Then suddenly, on ""Work It to the Top"", Phonte sings in a nasal tone that channels groups like Ready for the World and Cameo over a vintage, computerized-R&B stomp. Milk and Honey moves swiftly and has the same radiant mood as 2013’s Love in Flying Colors, the group’s previous album. But if Colors embraced the joy of a new relationship, Milk and Honey explores the comforts of sustained romance, where the urge to hit the club gives way to Netflix date nights and glasses of wine at the crib. ""Body"", a standout near the album’s end, says as much: ""Nowhere to go and it’s nothing on these streets,"" Phonte sings, who addressed a similar notion on his 2011 solo album, Charity Starts at Home. The familiarity of the music is the best kind, and for anyone who has kept up closely with this project, it's both a joy and a comfort. Ever since the group’s landmark debut, the Foreign Exchange has evolved into a roving crew of musicians who specialize in adult contemporary soul. They tend to focus on the day-to-day aspects of love and life, which helps them stay connected with their cult followers, some of whom have kept up with the crew since its inception on Okayplayer. Overall, Milk and Honey is a victory lap and a nice step forward in the group’s creative progress. Or maybe it’s a two-step.","On Tales from the Land of Milk and Honey, the fifth studio album by the Foreign Exchange, the group pays homage to old-school funk and R&B while remaining close to their own blend of Eurocentric soul.

How the Spark Loves the Tinder,Monk Parker,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929affd9d034d5c69bf47ce/1:1/w_160/ec8fdae2.jpg,2015-08-20 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20920-how-the-spark-loves-the-tinder/,Bronze Rat,"Monk Parker's How the Spark Loves the Tinder is fall music—languid, heart-wrenching, suggesting pangs of transition. Singing unhurried minor-key songs burnished with horns, weeping organs, and steel guitar, Parker traffics in a twilit Americana, drifting between Phosphorescent's sun-drunk aphorisms and Castanets' moonlit chill. The man at the helm here is an itinerant writer and musician named Mangham ""Monk"" Parker. He went by Parker Noon in the early '00s, when he was based out of New York City and played with his then-girlfriend in a duo called Parker & Lily. After their breakup he relocated to Athens and launched the Low Lows, a rotating collective of musicians with its name taken from a Parker & Lily album. For the last five years Parker's lived in Austin, where he put together his latest band. The credits to How the Spark Loves the Tinder list 20-some players and several recording studios in New York (including NY Hed, the studio run by Jon Spencer collaborator Matt Verta-Ray) and Austin (including Parker's home), and it feels more ambitious and more fully realized than any of his earlier work. Perhaps that's the reason for Parker's current moniker and why Spark is billed by his label, UK-based Bronze Rat, as a debut. Parker's lyrics read like poetry, with images of floating stars and nighttime winds and endless skies. ""Idle in Idlewild"", at seven-some minutes the longest song on the album, contains this perfect triplet: ""Some strange April/ When all the stars stall and stay still/ And the days fly by."" Parker practically gives each word its own breath. The arrangements are rich in color and nuance: Opener and lead single ""Sadly Yes"" builds from a dirge to a big, brassy climax over nearly six minutes, achieving hard-fought catharsis while a Theremin-like wail cuts through. A mournful, elegant suite of clarinet and strings opens ""I Am a Gun"" before it segues into a kind of chamber-country waltz. There's an extended moment in the middle of ""The Happy Hours"", a song ostensibly about existential dread in Rapid City, Iowa, where horns and strings assume a density as vast and uplifting as an orchestra. For all of this life-affirming beauty, the album's operative emotional state is resignation. Parker's songs find solace in the ability to accept defeat—lost love, unfulfilled potential—and present this ability as a form of wisdom. This is the sort of mind state achieved only from age and experience. Far from depressing, the exquisite dejection of How the Spark Loves the Tinder is almost celebratory. After all, you can't fight the changing seasons.","Monk Parker  traffics in a twilit Americana, drifting between Phosphorescent's sun-drunk aphorisms and Castanets' moonlit chill.

"Grown Up, Fucked Up",Reatards,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b015c0084474cd0c1baa/1:1/w_160/9bd00b9f.jpg,2015-08-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20940-grown-up-fucked-up/,GonerGoner,"Jay Reatard was 18 when he recorded the Reatards' second album Grown Up, Fucked Up. The short time between the Memphis punks' extraordinary debut Teenage Hate and their new album had apparently taken a toll. ""In the past year all innocence, all naiveness, and all kindness has all but been sucked out of my heart, my mind, and my soul,"" he wrote in the liner notes. By 1999, he'd already started to alienate some of the people around him. Guitarist Sean Redd stopped regularly hanging out with Jay outside of Reatards shows and only played on Grown Up, Fucked Up because Jay asked him. Jay once noted that about 27 different people had been Reatards at some point; the turn-around rate was significant. There's footage of Reatards playing a Reno basement in 1999, which offers a pretty good illustration of his live presence at the time. He screams and thrashes everywhere, hitting the floor and smashing himself in the head multiple times. He chokes himself with the mic cable. He'd just been dumped; he is not kind when he described her in his between-songs banter. ""I use [sic] to be a nice caring sweet kid that everyone loved,"" he wrote in the album's liner notes. ""Now I'm just fucked and no one can fucking stand me."" Grown Up, Fucked Up is about making the final transition from sweet-faced little Jimmy Lee Lindsey to Jay Reatard. There was no going back—from then on, he was that shrieking figure writhing on the Reno basement floor. On Grown Up, Jay's chaotic rage is the driving force behind most of the songs. His enemies list on the record includes Led Zeppelin fans and the entire city of Memphis. On ""No One Stands Me"", Jay posits himself as a ""dirty motherfucker,"" growling and screaming. Many of these songs are about feeling like the perpetual other. ""I'm gonna break down,"" he repeatedly sings in one of the album's best hooks. It's ironic that this declaration is the album's closing sentiment (before the bonus cuts on Goner's new reissue)—he seems to have been going through a loud, violent breakdown all along. Of all of Jay's many projects, Reatards are among the most primitive. While speed punk jams like ""Sat. Night Suicide"" and ""Eat Your Heart Out"" reinforce that idea, there are moments that begin to take it apart and predict where Jay would travel next. ""Blew My Mind"" is all muscular guitar and gang vocals right up until the bridge, when handclaps enter and the power-chord melody takes on a saccharine sheen. In glints, you can see the the aggressive-but-catchy sound he'd master on Blood Visions. The middle of the album bogs down a little bit, with hooks and performances that blend into each other. The three bonus tracks from the 1999 ""You're So Lewd"" 7"" feel tacked-on and inessential. Their cover of the Persuaders' ""Heart of Chrome"" is sluggish when stacked next to songs like ""Sick When I See"" and ""Sat. Night Suicide"". But even when this album's on the downswing, the Reatards are still screaming, blaring, and ferocious. Sometimes they trudge and sometimes they sprint, but they are always effective. Jay Reatard pushed people's buttons, but he was beloved. This love shines through in the reissue's liner notes, which feature tributes from Goner Records' Eric Freidl and Empty Records' Meghan Smith. Both remember him for who he was—a frustrated teenager who broke disco balls and sought refuge in rock'n'roll. He was an incredible performer—an unhinged presence whose emotions seemed to be spilling out from all sides at all times. It's been five years since he died, and while many artists make angry rock'n'roll in the Reatards' wheelhouse, Jay's absence is felt.

The Expanding Flower Planet,Deradoorian,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0145e6ef95969321efa/1:1/w_160/91dfc738.jpg,2015-08-20 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20939-the-expanding-flower-planet/,Anticon,"Angel Deradoorian's debut album is full of unusual juxtapositions: '60s psych and Georgian polyphony; classical minimalism and laser-show maximalism; dulcimer and church organ. But her voice is the thread that holds it all together, and once the album has finished, tied off with a ribbon of wailing trombone, it's her voice you remember most. Crystalline and unerring in pitch, it dominates the album, both solo and in multi-tracked close harmonies that radiate an eerie glow, like pyrite glinting through fog. It's not hard to imagine that an a capella version of this album would be captivating all on its own. This is Deradoorian's debut solo album, but she has played a key role in a number of arty, ambitious indie rock projects: She played bass and sang in Dave Longstreth's Dirty Projectors in the Bitte Orca years, and she's one third of Avey Tare's Slasher Flicks, the most recent side project of Animal Collective's Dave Portner. As a singer, she's also worked with Vampire Weekend, Charli XCX, Flying Lotus, U2, and Matmos, a list that suggests an unusually robust  versatility. She began releasing her own music in 2009, with the Mind Raft EP, but the new album represents a quantum leap in complexity and ambition. The Expanding Flower Planet feels like an album full of trap doors, where a single, unexpected sound can deposit you into new worlds. Playing the bulk of the music herself, with help from two drummers and a handful of backup vocalists, Deradoorian explores krautrock rhythms, microtonal tunings, and various Eastern scales, including those of her Armenian heritage. And she lets those scales dictate a melodic line that takes her far away from the hidebound formula of indie's usual four-bar chord changes. ""A Beautiful Woman"" begins as a garage-soul rave-up and then explodes into the eerie, cascading harmonies of the Black Sea region; ""Your Creator"" stacks ghostly chords to the heavens and trips up and down their intervals, a dizzying game of chutes and ladders. The album's title comes from a Chinese mandala tapestry that hung in Deradoorian's studio, and, accordingly, she wrestles with big, metaphysical themes: elemental forces, catacombs and mosaics, hearts and eyes, clutching and binding, love and knowledge, and above all, oneness. The theme of self-actualization runs from the first song's daily affirmations (""Beautiful woman/ You're the one I wanna be"") to the last song's healing mantra (""Love/ Grow/ Love… Grow grow grow grow grow""). But the focus is rarely narrative; the lyrics tend to operate like koans, spells, small tokens supercharged with symbolic power. The quest for knowledge drives it all. ""How do you know?/ Who can tell the truth?"" asks ""DarkLord"". In the title song she sings, ""We all know much more than we really think we know,"" and in ""Grow"", that idea becomes a question:"" How do we learn so we can all teach?"" And then there's ""Komodo"", probably the only song you'll hear this year that seems at least nominally to be about a Komodo dragon attack (""Komodo coming through/ Run for your lives/ Run for the hills/ Don't close your eyes""). It contains some of the album's most vivid lyrics, particularly in a cooing chorus whose dulcet tone contradicts its stark imagery (""Drone/ Between the grass/ The blades are rough/ Your metal skin/ Protects your hunt/ Death is in your clutch""). Despite this reptilian foray, though, the album's wide-angled macro perspective suggests that Deradoorian's true spirit animal is likelier to be a hawk or an eagle. There is an aching sense of space in her music: with her soaring vocals leading the way, her arrangements begin to suggest patchworks of fields and freeways and mountains and beaches as seen from above. ""I love the beauty of the state, but there's a whole other aspect of it that I struggle with,"" she told Self-Titled magazine of her attempt to come to grips with California's sprawl. As she wends her unpredictable way up and away, through strange intros and outros and across mantra-like choruses and far above bridges to nowhere, she offers a bird's-eye view of a landscape unlike any other, a place at once familiar, as though half-remembered from a dream, and spellbindingly alien.","This is Angel Deradoorian's debut solo album, but she played bass and sang in Dave Longstreth's Dirty Projectors in the Bitte Orca years, and she's one third of Avey Tare's Slasher Flicks, the most recent side project of Animal Collective's Dave Portner.

The Pale Horse,Ancient Warfare,by: Ned Raggett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05aea9e61561daa65eb/1:1/w_160/d9211fbc.jpg,2015-08-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20988-the-pale-horse/,Alias,"The band name and album title for Ancient Warfare's The Pale Horse suggests metal—something blackened, possibly from somewhere Scandinavian. But the band turns out to be a quartet based in Lexington, Ky. that trades in cinematic Americana. Focused around the songwriting, singing, and guitar playing of Echo Wilcox, Ancient Warfare take a well-worn form and invest it with some of the mystery of its best practitioners. From the start of the album, where a low guitar reverb effect leads to a quick pause before Wilcox simply sings the title word of the opening track, ""Darlin'"", there's a heavy-lidded mood at play the kind of slow intensity that can be terribly boring in the wrong hands, but The Pale Horse is immediately compelling. In the first song alone, there are quiet touches that emerge with time—how the violin part floats upward, the extra guitar notes picked out towards the conclusion—testifying to the quiet power of a carefully detailed performance. Wilcox began Ancient Warfare as a solo project in 2010, with the encouragement of Shangri-La Productions' Duane Lundy, who serves as this record's producer and engineer. By now, she has assembled a powerful lineup: the muffled, reverbed punch of Emily Hagihara's drumming on ""Dreamcatcher"" loosely evokes ""Be My Baby"", while Wilcox intones ""dream"" like a woozy afterecho of the Everly Brothers, even as the arrangement gets noisier. Hagihara also contributes piano, bass, and vocals on nearly every track, while Rachael Yanarella's violin work serves as both melodic counterpoint and ghostly atmosphere. But Wilcox remains the center of the band, exuding a cool confidence in her singing and playing. Hers is the kind of rich voice that blends beautifully into the arrangements even while you yearn to hear more of it on it's own. The entire album is a mood piece to some degree, but it never simply repeats itself: Sometimes it's as simple as a quiet key change or a shift from lyrics to wordless tones, as near the conclusion of ""Tusk and Mouth"". Never once does she sound like she is straining to get across. Lyrically, her voice is still emerging, but even with slightly forced lines like ""Kentucky's shades of grace,"" from ""Lickin' Lies"", she sells it with her detached cool. The less graceful turns of phrase are still of a piece with the impressionistic stories she weaves. Her vision of America is understated, laying somewhere between concrete and dreamscape and containing echoes of numerous previous decades. Depending on your angle of approach, you could hear Lee Hazlewood, Emmylou Harris's riffs on cosmic American music, the Walkabouts, Mazzy Star, Mojave 3. (The bandmembers themselves have namechecked figures like Aimee Mann, Patti Smith, Karen O, and the Pixies.) But despite all these other voices informing theirs, Ancient Warfare have hit upon a singular lonesome-highway energy, the kind that you can study but cannot fake.","Ancient Warfare are a quartet from Lexington, Ky. that trades in cinematic Americana.

The Complete Recordings of Jackson C. Frank,Jackson C. Frank,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afae9d034d5c69bf4756/1:1/w_160/5fce3096.jpg,2015-08-19 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20865-the-complete-recordings-of-jackson-c-frank/,Ba Da Bing,"Jackson C. Frank could never quite come back. In 1965, under the aegis of producer Paul Simon and with the assistance of sideman Al Stewart, the Buffalo-born Frank cut a 10-song masterpiece of the transatlantic folk revival. Frank’s self-titled debut gathered together the requisite folk threads of his day and refashioned them with his steady picking and a tenor that lilted, even as it moped. Frank could be topical and timely, as on the Dylan social nod ""Don’t Look Back"", or he could web simple phrases and patterns into enigmatic, illusory anthems, as he did for ""My Name Is Carnival"". He made existential unease charming on ""Just Like Anything"", and he updated Bascom Lamar Lunsford’s ancient American banjo trot, ""I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground"", for a new generation of post-beatnik vagabonds. Frank got to all of those feelings at once during ""Blues Run the Game"", reportedly the first song he ever finished and, for most, the sole perfect number that forms his entire legacy. On The Complete Recordings, the most exhaustive assembly of his catalog to date, Frank’s standard tellingly appears three times—at the start of Jackson C. Frank, in an extra tender 1968 take from John Peel’s radio show and in its reverb-enhanced, slide-gilded 7"" form. A mantra for those who can never outrun their own tail of perennial sadness, whether they catch a boat to England or try another city, it doubles as the perfectly tragic summary of Frank’s own life. Before his death in 1999, he would suffer impossible penury and injury and drift into anonymity, but he would never record another album. Frank, you could say, never outfoxed his self-diagnosis of perpetual blues. A year before Frank made his auspicious but low-selling debut, he left the Northeast for London, where he became an influential implant in that scene’s vibrant and varied lot of writers and pickers. Though new to songwriting, he seemed one of the scene’s certain stars, carousing with the names of the day and soon signing a deal with Columbia. Though only in his early twenties, Frank had already survived a great amount of sadness. When he was 11 years old, a school furnace exploded, burning him and many classmates so badly that he spent months in the hospital. The incident seemed to trail and torment him his entire life, responsible in part for the shadow that hung over many of his songs and made them so immediate but also for the depression that debilitated him. Frank tried time and again to restart his career, just to fumble again. Only now, 16 years after his death, are we really learning that his slim output and tiny reputation stand as one of the great legacies and losses of a movement in which he has sometimes been considered but a blip. In the five decades since Frank recorded his only proper album, a dozen efforts to revivify his catalog have come and gone, from covers by people like Bert Jansch and John Mayer to deluxe reissues. The Complete Recordings pairs those earlier excavation attempts with the latest finds from Frank’s fragmented archive, though much debate remains about just how complete this set is. Ba Da Bing is issuing Recordings in conjunction with the arrival of Jackson C. Frank: The Clear, Hard Light of Genius, the most tender and authoritative biography on the singer to date. Befitting Frank’s entire career, though, the coordinated schedule hamstrings the set itself, as a truncated and badly edited essay serves as the surrogate for proper liner notes. At least Recordings begins brilliantly, with Frank’s debut LP in its wonderful, remastered entirety. It then backtracks four years to the campus of Gettysburg College, where Frank and some friends slur through ""CC Rider"", creep through ""In the Pines"", and race through ""John Henry"". According to Mark Anderson, the friend with which Frank cut many of these songs, there were at least a dozen more, but it matters little. These collegiate curios mostly show us the roots of Frank’s musical development. They dovetail well with his ramshackle teenage take on ""Heartbreak Hotel"" (recorded in 1957, the year he met Elvis) and a 1960 session of folk standards Frank cut on the cheap back in Buffalo. He’s less a stylist on these standards than a teenager piecing together his toolkit; these songs would matter to his overall approach, yes, but these takes do not. The jewels of Recordings come, in many cases, more than a decade after Frank’s debut, long after he and others had already tried to resuscitate his career. The scraps from his aborted follow-ups don’t hang together quite so well as his lone album, but taken together, they reaffirm and expand his general mystique. The terse, romantic existentialism of ""Cover Me With Roses"" overcomes the tawdry blues guitar beneath its chugging chords; a song about the raw deals we all make and deal with ""if you can,"" it adds pep and a bit of wit to the essential premise of ""Blues Run the Game"". ""Madonna of Swans"" is as graceful as the title suggests, with Frank’s lush chords and gentle harmonics lifting his wavering voice. But it’s the loping ""Spanish Moss"", recorded in 1974, that haunts most. One of the brightest songs Frank ever cut, it is his preemptive ""Tangled Up in Blue"". He details a romantic rendezvous that feels sinister in its execution—""She opened a picture of Lucifer in chains,"" he haltingly offers—and melancholy in its temporary necessity. ""Her hair hung like a sacrament,"" he relays, ""our bodies to begin."" It’s perhaps the most vivid narrative language in the emotional impressionist’s entire songbook, an unfulfilled promise for the possibility of the other scenes he may have soon set. ""Spanish Moss"" is sexual, sophisticated, and playful, the work of a writer who had momentarily shrugged aside his blues, even if he would never fully break their spell. He didn’t, of course: During the next two decades, Frank sometimes found himself homeless or committed to sanitariums. He lost an eye in a senseless shooting but was eventually rescued by a fan who got him money from royalties and a new guitar. Some of the most poignant and compelling numbers in Frank’s oeuvre arrive at that point, nearly 20 years ago. In 1994, Jackson cut several songs in a proper studio, and the results rival the best material of his debut. ""October"" is a meditation on the judgment of the drunk and the way that time can never be captured. ""I Don’t Want to Love You No More"" is an attempt to deny the undeniable, a transmission from someone working to regain some semblance of sanity and civility. It’s like George Jones’ ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"" rewritten by the survivor. In these sunset songs, you can hear premonitions of Richard Buckner and Damien Jurado, Will Oldham and Bill Callahan, songwriters who would soon similarly mumble and croon their way to measures of success Frank never enjoyed. By 1997, when Frank recorded a set of fragmentary songs and false starts in a kitchen, both his voice and verve had stiffened considerably. His late-life charm had faded. That material is hard to hear, really, as you can tell that Frank’s quest for redemption is slowly drifting into oblivion. The whole situation recalls one particularly excruciating passage from ""Goodbye (To My Loving You)"", my favorite Frank relic from 1994. ""Now that love is leaving,"" he ends one of his saddest, sharpest verses ever, his voice quaking, ""there’s nothing left to show."" Nearly three decades later, blues would finally end the game, he seemed to say, just as they had run it for so long.","In 1965, the Buffalo-born folk musician Jackson C.

Everybody’s Coming Down,The Good Life,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe1c0084474cd0c1b5d/1:1/w_160/2afc2307.jpg,2015-08-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20897-everybodys-coming-down/,Saddle Creek,"Taking the long view, Cursive frontman Tim Kasher’s trajectory appears more like that of a Hollywood journeyman than a musician. His most renowned work could be described as ""reality programming""—Domestica, The Ugly Organ, and Black Out played up the distasteful and compelling tics of their narcissistic leads to provide gripping conflict and perverse pleasure. His brief residency in Los Angeles coincided with his ""screenwriting"" period, Happy Hollow and Help Wanted Nights creating self-contained, fictional cities filled with multi-dimensional characters and their questionable motivations (the libretto-assisted *I Am Gemini *was a one-off in musical theater). Since releasing music under his own name in 2010, Kasher has shifted to ""sitcoms""—as with The Game of Monogamy and Adult Film, the Good Life’s Everybody’s Coming Down softens his takes on modern life with gentle, PG-13 humor and a tremendous lessening of stakes. Last year, Kasher turned 40 and toured behind a reissue of 2003's The Ugly Organ—a means of celebrating his most beloved record and reckoning with a ""perspective shift"" that made it difficult for him to relate to the guy who sang ""The Recluse"". And yet, present-day Kasher doesn’t achieve much distance from his brash, idealistic, and self-destructive former self, as the entirety of Everybody’s Coming Down puts the two in direct, unflattering comparison. While Kasher’s platitudes are presented as hard truths forged from experience, most of the time, it just sounds secondhand, scripts written by someone whose worldview has been shaped mostly by Cursive records. There’s the inevitable talk of the futility of artistic expression—maybe Burst and Bloom's ""Sink to the Beat"" and The Ugly Organ's ""Art Is Hard"" were cynical, but there was convincing conflict between Kasher’s ego and his soul. The self-evisceration has given way to bellyaching on Everybody’s Coming Down. Rather than busting down the fourth wall and providing insider intel as to what happens in ""The Troubadour’s Green Room"", Kasher diffidently states what was always implied—he’s singing for any kind of attention and the only original thought results from two cliches soldered together as non sequitur—""I was chasing the big fish/ And all the wine and roses that come with it."" There’s the inevitable talk of the futility of human coupling. As with Happy Hollow's ""Big Bang"" and Mama, I'm Swollen's ""Caveman"", ""How Small We Are"" sees procreation as a zero sum game with lyrics not punched-up enough for laughs nor plain enough to be anything anyone might actually say (""propagating teensy human beings is a must""). And there’s the inevitable talk of the futility of human existence itself (most notably ""Holy Shit""), with nearly every song finding some way to rehash the album title: ""With the proper dosage I can feed my ego/ Once the buzz wears off I feel so hollow""; ""Each ticker tape parade/ Is followed by a broom brigade""; ""Every candle lit for every god or cancer kid/ Has flickered out and no one ever heard the prayer""; ""If my body's a temple, it’s crumbling/ It can’t be renovated""; ""Another carousel through the nothingsphere""; ""Everybody’s riding the Ferris wheel/ And the pinnacle’s gorgeous...once the ride is done, they’re back in line again."" The increasing generality of Kasher’s lyrics is matched by the Good Life’s evolution into a tuneful, spirited, but extremely conventional indie rock outfit. The plodding, bashed-out alt of ""Everybody"" or the friskier pop-punk of ""Holy Shit"" and ""Ad Nauseum"" are hooky enough and they’re the kind of songs you could hear every hour, on the hour just walking through Philadelphia or Boston these days. Kasher’s sardonic tone at least prevents them from anonymity, though the true highlights happen when he takes a supporting role—bassist Stefanie Drootin-Senseney’s aqueous vocals lend ""Diving Bell"" an eerie psychedelia and when its lyrics fail, a worldless, harmonized moan on ""The Troubadour’s Green Room"" properly evokes the weariness of a veteran half-assing it on stage while looking over a half-filled venue. Cursive had been increasingly shearing off the nettlesome vocal tics and jagged edges of their prickly post-hardcore, while the Good Life had developed from Kasher’s nocturnal synth-pop project to a hearty Midwestern rock act—the distinction between the two has been all but eliminated at this point. And that’s what makes Everybody’s Coming Down disappointing in a way that 2012's seventh Cursive album I Am Gemini or the 2013 solo album Adult Film never managed. The Good Life had once felt like Tim Kasher’s necessary relief from Being Tim Kasher. Not that 2002's Black Out or 2004's Album of the Year were lighthearted—but they could be cloaked in gothic hues or the assumption of fiction. But whether it’s Cursive or Good Life or Tim Kasher, it’s all sitcom at this point, his version of ""Mulaney"" or ""Mr. Robinson""—a barely fictionalized, deadened version of his own life starring him. Or, ""Shit Tim Says"".","Last year, Tim Kasher turned 40 and toured behind a reissue of Cursive's 2003 collection, The Ugly Organ, a record that played up the distasteful, compelling tics of its lead to provide gripping conflict and perverse pleasure.

Trap-A-Velli Tre,2 Chainz,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00513d197565213a3ad/1:1/w_160/f2c7995c.jpg,2015-08-19 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20926-trap-a-velli-tre/,self-released,"When rapper 2 Chainz released Trap-A-Velli in 2009 he was still Tity Boi, the more prominent member of middling Atlanta duo Playaz Circle. That seems like a lifetime ago. Back then, as a signee of Ludacris' label, Disturbing Tha Peace, with one hit single to his credit (which was heavily indebted to its Lil Wayne feature), his boasts were discernibly smaller. Still, it was easy to hear his talent working. Even then he was an expert at making basic rap colorful and comical (on ""Stunt"": ""The feet on the whip, big like Jurassic Park/ The car tall, to get in you need a running start""). By the time 2010's Trap-A-Velli 2 arrived, the rapper was a free agent, and it felt like he was campaigning to be a star, swaggering a bit bigger on record while carefully floating around an alternate moniker. The following year brought the name change and with it came the breakthrough, completing one of the more successful rebrands in rap history. Shortly thereafter, he landed the rap trifecta: a big feature run, a signature mixtape, and a #1 debut. The third installment in the series, Trap-A-Velli Tre, comes at a very different time for 2 Chainz. After becoming a chart mainstay for much of the '10s, he's fighting to remain relevant in a crowded field. His 2013 sophomore album, B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time, was shut out by urban radio: Not only did it sell significantly less than its predecessor, it also failed to chart a single in either the Billboard Top 40 or the Rap Top 10. (Four of his previous five singles hit both of those marks.) For a rapper that relies on visibility as much as 2 Chainz does, that's a pretty sizable blow. Last year, his solid FreeBase EP came and went without so much as a whimper, despite the stellar, single-ready ""Crib in My Closet"" with big name guests Rick Ross and A$AP Rocky. He's at the point in his career where stagnation could render him a footnote. Perhaps 2 Chainz is aware of this, because on Trap-A-Velli Tre, for the first time in a very long time, he raps with real purpose. These aren't the phoned-in raps from failed crossovers like Jessie J's ""Burnin' Up"" and TeeFLii's ""24 Hours"". 2 Chainz has always been naturally charismatic, and it's an integral part of his shtick, but his true talent is measuring the weight of a goofy punchline. When he raps ""Get so much pussy I go to sleep with a condom on"" on ""A Milli Billi Trilli"", it comes after a string of considerably less ridiculous jokes  and it lands right before the hook, boosting its effectiveness. Good comedy sometimes requires a sharp eye for commentary, and on the tape's centerpiece, ""GOAT"", which features The-Dream, he mixes in keen observations (""Mama's only child, the crackhouse was my daycare"") with goofy humor (""Aiming for the stars, so I fucked her on the balcony""). Trap-A-Velli Tre often struggles to find that balance elsewhere. On a pair of Zaytoven-produced tracks, ""BFF"" and ""Starter Kit"", cringeworthy bars stick out like sore thumbs. His daughters pop up on ""Halo (Letter to My Unborn Son)"", a weird record written from the perspective of the fetus. There's a random bar about having enough land to find Sasquatch. Sixteen tracks means there is far too much room for filler. 2 Chainz isn't built to embellish. Despite the overabundance of one-liners, it isn't all laughs on Trap-A-Velli Tre. There are several serious reminders that 2 Chainz still has real hit-making potential. The TM88-produced ""Big Meech Era"" staggers back in time through otherworldly synths and feedbacking 808s. ""Watch Out"" reinterprets the minimalism of OG Maco's ""U Guessed It"" and turns it into a full-on jam that can sustain itself for longer that six seconds. On ""Lapdance in the Trap House"", produced by Honorable C Note, he shouts some of his most graphic boasts (""Put a half a milli in an MCM bag/ Had that muthafucka looking pregnant!"") over deflating synth chords. If he can again harness his charm, he may just stick around awhile longer.","2 Chainz's Trap-A-Velli Tre arrives as the rapper is fighting to remain relevant in a crowded field.

M3LL155X,FKA twigs,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b05513d197565213a44d/1:1/w_160/91be6bde.jpeg,2015-08-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20985-m3ll155x/,Young Turks,"In ""Papi Pacify"", the video that introduced FKA twigs to the wider world, the British pop star stares into the camera as a man (a lover, it should be said) pries his fingers into her gaping mouth. The hook is a moan: ""Mmm, papi pacify."" The lyrics are about the tension of desire, but the mise en scene is power. On the cover of her third EP M3LL155X, twigs echoes this gesture, staring at us as her own hand merges into her face. Once again, her gaze is discomfiting and impossible not to return. A glassy-voiced singer refracting melody through diffuse electronic beats, twigs takes the familiar R&B star as her avatar, but her presentation is more complex: her ideas mar beauty and mine power, and exalt sex without exotifying. She develops these ideas further on M3LL155X, a five-song EP accompanied by a 16-minute music video/film that dropped last week, just over a year after the release of twigs' high profile debut, LP1. As a creative package the EP is unimpeachable; a high-concept, intellectually curious project that's evocative, accessible and transgressive enough to satisfy the competing demands of a newly broadened fanbase and her existing audience of Tumblr-educated aesthetes. M3LL155X (pronounced 'Melissa') builds on her previous work, exploring ideas of dominance and submission and drilling down almost completely into the self. Instead of obfuscating her soft voice with layers of effects or singing in that cartoonishly frail and breathy falsetto, twigs prowls confidently over M3LL155X.  The opening track ""Figure 8"" rumbles, shudders, whirrs and clicks like most of LP1, but her voice is clearer than ever. Over modular synth patches and a fluid wheeze of artificial strings on ""In Time"", she tests her brawniest delivery yet: ""Every day, every day, you be testing my sane, you've got a goddamned nerve."" When there are vocal effects, they're sinister instead of sweet, as if she's haunted by her own thoughts.  That's the rub behind a seemingly submissive song like ""I'm Your Doll"", an angsty love song written by her pre-woke teenage self that twigs repurposes for adulthood.""I just want [for] you to love you,"" she implores, as a reminder, on the garage-meets-gagging dancefloor missive ""Glass & Patron."" M3LL155X — like Sasha Fierce or Zadie Smith — isn't interested in vulnerability. In the video for ""Figure 8"", a song about life and birth, twigs uses a prosthesis to appear pregnant, stepping and spinning while clutching her belly. The title of the track, produced with Beyonce's Beyoncé ace Boots, is derived from the detailed handwork voguers use to frame their faces as they dance, as twigs explained  in an interview with Complex. Voguing, like the ballroom culture that birthed the dance style, has been a way for gay men and queer people of colour to aggressively reclaim their bodies, cycling back into twigs' ideas about rebirth. What lyrics might not make explicit, her videos and movement do: illuminating the multifarious ways in which a woman — a black woman — understands and owns her body, sexuality and creativity. The film accompanying M3LL155X opens on the wrinkled, smiling face of restaurateur and creative icon Michèle Lamy, who is tattooed, older and unbothered, and the muse and partner to fashion designer Rick Owens. Later, twigs moves through vignettes that show her as a sex doll, seductress, pregnant, in the club with her girls, being watched by a man as she dances solo to trembling down a runway with a crew of voguers. The mood flips between the skin-crawling sci-fi of Jonathan Glazer's succubus film Under The Skin and the bubblegum spunk of early '00s girl groups like 3LW and Cleopatra. What twigs is interested in, above all, is mastery. Her idea of mastery involves ownership of her craft, but is mindfully tempered with the knowledge that she is one of many voices. twigs appears to understand that mainstream culture pins her as artist zero for voguing (and baby hairs) and she counters cultural myopia by continually naming her teachers and collaborators: Wet Wipez, Benjamin Milan, Derek Prodigy. She maintains co-producer credits on her tracks (although, as MIA, Bjork and Missy Elliott have noted of their work, credit often goes to the men who produce with her, like Tic and Arca). For some, it matters profoundly that twigs centers black men in her videos. We increasingly see twigs behind the camera as director as well (in additionto many of her recent videos, she developed that crazy piece for Google Glass as well). All of which is to say that the EP takes the ur-feminist mantra of ""the personal is political"" as a starting point. Indeed, after the tiresome reams of ""is she or isn't she?"" thinkpieces dissecting Beyoncé, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Taylor Swift and other figures that commodify feminist rhetoric, twigs makes the strongest case for the feminist pop star proper, standing up (for now) to the checklist scrutiny of ""ur fav is problematic"" culture. Role models aren't universal, but if we need a feminist pop star, then twigs is it.","As a creative package, M3LL155X is unimpeachable; a high-concept piece of work that's evocative, accessible and transgressive. It builds on FKA twigs' previous work, exploring ideas of psychic and interpersonal dominance and submission, but drills down almost completely into self.

Hide Before Dinner,F ingers,by: J. Edward Keyes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff1b1335d7bf169a024/1:1/w_160/8e4c194d.jpg,2015-08-18 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20909-hide-before-dinner/,Blackest Ever Black,"In the phenomenon known as ""spirit photography,"" which rose to prominence in the 19th century, ghosts are said to be captured on film by unsuspecting cameramen during the course of a normal day’s shooting. Some of them are clearly the result of double exposure or trickery—the photographer William H. Mumler built a career on such forgeries—but the most effective ones have an eerie realism, as if you’re catching a momentary glimpse into another, darker world that exists just below the surface of our own. That’s more or less the effect of listening to Hide Before Dinner, the debut LP from the Australian group F ingers. That’s largely because each of its seven songs strictly adhere to their own cadaverous aesthetic: spider-web guitars billow and glisten, cheap synths drip like melting icicles, and Carla dal Forno—who, like F ingers’ Tarquin Manek, is also a member of the gloomy electronic outfit Tarcar—sings as if she’s in a death trance, emotionless and distant. That kind of deliberate spookiness in clumsier hands can feel affected or, worse, just dull, but Hide Before Dinner is instead distinctly chilling, mostly because del Forno, Manek, and Samuel Karmel seem to be following specific, supernatural sheet music. Opener ""Escape Into the Bushes"" starts like something from the Cure’s Faith, with a mournful, two-chord guitar pattern ringing out in pitch-black open air. But the minute del Forno enters, it becomes something else. The words she’s singing are indistinct, but that hardly matters: she sings them like they’re the familiar intro to some occult ritual—purposeful, reverent, and with grim anticipation. Whatever weird conjuring is about to take place, del Forno’s determined tone implies that it’s happened before, and there’s no stopping it from happening again. That mood carries throughout Dinner. There’s not much to ""Mum’s Caress After Trip"" beyond a ghoul-calliope keyboard line and del Forno’s baleful alto, but it inches under the skin. Del Forno sounds like she’s moved past sorrow into something worse—depressive catatonia—and the music’s ruthless blankness seems to mirror the condition of her spirit. ""Useless Treasure"" takes this same aesthetic of emptiness and stretches it out to a full seven minutes. Here, del Forno’s voice is lacquered with effects and then stretched and twisted, lurching zombie-like through blue bars of bass. There are echoes of the same funereal mood that pervaded Nico’s Marble Index, but compared to F ingers’ whispery instrumentation and miles of cold empty air, that album seems like an exercise in maximalism. The title track milks a simple, four-chord minor-key guitar line for all it’s worth, dragging it miserably across the song’s six minutes, del Forno’s suffocated vocals so far in the background it sounds like she’s singing from another room, downstairs, beneath a thick wool blanket. F ingers are even more disquieting when they purposefully ratchet up the darkness. The electronic wind chimes that ripple throughout ""Tantrum Time"" sound like they’re being stirred up by a warm night breeze outside the devil’s back door, and del Forno’s diced-up and detuned vocals are distinctly menacing; as the song progresses, it slowly fills with more and more digital apparitions—warped bass tones, suffocating static—summoning more horror than dread. Because its primary goal is sustaining a mood rather than delivering concrete songs, Hide Before Dinner works best when taken as a whole, like outsider art from the afterlife. It’s a bleak and focused exercise in misery—traveling music for a long boat ride down the river Styx.","The debut LP from the Australian group F ingers features a cadaverous aesthetic: spider-web guitars billow and glisten, cheap synths drip like melting icicles, and Carla dal Forno sings as if she’s in a death trance, emotionless and distant.

Nephew in the Wild,Advance Base,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd6c0084474cd0c1b4a/1:1/w_160/19517594.jpg,2015-08-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20889-nephew-in-the-wild/,Orindal,"Growing up isn't easy. Just ask Owen Ashworth. Under the name Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Ashworth spent over a decade giving voice to the anxieties of young misfits with battery-powered keyboards serving as his primary accompaniment. His best songs during these years were miniature bildungsromans, richly detailed portraits of characters fighting to achieve adulthood despite personal failings, everyday struggles, and diminished horizons. By the end of his run as CFTPA, this tension between immaturity and responsibility had reached its logical apex: parenthood. The songs on CFTPA's 2009 swan song*,* Vs. Children, read like cautionary tales*—*it's an album populated by absent fathers, abandoned mothers, and the children hanging in the balance. Having all but exhausted the artistic possibilities built into the Casiotone name, Ashworth rebranded himself as Advance Base in 2011 and set to work de-modernizing his sound. He's now more likely to reach for a Fender Rhodes over a Casio SK-1 and has been studying time-tested pop songcraft, as his recent covers of classic rock and gospel artists attest. His debut as Advance Base, 2012's A Shut-In's Prayer, felt like a natural extension of his previous work, 10 short vignettes soundtracked by charmingly homespun downer-pop. Nephew in the Wild continues along this same path, employing the warm sonics of vintage gear in service of Ashworth's storytelling. Many of the longstanding hallmarks of his sound can be found here*—twinkling melodies, sustained minor chords—*though everything feels a bit looser this time around. Ashworth leans on electric piano for most of the lead parts, with guitar, autoharp, synthesized mellotron, and the occasional analog drum machine filling things out. The most striking change, however, is Ashworth's vocals. After years of singing with a flat intonation that gave his voice the tenor of a resigned sigh, on many of Nephew in Wild's songs, Ashworth pushes himself to be more expressive, with results that are more tuneful, if still every bit as charmingly gruff. Musically, Nephew in the Wild feels like a logical progression from Ashworth's past work; lyrically, however, it isn't always as clear of a step forward. Most of the album's narratives focus on flinty Midwesterners coping with decidedly adult problems: addiction, jealousy, dead-end jobs. These characters feel slightly out of reach for Ashworth and their stories often lack the depth and novelistic detail for which he's known. The post-collegiate malaise of CFTPA characters felt real*—*you could imagine them pulling up a barstool next to you and unburdening themselves of their troubles. By way of comparison, the characters on Nephew in the Wild never quite come into focus. But then there's ""Kitty Winn"", the album's final and best song. Over a simple, lullaby-like melody, Ashworth details the joys of married life and parenthood as he looks back on the recklessness of his youth. The song is a clear outlier in Ashworth's catalog; here melancholy takes a backseat to lucid, unguarded sincerity. Summing up the difference between then and now, Ashworth gingerly sings, ""I'm not out looking for something/ I haven't found/ You won't see me around/ I've got a family now."" He sounds like a man who's managed to navigate life's pitfalls, arriving at the contentment that so often eludes his characters. On ""Kitty Winn"" it feels like Ashworth finds his footing as Advance Base, delivering a song that's as affecting as his best work even if there's little that's ""painfully alone"" about it. Growing up might not be easy but it seems like Owen Ashworth is getting the hang of it.","Under the name Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Owen Ashworth spent over a decade giving voice to the anxieties of young misfits with battery-powered keyboards serving as his primary accompaniment.

Drought Season 3,BernerThe Jacka,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9eea9e61561daa64aa/1:1/w_160/1b6f8e32.jpg,2015-08-18 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20844-drought-season-3/,The ArtistBern One,"When 37-year-old rapper the Jacka was killed earlier this year in East Oakland, he'd been on the verge of a modest resurgence. The initial arc of his solo career, which began with 2001's Jacka of the Mob Figaz and peaked eight years later with 2009's Tear Gas, was one of the most prolific auteurs of the 2000s. A peerless writer with a distinct sound, a gift for vivid prose, and a powerful moral conscience, his best material received little attention at his apex. (At least on a national level—within the Bay Area and its satellite cities, he's on his way to matching Mac Dre as a regional legend.) After a fallow period in the early 2010s, Jacka released his official Tear Gas follow-up, What Happened to the World, in 2014. Though his momentum had slowed, his writing was as strong as it had ever been. Drought Season 3, his first posthumous release and the third in his series of collaborative albums with fellow Bay Area rapper Berner, proves this was no fluke; there was plenty of gas left in the tank when Jacka's life was tragically cut short this past February. This tape's prequel, Drought Season 2, was one of the last great albums of the Jacka's initial creative run. But at a time when his career should have been peaking commercially, the internet was wreaking havoc. Album sales were at their nadir, and popular regional stars like Jacka suddenly sat in the shadow of viral sensations like Lil B, whose prescient understanding of meme-marketing gave him a leg up outside his native Bay Area. And while Jacka had long sustained himself by charging for features, the Internet's clear-glass window into the Bay Area scene made it so bootlegs and guest verses buried his official catalog amidst a nebulous cloud of unofficial material. At the same time, he began to nurse a codeine addiction. Initially, he appreciated syrup's effect on his vocal style, but as time wore on, it began to detach his words and flow from the groove. By the time Drought Season 3 was recorded, his voice no longer felt as present. Its wispier texture seems seconds from evaporating. On the album, this weightlessness detracts only when the Jacka aims for menace, as on the overdriven guitars of ""45""; his reflective moments remain convincing, ghosted vocals camouflaging complex emotions and hard-earned wisdom in a dreamlike reverie. Despite this effervescence, his writing is sharp enough to cut glass. It's not just that he doesn't waste words; each statement is saturated with meaning, each deceptively simple lyric charged with purpose, its wider implications left to echo over each successive line. His passing looms over the proceedings; lyrics recorded before his death take on portentous connotations. On ""One Sound"", he laments the catch-22 of success: ""I just want to make you proud/ But you'd rather see me gunned down."" It's a sentiment echoed by Husalah's chorus on ""Win"": ""When you start gettin' money and these suckers start hating/ Sometimes when you win you lose."" The Jacka's take on street rap is an urgent one charged by violence, anchored by realism that could verge on the despondent. Underlying it all is a struggle to stay sane in a fallen world, one marked by betrayal (""'Cause niggas got rich and ain't show us how"") that is unsparing in its indictment of the wider world's complicity (""Where killing made it safe for y'all to walk around""). A stance of perpetual resistance in the face of the world's cruelty—a cruelty in which he is complicit and compromised—is his eternal subject. That he doesn't fold under its weight, even as the drugs numbed his pain, is a reflection of his abiding Muslim faith, a radicalized race consciousness (""Everywhere I've ever been they treat the blacks, unfair""), and confidence in his art—a trust in truth as a liberating force. On its musical surface, Drought Season 3 is one of the smoothest rap releases of the year—appropriate for a collaboration with Berner, who has membership in Wiz Khalifa's more commercially-relevant Taylor Gang. The production is lush, colorful, and the dominant rap style throughout its guest-heavy tracklist—give or take Freeway's urgent mania—is one of half-lidded nonchalance. For the uninitiated, this sleek, subtle mood music belies its depth. Expensive-sounding production has long been the m.o. of the Drought Season series. After all, these were the tapes that made Berner's name, an (ostensible) weed-dealing kingpin buying his way into hip-hop with impeccable taste in collaborators and production. But for his part, Berner is no longer the cipher he once was. His flow, which previously relied upon a halting cadence that sounded As If He Were Rapping In Title Case, now rolls off his tongue in a more effortless legato. His lyrics have also deepened in both his attraction to arresting imagery (""I can see my stones glowing in the limousine tint"") to an emotional potency that seems, well, Jacka-inspired in its multiplicity of meaning: ""We die young but this here forever/ Leave my daughter a letter, don't believe what they tell you."" But while Berner's lyrical contributions here mark a substantial step forward, he's taken a step back in shaping the album's sound, which owes more to Jacka's camp than usual. It's most evident glancing at the record's guest list, which suggests an emotional send-off from his closest friends. For an independent artist working outside the major label system, Jacka's extended crew was built upon strategic alliances, but sustained due to stronger bonds: Ampichino, an Akron, Ohio-based rapper who collaborated with Jacka on two albums as the Devilz Rejects and frequently brought him to perform in the Midwest; Rydah J. Klyde and Husalah, the most active members of Jacka's group the Mob Figaz; Freeway, the sympatico former Roc-A-Fella rapper who bonded with the Jacka over their shared identity as Muslims. The guests pay their respects in varied ways. On ""Drought Season"", Joe Blow, the most accomplished artist on Jacka's The Artist record label, unleashes a flurry of syllables in a controlled, laconic style that celebrates Jacka's legacy through breathless formal architecture. ""Die Young"", a remake of Cormega's street classic ""They Forced My Hand"", features Oakland legend Richie Rich, a rapper who was signed to Def Jam in the mid-1990s. He addresses his time in the spotlight in a way that could as easily speak to Jacka's own ambivalence to the industry: ""I ate with Russell Simmons, so how could I be local?/ But a lot of that bullshit, I just couldn't go for."" Cormega appears on ""Whole Thang"", his understated prose taking on deeper implications: ""I was one amongst many, few remain."" But it's Jacka's longtime partner Husalah who captures the album's purposeful spirit, on ""Win"": ""As little kids took an oath to this criminal movement/ Hoping this song redeem our souls and wake you up like a rooster."" Or perhaps that honor belongs to Jacka himself, who raps on the title track: ""I try to end this with who I began with."" Indeed, it's the Jacka's purposeful ideology—scattered jewels throughout the tape which imprint themselves upon the psyche long after the song ends—that makes this a nourishing listen. The album's most revelatory moment comes on the hidden bonus track, ""So Much Pain"". With a beat that sounds like sun breaking through storm clouds, it opens with an affecting turn from Berner (""Thinking 'bout my mother, I'm screaming 'fuck cancer'"") before jumping to one of the most compelling verses of Jacka's career. His truest skill as an artist was the ability to compress a world and worldview onto the head of a pin, and this song is a platonic ideal: opening with a scene of betrayal, he slips to tormented guilt, an indictment of the system, and an affirmation of religious faith that remains as vivid as his street stories: ""I know I'm blessed the way you manifest a hopeless mind, into an open eye/ Never seen a god in the open sky, but I read the signs so I know you are, right there, unseen like the air you feel/ On your skin, unseen like the evil djinn, you know I kneel."" His verse ends in what may as well be his career's statement of purpose (""All I try to do is make it pop, somewhere/ All my fallen soldiers, dead or locked, you'll live again""). The effect is overwhelming, a moment of crystalline clarity, a flash of light. And as suddenly the light recedes, as Carey Stacks, a Seattle protege, returns to the here-and-now, to his immediate vicinity, to the concrete threats of the world in front of him: ""Two feet on the ground, both eyes open.""","When 37-year-old rapper the Jacka was killed earlier this year in East Oakland, he'd been on the verge of a modest resurgence. Drought Season 3, his first posthumous release and the third in his series of collaborative albums with fellow Bay Area rapper Berner, proves there was plenty of gas left in the tank when his life was tragically cut short.

High,Royal Headache,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af19c0084474cd0c19f1/1:1/w_160/3ec14bfe.jpg,2015-08-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20746-high/,What's Your Rupture?,"A recent Royal Headache show at the Sydney Opera House got stopped by police. During ""Down the Lane"", fans crashed the stage en masse, and when the chorus hit, they sang it as hard as they could. The scene became more raucous as the band sped into ""Girls"", and that's when cops eventually muscled the crowd off stage. A woman who'd eluded the wall of neon-vested officers took the mic and said, ""I love you, Shogun."" She was speaking to the band's sweaty, shirtless frontman who'd just been singing his heart out, lost somewhere in the mass of bodies. Royal Headache have earned this beer-slinging, shout-along adulation fair and square. The songs of 2012's Royal Headache were catchy, loud, fuzzy, and frantic, and Shogun's voice has absurd range, plenty of force, and soul. It took three years to follow up on this debut, and with High they waste no time charging back in. On opener ""My Own Fantasy"", Shogun belts ""I used to live in a world of rock'n'roll and tons of girls!"" over a chugging, high-power intro. At a glance, it seems he's going through rock-god motions—romanticizing guitar music while extolling the virtues of fucking multiple strangers. Really, though, the song is about that bubble finally bursting—the sudden, cold feeling of loneliness even while fans are singing along and dancing all around you. If there's an underlying sense of dissatisfaction here, it's safe to assume it might have something to do with the band's emotional state over the past year. In one interview, Shogun said he broke the band up due to their ""dysfunctional"" dynamic. (It was later clarified that they weren't breaking up after all.) In a statement, he said the whole album is ""about someone I don't see anymore."" The open wounds of relationship turmoil fuel High. The band are frenzied on ""Need You"", one of the best songs in their repertoire (buoyed significantly by Gabrielle de Giorgio's organ line). It's a song about professing love to no avail and eventually having those feelings decay into fruitless obsession. On ""Another World"", Shogun accuses the person he's with of judging him for superficial reasons. Both songs are as melodic and upbeat as anything on their debut. Shogun labors over his vocals in the recording process, and his care shows. He could easily soul-scream all over the place, but instead he holds off on the high notes until the perfect moment comes around. He simmers calmly while addressing someone running scared from new love on ""Wouldn't You Know"". He's dismissive and contemptuous on ""Garbage"". When he does let loose, it's almost disorienting. He belts over and over during ""Love Her If I Tried"", and just when he appears to be going at full power, he seems to momentarily unhinge his jaw for one enormous, cathartic high note. They still thrive on adrenaline and huge sing-along choruses, and ""High"" and ""Electric Shock"" deliver the dependable goods. They're not just going through the motions, though. ""Carolina"", with its acoustic underpinnings, is a surprisingly pastoral plea. The hook is indelible, stirring memories of other people singing the words ""sweet Caroline"". As ever, it's catchy and full of emotion. Royal Headache have taken steps forward since their last album—they’ve cleaned up their production and diversified their songwriting. Ultimately, though, the important bits are intact: the passion, the power, and the hooks that demand being shouted joyfully.","The Australian garage rock band gained an adoring cult with the catchy, loud, fuzzy, and frantic songs of their 2012 debut. Three years later, lead singer Shogun might have worked to temper his powerful soul shout and the production is cleaner, but the songs are just as catchy and full of emotion.

Depression Cherry,Beach House,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aed09d034d5c69bf45f4/1:1/w_160/9c17ddf5.jpg,2015-08-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20691-depression-cherry/,Bella UnionMistletoneSub Pop,"If you view a band as a long-term artistic project, then Beach House have always been perfect. Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally have done everything right: They’ve found the ideal balance of dim, lush tones; their sound progresses at a graceful, even clip; they leave just the right amount of time between albums. Even their name is perfect: Beach houses are rickety, inviting spaces that, by nature of their existence, live outside of time. If a beach house were to change noticeably—if that paperback you left there last May isn’t still sitting upside-down and open to the same page, gathering dust on the same shelf you left it—you'd be upset. Part of the joy of yielding to their luxuriant music, then, comes from sensing the comfort of these solid borders framing it. Their music explores the sadness of pleasure, and the pleasure of sadness, and with each record they deepen this inquiry a little more. Their newest, Depression Cherry, might have the silliest, or at least the most inexplicable, title in their catalog (compare it with the euphonious clarity of Teen Dream, or Bloom, or Devotion), but in every other sense it’s another impeccably measured step forward. Their albums might be an ideal soundtrack for daydreaming, but Scally and Legrand seem remarkably clear-headed about their work. The most noticeable changes they make here are adjustments to lighting and angles. They’ve stripped back the booming drums of Bloom and boosted the synth and guitars, giving a new physicality to ethereal sounds. On ""Sparks"", Scally’s vintage-organ keyboard patch is dissonant, mixed right up front, and a little uncomfortable, like a crick in the song’s neck. The slide guitars have a brittle edge, suggesting the involvement of actual human fingers. The backing vocals are mixed a few inches closer, so they sound less like a celestial choir than an earthbound crew of worried voices whispering secrets. These minor tweaks result in a sound that retains the band’s grand theatricality, but also lets you smell the grease paint a little more, feel the itch of the Victorian-era fabrics on your skin. When Legrand sings ""Tender is the night for a broken heart/ Who will dry your eyes when it falls apart?"" on the sweeping mid-album highlight ""Space Song"", it registers as exactly the sort of high-flown Romantic soliloquy she’s always preferred. But then a buzzing, dinky-sounding synthesizer burbles up into the track, wandering onstage like a comic foil. Like the old drum machines they prefer, touches like these give the music an air of innocence, evoking silent films, community theater productions, puppet shows. Legrand and Scally have grown so adept at spinning dreams that they can turn all the lights on the set and still dazzle us. ""Trance is a big part of our thing,"" Scally said in their recent Pitchfork interview. ""We'll repeat a part for three hours while we wait for the next piece to fall into place."" On Depression Cherry, you can almost hear these dawning moments as they happen, with a palpable click. The bone structures of these songs are closer to dance tracks—with builds, drops, peaks, and switch-ups—than the flourishes of traditional pop songwriting, and this frame allows Beach House to stretch out and telescope their songs without getting lost. On ""PPP"", Legrand alternates between a pinwheeling melody and a more open-ended, spoken-word performance, with Scally’s arpeggiated guitar stitching a visible, silvery thread through both. Underpinning everything, as always, is the drone. Legrand’s finger almost never lets up on a chord’s root or fifth note in a Beach House song. You can see her live, doing this—she keeps one hand pressed on the keyboard at all times, grounding the song even as her vocal soars and Scally’s guitar glitters. On Depression Cherry’s opening track ""Levitation"", a lovely saturated D chord opens slowly out of a faint high-F# drone, which never disappears from the song’s edges. The omnipresence of these drones in their songs suggests that their fantasies have a fatalistic tint: The drone is always there, the hum of the air conditioner that’s too loud in your vacation condo, the fly that won’t stop buzzing. That buzzing note is as legible on Bloom’s ""Irene"" as it is on many of the songs here, and it’s why we feel our gut tugged to Earth and our skulls lifted skyward when Legrand’s voice reaches for her highest notes. One of the first lines Legrand sings on the album, from ""Levitation"", is ""There’s a place I want to take you."" Isolated, it’s an emblematic Beach House lyric—a promise of transportation that leaves the destination unspecified. In fact, it doesn’t even promise arrival: she just wants to take you there. It is this melancholia, the exquisite ache of being nearly aloft, that Beach House has perfected. With every album, someone observes—rightly—that the band has never sounded exactly this full and soaring before. From their muted first two records, into their Sub Pop debut Teen Dream and then Bloom, Beach House always seem to be just leaving the ground as we catch them. It’s a trick of the light, and it speaks to the sadness that makes their music linger: Transporting experiences, they gently remind us, are always round-trip tickets back to everyday life.","Beach House's newest album, Depression Cherry, might have the silliest, or at least the most inexplicable, title in their catalog, but in every other sense it’s another impeccably measured step forward.

Remember the Life Is Beautiful,Gonno,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc2b1335d7bf1699fd2/1:1/w_160/c3ed5c08.jpg,2015-08-17 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20873-remember-the-life-is-beautiful/,Endless Flight,"The opening song on Gonno's debut album, Remember the Life Is Beautiful, is called ""Hippies"". I don't know what the attitude towards hippies is in Gonno's native Japan, but there's no doubt in my mind that the song is meant sympathetically. Its backmasked guitars waft like dandelion tufts across an open field, and its bass tone is as reassuringly heavy as a hand-me-down blanket. It's ambient techno the way it's meant to be made, fleshed out with acid lines and updated with live drums, and the way it develops is so effortless—building to a softly rounded climax and then rolling back downhill—that it feels less like a work of art than a product of nature. One place the hippie ideology has continued to flourish in dance culture is in the so-called Balearic scene, the fuzzily defined style of music that grew out of Ibiza's discotheques in the 1980s, when DJs like Alfredo and Jose Padilla bricolaged together an eclectic, sunset-friendly style out of ambient, dub, yacht rock, krautrock, acid house, and anything else that fit the mood. Gonno's Balearic bona fides are solid. After years of making relatively rugged, stripped-down techno, he took an abrupt turn in 2011 and wound up on Ibiza's very own International Feel, ground zero for the current decade's Balearic revival. On Remember the Life Is Beautiful, he extends his emotive, exploratory approach to album length, the optimal way to engage with it—not as a series of singles but in an extended session that unfolds like a meal among friends at dusk. Remember isn't strictly a ""dance"" album, although warm-up DJs will find plenty of copacetic material here, and a few tracks are relatively peak-time in their energy. ""Stop"", with its ragged hi-hats and triplet bass, might be a vintage Border Community track, and ""Revoked"", with its chimes, arpeggios, and chugging groove, is part DFA and part Carl Craig. Four Tet and Caribou's hybridized live drums and machine beats inform a few tracks here, as do their photosensitive quirks and generally wistful air. The uptempo cuts are the exceptions; most songs are stolidly midtempo, if not outright sluggish. In ""The Worst Day Ever"", which creeps along at 100 beats per minute, small plucked sounds pile up into a shimmering whole that verges on sensory overload; the equally dreamy ""Confusion"", a hair faster, affects a majestically relaxed groove. The sonic balance he achieves, between ethereal vibes and physical modeling, is tricky enough; few artists can project a sense of chill that's so convincing. Fittingly, some of the most powerful songs do without drums entirely. ""Beasts in Your Mind"" runs Göttsching's arpeggios through the Cocteaus' delay pedals, while ""Already Almost"" goes for a midnight swim in Harold Budd's blue lagoon. And on ""The Island I've Never Been"", he swaps out the drums for clanking ship's bells, climaxing with a green flash of arpeggiated synths before succumbing to dusk again. It's a wonderful summation of the album's strengths. Remember the Life Is Beautiful isn't a triumph simply because it so elegantly captures the Balearic style; it's that it so elegantly captures its spirit.","Gonno is a Japanese producer with ties to the eclectic and sunset-friendly Ibiza Balearic scene.

Singing in a low, grainy voice that sounds like Captain Beefheart, Cloud played garage rock and noise as though the Sonics and Sonic Youth were the same band, adding drone and distortion to his three-minute rave-ups and pop tunes. His guitar usually sported only one string, two if he was feeling adventurous, and onstage he transmogrified into the raging id to Nashville's massive ego: the wild, demented offspring chained in the basement, never spoken of in polite company. Cloud's handful of records comprise a modest catalog that barely sold in the U.S. but established him as something of a hero in Scandinavia. There is a strong you had to be there, man aspect to artists like Cloud, whose charisma is most intense onstage and yet whose live shows don't always translate to YouTube clips or vinyl. And yet, even without the secondhand stories of onstage shenanigans, there is a great deal to admire in his brand of grouty garage rock, from his rusted-tailpipe vocals to the Gospel of Power's grimy reimaginings of '60s pop riffs and grooves. Today Is the Day That They Take Me Away surveys the breadth of Cloud's relatively brief recording career. He may have started performing at local record stores back in the '70s and his previous band the Psychotic Night Auditors may have been banned for life from the Springwater, but he finally released his debut album in 1999, followed by three more studio albums, one compilation, and a live album recorded just down I-40 at GonerFest in Memphis. Rather than mapping out the development of his sound over 16 tracks (27 on the digital version), Today Is the Day instead reveals an artist who had already refined his aesthetic and had utmost confidence in its viability over the years. In fact, he makes that small patch of garage rock sound unreasonably large: ""Party Doll"" sounds like Buddy Holly back from the dead, playing guitar until his hands literally fall off, while the title track layers his paranoid ramblings into a kind of incantatory warning that picks up where Napoleon XIV left off. We've heard songs like ""Bimbo"" and ""400 Girls"" before, reiterations of omnivorous male sexuality that innervated early rock'n'roll but soon became a tired ritual, a means of oppression rather than liberation. But there's something so exaggerated in Cloud's delivery that the songs sound like parodies: hetero-dude desire exploded to Tex Avery proportions. Cloud sings so often about unattainable women that romantic longing becomes the de facto theme of this collection, undermining the jokiness of ""Thieving Love Bandit"" and ""Damn Damn Damn Damn"" and suggesting a very real sense of loneliness motivating these songs. Today Is the Day That They Take Me Away is an epitaph for an unusual career, because Dave Cloud died earlier this year, age 58, of melanoma. He never achieved the fame and fortune many believed was his due, but his true destiny was to be Nashville's glorious cult icon. He obviously relished the role, and this affectionate tribute reveals an artist who managed—amazingly enough—to remake rock'n'roll in his own image.","Dave Cloud was a cult artist in Nashville, playing the raging id to Nashville's massive ego: the wild, demented offspring chained in the basement, never spoken of in polite company.

Dry Food,Palehound,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb0ea9e61561daa64c3/1:1/w_160/3d31fc14.jpg,2015-08-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20869-dry-food/,Exploding in Sound,"On 2013's Bent Nail EP, Palehound's Ellen Kempner sang about taking a carrot for a pet in order to stave off late-teen loneliness. She makes similarly childlike gestures on her debut album. ""You made beauty a monster to me, so I'm kissing all the ugly things I see,"" she seethes at an ex in a so there voice on Dry Food's title track. It's the most deliciously futile form of revenge and reclamation: doing the opposite. Dry Food is partially a product of the 21-year-old Boston-dwelling songwriter's first big breakup—the deeper kind of solitude of having known and lost someone. Its sound captures the Herculean efforts required to survive the ensuing slump: ""All I need's a little sleep and I'll be good to clean and eat,"" she sings in a medicated sigh on ""Easy"", her acoustic guitar rising and dipping with the methodical pace of someone trying to make a new routine stick. But like her former camp counselor and roommate, Speedy Ortiz's Sadie Dupuis, Kempner never lets a sad jam wallow: she kicks the end of the song into shape with a zippy electric guitar motif and some awkward, itchy squall. It's followed by ""Cinnamon"", which takes the opposite tack, hooked around the kind of amiable, waterlogged psych burble that Mac DeMarco noodles in his sleep. Kempner sings dreamily about her worst self-defeating impulses, but is stirred from her reverie by a divine revelation that her life is becoming ""a pretty lie"". Frantic drums force the song somewhere agitated and ascendant, but instead of bursting into some bright new phrase, the furor falls away like a captivating slo-mo bellyflop. Kempner has a knack for these odd little about-turns that elevate Dry Food above the usual plainspoken acoustic indie fare. And like her old roommate, she often obscures her intentions between appealingly twisty language. ""Mouth ajar watching cuties hit the half pipe/ I only feel half ripe/ Around healthier folk,"" she sings on ""Healthier Folk"". She distils her disgust at her own post-breakup malaise with perfectly understated images: ""The hair that's in my shower drain/ Has been clogging up my home,"" she sings on ""Dixie"". ""And I try to scoop it up, but I wretch until I'm stuck."" It's maybe the most straightforward song here, just fingerpicked acoustic guitar, but she messes at it like a cat dragging a mouse into a dark nook. Saddest of all is closer ""Seakonk"", where Kempner protests that she's not alone, actually; she's home watching TV with her parents, sister and their dogs. There's a blithe fairground pirate ship sway to the song, which she closes with a jaunty ""doo doo doo"" that could have come from the credits of one of the cartoons she's watching—only she lets the final note deflate with a groan. It's at this point that Dry Food confronts the point it's been evading: kidding yourself is no way to recover, and comfort offers little impetus to move on. Palehound's discomfiting, unflinching debut suggests she knew it all along.","The debut LP from Boston indie rock band Palehound is inspired by leader Ellen Kempner's breakup.

Transgressor,Tunde Olaniran,by: Jia Tolentino,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b01713d197565213a3d8/1:1/w_160/520371bb.jpg,2015-08-17 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20941-transgressor/,Quite Scientific,"Tunde Olaniran, the jarringly multitalented artist from Flint, Mich., is a one-man band minus the instruments. Often described as a rapper, he's just as much a singer, and his skill in both arenas is prodigious. When he sings, he vaults between octaves, sliding from tragicomic fluttery falsetto to a luxuriant R&B tenor to a taut, imperious belt; rapping, he flips from wild Danny Brown shriek, herby Big Sean bounce, and a Father-ish benzo disaffectation. All told, Olaniran's got at least a dozen voices, and he moves between them without any sign of conscious effort—or any seeming consciousness that what he's doing is quite so wild. And this, combined with his equally startling flexibility with genre, makes Olaniran's debut album Transgressor feel like it was recorded by a dissonant, flourishing collective, rather than a man from Flint, an LGBTQ activist with a day job at Planned Parenthood, whose only vocal training is choir practice to boot. Born to a Nigerian Christian immigrant father and an atheist, Socialist union organizer mother, Olaniran was discovered by the Berlin-based producer Phon.O off a MySpace track in 2008. He toured Europe briefly, stopping in the cities where he'd lived when his father was in the military. Since then, he's been a mainstay of and bridge between the scrappy Flint and Detroit musical scenes—he's hands-on to the point of designing costumes for his backup dancers and choreographing their routines—and his collaborators now are steadfastly local. On 2014's Yung Archetype, his under-hyped idea factory of an EP, Olaniran brought on Detroit R&B singer James Linck; Transgressor features even more Motor City, including the raucous kitsch-punk act Flint Eastwood, the cross-racial hip-hop buddy duo Passalacqua, and Invincible, a female rapper who's Jewish and queer. His interest in genre and identity is central enough that it inspired both his album and EP titles, and he's built an experimental, leftist, theatrically artistic, streetwise pop debut, as close to Dirty Projectors as it is to Yeezus as it is to some dystopian alley-cat cabaret. His sound is pastiche reaching for synthesis, falling short when it lacks a sense of stakes. Olaniran's assets are so plentiful that he tosses them around almost forgetfully: without a clear aesthetic target, his shape-shifting can feel haphazard or unedited. But, when he is motivated by a clear sense of intention—when the disparate elements in each track stand out at right angles, subvert each other, throw each other into relief—the album glows. This intention, like everything about Olaniran, takes wildly varying forms. He's a conscious writer, to begin with. His bouncy rap track ""Diamonds"", with its singsong, arch delivery and a first verse that name-checks Taco Bell, could sound like Das Racist roleplay on a careless first listen; one more time, and it's a painfully astute inhabitation of a story about the slow, mundane, systematic disenfranchisement of the American poor. His activism is out front, too, on ""Everyone's Missing"", a beautiful and spooky lament in which Olaniran sound like a prophet on the chorus, a radio crooner on the bridge hook, and then five different rappers on a verse that ramps up with the line ""It mocks me when I'm wishful/ Grab my guts by the fistful""—""it"" here being both hope and death by police—and then tosses off, ""MLK was respectable/ Still gunned down in that motel."" But Olaniran's even better when he's elbowing people aesthetically rather than via commentary. There's a lot of new space ready to be claimed in R&B right now, and he's as sonically progressive as he is in verse. His punky, flamboyant, radical edge is immensely satisfying when it's got a tough, pretty melody to play against, and some of the best moments of the album come from TV on the Radio-esque, flag-waving, desperate, deeply-felt rock toplines. On the standout ""Let Me Go"", his generous hook unfurls down in spirals: ""Once upon a time, I was yours, you were mine/ And you had me hook, line and sinker."" The track's not about romance, but about Olaniran's father (who happened to give him a name that translates, remarkably, to ""The spirit of the father is gone but will return again to bring back the wealth that was granted to your family."") The whole thing's tough and bombastic, as big as Funeral, as punk as hell. Olaniran leans on melody again to great effect on ""Up & Down"", another song with an unexpected subject—his fluctuating weight—that distorts his harmony while spare apocalyptic trap drums build in the back. There's 808s aplenty on Transgressor; Olaniran uses a lot of what the kids are into, to occasionally flat effect. There's an exact Hudson Mohawke facsimile in the highly catchy if somewhat ""Reading Rainbow""-esque single ""Namesake"", and at multiple points on the album, the progression is metronome-regular: there goes the trap clap, the skitter, the stomping wobbly synth. But, just as often (on the swinging, grimy ""Run to the Gun"" and the dance track ""KYBM"", for example), Olaniran uses these elements flexibly and exactly right. Transgressor is an exceptional, aggressive, and incendiary album, in which Olaniran's idiosyncrasy feels alternately revelatory and in need of editing. He's in search of his own idiom. But when he's building—and he is building—his songs feel truly architectural: beautiful, strange structures that bomb themselves at regular intervals; rattling drives through some wild country where subversion is introduced as startling and naturally as landscape—each shift a turn around a mountain that suddenly looms.","Tunde Olaniran, the jarringly multitalented artist from Flint, Mich., sings and raps in about a dozen different voices.

E•MO•TION,Carly Rae Jepsen,by: Corban Goble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aec29d034d5c69bf45d9/1:1/w_160/1f4d0473.jpg,2015-08-17 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/,InterscopeSchoolboy,"Carly Rae Jepsen's ambition for her new album E•MO•TION could not be clearer. ""We had the biggest single in the world last time and didn't have the biggest album,"" her manager Scooter Braun told the New York Times in July, referring to her 2011 breakout hit, ""Call Me Maybe"". ""This time we wanted to stop worrying about singles and focus on having a critically acclaimed album."" It's an ambitious campaign, but the Shellback-produced opener ""Run Away With Me"" announces it with clarion synths that sound like battle-call horns: Carly Rae is at the gates with an army, hellbent on returning home with your love. In many ways, she succeeds: E•MO•TION is as solid and spotless a pop album as you're likely to hear this year, the result of several years working alongside a storied list of contributors. More than 200 tracks were workshopped in sessions with some of the pop world's most prestigious hired hands, including hitmakers Max Martin and Jack Antonoff, neither of whom made the final cut. In the end, just 12 made the album, with six more filling out the deluxe edition. The hand-picked collaborators that do appear on E•MO•TION include Sia, Devonté Hynes, and Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij, all of whom contribute excellent work (Hynes, on the twinkling Prince-inspired ballad ""All That"", and Batmanglij, on the weird, warbling ""Warm Blood""). The synth and drum programming, handled by Ariel Rechtshaid, may be his best, building off the sound he developed for Haim's Days Are Gone. I can think of a few fans and gearheads who would pay good money to have Rechtshaid break down the sounds on this album, as he's done in the past. But whatever lessons we learn from *E•MO•TION—for example, *that this palette of '80s synth sounds and Madonna hat-tips will probably endure for eternity—we don't learn much about Jepsen. The best pop stars distill attitudes and emotions into gestures so perfect they can take on a life of their own. This is why pop icons inspire endless memes: Rihanna for when we give no fucks, Beyoncé for when we're feeling imperial. We have Drake for performative vulnerability, Taylor for performative generosity. Jepsen, on the other hand, hasn't captured the Internet's imagination in the same way. Her best performance is still as a shy, boy-crazy brunette, a role she reprises on the ""driving the speed limit on the zeitgeist"" first single ""I Really Like You"". Her efforts on E•MO•TION to break new ground around this reductive portrait are fitful and unconvincing. (She told the Guardian she ""spent an entire week vaping"" to sound ""gritty"" on the song ""Your Type"", yet she sounds no different on that track than on any of the others.) Ultimately, you can listen to Carly Rae Jepsen for days and still have no idea who she is. This may seem like a surface-level concern, but it's an important one, because E•MO•TION is all surface. It's unfair to deeply scrutinize lyrics on a pop record—the goal is to write smart, but skew broad—but E•MO•TION fails to tell us who Jepsen is or wants to be. The economy of her writing is impressive, especially on songs like the shadowy ""Warm Blood"" or the booming closer ""When I Needed You"". ""LA Hallucinations"", her collaboration with members from little-known indie rock bands Zolas and Data Romance, stitches a bubblegum vocal to a no-frills electronic production. (It is also the rare pop song to include the word ""BuzzFeed."") But the album mostly feels like the conclusion of a team determined to create an unassailable pop product. That's why it falls short of its ultimate goal of setting the world on fire; for all its ironclad hooks and studio precision, Jepsen's third album, like her second, lacks the personality of the most memorable pop records. There's an unshakeable vagueness to her—her last album was simply called Kiss, and this one bears the generic title E•MO•TION, with inexplicable punctuation. It may be flooded with winning moments—the bridge on ""Gimmie Love""! the build to the last chorus on ""All That""!—but E•MO•TION as a whole sounds like a slab of blank space. If only Jepsen had written her name.","Carly Rae Jepsen's third album E•MO•TION is as solid and spotless as any pop album you're likely to hear this year, the result of several years working alongside a storied list of contributors.

Finesse the World,RetcH,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd45e6ef95969321e83/1:1/w_160/5ff0f50c.jpg,2015-08-14 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20887-finesse-the-world/,self-released,"On ""Disclaimer"", the mean-mugging opener to RetcH’s dark Finesse the World mixtape, the New Jersey rapper issues a series of warnings for listeners colored in with pop culture references: ""This ain’t no Wale, this ain’t no Makonnen/ This junkie's dying in the stairwell ‘cause the dope is potent."" It’s an abrupt introduction, a shoulder check that announces itself with its sudden sting, and it’s a fitting entrance for RetcH, who is best described as a menace. RetcH is a small-time drug dealer, a corner boy passing off product through closed-hand transactions on the block. Dealing opens doors to violent crime and petty larceny. There isn’t any of the chest beating bravado that helped mythologize drug impresarios like Reasonable Doubt-era Jay Z or (to an entirely different extent) Rick Ross. This isn’t glamorous. This is felony possession with intent to distribute. This is ""selling smack and tucking bread with your granny."" This isn’t Scarface, it’s Pusher. RetcH, or RetcHy P, first began to gain traction on the indie rap circuit with his soul-chopping 2013 mixtape, Polo Sporting Goods, which was entirely produced by Thelonious Martin. The tape, and especially the brilliantly composed ""Special Jim"", which was endorsed by Earl Sweatshirt, showcased his colorful storytelling and his angling perspective. RetcH often takes a winding approach to writing that supplements dramatic scene-setting with lesser, more arresting details. He has a keen sense for exactly what makes his stories worth telling—the visceral nature in which he presents them—and he constantly frames his verses like he’s describing a first person shooter to a blind person. But many of the soul samples on Polo Sporting Goods weren’t equipped to fully utilize his skillset. After doing a bid in county last year, RetcHy P returns better than he’s ever been, in his element, on Finesse the World, a super sinister segue into his vivid underworld. As a proud street urchin, RetcH is a poster boy for Keeping It Real, one who won’t hesitate to snuff a show-off for his jewelry just to laugh about it. On ""Still With It"", which employs the ""fame hasn’t changed me"" trope with a twist, he raps, ""Still rock polo that I stole on me/ Still fuck up niggas that done told on me."" He’s at his best when he unapologetically explores the murky depths of villainy. There were glimpses of it on Polo Sporting Goods, but, as the title implies, that tape had a focus on flair over felonies. With Finesse the World, RetcHy P fully embraces being a scoundrel. This is the darkest he’s ever been, and he rips through ominous productions from noted gloom casters A$AP P on the Boards, H.N.I.C., and Antwon Carrera. There are no moments of reprieve; this is a labyrinth of dark alleyways. Turning the corner just introduces more unscrupulous characters. Things really heat up on Finesse the World when the beats warp into sonic distillations of evil and RetcH barrels through them with a snarl. On ""Affiliation"" he locks eyes with his foes, firing literal and figurative shots in all directions over a forbidding, distorted piano riff. He writes engrossing tales about small-time drug trafficking on ""Cheap Work"", which makes use of its rumbling bass and a wailing train horn sample. RetcH is at his most venomous on the title track over grim production from H.N.I.C., rapping phrases like ""Ready to shoot the next thing that's breathing, nigga/ I'm fucking heated, a fucking heathen, policing demons"" with real fury. The deeper he crawls inside the sparse, shadowy soundscapes, the better he raps. The tape does have a somewhat singular sound, but RetcH is most at home beneath a cloak of darkness. Somehow, through all the snarling and terrorizing on Finesse the World, RetcHy P retains his knack for storytelling, penning street epics as captivating as they are chilling. He does some of his best writing on ""Amedei Procelana"", which finds him posing naked for a sketch artist and dealing during chem class. He does some of his best rapping on the A$AP P-produced ""Round Here"", where he raps in compact bursts, stressing syllables like he’s trying to rip them. When he spits, ""Nigga you could get smoked eating jerked chicken/ In front of everybody and still won't be no witness,"" the juxtaposition of his phrasing with his cadence almost makes the act seem comical. There’s even a reunion with Thelonious Martin for ""Bad Luck"", which plays like a wicked outtake from the Polo Sporting Goods sessions. But he really puts it all together on Finesse the World’s most interesting cut, ""Product of Da Block"", layering an elastic riff with one of his most ferocious flows. He opens the song with a speech that condemns friendliness in rap: ""When the fuck did everyone become so friendly… When you see me, don’t even approach me because I ain’t friendly."" It only takes one listen for that same malice to become contagious.","The New Jersey rapper RetcH, or RetcHy P, began to gain traction on the indie rap circuit with his soul-chopping 2013 mixtape, Polo Sporting Goods.

Bone Turquoise,Stern,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff9c0084474cd0c1b80/1:1/w_160/b6656915.jpg,2015-08-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20917-bone-turquoise/,New Atlantis,"Listening to Bone Turquoise, the proper debut album from the New York quartet Stern, you spend the better part of an hour waiting for the band to get loud, to go unhinged and generally to deliver the volume-heavy vexation its roster promises. Stern is the vehicle of Chuck Stern, a singer who spent a decade leading the aggressively esoteric Time of Orchids. That band tellingly hopscotched between metal labels like Relapse and imprints that embrace the avant-garde, including Cuneiform and Tzadik. Since the end of Orchids, though, he's recorded and released loose-limbed solo work under his last name. For Bone Turquoise, he at last built an elite band (and even scheduled a handful of shows) that includes Toby Driver, the mastermind of art-metal savants Kayo Dot, and two of Driver's collaborators in that outfit. But the album's only real outburst—a plangent passage of sustained feedback, roiling drums, and ringing church bells—arrives just before the end of ""Birds of Passage"", the long record's serpentine closer. Instead, for much of these nine tracks, the quartet twists meticulously, almost seductively through pop-rock songs refracted at disorienting angles. At some points, what Stern terms his ""alien pop"" band even feels wistful—surprising given the group's pedigree, sure, but certainly not without reward. Much of Stern's surprising restraint stems from the quartet's deliberate choices about dynamics and modulation. Rather than simply pivot between quiet and loud or fast and slow, this subtle group often does both at once, moving incrementally rather than aggressively. That's the most striking feature of opener ""Reliquary"", for instance, which goes from languid passages into tense interruptions and then back again. And ""Ousted"" deploys near-amoeboid motion, where every element, from the tempo to the tone, seems fluid enough to shift at any moment. No peak in volume or pace ever lasts too long. That approach allows for touches of post-rock and pop, math rock and metal inside songs where no one look overrides the others. Stern himself is a provocative lyricist and an oddly endearing singer. His words are impressionistic and evocative—""Silt/ Precious memories/ A grave matter""—and his voice, like Scott Walker's, can quickly curve from a croon to a caterwaul. His songs and his sound deserve the full-rock-band treatment. Stern, however, seems to be readjusting to the role of proper bandleader a decade since Time of Orchids split, or of turning over his songs to collaborators who tamper with them. Across the eerie drift of ""Common Carrier"", piano notes echo against arid spaghetti western guitars, and the drums circle idly through low clouds of noise and hum. It's a wonderful arrangement, but Stern chooses to sit at its rear, merging his voice with the haze instead of pushing past it. Much the same goes for ""Storm Guide"". It's a simple quatrain—""You are my storm guide/ You make it right…""—but the band's luxurious patter communicates the mood more than his near-diffident singing. And during ""The Plot"" and ""Trappings"", songs where the band zigs and zags through time signatures and textural approaches, his singing often seems to be chasing the playing, as if his songs have become so complex he's now just trying to keep up with them. Still, Stern's tunes provide ballast and borders for Toby Driver and part of his Kayo Dot crew, something that band's albums have needed badly in recent years. Bone Turquoise is a promising start for the meeting of two captivating and contrasting bandleaders. Like the best of Kayo Dot and Time of Orchids, it revels in the unexpected—to the extent that it struggles with letting accessible songs stand, every once in a while, on their own.","The New York quartet Stern is the vehicle of Chuck Stern, a singer who spent a decade leading the aggressively esoteric Time of Orchids.

Detroit's Son,Guilty Simpson,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aff8ea9e61561daa6542/1:1/w_160/4043aa8a.jpg,2015-08-14 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20915-detroits-son/,Stones Throw,"You can't mention Guilty Simpson without thinking of Detroit. The gruff rapper embodies the city's resilient spirit and, much like fellow lyricists Redman and Black Thought, he shouts out his hometown of ""the D"" every chance he gets. So while his new album, Detroit's Son, is an ode to the Motor City, it's also a chest-thumping salute to himself and a reminder of what he still hopes to accomplish. Because despite a robust discography, Guilty sounds unsatisfied on his new album, still pushing for a breakthrough. Detroit's Son follows last year's Simpson Tape EP, produced entirely by California composer Oh No, whose stampeding drum breaks worked well for Guilty's menacing flows. Guilty is more straight-laced than his contemporaries: He relies on monotone real talk that, when paired with the right blend of cinematic soul, resembles 4,5,6 era Kool G Rap without the suit-and-tie crime bravado. His style is distinctly blue-collar, correlating with his hometown's hardworking ethos. At his best, he stands apart as a low-key yeoman with a penchant for street narratives. Yet for all the work he's done in his career—his debut Ode to the Ghetto, 2010's O.J. Simpson produced by Madlib, 2011's Random Axe project with Black Milk and Sean Price, and 2012's Dice Game with producer Apollo Brown—Guilty is only as good as the beats he receives. His bars tend to recede into the music and there's no 'wow' factor with his approach. Instead, he becomes an accessory; you find yourself more interested in the instrumentals than what he's actually saying. There's no denying Guilty's intense work ethic, but 12 years after his debut on Jaylib song ""Strapped"", he still doesn't sound fully comfortable as a lyricist. D**etroit's Son was produced entirely by Katalyst, an Australian member of the Quakers collective, and his patchwork funk sets a frenetic pace. The music resembles Madlib and Paul White in a way: It sorta plods along without much structure, and the kaleidoscopic sound feels influenced by the likes of George Clinton and Sun Ra. For Detroit's Son, Katalyst applies a dark sheen that reflects Guilty's home city's gritty reputation. The layered, slow-moving ""The D"" stands out, and ""Dirty Glove"" features an excellent verse from fellow Detroit rapper Phat Kat, and the driving rhythm conveys civic despair. But like the album's other featured rappers, Kat outshines Guilty, simply because he's more energetic and lyrically nimble. On ""Blue Collar"", Guilty sounds stilted alongside Elzhi, whose complex wordplay fits more naturally with Katalyst's spacey composition. As it plays, Detroit's Son feels like a collection of songs relying too heavily on well-worn themes (""Blunts in the Air"", ""Smoking"", ""Money""). Quick tracks like ""Ghetto"", ""The Music"", and ""Beautiful Death"" seem out of place and disrupt Detroit's sequencing. ""Power Outage""—a salacious sex romp—brings the album to an awkward and abrupt ending.

Neither/Neither,The Black Dog,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb113d197565213a311/1:1/w_160/18224292.jpg,2015-08-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20870-neitherneither/,Dust Science,"Although their Warp Records peers—Aphex Twin, Autechre, LFO—are regarded as the vanguard of ""intelligent dance music,"" the Black Dog were as equally deft, playful, and rambunctious through the early half of the '90s. A track like ""Techno Playtime"", which kicked off their 1990 EP of the same name, was truth in advertising, its sleek drum programming overtaken midway by a gnarly thump like Donkey Kong let loose. But by 1995, the trio, comprised of Ken Downie, Ed Handley, and Andy Turner, split, with Handley and Turner taking the more lighthearted aspects of their sound with them when they formed Plaid. But after a decade, Downie resuscitated the Black Dog with 2005's Drexciya-inspired Silenced, teaming up with Martin and Richard Dust. Since then, there has been a slew of Black Dog albums, nearly twice as many releases as in its original incarnation. But as Stephen King's Pet Sematary once warned, a revived dog isn't necessarily the same dog. As their seventh post-Handley and Turner album, Neither/ Neither, reveals, they've gotten far darker and more negative. Or as the press release puts it: ""We are all proles now; all are expected to maintain a mental state…of uncertainty and inaction."" It makes sense that the Black Dog would grow more dour, in that both have roots in Psychick Warriors ov Gaia and Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, which trace back to early industrialists Psychic TV. The first few times through Neither/ Neither, I was also reminded of fellow '90s acts like Portishead and Boards of Canada, who returned after a decade away to far sourer times, their music reflecting a heightened sense of paranoia, anxiety, and pessimism about the world. The downtempo title track here, with its skittering hi-hats and lurching heartbeat pulse, could definitely have come off of Tomorrow's Harvest, especially when—some two minutes in—its slow-moving analog melody crests and breaks. The tricky cymbals of ""Them (Everyone Is a Liar But)"" suggest a balance between early and present Black Dog, while ""Self Organising Sealed Systems"" is bracing, visceral techno that's au courant in Berlin. But ambient tracks like ""B.O.O.K.S."" mistake aimlessness for eeriness, and the interludes neither heighten the tension nor cast more shadow over the proceedings. As a result, most of the album drifts by without much to distinguish it from its field. Tracks like ""Control Needs Time"" and ""Shut Eye"" are indistinct to the point of anonymity, making Neither/ Neither an all too-perfect soundtrack for uncertainty and inaction.","Although their Warp Records peers—Aphex Twin, Autechre, LFO—are regarded as the vanguard of ""intelligent dance music,"" the Black Dog were as equally deft, playful, and rambunctious through the early half of the '90s.

Orphaned Deejay Selek (2006-2008) EP,Aphex TwinAFX,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afc013d197565213a32e/1:1/w_160/02f739de.jpg,2015-08-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20872-orphaned-deejay-selek-2006-2008-ep/,Warp,"By God, it's looking like Aphex Twin has gone full Energizer Bunny on us—which, given his interest in robots that bang drums, actually makes perfect sense. This time last year, Richard D. James was seven years into an extended hiatus (or nine, or 13, depending upon the alias) when Warp launched a hot-air balloon emblazoned with his logo into the skies over London. Since then, the occasionally press-shy, always unpredictable artist has cranked himself up to a fever pitch, and there's no evidence that he's headed back to his hermitage any time soon. In the past year, we've been treated to a wealth of new, or at least new to us, music. First there was Syro, Aphex Twin's triumphant return. Then, just four months later, came Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2, an EP of more abstracted material, inspired by the intersection between robotics and acoustic instruments. Right around the same time, James launched a series of anonymous accounts on SoundCloud, where he unloaded more than 100 previously unreleased tracks from his voluminous archives. If the title of the new release is to be believed, we're still in archival territory. (To that end, the cover art riffs on Warp's very first release, Forgemasters' ""Track With No Name"", from 1989.) That the record is credited to AFX and not Aphex Twin is probably significant, although, as with all things related to James, there's room for interpretation. The AFX handle has come to mean different things at different periods: In the '90s, with the Analogue Bubblebath and Hangable Autobulb series, it meant rugged, percussive workouts with a touch of acid. For 2005's Analord series, it came to stand for lyrical, all-analog jams. Orphaned Deejay Selek is closer to Analord and provides a stark contrast to the labyrinthine twists of Syro. These songs soar with a burly kind of grace. But Orphaned Deejay Selek is no Analord 12. For one thing, many of the Analord releases sound positively lo-fi compared to the eight tracks here. The separation of the sounds in the mix, and the way they stake out a position in space, is nothing short of spellbinding.  He's also not kidding about the ""deejay"" part of the title: These really are some of the most straightforward pieces of music that James has put his name to in years. They're far more focused on rhythm, on that ineffable quality known as the groove, than either of his other recent releases. James dives right in at 144 BPM on ""dmx acid test"" and doesn't let up, tearing through five tracks at the sort of tempos that haven't often been heard in techno since the '90s. ""acid test"" puts twin 303s through their paces while he lays down hissing, snapping electro rhythms; that track seamlessly gives way to ""oberheim blacet1b"", a slightly more baroque variation on the same theme that gives free rein to his wild, microtonal tunings. ""simple slamming b 2"" is just what the title suggests, right down to the four-to-the-floor kick drums and rolling, 16th-note hi-hats. Towards the end he slows down. ""NEOTEKT72"" riffs on deliriously detuned synthesizers over a loosely funky beat, full of lanky tambourine and cowbell patterns; the closing ""r8m neotek beat"" recalls the spindly minimalism of 1994's GAK EP. The slowest track here might be the most surprising: ""midi pipe1c sds3time cube/klonedrm"" bumps away at 100 BPM, with wheezing synth-flutes and sad, sour bongo drums like some half-melted rainforest diorama in a gone-to-seed wax museum. But the keystone of the entire record is the one with the most understated title: ""bonus EMT beats"". In DJ parlance ""bonus beats"" used to mean two- or three-minute filler cuts, often found on the B3 of a standard 12-inch EP, in which the A-side's beat, and maybe its bassline, was given a brief, stripped-down reprise. They were DJ tools, basically, meant to be juggled with. ""bonus EMT beats"" is clearly a rework of ""dmx acid test"": it's got the same hard, dry snare thwack, the same staggered kick drum, the same ricocheting rimshots. The bassline's been muted and the reverb pushed way up. It rolls so naturally that it may take you a moment to notice what's changed: the bonus beat is in 5/4 time, whereas the original counts out in four. What's stunning is that James could take a cadence so unusual and make it feel so natural. For nearly five minutes, he wails away like a prog-rock titan on a drum throne. Usually, drum solos like this one make for an easy punchline, and you suspect that James may be teasing us here—breaking it down, building it up, toying with the reverb, refusing us so much as a note of melody, self-indulgent to the max. And on and on it goes. Three records into his return, on the most Spartan cut of the bunch, James is sounding more energized than ever.","Last year, Richard D. James returned with a new Aphex Twin record, ending a prolonged drought. Since then, he's kept busy, and three records into his return, James is sounding more energized than ever. Orphaned Deejay Selek revives his AFX moniker and provides a stark contrast to the labyrinthine twists of Syro.

Duskland,Zachary Cale,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aee25e6ef95969321cfa/1:1/w_160/d3a9cda3.jpg,2015-08-13 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20705-duskland/,No Quarter,"Duskland is a good name for a Zachary Cale album. Duskland would be a good name for all Zachary Cale albums. The NYC-based singer-songwriter has released four of them in four years, and they all take place somewhere similar. They are reliable and soothing, like old-fashioneds: Mix a little barely-perceptible organ hum and faraway slide guitars of '90s Yo La Tengo with the reedy voice of Cass McCombs, twist a few melancholic turns of phrase, and you will arrive at the place Zachary Cale is transmitting from. It's an inviting spot. His last album, 2013's Blue Rider, glides well into this one: You can cue them up and lose yourself in a pleasant haze for a couple of hours and not take immediate notice where they end. Cale probably wouldn't be offended by the suggestion: His 2011 collection was called Noise of Welcome, and so was a song on 2013's Blue Rider. He likes ""blue"": besides Blue Rider, Duskland has a ""Blue Moth"". The crisp, palm-muted acoustic strumming pattern on ""I Left the Old Cell"" is pretty-damn-near identical to the one on ""Hold Fast"" from Blue Rider. He repeats himself, but it doesn't make his music feel redundant, just identifiable as his own. Squint into the haze, however, and you'll discern moving parts in these simple and rootsy songs that help them resonate. ""Sundowner"" has a softly complicated arrangement—organs chime at different levels in the mix, playing different chord voicings, and somewhere in that rosy glow, a steady piano pulses. Cale's solo acoustic playing usually covers all corners of an arrangement, from backbeat and melody to counterpoint. But he has a full band on Duskland, one that confidently evokes dream pop and country rock, and he luxuriates in their sound. There are some horns on ""Low Light Serenade"" (another very on-the-nose song title) that might have come from a Matthew E. White production, or Phosphorescent's last album. Cale makes good company with those artists, but his essence feels a little more elusive. Sometimes, that's just because it's often hard to make out what he is singing, even though his voice is mixed high; you can listen to a song multiple times, and only catch a few phrases. His singing is also odd, drawing out notes that don't seem obvious and hitching unexpectedly at others. He sits just far enough away from you. He's close enough to draw your attention, but far enough away to make you lean forward and follow him.","The NYC-based singer-songwriter Zachary Cale has released four albums in four years, and they all take place somewhere reliable and soothing.

All Around Us,Briana Marela,by: Joel Oliphint,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b001ea9e61561daa6552/1:1/w_160/f2affaf3.jpg,2015-08-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20923-all-around-us/,Jagjaguwar,"All Around Us gets its name from a children’s book. It's an appropriate inspiration given the plainspoken way Briana Marela talks about emotions. ""It’s cool to care! Chill is boring,"" she recently tweeted, and she means it; she titled her 2012 album Speak from Your Heart. Marela recorded All Around Us, her first for Jagjaguwar, in Reykjavík with Sigur Rós producer Alex Somers. Strings are played by Amiina, another name that shows up frequently in Sigur Rós album credits. Not surprisingly, some of this record’s instrumental sections—particularly the intros of ""Dani"", ""Surrender"", and ""Further""—feel like place settings for a soaring Jónsi vocal. Instead, Marela enters with crystalline sweetness, not unlike Chvrches’ Lauren Mayberry, but breathier, more deliberate, and precise. Just as she does in her intimate live performances, Marela loops and layers pitched exhalations (usually ""oh"" or ""ah-oh"") to create choral collages that could just as easily evoke Iceland or her Pacific Northwest homeland. It’s her best, most affecting asset. Her emotional forthrightness can be refreshing, too. On ""Friend Tonight"", she forces herself out of the house and pleads for an old flame to help her face the darkness, but only in a platonic way. ""Don’t come back to my bed tonight/ I just need a friend tonight,"" she repeats. Just as often, though, her only mildly poetic candor disrupts the songs. Marela’s lyrics sometimes lack craft and thoughtfulness, like words plucked from a diary and dropped into a song without regard to word choice or rhythm. It’s a fine line between childlike and childish, and too many songs tend toward the latter. On ""Take Care of Me"", a bouncy tale of a relationship going right, a line like ""Now you know me so well, it’s special that I can be myself"" stands out not for its honesty but its jarring ""Sesame Street"" tone. ""I Don’t Belong to You"" suffers from the same clunkiness: ""Dream of all the possibilities/ We can do anything/ It’s not a competition/ Everyone has music within them."" And ""Follow It"" is meant to be similarly inspirational, but even amid the gorgeous waves of Marela’s vocals and the well-placed, unpredictable percussion, the words sound like the platitudes of an out-of-work motivational speaker. She's at her best when she’s lyrically and instrumentally ethereal. ""Everything Is New"" reworks a song from an earlier live album, and Marela wisely lets it breathe and slowly build, accompanying only with subtle drones at first. ""What matters when everything is new?"" she asks. It’s a worthwhile question, and she uses it to get at the concept of carpe diem. ""All we have is now,"" she says. ""All we have is here, and I don’t have the time/ Want to keep you always near, but I don’t have the time."" That is honest simplicity. Sometimes—perhaps most often—relationships end not with fits of rage and screaming and crying. They end for multiple mundane reasons. Two people are right in front of each other, yet they don’t have time to figure it out. Life gets in the way. As Marela sings on the title track, ""Time is love, and love is the time it takes to know someone so well."" Love takes time, and that takes work—that’s the stuff that belongs in both children’s books and Marela’s music.","Briana Marela's new album, All Around Us, gets its name from a children’s book, an appropriate inspiration given the plainspoken way she talks about emotions.

Houston,Mark Lanegan,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00eea9e61561daa656f/1:1/w_160/cb2c1445.jpg,2015-08-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20933-houston/,Ipecac,"By 2002, Mark Lanegan was already five albums deep into a solo discography that had uprooted the former Screaming Tree from his grungy groundwater into more rustic, earthier realms. But that year would mark a significant turning point in his career. You can hear it in the jarring contrast between 2001’s solemn, sepia-toned Field Songs and 2003’s scabrous Here Comes That Weird Chill, where Lanegan's brooding balladry gave way to clanging industrial funk, lecherous electric-guitar grinds, and CB-radio squawks. There are a couple of ways to account for the dramatic shift. It’s possible that, with the Screaming Trees officially on ice as of 2000, Lanegan no longer felt the need to present his solo work as the sobering counterpoint to his main band’s amped-up overdrive. Or maybe Weird Chill (and its 2004 counterpart Bubblegum) bore the corrupting influence of becoming an official member of Queens of the Stone Age for 2002’s colossal Songs for the Deaf (a move that would spur Lanegan’s transformation into rock’s most promiscuous collaborator). Houston compiles songs Lanegan recorded and then shelved during this transitory period, but it doesn’t so much capture the metamorphosis in action as reinforce the abruptness of his about-face. Rather than serve as a bridge between Field Songs and Weird Chill, it suggests the cul-de-sac Lanegan may have hit had he continued down the former album’s footpath into more arid terrain (as emphasized by Mekon Jon Langford’s creepy cover art). That’s not to say Houston is a retread of Field Songs. Thanks to the atmospheric accordion haze provided by Bukka Allen, the sitar accents of Ian Moore, and controlled feedback bursts of long-time collaborator/ex-Dinosaur Jr. member Mike Johnson, the album gently blurs the edges of Lanegan’s sturdy roots rock template with subtle lysergic touches, like mirage vapors rising from the desert sands. But, presumably, Houston wasn’t the bold statement Lanegan needed to deliver at a time when, post-Screaming Trees, his solo work had been promoted from sideline activity to full-time endeavor. The album’s procedural subtitle—Publishing Demos 2002—hints at the career crossroads he was facing at the time. However, 13 years removed from that context, Houston is a means to revisit Lanegan in his natural habitat, following a decade of increasingly eclectic pursuits both within and without his own discography. Rooted in timeless musical forms—folk, blues, country rock, spaghetti-western soundtracks, eastern-infused psychedelia—Houston never feels stylistically tethered to its moment of origin; it’s the sort of album that could’ve conceivably been released at any point in Lanegan’s career. Adding to the sense of temporal disorder is the fact a handful of its songs actually first surfaced on the soundtrack to Cook County, a 2009 indie drama about meth addicts in Texas that provided a suitably despairing backdrop for ""When It’s in You"", an early, radically different arrangement of Weird Chill’s howling opening salvo ""Methamphetamine Blues"". But its wobbly-kneed, light-headed lurch bears none of the nasty, scuzz-covered choogle that powers the later version, nor does it contain the song’s now-familiar chorus line. Perhaps Lanegan only later realized that staying the course to Houston would amount to ""rollin’ just to keep on rollin'"". ""When It’s in You"" isn’t the only scrap material here salvaged for future use; the hypnotic guitar refrain of ""Two Horses"" would get recycled no fewer than two times on future releases. But like last year’s judiciously curated Has God Seen My Shadow? box set (which showcased two of these songs), Houston ultimately serves to illuminate a more sanguine side to Lanegan that’s often obscured by the imposing, wraithlike persona he’s projected in his later work. Even at his most dejected, there’s a perceptible smirk forming at the edges of his grimace; on the lilting acoustic serenade ""Nothing Much to Mention"", he surveys the wreckage of a doomed relationship at a wedding reception gone wrong, but is still game to take advantage of the open bar (""pack up that crystal chandelier/ but leave some pink champagne on ice""). And on Houston’s burning-embered highlight—the cantina slow dance ""Halcyon Days""—Lanegan optimistically raises a toast to the good times before wryly admitting, ""I’ll do my suffering tomorrow."" It’s a sweet, self-deprecating moment of levity undiminished by the fact that—as the grimy, guttural Weird Chill would soon prove—Lanegan wasn’t joking.","Houston compiles songs Mark Lanegan recorded and then shelved during the period between 2001’s solemn Field Songs and 2003’s scabrous Here Comes That Weird Chill, but it doesn’t so much capture the metamorphosis as reinforce the abruptness of his about-face.

Winter’s Diary 3,Tink,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afecea9e61561daa652d/1:1/w_160/0f836290.jpg,2015-08-13 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20905-winters-diary-3/,self-released,"It seemed like it could only be a good thing when Timbaland announced he'd taken on Tink as his new protégé last year, signing her to his Mosley Music imprint and revealing that he'd be executive producing her forthcoming debut album. Finally—the big break for Chicago's most criminally slept-on talent (though she hails from south suburb Calumet City), a double threat who'd dropped five good-to-great mixtapes before she'd turned 20. But things got weird quick: specifically, during the Breakfast Club interview where Timbaland recounted a dream in which Aaliyah's ghost told him Tink was ""the one."" Then came ""Million"", the capable-yet-creepy single centered around a prominent ""One in a Million"" sample. The whole thing felt perverse: Timbo dressing up his new muse in his dead muse's clothes. It was hard to ignore the nagging fear that the super-producer was going to smother her. Tink is not the next Aaliyah; most likely, nobody is. But she doesn't need to be, and in fact, attempting to mold her into Baby Girl the Sequel undersells her extraordinary talents. Despite her girl-next-door demeanor, there was always something mysterious about Aaliyah. At her core, Tink's appeal is that she is very much of this world. She bares her soul completely, putting her most private hopes, fears, and fantasies on paper in hopes of making things a little easier for someone else. Her Winter's Diary series—spanning from her 2012 debut to her latest, Winter's Diary 3—hinges around the loose concept of journaling about a boy that's fucked her entire world up. And as far as Tink's come since that first project, she's very much still that girl in her room, staying up too late stuck in her own head; the tape opens, as the first Winter's Diary did, with the sound of her pen scribbling furiously as she narrates: ""It's December 1st, and I met this guy…"" (No matter she's dropped it in the height of summer; the Gregorian calendar is irrelevant in Tink's universe, where cuffing season is year-round.) With WD3, any concerns about her impending debut album should be at least temporarily assuaged. It's a slighter work than last year's Winter's Diary 2, still her best project to date. But it shows her stepping back from the Aaliyah karaoke and the fun but slightly forced single ""Ratchet Commandments"" to return to what initially made her so compelling: intimate, writerly, and improbably mature R&B, never oversold by her lithe, iridescent voice. Though she's an excellent rapper, her tough, straightforward rap songs on Alter Ego and Boss Up often tended towards the generic. WD3 is the best example yet of her fusing her rapping and singing. On the brief but powerful ""Medicine Interlude"", she lapses almost imperceptibly between the two. ""Look at the flicka the wrist/ I look at the way that you gotta regret every day waking up to your bitch,"" she seethes, rapid-fire, before slipping into deceptively sweet-sounding song: ""Baby you took that L."" Her bars give her ballads an essential edge, and her dense, nimble rap delivery often informs the patterns of her sung vocals: on ""Jupiter"", a slow-burner with a current of Zapp-style space funk, she switches up her flow more frequently than a Young Thug verse. There's only one Timbaland production here, and it's better than any of their previous collaborations: ""L.E.A.S.H."", a quick-and-dirty bad-bitch anthem in the vein of early hit ""Bad Girl"" that subtly hints at a bass-heavy update of ""Indian Flute"". ""I'ma turn this boy into a man,"" Tink purrs, and though she's still not old enough to legally drink, I can't help but believe her. But elsewhere, her mentor gets out of her way, giving her space to strengthen her old habits and branch out into new territory. ""Very Very Special"" is a quintessential Tink sex jam, dirty but subtle, with a Cookin Soul beat that lets its juke-referencing hook ride out into a slow bounce. ""Stripclub"" is a showcase for Tink's singular knack for empathetic, reality-grounded narrative (and a prime example of why only women should make songs about the plight of sex workers), telling the story of a single-mother stripper without moralizing or patronizing: ""Can't nobody judge you/ Make that money, don't let that money make you."" But the tape's most promising moment is its closer, ""Afterparty"", which ends the tape's arc from infatuation to breakup on an optimistic note. It's a weightless, '80s-nodding dance number—practically a freestyle track—and completely unlike anything Tink's released before. If her album's anything like this, we're in good hands.","The criminally slept-on Chicago rapper and singer Tink got a big break when Timbaland announced he was executive-producing her album.

Bang 3,Chief Keef,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b003c0084474cd0c1b91/1:1/w_160/d810bc31.jpg,2015-08-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20925-bang-3/,self-released,"To some rap fans, Chief Keef is still a reliable wellspring of dense, intriguing street rap; to others, he's a misguided and spoiled ne'er-do-well who has been making sloppy Death-of-Rap mixtapes in his mansion since ""Love Sosa"" fell off the bottom of the charts. Even a cursory listen to Keef's new album, though, pokes a hole, or several, in the latter diagnosis. Bang 3 is clearly not the work of a contrarian, unfocused artist (or, for that matter, an ""outsider"" one) actively trying to antagonize and self-sabotage; nor is it an awkward or even phoned-in bid for renewed pop appeal. It's the work of a mature rapper and songwriter, putting the skills he developed over several years spent branching out stylistically to good use. The release of Bang 3 carries some significance for Keef. This project has been in limbo since 2013; it was postulated first as his sophomore Interscope release, then as an album-turned-mixtape (a kiss-off to label bureaucracy), then, following the loss of his deal, as an independent album to arrive exactly one year ago. Luckily, Bang 3 isn't a too-little-too-late effort like Gunplay's recent, forestalled full-length; instead, it sounds like Keef signaling a new beginning. The higher, clearer production values are most immediately noticeable—this is the crispest-sounding Keef release since 2012's *Finally Rich—*and its well-ironed-out song structures. It feels like a new coat of paint to befit a new partnership: The rapper is in the honeymoon phase of a new deal with Greek billionaire, web entrepreneur, and probable psychopath Alki David's multi-platform entertainment company FilmOn, and the sense that he's getting some new encouragement (and constructive criticism) is all over this confident and studied-sounding music. On Bang 3, his voice is turned up loud, left untreated and pushed to the front of the mix, highlighting smaller, expressive details in his delivery. He builds energy across verses rather than hammering on one idea, relishing word sounds and inflecting his patterns with a conversational, sing-songy style: ""I'm rocking Tweet, beat, skeet, then delete"" (from ""You""). Often, the fun he's having in the booth is infectious, sellling chancier lines like ""Remember having pistol fights, now I'm having food fights/ Now we having rack fights, now we having jewel fights"" (from ""New School""). For the most part, the production stays behind the rapping, unlike Keef's in-house work on Sorry 4 the Weight and the self-produced Back from the Dead 2. Trusted Atlanta stalwart Zaytoven is here, as is Keef's first and most important collaborator, his childhood ally Young Chop. On ""Facts"", produced by Glo Gang, he delivers some of his most pointed and emotional lyrics on the album over eerie synth string seesaws. That said, while these songs feel more well-plotted and pristinely delivered than anything he has released in a while (that is not to say ""better""), you still get the feeling they are molded from Keef's first thoughts after stepping in the booth. In this case, this makes for a lot of very good, but only a few great tracks; the rigorously composed '80s-inflected ballad ""Ain't Missing You""— with its gunshot timpanis, EKG fluttering, and fierce hook—is a one-off novelty, not indicative of a new, aggressively poppy direction. Ever since the the sleek pop appeal of Finally Rich, fans have wondered if the rapper will someday make another streamlined, unassailably consistent project.  Bang 3 seems to signal that, despite his newfound poise, he won't; he's not interested in that. That's not a bad thing, and it's even something of a relief to not be constantly waiting for some succinct return-to-form moment. The key to enjoying his work is appreciating the sweet spots, the moments where his reckless experimentation and his unmistakable attitude intersect and become more than the sum of their parts. These are tapes you wander into slowly and patiently, bypassing some murkier, hastier-sounding clunkers until you find the music that both sounds like no one else and begs for replays reveals itself. It's usually worth it.","Chief Keef's Bang 3 has been in limbo since 2013, but it doesn't sound like a too-little-too-late effort. Instead, it sounds like Keef signaling a new beginning.

With Raw, Vol. 1, however, the self-produced singer winnows out a slice of this familiar territory and advances it with a distinctly British sensibility. Not only is Azekel doing all the singing, songwriting, production, engineering, and mastering on Raw, but standout singles like bass-heavy ""Chronophobia"" and ""Mad About the Boy"" suggest that there is a quintessentially London R&B sound, and that this, more specifically, is it. The EP has an intimate, conversational atmosphere. Production flourishes peek out from every corner of the mix, from the purposeful, jolting radio fuzz on early single ""New Romance"" to the errant sirens and clips of presumably real DJs talking about Azekel on ""Late Intro"". Interludes like this make the EP sound like a late-night mood mix on the BBC—all vaporous voices and distant chatter over smooth, immersive ambience, crafted to sound incidental. Raw Vol. 1 has a pretty solid narrative arc for an EP—from roiling statement singles like ""Chronophobia"" to the reflective closer ""Sold My Love"". Lyrically, however, Raw favors the oblique, with Azekel singing ingratiating lines (""I've been watching you watch me""; ""Sweet love, I've paid my dues"") that occasionally feel redundant. The downtempo soul of ""Holy Matrimony"" provides the best example of the vocal styling that sets Azekel apart: the lilting falsetto, the tremolo, the manifold ways his voice molds and shapeshifts to underscore the production, rather than the other way around. There is room in this spacious music for small, experimental touches that don't announce themselves—from the harmonious, intergalactic fade out on ""Holy Matrimony"" to the womping bassline on ""Chronophobia"", which is later underscored by a beat that sounds like someone clicking their tongue. It's a unique touch that's characteristic of Raw, Vol. 1—Azekel isn't reinventing the wheel, but his attention to detail results in something rare: a record that feels impulsive, risky, and polished all at the same time.","This intimate, conversational EP from East London R&B producer/singer Azekel isn't reinventing the wheel. But his attention to detail is rare, and results in a record that feels impulsive, risky, and polished all at the same time.

Morning World,Teen Daze,by: Andrew Ryce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929affb13d197565213a3a0/1:1/w_160/52b64c88.jpg,2015-08-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20918-morning-world/,Paper Bag,"Teen Daze has an on-and-off relationship with the dancefloor. It makes sense: the artist known otherwise as Jamison (he uses only his first name professionally) lives in the Fraser Valley, an exurb of Vancouver that isn't exactly known for a clubbing scene, and it's far enough away from its larger neighbor that you'd probably need a hotel room to bother going out. His earliest work was lumped in with chillwave, but through releases like All of Us, Together, the rhythms started to become the focal point of his productions, leading him to play club sets and even DJ occasionally. But melody has always been Jamison's strong suit, which has lent his dance-oriented work a heart-on-sleeve quality that's more Tycho than techno. It also means that his time spent away from the drum machines—like 2013's delicate Glacier—have been the best showcases for his songwriting. And now, with Morning World, Jamison finds his voice. Picking up a guitar (and a studio full of other instruments), he plays, plucks, and sings his heart out for his best record yet. Following a number of turbulent life changes, Jamison travelled down to San Francisco to work with John Vanderslice, who helps imbue Morning World with indie rock's warm, analog glow. It sounds almost nothing like previous Teen Daze material. Only Jamison's fluttery songwriting remains, and the new style puts his pleasant idiosyncrasies into sharper focus. Instead of pirouetting synths and daydream melodies, Jamison's singing is the center point of Morning World. His voice is wonderfully meek and boyish, with shades of Ben Gibbard and Doug Martsch in his soft, clearly enunciated delivery. It's a great match for the baroque sound he's built with Vanderslice, which feels ornate and well-appointed without reaching for the ostentatious. While the meat of Morning World is largely string instruments and drums, Jamison's nostalgic synths play an important part, always lurking in the background. Synths swirl underneath the title track, giving it the childlike lilt of hauntology practitioners like the Advisory Circle, and add vivid color between the lines on upbeat highlight ""Life in the Sea"". The latter is an ode to swimming that underlines the album's core theme: an appreciation of the simple things around you. Two of the album's tracks, including opener ""Valley of Gardens"", paint verdant pictures: ""I've come to watch the flowers as they grow/ Another chance to feel how little I know/ And another morning spent no feeling alone."" Those lyrics highlight a naïveté that's been core to Teen Daze since Jamison was young, which makes his romantic songwriting feel as earnest as a Postal Service song. It comes to a head on the LP's climax, ""Infinity"", which is one of his most touching songs yet, breaking out into a soaring coda where he repeats ""Let me stay a little longer/ I can find my way back home."" In the wake of the breakup of a long-term relationship that preceded Morning World, it's an elegant refrain that packs an adolescent's world of emotion into one loaded phrase. When Jamison isn't being so direct, the album falters: ""You Said"" is a blandly casual instrumental that feels like treading water (think ""Flying"" from Magical Mystery Tour), while ""Post Storm"" goes for epic but ends up dawdling through its hefty six minutes. Those signs suggest that Jamison might still be working to reconcile his singer-songwriter direction with his many past selves, but he sounds remarkably assured for the rest of it. More importantly, he sounds like himself more than ever—which makes Morning World Jamison's most captivating and personal album yet.","Teen Daze's earliest work was lumped in with chillwave, but through releases like All of Us Together, the rhythms started to become the focal point of his productions. Frontman Jamison's singing is the center point of Morning World, and it sounds like nothing else in his catalog.

The Blackest Eye EP,Aye Nako,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b006b1335d7bf169a04a/1:1/w_160/acdc8ca9.jpg,2015-08-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20927-the-blackest-eye-ep/,Don Giovanni,"The Brooklyn quartet Aye Nako's The Blackest Eye is an immense stylistic step forward for a band whose previous full-length effort, while addressing complicated personal experiences with sexual and racial identity, seemed like it was constrained in places by pop punk subgenre boundaries. Pop punk is not a subgenre known for its attention to nuance. Their newest EP, The Blackest Eye, the title and lyrical themes of which riff on Toni Morrison's 1970 debut novel The Bluest Eye, breaks out of those subgenre forms. On it, Aye Nako are exploring, stretching, and pushing their sound into a unique place. Opening track ""Leaving the Body"" is a relentlessly catchy but also deeply affecting personal account of living with the cycle of sexual trauma in many of its complex realities: the reiteration of patterns of abuse (""Dead men don't abuse/ Still you resurrect"") cemented by the common reaction of disbelief when one tries to tell one's story (""Who would believe me anyway/ It's just the kind of lie a girl would say""). ""Killswitch"" and ""White Noise"" examine racial fetishization and the immediate heaviness of a society that prizes whiteness at all costs. Closer ""Sick Fuck"" addresses the weariness and predictability of dealing with a society that would rather turn away from you or place you into a box than acknowledge your queer humanity. ""Already know what you'd say,"" main vocalist Mars Ganito and new guitarist Jade Payne sing together on the chorus, which breaks down into a bridge: ""In lust we trust."" To follow a path away from heteronormativity, away from society's maps, is exhausting, but it is also necessary for so many to live in truth. Is it more exhausting to lie to yourself or to deal with others' approbation, the song asks. The guitar lines*,* vocal interplay, lyrical poignancy and pointedness, and song structures on The Blackest Eye avoid predictability and heavy-handed formulae; there are plenty of stylistic curveballs. Though there's a lot of music out there that references the '90s by people who experienced their early childhood during that decade, little of it is as playful or as interesting; where others fall into the trap of directly replicating a sound, Aye Nako take scraps of sonic references to any number of early Sub Pop/K/Yoyo artists and manipulate and repurpose them to their own effect. One gets the sense that Aye Nako are this tightly coiled and elegantly structured because of the urgency of what they have to say; they can't afford to be anything less than precise. This is a band that is ""political"" because the circumstances of their own lives necessitate it, and we are all lucky to be able to hear their voices.","The Brooklyn quartet Aye Nako's The Blackest Eye, which riffs on Toni Morrison's 1970 debut novel The Bluest Eye, is an immense stylistic step from their previous full-length which, while addressing complicated personal experiences with sexual and racial identity, seemed like it was constrained by pop punk subgenre boundaries.

American Drift,Elysia Crampton,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afbfea9e61561daa64df/1:1/w_160/0c9f8510.jpg,2015-08-12 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20871-american-drift/,Blueberry,"Elysia Crampton's debut album is only four songs long, but it represents a monumental undertaking. She has described it as an exploration of Virginia's history as well as a meditation on brownness, on being Latina, as a kind of geology—""as mud, dirt and mineral, enmeshed in lithic, vast time scales."" Those are big, provocative ideas, but anyone who has ever logged serious mileage crossing the continent will have devoted at least some thought to the bonds of landscape and identity, and Crampton has covered more ground than most. She grew up between Southern California and northern Mexico; these days, she makes her home in Weyers Cave, Va., a small town (pop. 2473) in the Shenandoah Valley. Specific places and the vastness of the continent itself both give shape to American Drift, an album of luminous digital synths and jarring samples whose title suggests tectonic plates and manifest destiny and maybe even car racing (not impossible, given Crampton's interest in monster trucks and the culture of car stereos). ""Axacan"" gets its title from a 16th-century Spanish mission in present-day Virginia whose personnel were killed by the members of a native tribe (who were, in turn, massacred by Spanish reinforcements sent up from Florida). ""American Drift"", the album's meditative opening track, takes the form of an invocation: over tolling bells, a solemn voice rhetorically unites heaven and earth in unmistakably carnal terms—""O talus-sloped speared summit/ O earthwork and eyeball/ Varicose and branched…"" It's heady stuff, complete with references to the 17th-century Christian allegory Pilgrim's Progress. But the encyclopedic references also work on a purely visceral level. Sonically, the album is like a hillside that's been worn away by erosion to reveal a sedimentary record of the millennia. ""Petrichrist"" is steeped in the chorused grunts of DJ Mustard and his trap imitators, and Lil Jon's trademark yelps are spread liberally across ""Axacan"". That song gets its loping triplet cadence from Andean huayño—a nod both to Crampton's Bolivian roots and to her time in Mexico, where she delved into huayño and cumbia via the local tribal guarachero—and its counter-rhythms come from the unsteady pulsing of crickets, suggesting a natural heartbeat beneath all those gleaming digital surfaces. And what a jagged gleam: all four tracks bristle with dissonant MIDI horns, speed-dial touch-tone bleeps, subwoofer-testing explosions, shell casings clattering to the ground, and all manner of FM radio special ef-ef-ef-ef-ects, like a morning show on steroids. As much as it is a record of the landscape of the Americas, American Drift is also, I think, a communion with the airwaves, an investigation of the ways that radio has contributed to the development of sonic dialects up and down the continent, shaping the way different communities hear not just sounds but frequencies, from the wash of white noise to the THX-worthy rumble of deepest sub-bass. It is not easy listening. Crampton's music never has been. Previously, as E+E, she developed her voice as a collage artist, layering R&B vocals with cumbia beats and explosive digital effects in a way that suggested standing in the middle of a television showroom in which every flatscreen was tuned to a different channel and every 5.1 system pushed deeply into the red. Likewise, listening to American Drift requires work to make sense of it all; it can be physically fatiguing. But it can also be exhilarating. Turn up ""Wing"" loud enough, wrap yourself up in the woodblock rhythms and trap chants and coruscating organs and a melody that sneakily resembles Shannon's ""Let the Music Play"", and the effect is overwhelming in the best way. There is a deeply ecstatic spiritual dimension to Crampton's work, and it invests her futurism with much more power than the usual techno-futurist's pose. As a self-proclaimed ""transevangelist,"" her concept of futurism is deeply invested in gender, in transformation, and in the process of becoming one's true self, and that, in turn, invests her music with an undeniable honesty and urgency. Her epiphanies feel hard-won, and they shine all the more brightly for it.","The Virginia producer Elysia Crampton's debut album is only four songs long, but it represents a monumental undertaking.

"The Secret History, Vol. 1",Pavement,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1a9d034d5c69bf4669/1:1/w_160/abc9902e.jpg,2015-08-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20747-the-secret-history-vol-1/,Matador,"Pavement haven’t released a proper album since Terror Twilight in 1999, but the industry around the band has consistently reminded you of their importance with a variety of compilations, live documents, and reissues. This was aided in part by the group’s reunion in 2010. The collection coinciding with that reunion was the 23-song compilation Quarantine the Past: The Best of Pavement (which came out in both regular and Record Store Day editions). The title was a clever way of saying no, you really never can quarantine the past. Especially not when you can make money from it. The newest installment to the discography is The Secret History, Vol. 1, which is the first in a five-part rarity series that will cover the band's proper LPs. They’re being framed as ""shadow albums"" that illustrate how productive Pavement was in their heyday, and how strong the material was that didn’t make it onto the albums themselves. This one collects rarities and live tracks and other odds and ends from 1990-1992, Pavement’s hallowed Slanted & Enchanted period. I was a teenager then, and in love with Pavement, and it honestly was great. S&E was one of those albums I owned on vinyl and cassette (two copies, because one got burnt out), and then I found a third copy of the cassette in my backyard after I put on a show. It was everywhere for a certain small group of people, and it meant the world to them. It still means a lot in 2015, though it’s tricky to calculate how much importance we can place on its B-sides and other miscellany, especially when all of these songs were available as part of the 2002 Slanted & Enchanted: Luxe & Reduxe 2XCD. Right, all of them. Even the liner notes included here—blurbs from Matador head Gerard Cosloy, Drag City head Dan Koretzky, Stephen Malkmus, Spiral Stairs, and the booking agent Boche Billions—are from the 2002 edition. If you're looking for silver linings, it’s the first time 25 of the 30 songs have appeared on vinyl— purists, there’s that. And, of course, the music itself is mostly great. You won’t need to hear the entire 1992 Brixton set from Pavement's first European tour opening for Sonic Youth more than once, but there is plenty of slacker charm to Malkmus’ between-song banter—his references to Echo and the Bunnymen (who the band went on to cover in 1997) and the Beatles in the same sentence, his nods to the elder Sonic Youth in their The Year Punk Broke moment, the wisecracks and asides. But the studio versions of the same songs are undeniably better, and the live takes occupy 13 of the 30 tracks here. (That said, the way they rip through ""Summer Babe"" reminds you how important we all knew that song was, and it can still deliver shivers.) Otherwise, you get their first and second Peel session, the 7"" version of ""Summer Babe"", the fuzzed-out, grunge-nodding alternate take of ""Here"", and the rest of the Redux ""Slanted Sessions"" (a cleaner, more pristine ""Here"" shows up as part of Peel Session 1), ""Sue Me Jack"",  ""Greenlander"", and ""So Stark (You're a Skyscraper)"" from the Watery, Domestic sessions (I love that EP, and wish it was here in full, maybe instead of the live material), and etc. It’s a bit like Gus Van Sant’s remake of Psycho, though the sequencing is different from the 2002 version, and you get different cover art. In the middle of the Brixton set, while introducing ""Frontwards"", Malkmus deadpans: ""‘Frontwards’ is the name of this song, it’s about moving forward obviously."" When Stuart Berman interviewed Malkmus (and Spiral Stairs) about these compilations and asked ""Whose idea was it to go back and repackage these songs?,"" Malkmus answered ""Not mine"" and when asked if they added up to a proper album he replied: ""No way. That’s just fuck-around shit, off-the-top-of-the-head stuff, and B-sides."" Of course, the members of Pavement have moved forward: they're making music, writing about food, bartending, being horse racing buffs, and Gary Young. At this point, you wish the industry around them would, too.","The Secret History, Vol. 1 is the first in a five-part rarity series that will cover Pavement's proper LPs.

Persuasion EP,Blondes,by: Cameron Cook,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0109d034d5c69bf47f2/1:1/w_160/9b1c5fb3.jpg,2015-08-11 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20936-persuasion-ep/,Rvng Intl.,"With the current mainstream status and Coachellification of American techno, it's sometimes hard to remember the origins of the genre. It was created not by pasty knob-noodlers or bros in culturally-appropriative headgear, but a multiethnic, pansexual community of revelers interested in an almost spiritual loss of self, an out-of-body escapism that could only be achieved through electronics, dancing, and the occasional hit of very potent psychedelics. Good techno, inherently, does not forget that heritage. Persuasion, a new three-song EP by New York City-based duo Blondes, is good techno. Their newest offering since a one-off collage and 2013's gangly soundscape Swisher, Persuasion sees Blondes turning their massive live show inside out and reconstructing it in a studio setting. It's more visceral and immediate than what they've been releasing in the past few years, condensing their more pensive moments into 25 minutes of purified dance. Title track ""Persuasion"" starts off with a shuffleboard beat and a synth blip that sounds almost exactly like the default iPhone text message alert tone, until the main synthesizer loop tickles its way in and the rest of the track bubbles over an eight-minute build. It's what Blondes do best: expertly guide their audience to that place beyond the dancefloor, grabbing their cerebrums with sound and forcibly lifting them to the heavens, or at the very least to the top of the DJ booth. ""Son"" is centered around a runaway timpani chased by swirling synth stabs, landing only a few thumps short of Afrobeat in the process. A third of the way through, reverberated and outstretched vocals punctuate the mix. It's a daring touch that pays off, imbuing the track with an element both human and distinctly alien. As ""Son"" slows down and comes to a close, the kettledrum finally loses its steam and a lone hi-hat struggles past the finish line—a witty fake-out, as it happens, as third and final track ""Inner Motive"" gears up in a swell of muted beats and modulated synths. This is the closest the EP comes to customary Blondes, a pulsating, multi-layered beat accompanied by a multitude of overlapping squiggles. Much like the techno of yore, Persuasion serves its primary purpose as dance music, but is also intelligent, experimental, and above all, fun—all qualifiers that many of Blondes' compatriots could learn a thing or two about.","Persuasion, a new three-song EP by New York City-based duo Blondes, turns their massive live show inside out and reconstructs it in a studio setting.

You Disgust Me,Gangrene,by: Mosi Reeves,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afdeea9e61561daa6514/1:1/w_160/ba3b6c06.jpg,2015-08-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20894-you-disgust-me/,Mass Appeal,"When you hear an Alchemist beat, you know it. He's refined his style over 15 years and hundreds of productions, from Prodigy's thug-rap high-water mark Return of the Mac to brilliant loosies for Dilated Peoples (""Worst Comes to Worst""), Nas (""Book of Rhymes"") and Raekwon (""Surgical Gloves""). His sound moves between two poles. There are the loops woven out of all manner of sample fodder, like the superior Israeli Salad instrumental suite he released earlier this year that excavates records purchased during a trip to Israel. Then there's his coldly synthesized gangster music, best displayed on Mobb Deep's mid-'00s hit ""Got It Twisted"", and seemingly inspired by New Wave pop and '80s crime soundtracks like Giorgio Moroder's Scarface and Tangerine Dream's Thief.  Both types are clipped and chopped like vintage DJ Premier, yet rumble at a leisurely West Coast tempo. Alchemist does consistently entertaining work, but it's become predictable after over a decade and too much music—so far this year, he's dropped Israeli Salad and Retarded Alligator Beats joints, and now comes Gangrene's You Disgust Me. Yet Al's Gangrene project with Oh No gives both a chance to subvert their well-worn templates into something more dynamic. The two complement each other: Oh No likes to flip vinyl from exotic sources, too, whether it's Dr. No's Ethiopium or Exodus into Unheard Rhythms, the latter built around Galt MacDermot's catalog. He tends to be underrated—it's unlikely that most people who heard Dr. Dre's Compton and its ""Issues"" track know that Oh No also sampled Turkish folk singer Selda's ""Ince Ince"" with his 2007 track ""Heavy"", which Mos Def used for his 2009 single ""Supermagic"". And while his dependence on traditionalist sample loops runs deeper than Alchemist, he uses rhythm more dynamically. Both Alchemist and Oh No approach Gangrene's You Disgust Me as an excursion into weed-hazed hip-hop psychedelia: Snippets of whacked-out voices, culled from some late night VHS videodrome, dudes talking greasy over crate-digger's delights. (RIP Sean Price, who drops a jewel on ""Sheet Music"" alongside Mobb Deep's Havoc.) It's a formula that Gangrene established over its two albums, Gutter Water and Vodka & Ayahuasca, light themes that bracket the usual backpack thuggery. The thirteen tracks add up to just under 40 minutes, and often seem to blend in with one another. Peaks like “Noon Chuckas,” its ominous big band buildup smoothing out into a female voice’s hypnotic glissando, sound indistinguishable from knuckleheaded errata like “Driving Gloves,” with Action Bronson’s brain fart about needing ""a bitch with a pussy like like a Little League glove."" As rappers, the words Alchemist and Oh No say are less interesting than the sound of their slangy, chippy voices riffing over the blappers.Their peak You Disgust Me moment arrives on ""The Man with the Horn"", which draws equal inspiration from Miles Davis-styled melancholy and New York noir vis-à-vis Travis Bickle samples. Al visualizes himself as a loner wandering the streets, ""stumble out the bar, vision blurry/ Humphrey Bogart, face underneath the rim of my derby."" Oh No adds, ""It's looking like a scene out of Vegas/ It's nighttime, and the jazz jukebox is playing."" It offers a glimpse of what Gangrene could be if it was more than just headnod music stuffed with weed jokes. Both are more than capable of crafting memorable hip-hop music, even if they're too focused on cranking out bangers at an industrial rate to notice whether anything they've made stands out.","Alchemist and Oh No approach Gangrene's You Disgust Me as an excursion into weed-hazed hip-hop psychedelia.

Faded Gloryville,Lindi Ortega,by: Stephen M.

After laboring for years as a country outlier in a city better known for indie rock, she self-released two albums and a handful of EPs in the 2000s, weathered one ill-fated major-label signing, then toured as a back-up singer for Brandon Flowers. At the beginning of this decade, she signed with Last Gang Records, releasing two well-reviewed albums that introduced her studiously forlorn vocals and twang-goth sound to a slowly growing audience. And yet, on her latest album, she sounds like she knows the best part is behind and now she’s living in a lonely place called Faded Gloryville. Ironically, Faded Gloryville might be Ortega's biggest record yet, one that feels well timed amid a boom of semi-traditionalist female country singer-songwriters. She's never quite as witty as Kacey Musgraves or as bold as Nikki Lane, and she doesn't have the ability to immediately shatter your heart the way Ashley Monroe can. Instead, she has a shrewd, quiet self-awareness: ""I ain't the girl you're looking for... I ain't the girl for you,"" she sings sweetly on ""I Ain't the Girl"". Even though the song is sung to a clean-cut, buttoned up would-be suitor, you get the sense that she might be speaking directly to you, the listener, and wondering why the hell you're even bothering with her. That's not low self-esteem or fake humility. Instead, one suspects that it has more to do with always being on the edges of the country industry. Ortega is a Canadian with Irish-Mexican blood and a sartorial style that's more Stevie Nicks than Loretta Lynn. Rather than small towns, she sings about big cities, especially on the standout ""Run-Down Neighborhood"", which finds a sturdy friendship taking shape in the sort of neighborhood where people drive through without stopping at red lights. ""Hey, you can have some of my weed if I can smoke your cigarette/ I might be running low, but I ain't out just yet,"" she sings brightly. Most of the time Ortega sounds spry, even excitable, singing with a knowing wink underscoring the fatalism of the songs. Even the grim details of a hard-luck life can't keep her down. ""Run Amuck"" begins as a typical lament about an unfaithful guy, but the second verse reveals that her man is chasing something besides skirts: ""Uppers and downers, coffee and cocaine,"" she sings, then adds, ""Egg in a frying pan, this is your brain."" In just a few words and a clever rhyme, Ortega stages an intervention and nods at the hokey inadequacy of interventions. There's more than a little rage driving that song, just as there's more than a little sadness nipping at the edges of ""Ain't the Girl"". Even if this isn't her most cohesive or inventive album (that would be 2012's Cigarettes & Truckstops), these songs highlight her innate ability to peel back the layers of country convention and find weird new emotions underneath. Ultimately, she makes Faded Gloryville sound not so much like a place of diminished opportunity, but endless possibility.","Toronto's Lindi Ortega is a country outlier in a city better known for indie rock.

AndSeeThatsTheThing EP,Dej Loaf,by: David Turner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe0ea9e61561daa6519/1:1/w_160/36fd7c3f.jpg,2015-08-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20896-andseethatsthething-ep/,Columbia,"Last year, the Detroit rapper Dej Loaf came to national attention with “Try Me”, an icy song dedicated to keeping one's personal circle small. The sentiment isn't too dissimilar from plenty of “us against the world” street rap songs, but Dej’s sweet hook and relatively unknown status gave the song an extra push. She arrived aloof, an emotion that gains currency as social networks proliferate and push themselves into every corner of our lives. People can buy followers, beef between superstars can start over tweets, and it is harder and harder to opt out of any of it. Dej’s latest EP may indulge in this world—see the hashtag inclusion in the EP's title #AndSeeThatsTheThing—but her default remains disinterest. On the EP’s opening track “Desire,” Dej says “I’d rather feel on myself than let you feel on my ass,” and the rest of the EP is just as self-contained and confident. The Big Sean-assisted “Back Up,” one of the most upbeat tracks in Dej’s catalog, focuses on keeping the distance with someone after just one night together. Big Sean, someone with a very public and on the record relationship history, struggles to keep up with Dej’s cold-hearted dismissals (“If I fuck and make you come, you gotta promise not to stress me,” she insists). But she never shuts herself off so much to miss when real attraction might be coming her way. “Butterflies” refers to the little creatures that flutter in nervous stomachs, and it captures the cheeks-blushing sweetness that is the other side of Dej. On “Hey There,” Dej partners with Future—more recently a heel on Dirty Sprite 2—who rediscovers his softer side that won over fans a few years ago with “Turn on the Lights”. Dej Loaf’s confidence extends to her production. She knows the particular sound that works for her mix of rap and R&B. The EP’s production stays laidback, so Dej can smoothly jump between singing and rapping without leaning too heavily towards one style. “Back Up” is the exception, a crisp straight-ahead rap song that forgoes genre blurring. Though Dej’s talent is walking both sides of that divide, she’s a strong enough singer and rapper that it’s great hearing her not stuck on instrumentals that straddle the genre fence. The performative nature of muting people from one’s life isn't seeking true isolation, but being selective about who is allowed into one’s world. Whether it is a passerby on the street, dudes creeping into DMs, or the comment section of Instagram, there are always so many voices shouting. The response of Dej’s music to pull inward feels appropriate, to only open up when most tender. #AndSeeThatsTheThing might sound so sad today, but Dej appears comfortably dour.","The Detroit rapper Dej Loaf came to national attention with “Try Me,” an icy song dedicated to keeping one’s personal circle small. Her new EP jumps smoothly between rapping and singing, and is just as confident and contained. She is aloof, but she never shuts herself off so much to miss when real attraction might be coming her way.

Compton,Dr. Dre,by: Jay Balfour,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b00f5e6ef95969321ef0/1:1/w_160/8ef1a836.jpg,2015-08-11 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton/,InterscopeAftermath,"Dr. Dre has been holed away for a worrying amount of time. A few years ago, he released a pair of singles ostensibly linked to his since-abandoned third album, Detox, and they were dire. ""I Need a Doctor"", in particular, was awkward and clunky, and it seemed as though Dre was straining too hard to perfect his comeback. He only re-emerged from the shadows in the name of Aftermath's latter-day luminary, Kendrick Lamar, who appeared to be energizing the elder statesman. But even Dre's surprise appearance on Lamar's major label debut good kid, m.A.A.d city in 2012 felt disjointed, providing more reason to fret over the producer's impending solo return. News that Dre had scrapped Detox entirely was confirmed alongside the announcement of this new album. Years of build-up washed away in the cancellation. It must have been a unique catharsis, purging an undeliverable hype with something tangible finally in hand. Compton isn't a bait-and-switch. If anything, the album is undersold by its billing as a soundtrack, a tag that misleads how well it stands on its own originality. Dre claims the recording was inspired by the set of Straight Outta Compton, the just-released biopic about N.W.A., and for a guy who's been helplessly coddling music in private for years, Compton ended up being a bit of a rush job. And yet, that haste helps the album sound more of-the-moment and free-flowing. For the first time in more than a decade, Dre's inspiration met up with a corporate deadline, and you can see the appeal for him: an opportunity to bundle his final record with a blockbuster movie about his career's origins. In that way, he's toying with the bookends of his career, polishing the story of his come-up while coming to terms with how to step away for good. Dre has been here before, of course, years removed from a game-changer with an entire industry's eyes trained on him, wondering, ""How might he do it again?"" But he's less invested in building a comeback narrative on Compton than he was on 2001. Instead, the album finds Dre coming to terms with his career for himself, not others. If there's a surprise here, it's that Dre, a 50-year-old near-billionaire long suspected of drifting out of touch, sounds charged-up, nimble, and relevant. Dre has always relied on other rappers and producers for inspiration and his own legacy is tied up in showcasing talent, lifting and rearranging it for his own cause. On Compton he's taken the approach and doubled down, and while the album is frequently personal, it's also communal, pushing his own voice towards the margins in favor of other vocalists. The first raps we hear on the album are delivered by King Mez, a Raleigh native who, alongside Justus, the least known of the album's features, appears to have helped Dre with the bulk of his lyric writing. (Either one or both of them are credited on all but one of Dre's vocal tracks.) When Dre comes in on verse two of the sweeping opener ""Talk About It"", he brags about his unopened Eminem royalty checks and jokes about buying the state of California. It's a reminder that Dre is the richest hip-hop artist ever, but he actually seems more interested in pinning down and framing his influence than bragging about his bank account. ""Genocide"" is the earliest and clearest standout, carrying one of two showstopping Kendrick Lamar appearances, who bends and stretches his voice to the limits he encountered on To Pimp a Butterfly. The song is also the first instance on the album of Dre sounding completely unlike himself. To be sure, he's always been an obvious conduit as a rapper, unashamedly channeling the flow and cadence of his ghostwriters, but here he's adopted a delivery that spills out in bursts, his register is higher, and he's snarling; it's not the only place on Compton that Dre's rapping is both impressively light-footed and almost unrecognizable. Musically, the album is a reminder that Dre's palette and appetite for sound has always been eclectic, and rather than retread, we hear him pushing into new territory. At one moment, he's sampling an obscure modern funk band from Italy (for ""One Shot One Kill"") and the next, lifting a guitar riff from a random Turkish psychedelic burner. Throughout, session musicians polish out the edges, and Dre continues to lean on live keys and bass to fill out chunky bottom ends. Dre's quietest and most stalwart collaborator behind the boards on Compton is Focus…, son of Chic bassist Bernard Edwards and a longtime Aftermath in-house guy. (Focus… ditched the label in 2009 after spending years on end piling music into the Detox dump. He returned a few years later, working directly alongside Dre.) If Focus… is the easily overlooked workhorse—he contributes keys and bass as well as frequent co-production credits—higher-profile appearances from the likes of DJ Premier and DJ Dahi inflect Dre's music with their personalities. Primo's offering comes in the form of ""Animals"", impressively billed as the first-ever Premier and Dre collaboration. (Russian producer BMB SpaceKid programmed drums, which carry the best of the Gang Starr producer's fingerprints.) The song is also the most politically pressing on the album and nearly 30 years after ""Fuck Tha Police"" we hear desperation in place of rage. Anderson .Paak, a young multi-talent from Los Angeles who's all over Compton, finds his star turn here. (The song originally belonged to him and Premier.) Still, Dre's verse is powerful, a member of the one percent grappling with racism and the depressingly consistent anguish of being Black in America. ""Why the fuck are they after me?"" he booms, ""Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard, or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally."" The cast of musicians employed on Compton is as varied as ever, but some of the most dramatic displays come from the legends. On ""One Shot One Kill"" Snoop Dogg rekindles an agitated menace that he seemed to have lost more than a decade ago. Xzibit and Cold 187um dip into a perfect stride over the meandering ""Loose Cannons"". The Game, for the first time since The Documentary, sounds like he deserved that original Dre co-sign, owning his original identity instead of falling into chameleonic flow-stealing. ""Deep Water"" is the most dynamic and brooding cut, a moment where everyone's contributions click into place. Anderson .Paak's performance as a drowning man is upsetting and uncomfortable, while Kendrick Lamar appears to be throwing Drake subliminals—and enlisting Dre in doing so. His verse is so overspilling with genius technicality that it's hard to dwell in any one place. Part of the trouble in anticipating a new Dre album, then, has been a difficulty in framing our expectations. Hip-hop has been evolving around Dr. Dre for decades: He injected the type of ambitious orchestration into the genre that helped it modernize in the '90s, cannibalizing and assimilating everything around it. On his previous classics he showed us that new things were possible, a magic that's available only so many times in one life. Compton doesn't have the same breathtaking power, but it's excellent nonetheless, and more complicated and jarring than we could have known to hope for. The biggest and most immediately recognizable accomplishments here are basic: Dre is doing more than just fitting in or harking back, and both of those inclinations together were the real nail biters surrounding his new music anyway. Knowing that this is Dre's finale, there's a pleasant melancholy that frames Compton, and with the music in our ears, acknowledging that maybe that's for the best.","Compton is Dr. Dre's first record in 16 years, following news that his long-awaited Detox has been scrapped. Billed as a soundtrack to coincide with the new N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton, the album finds him sounding charged-up, relevant, and coming to terms with his career for himself, not others.

Jessie Jones,Jessie Jones,by: Tess Duncan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afce9d034d5c69bf4788/1:1/w_160/68eef558.png,2015-08-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20883-jessie-jones/,Burger,"On her debut LP, California singer-songwriter Jessie Jones advises her listeners ""And all the mystery is over a fear that by letting/ Go of love it'll feel like an ending/ Give it away/ It'll come back when you're ready."" This sanguine, if-you-love-something-let-it-go philosophy is in line with her career. She's traded in leading the charge for garage-rock quintet Feeding People to actualize her visions of radiant pop grandeur. It's a smooth transition for Jones, whose versatility as a vocalist alone is enough to warrant her place in the spotlight. On her solo release, she comes across as the best advocate you could have for not taking shit from anyone. But she also spins intoxicating tales that reveal her spiritual perspective on life. Her hippie-influenced outlook is partially why her name has been mentioned in the same breath as Janis Joplin, but her syrupy mew is closer in sound to indie-pop peer Alex Winston. Opener ""Sugar-Coated"" recalls a King Con-era Winston, as Jones builds the sprightly pop song with her deceivingly innocent voice before skyrocketing to carry the anthemic chorus. She plays with tension and release vocally on the rapturous ""Lady La De Da"". Mottled with giddy tambourines and spattering drum fills, the album is a little bipolar in its approach to instrumentation, but it isn't messy. ""Quicksilver Screen"" is anchored by jangly riffs, letting a squealing synth lead drop into deeper, wonkier ones that bob up and down with resilience. Jones flirts with brassier proclivities on ""Twelve Hour Man"", as rollicking horns steal the show, racing jazzy percussion and fluttering piano chords to the finish line. Closer ""Mental Illness"" is the album's biggest outlier but also one of its biggest successes. Suddenly we're placed in Jones' bedroom, as she nearly whispers in your ear, ""My mental illness/ There's nothing wrong with it/ Sick of my feelings, tired of faking it/ Crying so hard, I can't explain it."" She repeats this over a few bare riffs until her singing smudges into echoes. It's a stark jump from the up-to-mid-tempo psych-pop that precedes it, but it's a self-titled record for a reason. Jones wants to give her all, even if her moment of vulnerability is only a brief glance. ""La Loba"" is another anomaly, though a less severe one. It's a flamenco song that feels like an ancient fable put to music. Jones' voice snakes luxuriously around a few low, slick chords, a violin weeping. She grows increasingly desperate and unrelenting as the track builds, howling across zipping guitar lines, the pressure bubbling over like a pot of boiling water. It's a testament to the formidable range she never got a chance to fully realize during her time in Feeding People. Jessie Jones is a well-rounded introduction, one that holds little back. When asked about her personal philosophy, Jones is frank. ""Love yourself and speak your truth. I believe in individualism, I'm not anything but who I am is only something I live with."" This album's inconsistencies are deliberate. Without them, she would be presenting a false identity, an incomplete version of herself. With them, we can more fully work toward understanding Jessie Jones, the individual.","California singer-songwriter Jessie Jones left the garage-rock quintet Feeding People to pursue her visions of radiant pop grandeur. On her debut LP,  she spins intoxicating tales over exuberant and sugary pop, splattered with bipolar stylistic change-ups.

"Woodstock Sessions, Vol. 4",Team Sleep,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afeec0084474cd0c1b6e/1:1/w_160/5175fd03.jpg,2015-08-10 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20907-woodstock-sessions-vol-4/,self-released,"Team Sleep was Chino Moreno's first major side project, and the ones that came after were almost exactly like it—well-intentioned, admirably executed, and intermittently interesting amplifications of a trace element in Deftones' music. But upon the celebration of Team Sleep's 10th anniversary this past May, the band's only record, released in 2005 on a now-defunct major label, has taken on a Wet Hot American Summer-style, retroactive ""wow"" factor, both for its mere existence and the subsequent accomplishments of its already impressive cast. It now serves as the common link between Rufus Wainwright, Pinback, Ex Hex, Death Grips, Hole, and Faith No More (Melissa Auf der Maur and Mike Patton's contributions never made the final cut). That alone justifies revisiting Team Sleep, which is the ostensible purpose of Woodstock Sessions, Vol. 4. An intimate collection of album tracks and unreleased material recorded in front of a small live audience, the result is much more cohesive record than Team Sleep. It is also a less compelling one. Mary Timony, Rob Crow, and producer Greg Wells (responsible for the Wainwright and, um, Mika connection) did not make it to upstate New York. It's just as well. Team Sleep was slapdash by default—it was nearly 10 years in the making and reconfigured after its planned 2003 release was scuttled by a leak. Downsizing the personnel rips out much of the inert stuffing that padded out Team Sleep's nearly hourlong runtime—Timony's solo cut (""Tomb of Liegia"") was proof enough that any vocalist can sound fairly anonymous doing Sneaker Pimps-style deadpan trip-hop, while the explosive anti-chemistry on ""King Diamond"" showed how much Moreno can embarrass himself without actually rapping. And while Zach Hill's participation technically qualifies Team Sleep as a retroactive Deftones/Death Grips supergroup, his metallic, skittering breakbeats mostly worked against Moreno rather than with him—the Deftones songs after which Team Sleep was modeled (""Teenager"", ""Lucky You"") tended to be muted, free of distorted guitars and all the better for it. Hill has been replaced by Gil Sharone—a former member of the Dillinger Escape Plan who already has experience replacing a percussive maniac in a high-profile, alt-rock side project due to his time in +44. He ably recreates Hill's parts, but the wise selection of Team Sleep cuts ensure this is meant to be a more traditional rock record. Prior highlights ""(Ever) Foreign Flag"" and ""Princeton Review"" unlock themselves from a machinistic grid and take on an airy, major-key expansiveness that Moreno never quite achieved with Palms, even if they were focused on doing just that. Likewise, ""Blvd. Nights"" is angular, angry, and alive, while ""Live From the Stage"" stretches out to become the massive show closer it never had the chance to be. While the Mo' Wax-worship on Team Sleep can be now seen as both its definitive feature and inherent flaw, the same could be said of Moreno's vocals on Woodstock Session**s. No matter the context, as long as Moreno is singing, you will be forced to compare it to Deftones. Dude can't help it—he's one of the most immediately identifiable stylists in mainstream rock from the past two decades, his vaporous, wavering melodies nearly impossible to trace and usually conveying a highly identifiable mix of sensuality and menace. This is even more true of Team Sleep than it was in ††† and Palms, so even the best work here ends up sounding like a weakened version of ""Tempest"" that wouldn't be capable of soundtracking Furious 7. Such is the nature of Moreno's non-Deftones work: Moreno's outside projects do one thing, whereas Deftones are successful synthesists, playing up dynamic contrasts that come off as innovations. Woodstock Sessions is the third Moreno-fronted record to be released since Koi No Yokan, and it's the first where a new Deftones album is within view—though the when is unclear, they had promised a September due date back in March, and they officially finished recording about a month ago. As such, it's hard to feel disappointed in Woodstock Sessions or view it as a distraction. It just confirms what we keep finding out about Moreno's music outside of his main gig—it sounds either too much like Deftones or not enough unlike them.","Team Sleep was the first side project from the Deftones' Chino Moreno, and featured contributions from Mary Timony and Zach Hill. Ten years after the project's only album, the group has gathered to perform an intimate collection of album tracks and unreleased material recorded in front of a small live audience.

Body Complex,Heathered Pearls,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afdfea9e61561daa6517/1:1/w_160/8433b1a3.jpg,2015-08-10 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20895-body-complex/,Ghostly International,"Jakub Alexander's debut album as Heathered Pearls had the all the heft of a desert mirage. That was its chief attraction, but also its chief flaw. Loyal offered track after track of beatless shimmer, and it was gorgeous, but after a while, you could be forgiven for wanting something a little more substantial to sink your teeth into. Body Complex retains Loyal's delectable lightness but wisely injects a little more variety and a lot more physicality. Per the new album's title, you can actually dance to many of these songs. Although the rosy glow of his synthesizers remains the music's organizing principle and main attraction, six of the new album's 10 tracks feature crisp, boom-tick drum programming. His beats aren't terribly ornate or advanced, but they're utilitarian in a way that suits listening as well as dancing. Like a square black frame around a watercolor, they help to delineate all the washed-out frequencies they contain. The shoegaze- textured ""Personal Kiosk"" balances murky chords with scraped cymbals, while ""Perfume Catalog"" attaches a muffled machine beat to gauzy choral pads and high-end shimmer; it sounds a little like some heavenly fusion of Actress, 10cc's ""I'm Not in Love""—or the first few seconds of it, anyway—and Newworldaquarium's ""Trespassers"", still the high-water mark for the treble register in techno. ""Warm Air Estate"", featuring a singer named Outerbridge, points to a possible next step for Alexander's project: actual songs. His vocals remain indistinct, but the mere presence of a voice, with a clearly defined bassline, makes for the most corporeal music Heathered Pearls has made yet. Still, the atmospheres remain Heathered Pearls' selling point, with their tantalizing combination of magic-hour sunlight and gooey haze. ""Cast in Lemon & Sand"" and ""Artificial Foliage"" both sound a lot like Victorialand-era Cocteau Twins with the attack softened and the reverb blown way out. Cocteau Twins are, like Kate Bush and New Order, one of those acts that far too many artists try to emulate without really understanding what makes them tick, but Alexander gets it. Maybe that's not surprising, given that his alias sounds like a mockup for one of Vaughan Oliver's sleeves for 4AD. Alexander, who A&Rs for Ghostly and selects music for Tycho's design-centric ISO50 blog, is nothing if not knowing when it comes to the combined power of word, music, and image, which makes his choice of song titles a little bit surprising. ""Perfume Catalogue"", ""Sunken Living Area"", ""Holographic Lodge""—they read almost as parodies, as ironic commentary on ambient music's frequent role as a kind of lifestyle accessory. Fortunately, Body Complex never gets bogged down by ambient music's wallpaper associations. This isn't music for living rooms; it's music for living in.","Jakub Alexander records ambient techno music under the name Heathered Pearls.

Press Color,Lizzy Mercier Descloux,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af33ea9e61561daa63ed/1:1/w_160/fd0db5bd.jpg,2015-08-10 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20767-press-color/,Light in the AtticLight in the Attic,"In 1976, a couple of young French dreamers finagled their way into New York’s punk scene under the auspices of their newly minted magazine, Rock News. Lizzy Mercier Descloux and boyfriend Michel Esteban took full advantage of the Lower East Side’s perpetually open door, scooping ad hoc interviews with the likes of Patti Smith and Television, and became vivid regulars (and Descloux a regular heartbreaker) on the CBGBs circuit. Across the English Channel, they met with the Sex Pistols, and brought stories of nihilists and poets back to France. (France shrugged.) Just a year later, having appeared in Amos Poe and Ivan Kral’s Blank Generation, they had the audacity to declare punk dead, and closed the magazine. Sick of their stuffy city, they moved to New York, and roomed with Smith, Descloux’s Rimbaudian comrade, in a loft propped up by white columns. As Descloux drifted between simultaneous relationships with Richard Hell and various other artists, she and Esteban split but maintained a close personal and creative bond. She acquired a Fender Jazzmaster, and formed Rosa Yemen with Esteban’s brother, Didier, just around the time of the legendary Artists Space noise series immortalized in Brian Eno’s No New York compilation. Following unhinged gigs at the Kitchen and the Mudd Club where Descloux would scream herself silly and wrap the mic cable around her throat, the duo (named in honor of European activists like Rosa Luxembourg and the Baader-Meinhof group) consecrated their fractious musical relationship in a 12-inch, Live in N.Y.C. July 1978. It became the fifth release on the nascent ZE Records, which Esteban had founded earlier that year with the British writer Michael Zilkha. On that 12-inch, only ""Decryptated"" has any significant percussion, which sounds like it was slapped out on an empty bucket. The record is a clash between two guitars, the lead needling with the intensity of a polygraph test administered by a fascist regime, the loose rhythm taking its cues from dub. It’s beginners’ stuff, very much in the vein of Rosa Yemen’s destructive no wave peers, though the atmosphere is consummately terrifying, fraught with the danger of illicit negotiations on dark street corners. ""Herpes Simplex"" starts with the sound of gasping and frantic footsteps, and then Descloux comes in, yelping about the STI in fractured hysterics. She shudders the word ""metabolisme!"" like Dracula rising from his coffin. There are probably dozens, or maybe even hundreds of records like Rosa Yemen Live in N.Y.C.—gripping if unexceptional also-rans that may find an audience as reissue culture has to dig deeper. Light In The Attic has appended these songs to the first in their Lizzy Mercier Descloux reissue series, which focuses on Press Color, the first album under her own name, and one that warrants the marquee billing. In February 1979, as Sid Vicious was being sprinkled on Nancy Spungen’s grave, Descloux, Didier Esteban, Erik Eliasson (from Marie et les Garçons) and Jimmy Young headed into the third room of Bob Blank’s Blank Tapes studio at 37 West 20th Street for 10 days of intense recording. It was still under construction at the time, but then so was Descloux. Where Parisian studios would have scoffed at this bunch of amateurs, Blank welcomed their naïve creative impulses. Press Color was originally intended to be a group release, but ZE decided that Descloux’s name and face was a better selling point. At the time they were pushing their ""mutant disco"" aesthetic on their less fully formed artists. Cristina, Zilkha’s wife, had released ""Disco Clone"", which sent up the interchangeability of women within the scene. Descloux was working within the label’s prescribed sound, but she emerges here as a unique, instinctive voice, abandoning the harrowed yelps of Rosa Yemen to trill and jabber with glee. Uninterested in the conventions of rock, she pursued her guitar playing just the same way. As a New York newcomer, the failed '60s dream didn’t oppress Descloux in the same way as it did her new peers: she rose early to browse the fish market, swam in Central Park’s Lasker Pool, and scaled rooftops for the views. Her peers and boyfriends recall her as the only person who wore bright colors in a monochromatic scene. And so Press Color is full of joy and possibility rather than psychic pain and bankruptcy, opening with a shimmying cover of Arthur Brown’s ""Fire"" that moves at the pace of an enervated woodpecker. Descloux’s strong French accent just adds to the charm: ""You’ve been so blind! You fall be’ind!"" she explodes amidst the glittering whirl. There are more covers: a skeletal take on Lalo Shifrin’s ""Mission Impossible"" theme and ""Jim on the Move"", where Descloux seems to vocalize every twitch of her tongue. A strain of no wave malevolence lingers in ""Torso Corso"", ""Wawa"" (whose tumbling bassline deserves to be fully iconic), and the dubbed-out ""Aya Mood"", which show off the band’s nimble, minimalist interplay. Her shuffling, splayed redux of Peggy Lee’s ""Fever"" as ""Tumor"" has an obvious morbid humor, though it’s the original ""No Golden Throat"" where her disposition and tastes come through most strongly. By all accounts, Descloux wasn’t into slogging away in the studio, and resisted Michel Esteban’s attempts to get her to sing properly. ""Right now I’m not at all a writer of words,"" she told New York Rocker in the summer of 1980. ""I’m using the words completely for what they sound like, how they fit with the rhythms… What’s beautiful is that I don’t speak perfect English but I can get lost in the dictionary and just discover the words."" ""Golden Throat"" is her protest at being asked to fit any idiom: she repeats the line ""I’ll never have a golden throat"" a dozen different ways, seducing it, mocking it, playing her voicebox like a plastic slide whistle. Phonetic chatter litters the relaxed reggae guitar, prefiguring the direction she would pursue later in her career as she recorded in Nassau and apartheid-era Soweto. She never met the Slits, but they shared a love of reggae and silliness. European avant-garde artists are often self-serious, or considered to be, but Descloux and Ari Up (along with Palmolive and the Raincoats' Ana da Silva) brought a welcome playful streak to what could be an austere scene. Compared to 1979’s major punk releases, it’s not hard to see why Press Color didn’t make much of a dent in the U.S., UK, or even France. Next to the likes of Fear of Music, Entertainment!, The B-52s, Tom Verlaine, The Raincoats, This Heat, Broken English, Metal Box, London Calling, Cut, and Y, it’s a vivid curio and cool personality splatter rather than a cultural landmark. Descloux would make those later (even if their recognition remains overdue). What Press Color does is distill our collective excitement and unceasing wonder at a scene that’s almost four decades old. New York's no wave and punk’s protagonists were down in the squalor, waging a brutal, draining fight against their city, their country, the commoditization of their sound. As an outsider, Descloux was able to soak up their energy and revolution and use it to fuel the discovery of her own cultural identity and purpose. Press Color isn’t wildly original, but it’s the making of one.","Compared to 1979’s major punk releases, it’s not hard to see why Press Color didn’t make much of a dent in the U.S., UK, or even France.

Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape),Lil BChance the Rapper,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b0305e6ef95969321f26/1:1/w_160/3b1cc08e.png,2015-08-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20955-free-based-freestyles-mixtape/,self-released,"Short of perhaps Keith Jarrett, you could find no better company than Lil B for creating an album of collaborative, improvised music. For years, the elusive Berkeley rapper has built a cottage industry out of making invention-in-real-time the focal point and pleasure center of his music. Process is foregrounded, not sublimated; there is no desire to pull anything, in particular, off with a given song, just to tap into a mindset and atmosphere. This is part of what has made Lil B's unconventional style so maddening to traditionalists: Normally, the success of a freestyle is gauged by the degree to which it sounds too ""good"" to be one—by the rapper's ability to keep up steam. In B's world, the approach is hands-off, quasi-Eastern-philosophical; steam, as a concept, is rejected completely. Vulnerability is the Based God's most important tool: He tunnels into his moments of non-proficiency, like a free jazzer might lean into a bad note to justify it. This is, in a nutshell, B's ""Based"" state of mind, which was, before it became the stuff of hip-hop's most legendary meme culture, just an adjective describing a musical procedure. With Lil B, the creative environment automatically creeps into the listening experience. Since his multiple-MySpace days in the late '00s, Lil B's music has conjured the image of a lone wolf at his laptop in the basement of his Berkeley villa, leaving the Record button red for an hour or two at a time, ripping songs to MP3 without even listening back to them. While this lonesome vision has heightened the ""Based God"" mystique, it also makes some of B's music feel cramped and ritualistic—a one-man-show confined to too small of a stage. Recently, it seems as if B, too, has been feeling the claustrophobia. Tapes have been arriving at a diminishing rate, with a paltry three last year and nothing in 2015. He's been getting out of the house more—not only to do tours and motivational lectures, but to work with others. His new six-song Based Freestyles mixtape with Chicago superstar-in-the-making Chance the Rapper is the first major yield of this more social period, putting B back in human space and time to a degree we haven't heard since the days of his Soulja Boy collaboration Pretty Boy Millionaires. Free, initially, highlights the Based elements of Chance's style, though he is usually more associated with Kendrick's more athletic tongue-twisting. Chance, like B, is interested in tapping into the rhythms and cadences of speech in his rapping: see the dialogue-y features he contributed to Kehlani and Action Bronson's recent projects. Both rappers, in their own ways, frequently make their bits of doggerel feel almost-cogent and sometimes beautiful. But it's essential for any great duo to be foils to one another, and Free is propelled by the differences between the two young rappers as much as their shared agenda. Though Chance is a known studio rat, his art comes from a very live and extroverted tradition—the open mic stage. So while B's verses gradually dissemble instead of building in clear trajectories, Chance's are a series of razor-sharp gestures, monologues delivered to hypothetical stadiums. The younger rapper is a more apt rhythmic stylist, or at least a more hyperactive one, with a unique sense of daubed-on phrasing and improvisational timing. For Chance, the musical squiggle comes before the thought, whereas for B, rhythms get weird only when the words do. This is particularly evident on the faster tracks, ""Do My Dance"" (with an acid-jazz-trap beat in the vein of Acid Rap's ""Chain Smoker"") and the demented, strip-club-anthemic ""Rare,"" where Chance enters with a swaggering half-hook before devolving into yips and screech ad libs. In some of these pre-verbal moments, it feels like one is truly witnessing something previously unnoticed at the heart of these rappers' artistry—what is at the root of ""songwriting"" for them. What really makes this release replayable, though, are the gold foibles: the moments where both artists—especially Chance, who's not as used to this sort of thing—surprise themselves. In ""First Mixtape"", the most fun-loving and directly collaborative track, Chance categorizes his own rapid-fire flow almost by accident (""Need a gas mask just to rap ass fast/…As Eminem back in '96""). He breaks off, stunned, as B in the background responds with a long ""Wooo!"" in amazement. ""Who you think you rhyming with?"" Chance explodes enthusiastically, laughing. ""You don't got a mixtape with Lil B!"" Likewise, on his half of the nine-plus-minute mellotron dirge ""Amen"", Chance sings with a soulful, beatific air, but as he heads more and more uncontrollably into the inexpressible, his phrases become stifled by giggles: ""It's like God is my...on the side of my ear and I watch him talk into the shit/ I can't get into the shit, but understand that I'm blessed...God, just say 'yes.'"" B, naturally, swoops in to play the Creator: ""Yes, yes."" Meanwhile, in the background, there are mutterings of friends coming into the studio, getting introduced to one another, and leaving, possibly weirded out (""What happened to my bros?"" Chance cries out at a certain point, as if desperate for something to ground him). All of the tracks feature engaging microdramas along these lines. To make a record of this sort— both intimate and compelling—is no small achievement: Anyone who's ever recorded themselves jamming with friends, and then forced their other friends to listen back to it afterwards, will realize this. On all fronts, Chance and B deliver, with an extra helping of humor and lust for life—even beyond the degree we might have expected from these two. When B stops ranting about how it's okay to get ""a Buick or Ford"" and ""liv[ing] with the Lord"" to turn on a dime and ask, earnestly, ""How you doin' today, Chance?"", I would defy anyone not to laugh, and resist the urge to play the exchange right back again. No, this is not the stuff of genius, but it's enough to save anyone's bad day.","Free is a collaborative, improvised mixtape of freestyles from Chance the Rapper and Lil B. At its best, the tape's live atmosphere highlights what the two have in common.

Public Domain 4,Chris Crack,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929affcea9e61561daa6549/1:1/w_160/bf468792.jpg,2015-08-07 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20919-public-domain-4/,self-released,"Chris Crack has been angling for prominence in the many-tentacled Chicago underground hip-hop scene for a few years now, and these days, the rapper and producer is playing local support for acts like Slick Rick, Mystikal, and Can Ox. Crack built his reputation as a solo artist off of a couple of infectious and irreverent mixtapes—2013's Kitchen in the Bassment, last year's Kickin' It Wit TW, and a couple of collaborative projects with noted ""soultrap"" architect Tree—which set up the basic parameters of his style: wall-to-wall soul samples (and maybe not much else), a cutting, nasal delivery, and bars that sound as spontaneous as they are aggressive. Like like-minded fellow Chicago MC and frequent collaborator Vic Spencer, Crack pumps out constant musical product—an overwhelming amount of loose, often-hookless rap songs. It's hard to keep up with and organize; songs are tweeted only once, and downloads come with no artist tags and different titles. From his freestyling strings of verse, to the unimpeded, personable directness of his delivery, to the au naturale quality of his production, Crack's music is intended as comfort food. He's not aiming for perfection from song to song, but to access and inhabit a specific atmosphere and posture consistently: His own. On every level, this is music that is about just living, moving forward and getting by, told from the perspective of a proverbial Lothario and party-hunting nomad, loose in the city at night. Public Domain 4—which is, despite his constant SoundCloud one-offs, Crack's first full-length project of this year—feels like an apt and well-rounded representation of his personality. The title is a tribute to the legendary series of mixtapes by Harlem icon Max B (Crack even channels Bigavell directly in his detuned hook for the Tree and Spencer-featuring ""Again""). The tape is a strikingly smooth listen—an extended, lightly psychedelic tour through backseat smoke sessions, liquor store lines, and other peoples' girlfriends' bedrooms. Crack juggles snaking, off-the-dome flows with more regulated, motormouth patterns: Southern-styled flows you can set your watch to. The vinyl-treated backdrop (coming mostly courtesy of Crack's extra-talented affiliate and soul buff Tmthy Trtl) either lies back to give the rapper space, or feeds his fire. For the most part, Crack manages to be engaging without locking into clear narratives or hitting on much in the way of revelatory wisdom. The best moments come when he edits his goofiness a bit to arrive at sharper, more quotable lines: ""I kick it colder than a snowblower/ Chi-town, mid-December with my Colt open/ With no shoes, Devin the Dude on Pandora/ Rays feeling my aura, I be worse than a Taurus."" (Indeed, Crack himself could reasonably turn up on that station, as a modern-day RIYL.) Crack's music works best if you kick back with it, tune in and out, half-following trains of thought and embracing the diversions. He appreciates fine liquor, Willie Hutch, and good conversation, and he's not too big to rhyme ""Jacuzzi"" with ""booty."" Imagine you're shooting the shit with an old friend—your most low-maintenance one. These raps have nothing profound or ""new"" to offer in their particulars, but the music in sum seems to embody how one might always prefer life to always be. In actuality, unfortunately (to paraphrase a noted self-help writer), it's 90% maintenance, 5% grief, and only 5% that Chris Crack sort of vibe. So ride the wave while you can.","The Chicago rapper and producer Chris Crack  built his reputation as a solo artist off of a couple of infectious and irreverent mixtapes.

Colors of the Sun,Hatchback,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa89d034d5c69bf474c/1:1/w_160/e373d865.jpg,2015-08-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20852-colors-of-the-sun/,Be With,"When the Weeknd premiered his latest single, ""Can't Feel My Face"", on Apple Music back in June, its discofied groove suggested both a ""Get Lucky"" retread as well as a sign that some eight years on, mid-'00s Scandinavian cosmic disco might have finally wormed its way from blog backwaters on through Cadillac car commercials and into the mainstream. How else to explain a handsome, remastered-at-Abbey-Road, heavyweight gatefold sleeve reissue of an obscure nu-disco album from California's Hatchback, first released to little regard in 2008? Originally released by Lo Recordings and !K7, Sam Grawe's debut Colors of the Sun has since been resuscitated by upstart UK reissue imprint, Be With Records, whose catalog ranges from yacht rock demiurge Ned Doheny to South African singer Letta Mbulu. But most fascinating are the albums that Be With zero in on from the '00s, when compact discs remained the medium of conveyance and pressing up vinyl was cost-prohibitive. So far, Be With has done vinyl reissues of everything from the Streets' A Grand Don't Come for Free to a Wilco side project to Cassie's prophetic minimalist nu-R&B classic. Where Hatchback's debut fits in amid this eclectic, baffling roster is hard to gauge. Even as a fan of everything nu-disco/Balearic of that era, I'm only familiar with Hatchback's music via a 17-minute remix courtesy of Prins Thomas (these remixes were almost de rigueur circa 2007). His music occasionally recalls the vintage keyboard squiggles of Prins Thomas & Lindstrøm or else that of Klaus Schulze. Perhaps Grawe's perspective from Northern California gives such German and European electronic influences a touch of sunshine and open air here, a surfer's mentality informing both his Hatchback persona as well as duo Windsurf. ""Everything Is Neu"" might wear its krautrock heritage on its sleeve, but rather than the Autobahn, it suggests a leisurely drive down the PCH, detouring from that motorik beat with piano-laced breakdowns suggestive of Michael Rother's post-Neu! albums. ""Comets"" and ""White Diamond"" both begin as Cluster homages, before Grawe astutely adds other layers—a laidback guitar figure, a contemplative synth melody—that take the tracks into more rarefied air. And had Boards of Canada decamped for the West Coast from Scotland, they might have made something like ""Closer to Forever"". In hindsight, it's easy to see how the album might have not gotten a fair shake, favoring low-key melodic turns and gentle movements rather than the grander moves of his contemporaries. Outside of a 2013 single, there hasn't been much heard from Hatchback since 2011's follow-up, Zeus & Apollo. A quick search turned up the fact that Grawe worked first at Dwell and now serves as editorial director for furniture manufacturer Herman Miller, whose ergonomic Aeron chair I'm currently sitting in as I type this. It makes a certain kind of sense that Grawe gravitated toward modern architecture and design, in that Colors of the Sun suggests an astute sense of craft, even if its expert design becomes almost imperceptible due to its functionality.","Hatchback's Colors of the Sun was first released in 2008, and its Balearic nu-disco vibe slots neatly into contemporaries like Prins Thomas & Lindstrøm.

Works for Tomorrow,Eleventh Dream Day,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afedb1335d7bf169a01a/1:1/w_160/847d84ad.jpg,2015-08-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20906-works-for-tomorrow/,Thrill Jockey,"Few—if any—indie rock bands have been subject to as much armchair quarterbacking as Eleventh Dream Day. They had the songs, they had the chops, but they just never quite got the timing right. Their brief dalliance with the majors was, by most accounts, an unmitigated disaster; Atlantic so badly botched—and then quickly abandoned—1993's would-be breakthrough El Moodio that the band issued a director's cut of sorts, New Moodio, in 2013. They may not've found the fame they deserved in the post-Nevermind land grab, but the years that followed have been awfully kind; widely beloved among indie rock's older guard, with 12 good-to-great records to their name, they've found the freedom to follow their own serpentine path wherever it leads. In the wake of New Moodio—a record that may've just put all that ""what if?"" talk to bed—EDD seem revitalized*: Works for Tomorrow*, their latest, is their fieriest record in years, and among their finest ever. Produced by keyboardist Mark Greenberg, Works is a crisp, punchy-sounding record, not far from the unfussy, live-in-a-room feel of early triumphs like Prairie School Freakout. Works came together quickly; on their first day alone, they'd tracked 13 songs, 10 of which show up here. Works is also the first Eleventh Dream Day record in two decades to feature a second guitarist with Jim Elkington of Tweedy and the Horse's Ha. Elkington and singer/guitarist Rick Rizzo have an immediate on-record chemistry. Rizzo's gloriously ragged, Neil Young-jocking leads have long been EDD's signature, and with Elkington at his side, they can kick up twice the dust. Works charges out of the gate with ""Vanishing Point"", in which Janet Beveridge Bean does her damnedest to earn whoever's listening a speeding ticket. Every time she wails ""I'm gonna take it from the inside, I'm gonna take it slow,"" the song's taut, krautrock-indebted pulse seems to quicken. Bean's never held back, exactly, but the way she tears into ""Vanishing""—and her searing mid-LP cover of Judy Henske and Jerry Yester's psych-blues stomper ""Snowblind""—is something else entirely. Rizzo, as ever, is a quizzical, around-the-beat singer. The pair's frequent harmonizing has only deepened with time, so that the slightest shift in affect from either one changes the entire feel of the line. The raucous, gospel-tinged ""Go Tell It"" finds Rizzo doing his best Lou Reed, with Bean answering with an even-better Merry Clayton, while plainly gorgeous late-LP highlight ""Deep Lakes"" finds the pair sighing their way through a perserverer's anthem: ""I'm alive, we survived,"" they sing, with striking calm. Works, Rizzo's said in interviews, is his attempt to locate the source of some recent emotional turmoil. ""My mom's side is northern Europe Swedish and my dad is Italian,"" he told the Chicago Tribune, ""so you've got the Italian emotional half, and on the Swedish side, there's this attitude that you don't talk about the past. That warm front, cold front collision ends up causing a storm."" Never is this clearer than on closer ""End With Me"", which finds Rizzo out east, visiting relatives' graves, trying to figure out why everything behind him seems to be getting in his way. By digging into—and then letting go of—that past, Rizzo can finally reckon with the present. Even if he hadn't spelled it out, that feeling's all over Works for Tomorrow: what's done is done, but right now, things are looking up.","Eleventh Dream Day may not have found fame with the post-Nevermind land grab, but the years that followed have been kind: widely beloved among indie rock's older guard, with twelve good-to-great records to their name, they've found the freedom to follow their own serpentine path wherever it leads. Works for Tomorrow, their latest, is their fieriest record in years, and among their finest ever.

All In One Peace,Laraaji,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b023ea9e61561daa6591/1:1/w_160/c1c82a54.jpg,2015-08-07 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20839-all-in-one-peace/,LeavingLeaving,"Why has new age music floated back into the musical conversation? The answer is complicated. Reissue culture in general has kicked into overdrive, as music across the spectrum gets rediscovered and re-packaged at a pace we've never seen before. The line between ambient music with cultural cache (Eno, spacey krautrock) and relaxation tapes for the bourgeoisie has grown blurrier, not to mention the mainstreaming of yoga, locavore eating, and sustainable culture, all of which focus on the body and the senses as a ballast for data-driven digital reality. And there's also the fact that the idea of ""functional music"" in the playlist era has become so widely accepted. In this climate, it makes sense that mellow music designed for meditation and relaxation would wind its way back around. Into this context, enter Laraaji. Born Edward Larry Gordon, he knocked around several creative spheres in New York in the 1960s and '70s, working as an actor, comedian, and musician. Always a spiritual seeker, he had an epiphany in the '70s that caused him to trade in his acoustic guitar for a zither, and in the latter part of the decade he began busking in Brooklyn and Manhattan and releasing some of his home-recorded improvisations on small-run tapes. Laraaji's first wider notice came when Brian Eno heard him playing in Washington Square Park and asked if he wanted to record an album as part of Eno's Ambient series. Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, released in 1980, has always been a bit of an outlier in terms of Eno's ambient discography, because it sounds like no other music he was ever involved with (Eno produced, but it's a Laraaji album all the way). The intense energy of the hammered dulcimer on the record's first side could be trance-inducing, but it in no sense slips into the background. For many observers, Ambient 3 was Laraaji's big moment, but he has released many dozens of albums since, most of which were not marketed to the broader music-buying public. For many years, if you walked into a new age shop anywhere in the United States, from Santa Cruz to Burlington, Vt., you'd find a rack of tapes for meditation and relaxation that you'd never find in a regular record shop. And among these you might find a release from Laraaji. Only recently, with several reissues and the release of an excellent collaboration with Blues Control, has Laraaji's work started to reach beyond those origins. This history is part of what makes this particular set interesting: three early Laraaji releases are being put out, on tape, by Leaving Records, a Stones Throw subsidiary co-run by L.A. beatmaker Matthewdavid. Where they were once presented as music for a specific purpose and offered for sale to those heavily invested in new age culture, they are now re-presented to an audience who hears them mostly as strange and obscure music to be collected. The earliest tape in the set, Lotus Collage, which Laraaji issued himself in 1978, situates his music at an intersection of drone and Terry Riley-style minimalism, with a bent-note attack that draws in the music of India. Laraaji described his musical epiphany in terms of a universal vibration, and his music seems especially attuned to the feeling of matter moving rapidly in space. It has an elemental quality and the textures are metallic (his zither is outfitted with a pickup, and tuned to favor open strums and drone), bringing to mind oud, harp, guitar, dulcimer, bells, mbira, chimes, and singing bowls. At points on Lotus Collage he'll break into a strummed rhythm with damping that almost sounds funky, but these more propulsive moments are gradually subsumed into the drift. The overall feeling is one of relaxed contemplation, but Lotus Collage is ultimately a dynamic set, with intense peaks and lulling valleys. Like the other pieces here, it was clearly designed with tape in mind—two pieces, each just under 30 minutes, perfect for a C–60. Unicorns in Paradise, from 1981, was presumably issued on a C–90. Over two 40-plus minute tracks, Laraaji makes use of a Casio keyboard to flesh out the buzzing zither with softer, rounder tones. The sharp attacks of Lotus Collage are nowhere to be found, and instead, aside from some repetitive keyboard parts deep into the second side, the record as a whole is very open-ended and free, as if it's a seed being blown along by a gentle breeze. It's a less cosmic sound than the earlier release, more atmospheric and diffuse, and it seems designed to give a room a certain tint rather than being a vehicle for close listening. You could isolate any two-minute section of the whole and have no idea whether it comes early or late on the album, but in this case that doesn't seem like a negative. Connecting With the Inner Healer Through Music gathers two very different pieces that have never appeared on the same tape. The first side, a multi-part piece called ""Trance Celestial"", is a gorgeous collection of drones that feel richer and more fully formed than his earlier work. Here the divisions between individual instruments all but disappear, and everything feels integrated and focused. At times, the effect is close to the blissed-out post-shoegaze of Windy & Carl. The second side is a 35-minute piece with Laraaji on vocals offering a kind of guided meditation over plings and trails of synth. The sound of Laraaji's voice, intoning over wisps, underlines just how differently we listen to this music today, in contrast to the the spiritual seekers who presumably bought it in 1983. Bad-vibes films and television shows from ""True Detective"" to Inherent Vice have cast this kind of calm, echo-laden speech in a very different light, highlighting the creepiness and cultish aspects over the presumed search for spiritual enlightenment. It's also a reminder of how new age spirituality is so easily twisted into something dark, since it does, after all, involve people at their most open and vulnerable. But none of this speaks to Laraaji's intentions; 30 years later, he is still making the rounds of yoga and meditation centers, putting on workshops that emphasize the healing power of laughter. This is not an artist who takes himself too seriously. And the fact that his music is returning 30 years later into a new world to reach people in a new way is an inspiring tribute to our highly cyclical world.","Born Edward Larry Gordon, the new-age musician Laraaji first gained first wider notice when Brian Eno heard him playing in Washington Square Park and asked if he wanted to record an album as part of Eno's Ambient series. He went on to record a series of cosmic new age releases, situated at an intersection of drone and Terry Riley-style minimalism, several of which are being released as cassette tapes on Leaving Records, an imprint of Stones Throw.

Abyss,Chelsea Wolfe,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afcac0084474cd0c1b2c/1:1/w_160/81fe00c8.jpg,2015-08-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20866-abyss/,Sargent House,"When people talk about Chelsea Wolfe, they'll often mention that the Los Angeles musician covered the controversial Norwegian black metal artist Burzum's ""Black Spell of Destruction"" a few years ago, and that though she plays folk music she counts plenty of metalheads among her fans, including Sunn O)))'s Stephen O'Malley, who regularly retweets her ""Grow old and let your hair grow"" adage. That line, about sticking to your given path as a lifer, shows up on Wolfe's fifth full-length, Abyss, during the smeary, intense late-album standout ""Color of Blood"", and it's a fitting sentiment for her heaviest (and best) collection to date. Wolfe has incorporated metallic elements into her music since the beginning—especially on 2013's Pain Is Beauty—but she's never really gone full-on metal. And, honestly, she still hasn't, but on Abyss she comes closer than ever, externalizing those tendencies. She's thrown in moments of distortion, animal-like growling, or hiss on her other records, but it could come off like an affectation or add-on; here, it's built into, and integral to, the music, which frequently booms with distorted doom-metal guitar. Recorded in Dallas by John Congleton, Abyss features Wolfe's longtime collaborator, multi-instrumentalist and co-writer Ben Chisholm, plus regular drummer Dylan Fujioka and viola player Ezra Buchla. The real difference is Mike Sullivan, guitarist for mostly instrumental Chicago post-rock band, Russian Circles. Wolfe sang on the sole vocal track on Russian Circles' excellent 2013 album, Memorial; he returns the favor here, adding an anthemic dimension to a handful of the tracks that you won't find in her other work.  Overall, this is the first time you feel like the music consistently lives up to the power of her voice. The other big difference: She previously produced her albums with Chisholm, and they've done a fine job, but Congleton makes everything sound so much bigger. The production is ambitious—in the past, it could sometimes come off as a bit ill-fitting or unnatural. On Abyss, the sound is fully realized, her voice always at home. Congleton is a prolific producer, who's worked with the likes of Swans, Angel Olsen, Explosions in the Sky, and St. Vincent. If you focus on that small sampling, you'll have an idea of what Wolfe sounds like on here: The songs don't wait around, or take time to build—they are immediately full on, and never stop raging. Wolfe's early work felt solitary, like it was made, and meant to be listened to, alone. The music here is expansive, and teeming, and you can easily imagine it on a large stage, with a crowd singing along. The songs are long and dynamic, pushing their boundaries to the limit while maintaining spaciousness. ""Survive"", which opens with a bluesier feel, sprouts Swans-like tribal drums, ghostly and vicious feedback, a super-heavy Mudhoney bass, and a forceful bit of noise that comes off like a football stadium full of cheering zombies. The gorgeous ""Iron Moon"" was inspired by a Chinese factory worker, and poet, who killed himself because of the monotony of his daily grind and a failed relationship: It explodes in a way that didn't seem possible for Wolfe previously. ""Dragged Out"", a proper doom track that comes off like a more interesting Windhand, folds in noise, a tolling bell, haunted ghost howls and squeals. She's said these songs were inspired by sleep paralysis, something she's dealt with her entire life. It's a condition where you want to wake up but can't, and when you finally do, you can't move, and there are a number of lyrics about the different sides of sleep (""In sleep there is no sorrow,"" ""When I dream it steals my wonder,"" ""I’ve been waiting/ In this silence/ While you’re sleeping"") and being unable to escape from it (""I’m screaming/ But I can’t wake up,"" ""Set me free from my slumber,"" ""Chasing the sun/ I can’t wake up""). Abyss is night music. As Wolfe put it, ""Abyss is meant to have the feeling of when you’re dreaming, and you briefly wake up, but then fall back asleep into the same dream, diving quickly into your own subconscious."" The previously mentioned ""Color of Blood"" is not that far off from early Zola Jesus, and it's interesting to see that, where Nika Roza Danilova has downplayed her goth tendencies on her more recent, big-pop albums, Wolfe has found a way to remain backed by candelabra and decked in minimalist corpse paint and still locate pop melody alongside the bombast. The sultry ballad ""Simple Death"" is dark, but it's also gorgeous and catchy: Wolfe is not simply going heavier for heavier's sake, she's mastering her craft, writing songs that you remember immediately, and that you'll find yourself humming now and then. The bigger sound is what the source material, her sleep/dream issues, needed. Which brings to mind that line about letting your hair grow as you get old, of not changing your course. We're all frail and imperfect, and that's fine. But instead of inventing a persona or finding an easier way, Wolfe went deep into herself, doubled down on the horrors of life, and came back with a bleak, beautiful masterpiece—she kept going, especially when it started to hurt.","Chelsea Wolfe plays folk music but counts plenty of metalheads among her fans.

Love From Dust,Donnacha Costello,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afbec0084474cd0c1b18/1:1/w_160/db789ef0.jpg,2015-08-06 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20868-love-from-dust/,self-released,"For a minimalist, Donnacha Costello has always tended to think big. True, the Irish producer's debut album, 2000's Growing Up in Public, was an exquisitely restrained array of blips and digital crackle, but that turned out to be a red herring once you looked past the clicks. His 2001 album Together Is the New Alone was an example of ambient music at its most emotionally resonant, and from there he really broadened his horizons. Colorseries, his crowning achievement to date, sprawled across 10 different 12""'s that wrung every last drop of incandescence from a lean machine setup. Love From Dust is Costello's first album in five years. It marks his return to making music after unspecified circumstances in 2010 led him to sell off his studio and abandon music entirely. A more fortuitous set of circumstances brought him back: a custom-built EMS Synthi A, a rare analog synthesizer, finally became available to him after 13 years with his name on the waiting list. Costello's attempt to crowdfund the costs of recording a new album didn't meet his goal, so, alas, no Synthi. But he did raise enough to buy his backup choice, a Buchla Music Easel, which constitutes the album's entire instrumentation, save a pair of effects pedals. While it's not a concept album, it's very much an album determined by a specific set of constraints. The Music Easel is designed to be played in real time—the Philadelphia musician Charles Cohen, who also recorded his most recent album on the device, has described the instrument's benefits as ""complicated control over simple sounds, as opposed to many other instruments, where you have very, very complex sounds but only simple control""—and to that end, Costello recorded his album live in single takes with no overdubs. It's striking that a synthesizer this obscure should turn up as the sole instrument on two albums in the same year, but the two records couldn't be more different. Where Cohen's music is wiry and alien, evoking transistors with indigestion, Costello's is gentle, elegiac, soft as a well-watered lawn in the shade. He favors slow-moving chord progressions and consonant tones and extreme repetition, and each of the album's seven tracks is built around a single repeating figure. (The bookending songs ""Niigata Moment"" and ""Unconditional"" are variations upon the same theme, which lends to the sense that the album is best absorbed in a single sitting—or, better yet, while dropping off to sleep.) The wistful ""Ten Ton"" patiently follows organ-like tones through a softly cycling chord progression; ""Farewell"" evokes Boards of Canada at their dreamiest, with silvery filaments that seem to dissolve in thin air. Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Volume II is another obvious antecedent, both for its warm analog tones and its naïve melodies. Structurally, each track is a one-way street, repeating the same figure for so long that it's easy to forget that it's even playing. But then a note jumps up or down an octave, snapping you out of your reverie. And if you skip from the end of a track back to the beginning, you may be surprised to find how much has changed without you noticing, as the waveforms have grown teeth and toughened up, going from a lowing drone to a ragged growl. It all builds to a head with ""Everything Is Going to Be"", the album's penultimate track, and its longest. There's something about the distortion that makes its resolving chord progression feel even more satisfying; the tension registers as a physical vibration, and the release is just as visceral. At the music's peak, the tone is almost obscured by the buzz; it's like trying to catch a glimpse of a gorgeous landscape through narrowing blinds. It's a small moment that feels huge, a mark of Costello's talent not so much as a minimalist as an illusionist.","Love From Dust marks the minimalist Irish producer Donnacha Costello's return to making music after unspecified circumstances in 2010 led him to sell off his studio and abandon music entirely. The gentle, elegiac collection was recorded live in single takes and with no overdubs on an obscure Buchla Music Easel synthesizer.

Built In Sun,Joe Plummer,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afd39d034d5c69bf478f/1:1/w_160/0d3d0c0b.jpg,2015-08-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20886-built-in-sun/,People In A Position To Know,"Every music scene has a few players who seem to be everywhere at once, always open to whatever opportunities comes their way. For the last decade, drummer Joe Plummer has been one of those guys, splitting his time between bands around the West Coast. Among his more notable gigs: He manned the kit for the Black Heart Procession, traveled with Modest Mouse during their boom years, replaced Jesse Sandoval after James Mercer rebooted the Shins, backed Michael Cera in Mister Heavenly, and, most recently, became the latest addition to the Cold War Kids. He may not be a big name, but he could probably write a pretty decent memoir one day. Plummer carries over some lessons from all of those bands on his debut solo album Built In Sun, which delivers exactly the kind of open, upfront Pacific Northwest indie rock you'd expect from a guy who's long made a living playing it. The album wasn't originally intended to be such a direct reflection of his resume. Plummer had conceived it as a cinematic instrumental work, but began fishing the songs out to some of his singer pals once his focus shifted to more familiar territory. One of them responded so enthusiastically he became the project's designated voice: Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins, whose band had quietly gone on hiatus in 2013. Compared to some of the singers in Plummer's circle, Jenkins isn't an especially glamorous recruit. He lacks the star power and dynamism of James Mercer or Isaac Brock, and Built In Sun probably would've been a more interesting album if Plummer had gone the rotating-vocalist route instead. But he and Jenkins have an easy chemistry that flatters his casual tunes, and Jenkins is a more versatile singer than Black Heart Procession's albums let on. That band usually confined Jenkins to the role of a sullen doomsayer, a part he played so convincingly it became difficult to imagine him as anything other than a buzzkill. Here Jenkins goes wherever the songs let him, relishing the chance to stretch out a bit. Jenkins announces his gameness on opener ""Honeybear"", a hurried garage-rocker, crooning over Plummer's piping organ with gregarious abandon. David Bazan and Cody Votolato sit in on the woozy, Built to Spill-ish ""Winters Fall"" and he leads them through a merry sing-along chorus. And though Jenkins smuggles his share of macabre images into the album, with lyrics about arrow-pierced skin, broken bones, and abandoned dreams, he sings even the bleakest of them as if swinging a raised pint. Even ""13 Souls"", the closest Built In Sun comes to Black Heart territory (just look at that title), is bright and cheery, a lament that's played for a laugh. Only ""Due to Rain"", a detour into Public Image Ltd.'s claustrophobic dub-rock, teases the darker, more experimental turn these sessions could have taken. Plummer has made an album like this before. His 2003 self-titled release with the Magic Magicians had a similar setup, pairing the drummer with another regional indie vet, 764-Hero's John Atkins, for some very low-stakes rock'n'roll. That album didn't make much of a splash at the time and it's barely remembered today, but it's still a pleasure to revisit, precisely because of the same casual attitude that made it so easy to overlook. Built In Sun will probably sound good a few years from now for the same reason. It's a likably modest work from a musician who has spent the bulk of his career backing distinctive songwriters with complicated visions, without forgetting the rewards of making carefree music just for the sake of it, too.","Joe Plummer has played with Black Heart Procession, Modest Mouse, the Shins, and more. His debut solo album Built In Sun, with Black Heart Procession’s Pall Jenkins on vocals, delivers exactly the kind of open, upfront Pacific Northwest indie rock you’d expect from a guy who’s long made a living playing it.

Ivywild,Night Beds,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afcbea9e61561daa64f7/1:1/w_160/cf676314.jpg,2015-08-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20867-night-beds-ivywild/,Dead Oceans,"Don't let that score up there fool you—Ivywild is a must-listen, invigorating in the ways albums can be when they're so daring you can hardly believe what you're hearing. Really, when was the last time you encountered a record that took legitimate, potentially career-altering risks? Most of the time, an artist's ""bold new direction"" manifests in well-placed interview quotes and imperceptible effects on their actual music. Or, ""challenging art"" will come from outsiders of whom such abrasiveness is expected. Or, it'll be a hard left from a pop star or critical darling who gets the benefit of the doubt and is assumed to be one step ahead of the game. Winston Yellen is none of those things: his Night Beds debut Country Sleep was a modestly successful and kindly received batch of folk-friendly indie rock that figured to set him on the path of quietly successful, critically acclaimed labelmates such as Phosphorescent or Bowerbirds or the Tallest Man on Earth. He's followed it with a 65-minute opus where he sounds like a Weeknd in Dixie approximately 85% of the time and becomes the first guy to actually earn the distinction of ""PBR&B."" We often talk of artists switching lanes or taking a leap of faith—Ivywild is a guy skydiving without a parachute, firmly believing he can stick the landing if he just times it right. It's a free-fall captured in painful slow-mo, perversely gripping in the way it allows you to share Yellen's tunnel vision; there are many times where you might also think, ""yeah, I can totally see how he might've pulled this off."" He flexed raw skill and potential on Country Sleep, particularly a rangy, chameleonic voice—in a dusky lower register, he sounded like Ryan Adams, he could also channel makeout music mystics like Jeff Buckley or Devendra Banhart and when it went straight up alt-country, well, he also sounded like Ryan Adams. But he nonetheless possessed a rare assertiveness that puts him in a position to succeed when taking on pop and R&B. He's also been blessed with legitimate inspiration. Yellen endured a hard breakup, the subsequent, requisite heat-seeking tailspin, and an artistic course correction that found him being more honest about his tastes. In addition to the Weeknd, he's gone heavy on James Blake, Burial, D'Angelo, Kanye West, Flying Lotus, Dilla—no one should act surprised, let alone outraged that any 26-year old is seeking inspiration from these acts. Whatever the temptation may be to question an alt-country dude from Nashville about appropriation, put it aside because the major flaw of Yellen's planning stage is more simple. Pop, hip-hop, R&B, and electronic music have an expectation of being contemporary and even futuristic forms, whereas Night Beds works on a two-year album cycle. Notice that his frame of reference more or less cuts off at 2013—even if Ivywild were a flawless integration of his influences, it likely would have sounded dated mere months after Country Sleep. Moreover, all of the aforementioned have styles that are so distinct and proprietary, any slight deviation could be taken as parody. And Yellen emerges from his immersive listening having integrated the most easily parodied aspects, mostly those of Abel Tesfaye—toggling between a wounded moan and a needy yelp at tempos which progress with the excruciating stubbornness of a hangover, utilizing drug metaphors which would've been better off as similes or just direct references. And, of course, any trace of levity can only be provided by the listener, a humor derived from Ivywild's utter lack of humor. More deadening than the suffocating arrangements and production or the nonexistent hooks is a tiresome perspective that goes beyond the Weeknd and connects to a celebrated lineage of male authors who assume an inherent profundity in treating a psychosexual crisis of mid-twenties masculinity as miserably as possible. Maybe it's meant to accurately mirror Yellen's state of mind during its creation, maybe the utter lack of catharsis or even sensuality is meant to drive home the destitution of it all. Either way, Yellen still takes it upon himself to express Ivywild's conquests as burdens; drink and drugs must take on overwrought, sacramental connotation (""Five quarts won't harm us/ But these lines always cross us""). Elsewhere, the pillow talk fails on a fundamental level. For example, delivering ""If I give all my time/ Can I live in your thighs?"" in a Thom Yorke-ian whimper should make everyone who criticized Radiohead's lack of carnality apologize for their position. Or, Yellen emphasizing his isolation on ""Sway(ve)"", which slow-grinds with two left feet; there was no one who either could or would talk him out of not only making a song called ""Sway(ve)"", or using that incompatible portmanteau as a hook. That's also the only way to explain the chorus of ""Eve A"", which either scans as ""E A I O U"" or ""Eve A, I fuck you"" and it's actually both. There's nearly a half hour left after that. What more do you need to know really? Ivywild wasn't created in seclusion—more than 25 people contributed, including Yellen's brother Abe, a YouTube find, and whoever's responsible for the strings, horns, samples, and harmonies that clutter the admirably confrontational, six-minute opening gauntlet of ""Finished"". Regardless of the help, Yellen has been granted the leeway of not just an auteur, but a genius. In the context of Night Beds' previous work and Yellen's twang, the concept of Ivywild itself is alluring, promising an actual midnight in the garden of good and evil—a mysterious, verdant sprawl suffused with the palpable humidity of the American South, hot-blooded backsliders battling against the repression of self, of religion and social mores. Or, ""Ivywild"" could just as easily be the name of a college bar in Yellen's part-time home of Nashville—whatever its aim, this album reminds you that Vanderbilt frat bros are probably dry-humping to ""Can't Feel My Face"" as we speak.","Night Beds' debut Country Sleep was a modestly successful, kindly received batch of folk-friendly indie rock. Winston Yellen has followed it with a 65-minute opus where he sounds like the Weeknd in Dixie, and it’s a free-fall captured in painful slow-mo.

Ygg Huur,Krallice,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afeab1335d7bf169a016/1:1/w_160/cf023163.png,2015-08-06 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20904-ygg-huur/,self-released,"Near the end of the last decade, Krallice and Liturgy were often mentioned in the same sentence as two New York bands changing the face of black metal. They both arrived at around the same time with provocative, fresh-faced takes on the sometimes-stiff sound. The specifics of exactly what they did were, of course, very different. Where Krallice favored long-form dioramas built from two tessellated guitars and a bedrock rhythm section, Liturgy favored shorter, screeching numbers that hinged around the band's ability to make time seem flexible, as though it might be expanded and contracted at will. Still, they were members of the same promising freshman class. In the seven years since Krallice and Liturgy issued their debut recordings, though, the distinctions between the two have only grown. Liturgy have, as if by design, emerged as the flashpoint, pairing their radical ambitions with a soap-opera-like tendency for drama. Krallice, meanwhile, have become a workmanlike squad, steadily releasing albums that have increased the complexity and scale of their sound without ever recasting it completely. There have been no breakups, no public feuds, no manifestos and no grand announcements. But when Krallice delivered their first album in three years late last month, the riveting and delirious Ygg Huur, the six songs arrived as a simple Bandcamp download, sans all advanced notice. Ygg Huur is by far more nuanced and developed than Liturgy's unsteady The Ark Work—a byproduct, it would seem, of Krallice's steadfast, head-down evolution. By Krallice standards, Ygg Huur is a tiny album. It's about half the length of each of Krallice's four previous records and short enough to fit on a single LP when it gets a physical release from Gilead Media later this year. Ygg Huur isn't as punishingly loud as 2012's Years Past Matter, either, an album on which all of the instruments seemed pushed firmly against some invisible volume ceiling. Those changes only make it easier to notice that this is the densest Krallice material ever, with all those hyperactive and coordinated guitars tucked inside sub-seven-minute windows and accompanied by a rhythm section more audacious and commanding than ever. Despite including the dazzling technicians Colin Marston and Mick Barr, Krallice's past releases could seem, if not simple, easy enough to follow, even during 16-minute marathons. But most everything on Ygg Huur works as a wondrous, complicated blur. Lev Weinstein's drums sometimes switch tempos so that you barely notice at all and sometimes redirect the momentum to the point of whiplash. The guitars and Nicholas McMaster's bass spiderweb around his beats, moving up, down and around central riffs so quickly that they appear forever suspended in motion. The switchbacks toward the end of ""Tyranny of Thought"", for instance, are impossibly precise and precarious. During ""Idols"", the four pieces slide in and out of sync with one another, gliding past each other only to reconnect like the separate strands of an automated cat's cradle. Krallice named Ygg Huur for a three-piece suite by late Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi, remembered most for his creeping, miniscule movements around a single pitch. His original Ygghur suggests the slow, barely wavering drones of Yoshi Wada's earth horns or Glenn Branca's guitar symphonies, except limited to a single cello. It is a fitting reference point for what Krallice has become. On these six songs, they de-emphasize the rock'n'roll role of riffs to the point that this music works as sets of ever-shifting rhythms, gilded by slight fluctuations in pitch. ""Wastes of Ocean"" scans like a competition to see who can navigate constant changes of pace the best; even the vocals are forced to slip between the stop-and start volleys. During ""Over Spirit"", Barr, Marston, and McMaster move so rapidly and exactly between each note that the guitars and drums trade places; the drums provide the movement as the amplified strings provide the more stable framework. A colossus, Ygg Huur reflects the accretion of a thousand minute decisions, not unlike the microtonal work from which it takes its name. Liturgy's The Ark Work and Krallice's Ygg Huur do reveal one new connection between the fellow former upstarts, however unintentional. In their return to the studio and stage, Liturgy have insisted they are not playing black metal, a point reinforced by Hunter Hunt-Hendrix's strained rapping. And though Krallice have made no special effort to say as much (in fact, their Bandcamp page still describes this and every previous album as black metal), Krallice don't, either. Sure, these six songs examine oblivion and apocalypse, arriving at McMaster's closing proclamation that ""No matter what, it ends this way/ With me taking your body to the fire."" But there is little atavistic rage here, and there are no grand, horn-lifting moments. Instead, these six songs have as much to do with modern composition and prog rock as they do with the black metal mold from which they came. It's been three years since the release of Krallice's very good last album, the longest gap ever in their otherwise clockwork catalogue. It was time well spent, at least: Ygg Huur is more vivid, vexing, and meticulous than most of what the band's old peers still call black metal—a sentence Krallice no longer need to share.","Ygg Huur isn’t as punishingly loud as 2012’s Years Past Matter, which only make it easier to notice that this is the densest Krallice material ever, with all those hyperactive and coordinated guitars tucked inside sub-seven-minute windows and accompanied by a rhythm section more audacious and commanding then ever.

Love Is Free,RobynLa Bagatelle Magique,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe513d197565213a373/1:1/w_160/d9b7d58f.jpg,2015-08-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20902-love-is-free/,InterscopeKonichiwaCherrytree,"On last year's collaboration with Röyksopp, Do It Again, and 2010's Body Talk, Robyn made the dance floor her therapy couch, singing of breakups, feeling like a broken cyborg, and all the shit that was killing her over addictive electro-pop. It's exactly this bruised-but-headstrong expertise, built up over two decades as a writer and performer, that imbues Robyn's music with a sort of welcoming trust. So, when she takes a step back in the thumping opening track of Love Is Free, ""Lose Control"", to say, ""Hey, tell me all about your mistakes/ Tell me 'bout the love and the pain/ I know somebody hurt you some way,"" you might believe her and give it all up. On this debut EP with new music group La Bagatelle Magique, formed with her keyboardist Markus Jägerstedt and the late producer and Swedish club music veteran Christian Falk, Robyn cuts to the chase with what she wants from you (and herself). La Bagatelle Magique aren't trying to reinvent the wheel here. The group is meddling in music history, cranking out five familiar tracks that are too hard not to dance to. ""Got to Work It Out"" plays like an amped up, big beat version of Debbie Deb's 1983 single ""When I Hear Music"", with a twinkling, childlike xylophone melody buried under the track's trance-y basslines and Vocodered, aggressive vocals. And the standout single featuring rising singer Maluca, ""Love Is Free"", is ballroom-ready, steeped in a yippy, acid house groove that finds Robyn asserting physical boundaries while preaching free love. ""Imma give it to you baby/ Imma give it when I'm ready,"" she raps over the beat. A charming, un-slick outlier here is ""Tell You (Today)"", an eccentric, sample-heavy Loose Joints cover that mashes together instrumentals of the genre (horns, Heatwave-approved harp, disco lasers, etc.) to dizzying effect. The song sounds like someone was smashing their hands against a well-stocked sampler, even when it comes to Robyn's vocals. They're a little stilted in their delivery, as if every word was programmed on its own and played back to form sentences, but the lyrics still reel with the excitement of finally telling someone how much you love them. What Love Is Free does so well, and so simply, is hone in on just the beauty of finally letting go, physically and mentally. On ""Set Me Free"", there's a moment when the lyric ""Free your body"" repeats, getting clearer and clearer until it just hangs there in the middle of the track while the kick-drum pounds after it, punctuating it like a stream of trailing periods. For Robyn and La Bagatelle Magique*,* the simple request might not be the answer to all your problems, but it's sure as hell the start.","On this debut EP with new music group La Bagatelle Magique, formed with her keyboardist Markus Jägerstedt and the late producer and Swedish club music veteran Christian Falk, Robyn cuts to the chase with what she wants from you (and herself).

RIP III,Michael Stasis,by: Nathan Reese,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa9b1335d7bf1699fa2/1:1/w_160/41496928.jpg,2015-08-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20853-rip-iii/,Arbutus,"Michael Stasis has jokes. On the L.A.-based, Pennsylvania-bred artist's new album RIP III,  you'll hear the cult '90s kids show ""Land of the Lost""'s theme music interpolated as ""Land of the Goths"" and the sky described as ""green, like Mountain Dew."" Like Ariel Pink, with whom he's often compared, Stasis mines the sun-bleached sounds of '70s AM radio for inspiration, while also weaving Martin Rev's pre-industrial grind and Cleaners From Venus' psychedelic guitar work into his tapestry of outsider pop. He used to be involved in a band called Snowboarder while living in the Bay Area, but told an interviewer he'd only snowboarded once. He's the type of artist fans will try to one-up each other with where-they-heard-him-firsts as they attempt to accurately retrace a career that's brought Stasis from Philly to New York to the West Coast. That said, those fans would barely fill a Highland Park living room. Not only is Michael Stasis not particularly famous, he's essentially unknown outside a small subset of the California DIY scene. That leaves RIP III in the difficult position of serving as both a de-facto debut and a greatest hits collection for an artist with precisely zero ""hits."" As it turns out, RIP III is actually the third in a series of compilation albums, all of which draw from Stasis' home recordings, cassette releases, and other ephemera. III, however, has the unique distinction of being the first Stasis album released via Arbutus, the Montreal label that has served as a launchpad for alt-pop heavyweights Grimes and Majical Cloudz and remains home to underground faves like Sean Nicholas Savage and Tonstartssbandht. Fortunately for Stasis, RIP III shows not only that he deserves the larger audience, but that it's a surprise he's stayed under the radar so long. ""The Necklace"" is a love song whose haunting, hummable chorus is darker and weirder than first appears. ""This I'll hang on you,"" Stasis sings, irony saturating each drawn-out syllable, the twist being that what Stasis has to give is both a gift and a curse. Another parallel between Ariel Pink is Stasis' friendship with Jorge Elbrecht, known for having helped shaped some of the past decade's best experimental pop. Though RIP III is mostly self-recorded, Stasis' production, especially on songs like ""The Necklace"" and ""Little Devil"", hews close to Elbrecht's pillowy aesthetic. ""Brown Cow"", a track that appears to have no deeper meaning than describing a literal cow in a field, has a motorik groove that hits like Wilco's ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"" if you listened to it at a Club Med on mushrooms. That the effect is charming, rather than just confusing, is a testament to Stasis' ability to sell even his strangest left turns. As one might expect from an album recorded under varying circumstances and in different places, RIP III has radical changes in sound and production quality from track to track. It's not an exaggeration to say that, without some background info, you might not recognize that it's the same dude behind all these songs. ""Crushed"", for instance, is a bit of rollicking '60s surf rock that slams headlong into ""All the Ways"", a wobbly slow-burner that recalls Wolf Parade. ""Surface Area"", on the other hand, is a foray into Magnetic Fields' territory that's surprisingly affecting and totally unlike anything else on the rest of the record. Though disjointed, RIP III's eclecticism is part of its charm. Rather than coming off as haphazard, the album has the feeling of surfing between public access channels with a one-hitter at hand. Nothing in particular unites the images, but a singular mood blankets the activity. The danger for Stasis is that his more satirical side will overshadow his skill as a songwriter, or, worse, that he'll be seen as a dilettante without a clearly-defined aesthetic of his own. But if playlists are indeed becoming as important as albums, RIP III shows that an individual songwriter can contain the same multitudes. On album opener and highlight ""Venus of Soap"", the chorus, huge and ecstatic, repeats the phrase ""I'll just laugh it off."" For Stasis, it's a mantra. But the joke's on us if we do the same.","The L.A.-based, Pennsylvania-bred outsider pop artist Michael Stasis mines the sun-bleached sounds of '70s AM radio for inspiration, weaving in a pre-industrial grind and psychedelic guitar work.

Thank You for Stickin' With Twig,Slim Twig,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af12ea9e61561daa63a8/1:1/w_160/8cdee790.jpg,2015-08-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20740-thank-you-for-stickin-with-twig/,DFA,"Over the course of five albums and many peripheral releases, Toronto-born Max Turnbull has fashioned himself an outsider narrative as Slim Twig. It’s true that 2009’s slimy sample-heavy Contempt! wasn't about to find a mainstream audience, though the crux of his self-styled myth hangs on Paper Bag rejecting 2012’s A Hound at the Hem for being too far out, which feels off when you consider the rest of their roster. Compared to his previous records, Hound was Slim’s most accessible release: A concept album loosely themed around Lolita and L’Histoire de Melody Nelson that conjured L.A.’s chamber pop weirdos Van Dyke Parks, Harry Nilsson, and Randy Newman in a dank, oily guise. Owen Pallett provided string arrangements. Slim eventually issued the record on Calico Corp, the label he runs with his wife, U.S. Girls’ Meg Remy, and DFA Records saw fit to re-release it last year. They offered Slim a deal for new work, and encouraged him to ""keep the music as weird as possible."" In the meantime, he had released the milder Sof Sike to appease Paper Bag, a compromise he says he didn’t mind. For all Slim’s off-kilter aims, Thank You for Stickin’ With Twig fits right into any number of very timely pop cultural concerns. His desire to emulate and kill his idols—audibly Zappa, Beefheart, the Zombies—paired with an abiding love of classic melodies and psychedelic murk aligns him with self-conscious, costumed rock’n’roll stylists like Father John Misty and Ariel Pink. Both FJM and Pink use bad taste and misogyny in an attempt to radicalize the traditional realms in which they work, and are credited as complex artists for it, though, as NPR’s Ann Powers highlighted in a recent essay on Josh Tillman, it’s a marketing ploy as much as any potentially genuine creative impulse: ""Maybe for that reason, outrageousness now doesn’t seek to change much beyond itself. It’s provocative, but not necessarily oppositional or even that unconventional at its core."" With Thank You, Slim rejects FJM and Pink’s rejection of good taste, positioning himself as an ally on gender and wage equality, a woman’s pleasure, and an advocate for ""dragging an appropriation of rock’n’roll kicking and screaming into a place free of cliché, sexism, and trod on association."" It’s a big claim. And yet, Slim appointing himself as a corrective sits almost as uncomfortably as Pink’s ""maced by a feminist"" story and FJM's cultivated chauvinism. Pitchfork contributor Jes Skolnik wrote recently about ""[recoiling] from men who are extremely keen to tell me exactly how Feminist they are."" She continued, ""[trust is] not something that comes with hardcore lyrics about the Right Topics."" Given that Slim has talked about admiring ""a lot of artists who would be considered assholes or even criminals like Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, and Phil Spector,"" it’s hard not to raise a skeptical brow at his foregrounded activism on behalf of the disenfranchised. Thank You comes at a time when we greet any art that basically musters the Bechdel test with the enthusiasm of serfs receiving crumbs from the master’s table. Type ""Magic Mike female pleasure"" into your favorite search engine and there’s a whole page of essays from high-profile outlets praising the film’s portrayal of women’s satisfaction. This is where Thank You starts, with ""Slippin’ Slidin’"", a desperate, sleazy devotional where Slim puts himself at the mercy of his sexual partner, his distorted voice matching the guitar’s gravelly thrust. That it sounds like Queens of the Stone Age covering T. Rex is surely meant to make some audacious point about a cock-rocking song concerning female pleasure, a level of extra-textural interest that Thank You assumes of its listeners. (Cop the extensive explanations that accompany its page in the DFA web store.) Better is the subsequent ""A Woman’s Touch (It’s No Coincidence)""—co-written with Remy—which confronts Yoko haters and attributes the Beatles’ wives with significant responsibility for their husbands’ success. This feels like a well-judged feminist statement coming from a male artist messing with rock’n’roll signifiers. It also sounds like a dub remix of the ""Roobarb and Custard"" theme tune that’s as irritating as it is fun. Also strong is ""Fog of Sex (N.S.I.S.)""—if it were less corroded, its sharp lyrics might forge an anthem for gender fluidity: ""Gender please/ Standardized questionnaire fee/ Simply mark which one you are/ Yet no option applies to me,"" Slim sings with Remy. ""A Woman’s Touch"" and ""Fog of Sex"" are the opening book-end to a bog of courtly baroque interludes (""She Stickin’ With Twig""), twisted junkyard carousel songs (""Stone Rollin’ (Musical Emotion)""), doomy stutter (""Trip Thru Bells""), and drawling electric guitar that magically captures the gleeful menace of Captain Beefheart’s voice (""Textiles on Mainstreet""; see also). Everything is doused in unkempt psych sleaze; the middle section is in desperate need of a corset. Amidst it is ""Roll Red Roll (Song for Steubenville)"". It starts as a murky waltz that veers again into that louche guitar tone, heralding inaudible lyrics that evoke the grim situation of the Steubenville high school football team rape case—all uneasy come-ons that don’t contain the option to say no: ""You ever been a mule hon?/ You ever make it past the line?/ Even in a school zone/ I see you look just fine."" Perhaps Slim has very personal reasons for wanting to inhabit this horrendous incident, but at the same time, the lyrics don’t convey a complex handle on its gravity. The only nod to Steubenville is in the title, which feels like another pat on his own back; outrageousness—masquerading as tribute—not seeking to change much beyond itself, again. The empty Big Ideas continue: ""You Got Me Goin..."" features a slurped sample of the Chi-Lites’ ""Stoned Out of My Mind"", which is rekindled again later on ""Out of My Mind"", with added woodwind. Following the genuinely clever and brilliant Hound, the mess is wildly frustrating. ""The trouble is once having killed one’s idols, there’s a tendency to also do away with melody, structure, clever lyrics, and a more ambitious approach to production,"" Slim told one interviewer of his attempts to avoid doing that. He wasn't particularly successful. It’s no surprise that he named the supreme self-sabotage that was Julian Casablancas and the Voidz’ Tyranny as one of his albums of 2014. Perversely, the song where Slim confronts the tension between himself and his dearly held inspirations is both the least original and best of Thank You. The jaunty, confident guitar hook of ""Live In, Live On, Your Era"" evokes both the Stones’ ""Rocks Off"" and Bowie’s ""Rebel Rebel"", and sails through proggy patches as Slim delivers acutely written lyrics about the vital challenge of originality: ""This ain’t the time to be cribbing in class/ One’s own voice is a great deal rarer/ With that in mind, start living out your era."" As if to make—or break?—his point, he follows it and closes the record with a hoary cover of Serge Gainsbourg and Jean-Claude Vannier’s ""Cannabis"".

But in Slim Twig’s incessant and overbearing winks to the camera, he’s lost sight of his own potential.","Over the course of five albums, Toronto-born Max Turnbull has fashioned himself an outsider narrative as Slim Twig.

10 Summers: The Mixtape Vol. 1,DJ Mustard,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afcfc0084474cd0c1b3b/1:1/w_160/4c04a425.jpg,2015-08-05 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20884-10-summers-the-mixtape-vol-1/,10 Summers,"If there's been one constant in life since late 2011, when DJ Mustard got his big break via Tyga's sneaky crossover ""Rack City"", it's the comforting radio omnipresence of Mustard's sparse slaps and '90s-nodding ratchet&B. But four years may as well be 40, and the Mustardwave has long since crested. While the sound he pioneered has lingered well past the average trend life-cycle, ""ratchet"" as a buzzword has all but gone the way of the dodo; even the @DennysDiner social team has moved on to fleeker pastures. If Mustard's latest full-length, 10 Summers: The Mixtape Vol. 1, sounds familiar, it's because it shares a title with his 2014 debut album. It's also because you've heard approximations of all these songs before, over and over, everywhere you go, for years. The central conceit of this mixtape series is that Mustard's dominance will ride out for a full decade, and if anyone could pull off that kind of endurance feat, it's the Dijon Don. But that claim's starting to feel like an empty gesture, even if it's not entirely unfeasible; does anyone really need that much Mustard on the beat? To be fair, Mustardwave hitting critical mass was spurred on by opportunistic imitators as much as the producer himself. Aside from Omarion's still-buzzing 2014 single ""Post to Be"", the most Mustard-y Top 40 single right now is Jidenna's ""Classic Man"", which isn't actually his production at all: it's built around a sample from Iggy's ""Fancy"", the most high-profile, blatant Mustard rip-off to date. In other words, it's become impossible to tell the simulacra from the real deal. The Mustardwave singularity is upon us, and at this point, these beats may as well be self-replicating ad infinitum. It's not that 10 Summers isn't good, per se. While it's significantly less star-studded than last year's album, and less explosive than 2013's well-timed Ketchup tape, the dip in quality isn't all that extreme. Besides, who wants to hate on low-stakes party music? There's no need to overanalyze the tape's 17 passable-to-solid tracks; all you really need to do is dance to them a couple Mangoritas deep in a backyard. But I want to believe Mustard has more up his sleeve than this: slight alterations of the same snaps, single-finger piano prods, and bassy synths, with a corral of just-fine Pushaz Ink rappers passing through. Even longtime muse YG's switched his style up post-My Krazy Life, with the Terrace Martin G-funk of ""Twist My Fingaz"". YG doesn't show up at all on 10 Summers; the tape's highest-profile feature is the Game, which speaks volumes about the kinds of half-assed attempts at the zeitgeist here. There are a handful of pretty great guest spots, for what it's worth, mostly from L.A. locals. On ""Trippin Off Hoes"", Pushaz Ink affiliate and charming dirtbag RJ goes off like a bomb over the beat's guttural growl: ""Gettin' rich though! She a trip though! Credit cards with somebody else info!"" The track's only two minutes, but it doesn't need to be any longer; it's the type of efficient, mercenarial slapper Mustard redefined. ""You Know It"", the best rap song here, showcases buzzing Vallejo newcomer Nef the Pharaoh and houses the tape's best one-liner from relative unknown Big Mike: ""On my money, I'm a opportunist/ Off my meds, I'm a orthodontist."" But most of the project's first two-thirds passes in a forgettable blur, and if the overwhelming sense of facsimile wasn't enough, a rapper named DrakeO—DrakeO!—is prominently featured. To be fair, Mustard's R&B production has easily outshined his rap production post-My Krazy Life, and 10 Summers is no different. Most of the tracks with any significant replay value here are the loose, wispy cabana R&B jams that comprise the tape's tail end. ""Overdose"", with TeeFlii, Iamsu!, and Choice, slides into an understated, liquid groove that draws from G-funk, yacht rock, and twinkly early-'00s Nelly ballads. ""Ice Cream"" channels the new jack slickness of Soul For Real's candy-coated raindrops. It's clear the guy still has ideas, and maybe he's saving the good ones for when the stakes are higher. Last week, he released ""Why'd You Call?"", a SoundCloud loosie featuring Makonnen and Ty Dolla $ign that exists somewhere between '80s electro and Based World, complete with Diplo-esque EDM breakdown. It's not necessarily the most inspired direction for Mustard, but at least he's venturing out of his comfort zone. That doesn't happen nearly enough on 10 Summers.","Mustard's latest full-length, 10 Summers: The Mixtape Vol. 1, is less star-studded than last year's 10 Summers, and less explosive than 2013's well-timed Ketchup tape.

Woman,Jill Scott,by: Safy-Hallan Farah,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7b13d197565213a2b6/1:1/w_160/6848f261.jpg,2015-08-05 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20819-woman/,Atlantic,"Jill Scott's voice is familiar like hair being braided on a stoop, like a fire hydrant pouring out into the street, like a slow summer. Woman, her fifth studio album, is slow in the way that the familiar is slow: we already know what to expect. With Scott, it's mom-and-pop, all-you-can-eat R&B; sexy fun for grown folk over the age of 40, like speed dating at church. Woman's first track, ""Wild Cookie"", initially seems like a spoken word ode to ""Empire""'s Cookie Lyon, but the lyrics quickly suggest that ""Cookie"" is a euphemism for the vagina. ""Wild Cookie choices lead to lonely pregnancy,"" Scott says over strings and drums. The vagina in ""Wild Cookie"", personified, acts on its own. Desirous, it does not have a mind of its own, but it would seem that way. ""Just the other day my girlfriend said she was watching TV and her wild cookie detached from its seat."" That detachment, that Jill speaks of—that desire—is a magnetizing energy. Beyond ""Wild Cookie"", there are other food references. After all, Scott perpetually sings like she's about to cook dinner for a family that isn't even hers. She wants domesticity, craves it. ""Prepared"", the track that follows the intro poem, has the lyrics ""I've been getting recipes off the Internet"" and ""I've been eating more greens"", which come as no surprise for anyone who's ever listened to ""The Way"" off her first album. Food is a big part of Scott's music. Additionally, in the track ""Closure"", Scott sings about not making a man quiches and homemade waffles anymore, how he shouldn't expect breakfast. ""I'm on my way, I'm almost there,"" Scott sings in ""Coming to You"", a percussion-laden, breathless track, the most urgent on a decidedly slow record. ""Coming to You"" is a funky, upbeat jam, but for a faster song, it's not necessarily more fun. The fun tracks are the ones that shimmer. ""Fool's Gold"", arguably the best song, is about a disillusioned Scott who finds herself in a relationship that might as well have been a pipe dream. ""I was living the dream/ Believing things that just ain't true/ Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you/ Had me chasing fool's gold,"" she sings over a bouncy, enchanting instrumental. Another strong track is ""Lighthouse"", a somberly reassuring lullaby of a ballad about supporting a lover through trying, burdensome times. ""I'm your shelter,"" Scott sings like an overprotective siren, striking a balance between sexy and soothing. Intimate and slow-moving, Woman is good but underwhelming. It lacks the dynamism of Who Is Jill Scott?**, the rap features of Light of the Sun. What was new, interesting, and different 15 years ago isn't anymore. Scott's mastered the formula of candlelit, slow-cooker music. Her sense of humor and sensuality, fine-tuned, endearing and bold, is infused throughout this album, but it doesn't feel like enough. It misses the mark, like a lot of great music does, because it's less inventive.","Jill Scott's fifth studio album is slow in the way that the familiar is slow: we already know what to expect.

Regulate...G Funk Era Part II EP,Warren G,by: Jay Balfour,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe7b1335d7bf169a00c/1:1/w_160/a1e2f767.jpg,2015-08-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20901-warren-g-regulateg-funk-era-part-ii-ep/,G Funk,"Warren G is one of hip-hop's quietest modern pioneers. Even after he helped Dr. Dre, his stepbrother, carve out a career-long groove with his sample selections for The Chronic, Death Row wanted nothing to do with him until he churned out his own Def Jam single, ""Regulate"", which they happily slapped their logo on after the fact. The song was his first major hit—his production and collaboration with Nate Dogg on Mista Grimm's ""Indo Smoke"" notwithstanding—and it has rightfully endured as his biggest. But ""Regulate"" also overshadowed the rest of Warren G's output, so cleanly encapsulating G-funk that the song has become a deceptive stand-in for a frequently nuanced career. The album, Regulate… G Funk Era, was also released two years after Dre's solo debut, a post-N.W.A. team effort that pioneered a similar sound and is more frequently celebrated as a benchmark. But Regulate… was still momentous, hyper-local and ripe for national appetite at once, a sudden beam of light pointed directly on Long Beach. Making a sequel to such a career- and genre-defining record might smack of desperation elsewhere, but Warren G is sincere with G Funk Era Part II. A year past the original album's 20th anniversary, this record may have missed its most marketable moment; in another way it's also perfectly on time. In a recent interview with Billboard, Warren G made a familiar veteran-rapper promise about bringing back a ""sound that has been missing [in] hip-hop,"" but if anything, his return comes in the midst of a minor G-funk renaissance. Kendrick Lamar dabbled with and dissected the genre on To Pimp a Butterfly, and YG hit an unexpected stride over a Terrence Martin G-funk beat for his first post-shooting single last month. Meanwhile, DJ Quik is still tweaking and Snoop Dogg dropped the raps (again) on his last album for a smoother, adult-contemporary revision of the sound. The resurgence is part of a larger refocusing on California hip-hop, but G-funk has been brought along for the ride. As advertised, Regulate... G Funk Era Part II sticks squarely to Warren G's roots. The production is clean, lush, and familiar, and with four tracks running just under 15 minutes long, it is pleasantly unambitious. There's no misguided attempts at recreating the original, and there also isn't a dud in sight. ""My House"", the first single, flips Madness' '80s hit ""Our House"" into a bouncing stomper. It's the same trick Warren pitched with ""Regulate"" and has been his strength all along, upending weirdly obvious records into unexpected slappers. Nate Dogg rebuilds Madness' hook into a dramatic street anthem and Warren, whose rapping has always been confidently breezy, lays claim to everything in sight. The EP also serves as a tasteful tribute to Nate Dogg, who is featured on every track. ""Saturday"", the most upbeat number here, could anchor a barbeque anywhere in California, and Nate Dogg's vocals on the song bear out his mark as a stylistic innovator. Because of his most familiar riffs, Nate Dogg is sometimes pigeonholed as a monotonous baritone, but songs like ""Saturday"" not only stretch his upper register, they showcase his constant runs and clever vocal riffing. Thankfully, this sequel rarely fetishizes Nate Dogg or his passing, and most of the songs breeze by with no mention of his death. It's best that way, as a restrained, unceremonious showcase. Jeezy's verse on ""Keep on Hustlin'"" is an exception, opening with a handful of bars eulogizing Nate Dogg, 2Pac, and Biggie at once before dropping an unfortunately dated reference to freeing Boosie Badazz, who has been out of jail for more than a year. The verse breaks the mood, but it's only momentary, and the rest of the EP could have believably been released at any point in the last ten years. That might be the best thing about G Funk Era Part II: it's not strained or pandering, as much as an effortless continuation. The EP might not be a foundation shaker like its namesake, but Warren G is proof that sometimes music is best when it stands still.","A year past Regulate… G Funk Era's 20th anniversary, the hip-hop pioneer Warren G is releasing the G Funk Era Part II EP, which features Nate Dogg on every track.

Into the Eye of Satan,Deiphago,by: Andy O' Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4e5e6ef95969321d9f/1:1/w_160/724c82ea.png,2015-08-04 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20788-into-the-eye-of-satan/,Hell's Headbangers,"Filipino black metal trio Deiphago, who formed in Manila but have been based in Costa Rica since 2004, are but one testament to the global reach of metal. They're indebted to the black metal of two Canadian bands, Blasphemy and Conqueror, as well as the Brazilian primitivism of Sarcofago, but play with a looseness not quite fitting any of those groups. Even by the lo-fi fetish standards of black metal, Deiphago commit to a chaos few bands could match. A more polished Deiphago record seems antithetical, but that's what Into the Eye of Satan, their fourth full-length, is to an extent. In the hand of noted metal producer Colin Marston, we see a more complete version of the band. In Eyes, the chaos isn't squelched, just illuminated. From ""Evil and Adverse"", it's obvious their actual playing hasn't changed much, but Marston's production makes you better appreciate their muscularity. Guitarist Sidapa's leads are more prominent in the mix. ""Bloodbath of Genocide"" features wah-wah swaths in the beginning that would have gone unnoticed before, and these minor details add up. His mini-solos in ""6x6x6/3"" sound more like the playing of a college kid obsessed with free jazz and Thurston Moore than conventional shredding. Sidapa sounds most bizarre in ""Calculated Acts of Cruelty"" and the title track closer, abandoning any conceits of fluidity. Peaks become valleys without warning and notes criss-cross into tangled weaves. With improved production, Eye inadvertently reveals the hardcore influence—especially that of d-beat groups like Discharge—that's always been latent in Deiphago's music. Drummer Savnok opts for a looser, punkier style. Vocalist/bassist Voltaire 666's bass may sound less distorted, but it's never sounded meaner. Deiphago may be the true successors of Venom, who brought endearing sloppiness and fuck-all attitude to the creation of black metal. All this, combined with Sidapa's guitar work, finds Deiphago oddly, if pleasingly, working against their own credo. They're not afraid to proclaim ""Fuck off to the false!"", but Eye is less straitlaced than many of their peers' works. Deiphago's other records may have served as a litmus test for how much discordance you can handle in metal; this is where you fully realize just how serious they are.","The Filipino black metal trio Deiphago embrace a sound that is chaotic even by black-metal standards. On Into the Eye of Satan, they worked with noted metal producer Colin Marston, resulting in their cleanest-sounding release yet. In this form, their chaos isn't squelched, just illuminated.

Tha Truth,Trae tha Truth,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afccc0084474cd0c1b32/1:1/w_160/8b9d4094.jpg,2015-08-04 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20882-tha-truth/,Grand Hustle,"There's a run on great rap voices in Houston—Bun B's crisp baritone, Z-Ro's bluesy bounce, Scarface's bellow. But Trae tha Truth's might be the most unique—a rasp carrying so much weight he might be Houston's version of Big Rube, if Rube decided to rhyme. He's also never really broke all the way through like his contemporaries from the class of 2005, or escaped the local hub of the Screwed Up Click. There is a darkness to his music that might put off outsiders. Sometimes he even discomfits his own city: He was banned by Houston's most-recognizable hip-hop station for a sustained period of time because of an inane allegation he incited violence via his annual Trae Day, a local, charitable holiday (officially recognized by the mayor!). In other words, his art is so gut-level effective it nearly blacklisted him from a city he has represented tirelessly for over a decade. No one's realer than Trae. However, true to Houston form, he can't quite sustain a full-length album. Between a solo run and his work with ABN, Trae's established a personal canon, but you'll be hard-pressed to hear a song of his after Fat Pat's ""Tops Drop"" and Chamillionaire's ""Ridin'"" during a best-of-Houston playlist: he's so prolific that in recent years he's spread his catalog thin. That there's no strong Houston presence on Tha Truth, Trae's first record in four years, is not a surprise, because he's always been the odd-man-out of the nationally-recognized Houston crew, and his affiliation with T.I.'s Hustle Gang makes some locals bristle. But it unfortunately lends a major-label-rap sameness to Tha Truth, his seventh official studio album, that is kryptonite to someone as unique as Trae. Some moments work better than others, but the album feels shuffled rather than sequenced.  Problem, a good rapper, is sorely mismatched with Lil Boss, one of the few features (and only local one) to leave a mark, on solid first single ""Yeah Hoe."" Trae lets DeJ Loaf get the last word on this record, on the excellent closer ""Realigion,"" and the fit makes sense: DeJ works the same anti-social angle Trae has trafficked in for years. Surprisingly, the J. Cole collaboration is the most affecting song. Cole's strained gravitas works in small doses, and it does on ""Children of Men,"" a soulful lament that runs through familiar themes of violence and poverty but manages to twist them afresh in Trae's husky presence. When not basking in the highs of ""Children of Men"" or the lows of ill-advised sex jam ""Late Night King"" (with a badly Auto-Tuned Jeremih on the hook), Tha Truth just hovers in the Houston-street-rap middle. On the intro, Lil Duval insists, ""ain't no music out here for the struggle right now...that's what the people need."" And Trae stays to true to his word. ""Why"" is a somber reflection on gang violence, but it doesn't resonate after it's over. ""Tricken Every Car I Get"" with Future and Boosie, is a good single, but it's mostly telling  for how hungry Boosie sounds: ""Spray that thing candy but might wreck the whip the next day/Peanut butter insides covered up in plastic/stash spots everywhere, ride fly everywhere."" These are fun lines that stick in your head on first listen, and they capture more vitality in a few seconds than Trae does for the entire record. Showmanship has never been Trae's trademark, and that can be an issue. He's still rapping well enough over good beats, and he earns points for not shoehorning a Kirko Bangz hook or Travis Scott verse in somewhere. Yet Tha Truth doesn't feel vital, and, at his peak, Trae was arguably the most vital Houston rapper—anchoring a scene that featured the antics of Mike Jones and Paul Wall, he was the lyricist's lyricist, the conscience of the underground. Trae doesn't have to prove to anyone he's a necessary voice in hip-hop, but between Slim Thug's surprisingly solid twin Hogg Life records from this year, or the consistently mellow output from fellow ABN member Z-Ro, for now anyway, he's been outpaced.","Trae Tha Truth is one of the most distinctive voices in Houston rap, even if he never broke through to the degree of his class-of-2005 contemporaries. His latest album features J. Cole, Dej Loaf, Future, and others.

Holographic Violence,Grave Babies,by: Cameron Cook,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afbcb1335d7bf1699fc7/1:1/w_160/2940ad8f.jpg,2015-08-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20863-holographic-violence/,Hardly Art,"Holographic Violence is the third album in six years from Seattle’s Grave Babies, and it amounts to a costume change for their usual reverb-drenched, hollowed-out guitar noise: They've gone from garage to gothic. And we’re not talking a subtle nod to the Sisters of Mercy or Killing Joke sprinkled here or there. No, this would be candle-lit-bat-cave, Peter-Murphy-drinking-merlot-out-of-a-human-skull levels of goth. Generally, this switch serves the album well, as Grave Babies' earlier work felt a bit lost in the shuffle of the Bay Area garage rock revival of the late '00s. However, with song titles like ""Pain Iz Pleasure"" and ""Punishment (Only a Victim)"", it's not so clear where appreciation ends and pastiche begins. That's not a dig, actually—few scenes are more susceptible to parody than goth music, and for good reason; it can always feel embarrassing to celebrate negative emotions, but that's also what makes it deliciously indulgent. Grave Babies' music has always flirted with darkness, but the alienation and misanthropy of Violence feels new. Part of this shift may be attributed to personnel: Sometime between the releases of Crusher and Violence, frontman and songwriter Danny Wahlfeldt overhauled Grave Babies' permanent roster with Bryce Brown of Crypts on bass, Claire Haranda on synths, and the key addition of Mark Gajadhar from cult post-hardcore poster boys Blood Brothers on drums. Gajadhar duly takes his place as Violence's MVP, his precise, no-nonsense style (intertwined throughout the album with drum machines) propulsing everything forward, step by step, as Wahlfeldt's controlled chaos shudders and swirls around him. Violence opens with the near-shoegaze distortion of ""Eternal (On & On)"", with layer upon layer of guitars and synthesizers washing over Wahfeldt's echoing, distorted baritone: ""A life that leaves without a purpose/ And on and on and on it goes..."" It would be easy to imagine it as the soundtrack to a sci-fi film where teenagers in bondage gear roam a dystopian wasteland. ""Try 2 Try"" brings the tone even lower with heavy, syncopated guitars swamping through the mix as Haranda's keyboard line struggles to pop through. It works, giving the music the needed edge to create density without slog. ""Something Awful"" owes a whole lot to Disintegration-era Cure, or even Peter Hook, as Brown's buoyant bass takes center stage, carrying the album into its middle stage, which, like with many goths themselves, can get awkward. It's not a lack of direction, or even musicianship, that causes Violence to ultimately lag. It's perhaps not even a lack of tunes, as ""N2 Ether"" and its warbly vocal hook make for a welcome pick-me-up further down the tracklisting. It's just at some point, the album loses its flavor, and songs begin to mash and bleed into each other in a not-exactly-purposeful or interesting way. It's not unlistenable, far from it, it just gets slowly (very, very slowly) bogged and drowned under its own ideas. In a landscape where bands are encouraged more and more to play it safe and appeal to their same couple thousand Twitter followers over and over again, it's commendable that Grave Babies took this leap of faith and changed their direction so drastically. In the end, though, Violence comes off as transitional, a building block for a bigger, darker, blacker record that may be in Grave Babies' future.","Holographic Violence is the third album in six years from Seattle’s Grave Babies, and it amounts to a costume change for their usual reverb-drenched, hollowed-out guitar noise: They've gone from garage to gothic.

Weirdo Shrine,La Luz,by: Lindsay Hood,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af449d034d5c69bf46b7/1:1/w_160/9fde4246.jpg,2015-08-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20781-weirdo-shrine/,Hardly Art,"In Charles Burns' graphic novel Black Hole, the teenagers of 1970s Seattle are spreading a bizarre sexually transmitted disease with varying symptoms. One might grow a tail or shed their skin, or sprout a tiny mouth below the collarbone that whispers secrets while you sleep. Some kids become extremely deformed, while others manage to hide their disfigurement beneath bandages and clothes. Black Hole was the inspiration behind La Luz's Weirdo Shrine, and there are oblique references to Burns' work littered throughout: its title alludes to the artwork built out of trash and human parts that Black Hole's characters stumble upon in the forest, and lyrics like ""Cool kids/ Telling lies/ I can't hold their gazes in mine,"" (from opening track ""Sleep Till They Die"") hint at the shame and deceit in Burns' world. What makes Weirdo Shrine interesting is that all this existential dread is wrapped up in classic-sounding surf rock, topped with enough ""ooohhhs"", ""aaahhhs"", and vocal harmonies to fill your girl group quota for an entire year. Lead singer and guitarist Shana Cleveland tosses out bright, airy guitar riffs, tinged with just the right amount of reverb, as easy as breathing. But the surfer girl guise is a front. If La Luz are a rum punch drink served in a pineapple, be careful lifting the tiny drink umbrella: There's probably a black widow spider underneath. Nowhere is this more apparent than the ballad, ""I'll Be True"". Cleveland croons, ""No one else treats me like you do/ And I'll be true to you/ Just as long as you want me to,"" while keyboardist Alice Sandahl tries to wrestle the good name of organ solos from the hands of Ray Manzarek. But the lingering effect of the song is not the declaration of loyalty, it's the minor chord progression that blends with the ladies' descending voices. It begs the question: If the love in the song is so pure and innocent then why does it come tinged with such eeriness? La Luz recorded It's Alive in the back of their friend's trailer. For Weirdo Shrine, producer Ty Segall constructed a makeshift studio out of an old surfboard factory. At first, this tactic can come across almost like a cheap gimmick, a soundbite for press releases. But once you realize Segall also chose to keep a persistent hissing overlay on the entire record (it's hard to ignore once you hear it)—the occasional, lingering odd note or glitch will also tend to appear during the transitions between tracks—his methods become less a cute anecdote, and more a way to keep the group firmly grounded in their DIY roots. The ladies might have perfect pitch, but this is not an album for cleaning up mistakes. It's frustrating that the record doesn't fully convey the energy of La Luz's live shows, where the band members will crowd surf and request the audience make space for a line dance à la ""Soul Train"". But if you choose to focus on La Luz's doo-wop harmonizing, then you're only looking at the frilly, pink bow that tops the whole package. The undercurrent of darkness in La Luz's music is what makes their work so fierce and intelligent. You could blink and miss their sneaky, underhanded way of slipping unease into their cheerful-sounding songs. Which is why you should give them more of your attention. Much like a car accident, it's always the ones we didn't see coming that hit the hardest.","La Luz's second LP was inspired by Charles Burns' graphic novel Black Hole, in which the teenagers of 1970s Seattle spread a bizarre sexually transmitted disease with varying symptoms. Produced by Ty Segall, the album brings surf-rock riffs and girl-group harmonies to songs that are darker than they seem.

Another One,Mac DeMarco,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afbbc0084474cd0c1b14/1:1/w_160/eb62616b.jpg,2015-08-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20862-another-one/,Captured Tracks,"To get to Rockaway Beach you take the A train toward Far Rockaway, waiting as it winds through Brooklyn, past clumps of trees dotting picturesque residential neighborhoods, over narrow bridges surrounded by the sea, through an imaginary portal away from the hustle and bustle of New York City to a more serene existence. That's where Mac DeMarco lives on the water, when he's not busy gallivanting in the Brooklyn scene or touring across the world. At the end of his new mini-LP, Another One, he tells us his address, and invites us to come over for a cup of coffee, so that in the process of taking that long train ride, toward boardwalks dusted with white sand and the ocean stretched for miles and miles, we might come closer to understanding his slacker-poet point of view. At first sight, DeMarco seems impossibly ""chill,"" that meditative state achieved by studying Buddhism or popping a few Oxys, only it’s more complicated than that. He connects not simply because he's ""chill,"" but because his relaxed self seems borne of extreme self-confidence. His music isn't for situations that are laidback in and of themselves. They're for the unguarded moments you might share with another person where the both of you are comfortable without reservation. Music made for the end of a rooftop barbecue, when the sun dips, the beer is nearly gone, and everyone who doesn't want to be there has already gone. Here, you can be honest, goofy, even silent; all of it is accepted without a dissenting word. This type of sincerity without precocity is rare in art, and the contrast between the content of DeMarco's music and the content of his character only highlights his singularity as someone whose contradictions build toward a vibrant self, rather than collapsing in disarray. Which means: If you like DeMarco, you'll like Another One. It's like a novella, or a made-for-TV movie—something to chew on while we wait for the next major project. It riffs on his established formula: the same rinky-dink guitar tone, funky basslines, air-tight percussion announcing a band with enough experience to avoid fucking up the vibe. There are four slow songs and three songs that are a little less slow but still plenty relaxed, all of them filled with little details to catch your ear. The solo in ""The Way You Love Her"" was written with Robbie Robertson's strictured tone in mind, even as it ends up a few steps closer to the nu-reggae swing of Magic!'s ""Rude"". Few will sound as comely or as inviting as DeMarco does on ""No Other Heart"" when he sings, ""Come on and give this lover boy a try/ I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes/ What could you lose?"" The twinkling chord progression on ""Without Me""—amongst his prettiest songs ever recorded—is buttressed by a cloud of washed out synthesizers, creating a lovesick feeling as he sings about accepting that a woman is better without him. ""Just to Put Me Down"" has a future as an extended set closer, with the refrain of the song title warping ever so slowly as he sings it over and over again, his guitar bursting into peals of expression. The wink of the album's title turns introspective on the title track, with a deeply languid DeMarco ruminating about the uncertainty of his relationship while wondering if ""another one"" is knocking at the door of his beloved. DeMarco is an unusually sensitive songwriter, capable of ferreting out what someone else might be feeling even as he’s absorbed in his own perspective. He’s what sex columnist Dan Savage refers to as ""GGG"": good, giving, and game. When I saw him at this year's Primavera Sound Festival, his band dropped in a few minutes of Coldplay's ""Yellow""—the joke, of course, being that ""Yellow"" is fairly close to a song that DeMarco would've written. Chris Martin says the stars shine for his lover; DeMarco says they call for him, only he'd rather stay with his woman. I know I'm special, he sings, but I want you to be a part of it, too. And so he continues to write another one and another one until we're convinced.","Mac DeMarco is an unusually sensitive songwriter, capable of ferreting out what someone else might be feeling even as he’s absorbed in his own perspective.

Fratello Mare,Mike Cooper,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af57ea9e61561daa642e/1:1/w_160/438889d3.png,2015-08-03 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20793-fratello-mare/,Room40,"Mike Cooper isn’t widely known, but to the extent that the wider world has heard of him, it’s for a series of folk-rock albums that veer thrillingly towards free jazz and improvisation. Trout Steel, Places I Know, and T**he Machine Gun Co. with Mike Cooper were all reissued last year by Paradise of Bachelors, reasserting his place in the canon of exploratory singer-songwriters of the '60s and '70s, people who found unexplored corners on folk songs and pulled on them until they bent into new shapes. But those albums are a footnote inside the wider, weirder world of Mike Cooper. He also provides live music for silent films, paints and does collage, and releases albums of experimental, loop-based guitar music that sound like tropical-kitsch recordings from the mid-20th century drowning in soup. Fratello Mare is one such album: Cooper’s chosen instrument is a 1930s National Resophonic guitar that he has rigged with a series of effects pedals and loopers. He generates a slightly nauseous, shimmery river of sounds with it, fragments of pearly guitar notes that resemble Hawaiian slack-key guitar floating in a viscous solution filled with chattering incidental noises. On ""On Passing Bamboo"", there is the woody thunk of some mallet percussion, and in ""A House in Bali"" some pre-recorded wind chimes loop nightmarishly. Cooper has a fascination with Pacific culture, with tropical kitsch and folk music (he is a devoted collector of Hawaiian shirts), and the chatter of birds fills the background of almost every piece here, as well as the cries of other animals, while his improvisatory guitar peals quietly. The energy coursing through these warped recordings is that of a strange, terrible dream you might have after a luau. There are field recordings scattered through the album that Cooper made himself on the islands across South East Asia and the Caribbean, and they surface in fragments, sometimes recognizable (the riiip of a motorcycle engine tooling away from us), often not. Cooper’s music, in any of its forms, seems drunk on the intermingling of folk traditions, searching for a spot between them all that renders the strange familiar and vice versa. He is an improvisatory musician, one who generates his music in sheets, loops, and layers, and he seems to accrete these found-sound albums like a spider spins silk, or a vine grows pumpkins. They just appear, fattened and ripe, the fruits of his memories, travels, and idiosyncrasies.","Mike Cooper isn’t widely known, but to the extent that the wider world has heard of him, it’s as part of the canon of exploratory singer-songwriters of the '60s and '70s.

Green Lanes,Ultimate Painting,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9713d197565213a2ea/1:1/w_160/52e96d09.jpg,2015-08-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20842-green-lanes/,Trouble in Mind,"Ultimate Painting named their first album Ultimate Painting, and opened it with a song called ""Ultimate Painting"". Those neutral titles matched the duo's no-frills music. Centered on the wiry guitar lines of Jack Cooper (Mazes) and James Hoare (Veronica Falls), their economical three-minute songs echoed the patient melodies of the Velvet Underground's self-titled third album and the workingman's garage-pop of New Zealand bands like the Chills and the Bats. Ultimate Painting was winningly casual, the sound of two congenial dudes psyched to roll out easygoing melodies. But repeat listens revealed intriguing tensions inside basic templates. The group's follow-up, Green Lanes, sounds even more casual. It's mellower and more subdued, with most songs ticking along at medium tempo or slower. At first it even seems that Ultimate Painting might have gotten too relaxed, drifting into zoned-out territory (they did recently use a modified Grateful Dead logo as their Twitter avatar). But much like its predecessor, Green Lanes grows more interesting and distinctive with each subsequent rotation. Cooper and Hoare's deceptively simple interplay slowly worms into your synapses, as their seemingly anonymous melodies gain personality. That's part of what makes Green Lanes so cohesive, since its lyrical themes are as simple as its moods. Many songs focus on the austere pleasures of nature—words such as ocean, beach, fog, and sun recur—as well as the plain details of daily life. One of the catchiest tunes, the lament ""(I've Got the) Sanctioned Blues"", plays like the song about unemployment benefits VU never wrote. Songs like that could easily come off as run-of-the-mill, but Ultimate Paining infuse their short, spartan verses with deep contemplation. Just as Real Estate's music gathers meaning in nostalgia, Cooper and Hoare tap into universal experiences that approach profundity rather than mundanity. This gives their songs a vintage hue, most obvious in the Beatles-esque piano of ""Break the Chain"" and the Beach Boys-like vocal harmonies of ""Paying the Price"". Such classic reference points make it tempting to call Green Lanes a low-stakes record. Music this devoid of attention-seeking flash or overt ambition can sometimes appear risk-averse. But truly committing to any style means taking a chance, even if that style is inherently low-key. American Analog Set and Low built a wide palate with an understated approach, and the quietude of that third Velvet Underground album seemed daring at the time. Ultimate Painting are similarly devoted to a calm, subtle cause, and on Green Lanes that humble gamble again pays off handsomely.","Ultimate Painting is centered on the wiry guitar lines of Jack Cooper (Mazes) and James Hoare (Veronica Falls).

Pearl Charles EP,Pearl Charles,by: Tess Duncan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afad5e6ef95969321e42/1:1/w_160/7930ab4c.png,2015-08-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20864-pearl-charles-ep/,Burger,"The hazy dreamworld of Pearl Charles' eponymous debut comes primarily from the '60s and '70s. The EP is bursting with blues-rock and blissed-out psychedelia. Charles is not a frontwoman whose voice soars over her band—she favors shadowy harmonies. Bedding every track with cooing ""ooh""s and ""ah""s, she buries her strongest writing in the midst of splashy drumming and cutting power chords. ""What can I say to make you walk away?/ And make you understand that I don't wanna hold your hand?"" she sings on ""What Can I Do"", rejecting the Beatles' decades-old proposal with indignance. Charles' record takes cues from movements all over the American map. There are hints of Southern folk and alt-country, Midwest Americana, and West Coast acid rock. She tugs at these sounds with her smoky alto, which gives off the kind of sensuality we associate with Lana Del Rey. The femme fatale described in ""Idea to Her"" sounds like she could have been plucked from Del Rey's songbook, Charles' voice similarly toothsome and her tone nearly as coy. The seductress role looks good on Charles, and she takes it on again alongside driving rhythms on the rootsy ""I Ran So Far"". She coaxes her lover to trust her with their secrets, but in such a way that both she and the listener know she's lying through her teeth. When she vows, ""Won't tell nobody else,"" it's easy to picture thick smoke curling away to reveal a devilish grin on her face. When she recedes from the spotlight, the EP gets a little vague. ""Night & Day"" is Pearl Charles' most diverse cut, with a jaunty surf-rock chord progression leading into a twinkling piano glissando into spiraling, bluesy guitar lines. But Charles hits a snag, relying on the arrangements to carry her through dull lyrics and tedious ""dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum""s. On the prismatic psych-folk track ""Indian Burnout"", Charles leans into then out of her words, singing with a slight Southern drawl recalling Emmylou Harris. It's a shaky ride but a magnetic one that doesn't reach for heights that would overpower it or push things too far. The missteps are small and forgivable, especially considering her affinity for unexpected—but measured—choices. There are small but potent style decisions in many of these songs—rolling, ominous piano notes on ""Idea to Her"", rubbery, countrified strings on ""I Ran So Far"". It bodes well for a future full-length release. Here's hoping she continues to cultivate clear-sighted songwriting and an ear for worthwhile risk-taking.","Pearl Charles' debut EP is bursting with blues-rock and blissed-out psychedelia.

Bahdeni Nami,Omar Souleyman,by: Minna Zhou,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af89ea9e61561daa6485/1:1/w_160/8b27b795.jpg,2015-08-03 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20830-bahdeni-nami/,Monkeytown,"It's not always easy to tell who the person is behind the persona that is Omar Souleyman—what's really going on behind the aviator shades, the poker face, the dissonance between the high-speed jangling dance music bumping out of speakers and his relatively motionless stage presence. But if Bahdeni Nami is any indication, the man who's become the frontrunner of Syrian techno dabke is, among other things, a human being, who like anyone else is prone to heartbreak. Souleyman's last release and first ""proper"" studio album, Wenu Wenu, produced by Kieran Hebden (Four Tet), was colorful in its exuberance, a headlong rush into new love. But if Wenu Wenu was the upswing, Bahdeni Nami is the immediate aftermath, which isn't necessarily pretty and isn't always fun to listen to. It's still dabke—the popular Levantine Arab music traditionally accompanied by circle and line dancing—but it's heavier this time, both lyrically and musically. Bahdeni Nami was recorded closer to home, in Istanbul instead of Brooklyn where Wenu Wenu was made—though Souleyman is still in exile from his native Syria. Signed to Berlin producer duo Modeselektor's Monkeytown Records, Souleyman has enlisted a slew of producers for this second full-length studio release, including Four Tet, Gilles Peterson, Modeselektor, Legowelt (for an out-of-place haunted house remix), and Black Lips' Cole Alexander (for a purported upcoming remix). Unfortunately, Bahdeni Nami as an album isn't stronger for their handiwork. And it's not that their production styles overshadow Souleyman's sound, but rather that as the album progresses, the music becomes static and, in most instances, redundant. There's still a lot to be said for the mind-bending keyboard work of long-time collaborator Rizan Sa'id and the saz (long-necked lute) skills of Khaled Youssef, who create the bulk of the sound. The opening track, ""Mawal Menzal"", finds the singer professing his undying love for a woman who has ostensibly left him. It's a mawwal, a sung passage in Arabic music that traditionally involves a vocalist improvising the melody of a poetic text, usually while an instrumentalist intersperses corresponding lines. That kind of dueting is ubiquitous on Bahdeni Nami, alternating predictably with longer stretches of keyboard/saz solos. It's a formula that helped propel Souleyman to electro-dabke stardom in the first place. And on the album's title track ""Bahdeini Nami"", it still works. Produced by Four Tet, it's the most light-footed of the lot, and the most communal. Throughout the song, men throw ""Yey!""s and ""Hey!""s into the air. Even the stomping bass has a sort of upward lift, buoyed in part by lilting toy-Casio-esque syncopations. By contrast, on the dirge-like ""Darb El Hawa"", synths drone like distorted bagpipes above a lumbering bass drum and staid handclaps. Souleyman drags his voice like tired feet, intoning in Syrian Arabic, ""The road of love tortured me/ For so long, I've been waiting for a letter from my loved one."" His words echo and ricochet into the distance as he plays and replays his own grief back to himself. Save for saz, voice, and sometimes claps, everything here is simulated on keys, which is how Souleyman and Sa'id have always worked. But there's something poetic this time about the fact that nearly all the instrumentation is simulated; love is often an illusory thing after all. That said, on much of the album, repetition crosses into redundancy, especially true on the two Modeselektor-produced tracks, ""Tawwalt El Gheba"" and ""Enssa El Aatab"". Both have a four-on-the-floor thump that imitates migraine pain above all else. It's not because of the  four-on-the-floor though; it's because the music keeps cycling back on itself without a sense of having moved anywhere or varied much. This monolithic feeling ends up overshadowing some of the more interesting '80s synth music and acid house moments on the album, where the tightly-coiled keyboard solos recall variously a reedy mijwiz (a double-pipe reed instrument), a distorted psych rock guitar, even a Moog. Listening to Bahdeni Nami as a whole can feel borderline-masochistic. But then again, maybe that's the point; longing for or stewing over the memory of someone you've lost is its own kind of hell.","Syrian singer Omar Souleyman's first proper studio LP Wenu Wenu, produced by Kieren Hebden, was colorful in its exuberance, a headlong rush into new love.

Death Magic,HEALTH,by: T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aee0c0084474cd0c1994/1:1/w_160/eee74687.jpg,2015-08-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20861-death-magic/,Loma Vista,"One of the highlights of Nine Inch Nails' Lights in the Sky tour back in 2008 was the added pleasure of watching HEALTH—then a still relatively unknown bunch of L.A. noisemakers—manage to almost steal the show. Of all the acts that Trent Reznor picked to open dates on that tour, HEALTH seemed the like the most obvious heir apparent—a band using bizarro configurations of electronics and guitars to pummel the audience into submission. Theirs appeared to be a very Reznor-approved pursuit: technology employed in service of exploring some of the most base human impulses—to incite, to destroy, and to possibly cause deafness. It says something about the nature of HEALTH's music that of their now six proper full-length releases, two are remix albums (2008's Disco and 2010's Disco2) and one is the soundtrack to a video game (2013's surprisingly excellent Max Payne 3). In fact, their music has often flourished best in remix form. Hearing the band's music stripped and reworked by the likes of Gold Panda, Crystal Castles, and CFCF (whose sinewy reworking of Get Color's ""Before Tigers"" remains a standout) shone a light on just what was frequently hidden underneath all of HEALTH's Boredoms-esque roar: namely vocalist Jacob Duzsik's feathery vocals and the band's nascent ear for melody. Given room to breathe, HEALTH's music reveals itself to be much more than ""industrial disco""—it's also pop music. It's been over half a decade since they released a studio album, and Death Magic is a bold, albeit occasionally jarring, step forward. In a recent Pitchfork interview the band happily extolled the virtues of Depeche Mode and Rihanna, all of which makes the outré pop leanings of Death Magic more understandable. Given the early singles teased from the album, there was every reason to think that Death Magic might just be business as usual—and in some ways it is. The first single,""New Coke"", materialized via a music video that featured high-intensity blasts of rafter-shaking low-end (not to mention the most lovingly filmed slow-motion vomit shots ever captured in a music video). Similarly, ""Men Today"" is a riot of barely corralled tribal drums, overdriven synths, and unpredictable beats. The track is pristinely produced and appropriately mountain-sized (Andrew Dawson and Lars Stalfors contribute production duties throughout), but it's not exactly a radical reinvention. Once you dig deeper into the record, however, the dark clouds begin to part. On Death Magic, the band finally embraces the pop impulses that seem to have always been lurking in their DNA. ""Flesh World (UK)"" comes swinging out of the gate like a house track—a dancefloor appropriate number with an appropriately grim chorus (""We die/ So what/ We're here"") that only occasionally pauses to slam the listener face first into a wall of white noise before advising ""Do all the drugs/ But don't hurt the ones you love."" ""Dark Enough"" is a goth-pop power ballad in which Duzsik sings, ""Does it make a difference if it's real?/ As long as I still say I love you?"" It's the kind of sideways romantic admission that would have sounded out of place—or perhaps just totally unintelligible—on a previous HEALTH record. The band's biggest and most shocking pop moment comes just halfway through on ""Life""—a song that flirts with stadium-size pop sentiments that would not be out of place on mainstream radio or, say, playing during the closing credits of a teenage romantic comedy. To hear a band like HEALTH offer the sentiment—""Life is strange/ We die and we don't know why/ I don't know what I want but I know that I don't know what want/ Nobody does""—feels both exhilarating and perverse. Longtime fans and noise purists might balk, but it's refreshing. The more vulnerable, pop-friendly moments on ""Life"" and the sparkly ""L.A. Looks""—in which Duzsik admits,""It's not love, but I still want you""—make for a much more dynamic and oddly compelling listen than just 45 minutes of synthetic squall. Though they might bristle at the obvious comparison, it's hard not to notice the Reznorian qualities of Death Magic. With Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor married the formlessness of industrial music to radio-friendly pop melodies. The 12 tracks on Death Magic do much the same, neatly splitting the difference between exquisitely detailed bombast (more than anything they've done before, it's a record that demands a huge stereo system and/or an excellent set of headphones) and something more human. While they still don't have to worry about somehow getting accidentally swept up in the mainstream—a fate unlikely for a band still making scary songs about drugs and releasing vomit-soaked visuals—with Death Magic HEALTH wisely manage to sidestep the errors of so many other ostensibly ""heavy"" bands, who often chase after extremity to the point of becoming humorless cartoons. After a while, even unremitting noise and relentless nihilism becomes rote and, frankly, kind of boring. Without the occasional beam of light, it's hard to actually appreciate how dark—or how good—a band like HEALTH can actually be.","It's been over half a decade since HEALTH released a studio album, and Death Magic is a bold, albeit occasionally jarring, step forward.

Live at the 12 Bar,Bert Jansch,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef213d197565213a1cc/1:1/w_160/5fc7e5c8.jpg,2015-07-31 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20716-live-at-the-12-bar/,EarthEarth,"During Bert Jansch's five-decade career, he released records where nothing seemed out of place. The folk singer, who died in 2011, often wrestled with the torment of young lovers and restless souls in his lyrics, but those worries came in near-perfect packages, in which the blues and intercontinental folk, jazz, and pop moved together with riverine fluidity. When a New Weird America contingent led by Devendra Banhart and Noah Georgeson worked to revive his career with the The Black Swan LP in 2006, it made sense; he and his band, Pentangle, were godheads for pockets of that scene. It was, however, an odd fit, since Jansch, even as the young man who had made Birthday Blues or It Don’t Bother Me 40 years earlier, never seemed one for letting loose and getting wild. There was very little freak in his folk. Live at the 12 Bar—a 16-song set from 1996 that Earth Recordings has resurrected for the launch of an extensive series of Jansch reissues—is not some unbridled onstage affair. An intimate solo show, Jansch plays without much pause for about an hour, laughing at himself when he doesn’t leave the stage ahead of the encore. The sound of his amplified acoustic guitar is thin and modest, and his voice ranges from furtive murmur to broad-shouldered bellow. He speaks softly to the audience, and he doesn’t indulge in the great between-song yarns endemic to such releases. You do, though, get a sense of Jansch’s modest personality, wry wit, and self-effacing charm. He momentarily forgets song titles and awkwardly stumbles through a birthday greeting for a gleeful audience after his definitive take on ""Blackwaterside"". He flubs or altogether drops some notes in the turnarounds of the gorgeous aubade, ""Morning Brings Peace of Mind"", and he strums hard enough during the protest number ""Let Me Sing"" to break the reverie his music inspires. For such an on-the-record perfectionist, Jansch sounds humble and approachable during Live at the 12 Bar. On this ""authorized bootleg,"" a fan favorite for years, he lets the imperfections stand. The errors give his precise work a newly human touch, spotlighting the deep folk origins of his tender tunes. There are nearly a dozen live releases crammed into Jansch’s catalogue. Live at the 12 Bar stands out in part for the sweep of its songs, a range that reflects the roots of his work and how much he was able to grow within its traditions. He moves from the impetuous opener of his 1965 debut, ""Strolling Down the Highway"", to ""Walk Quietly By"", the beautiful and bothered beginning of When the Circus Comes to Town, the album he released not long before this show. He saunters and pleas through American R&B (""Come Back Baby"") and stands at the threshold of loneliness and love for an endearing turn on the Irish standard, ""Curragh of Kildare"". He picks gracefully through the transcontinental standard ""The Lily of the West"", and he seems to smile through the blues of ""Trouble in Mind"". Four years after his death, Jansch’s legacy often revolves around his guitar playing. Frequently presented as an other-side-of-the-Atlantic foil to John Fahey, Jansch is the less deliberate of the two. Where it felt like Fahey was often pulling notes from his instrument, Jansch’s skill seemed to be holding their flow back long enough to articulate their shape. But this career-spanning set from a late London club known as an incubator for great songwriters is a welcome reminder of his skills in that regard, too. He plunges into romantic neuroticism for ""A Woman Like You"" and moves between sensuality and sensitivity for ""Fresh as a Sweet Sunday Morning"". In turn, he gets mad, sad, and nostalgic, feelings he communicates as capably with his underrated voice as he does with his fingers and strings. No, Live at the 12 Bar, unlike much of Jansch’s catalogue, isn’t perfect. You hear mistakes, clumsy knocks at the microphone stand, and even his breath as he plays. But mostly, you hear this master traversing a musical map of his life, hard times and all.","For such an on-the-record perfectionist, Jansch sounds humble and approachable during Live at the 12 Bar.

Pain,Deaf Wish,by: Corbin Reiff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af67b1335d7bf1699f36/1:1/w_160/7b4e51f5.jpg,2015-07-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20804-pain/,Sub Pop,"On their first LP for Sub Pop, the Australian punk rockers Deaf Wish fly in the face of adhering to a singular sound. Instead, over 10 highly individualized tracks, the band veers across a diverse  spectrum, mixing the avant-garde with the melodic. In some ways, Pain can be considered a 30-minute history lesson of the last 40 years of proto-punk, punk, and alternative rock music. Despite their relatively low profile, Deaf Wish have been recording and performing music for eight years and seem to have a handle on where their individual strengths lie. As a group, their approach to making music comes off as defiantly democratic, with each member given the opportunity to take hold of the microphone and exert their own measure of control. Considering this approach, it’s amazing how effectively they bring the varying tones and textures together. On the opener, ""The Whip"", guitarist Jensen Tjhung steps up with a voice that sounds strikingly similar to Iggy Pop. He guides the band through the plodding funeral procession: over time it builds from a simple two-note riff and multi-layered vocal combination to a full-on hurricane with crashing cymbals and frenetic guitar scratchings fighting against each other to break out into the forefront. (Speaking of Iggy Pop, ""The Whip"" sounds like it has a fair amount of the song ""We Will Fall"", from the Stooges' 1969 self-titled debut, mixed into its DNA.) The pace then accelerates with a one-two follow up of punk rock in the form of ""Newness Again"" and ""They Know"". There isn’t that much differentiation between the two songs. Both are played at warp speed and carry a heavy dose of manic anti-solo guitar parts threaded underneath; however, on the first, bassist Nick Pratt spits out vocal lines with a rapid, Johnny Rotten-esque fierceness, while on the latter, guitarist Sarah Hardiman moves the feeling into an opposite direction by bringing a degree of harmony and melody to the tornado of notes. It’s probably the definitive example on Pain of Deaf Wish’s built-in capability to alter the sound and feel of their music with a simple personnel swap. That’s essentially the playbook for most of the album, with Pratt delivering hypersonic old-school punk rock like on the title track, a song that bears a striking resemblance to the Replacements’ classic ""We’re Coming Out"", Hardiman adding a measure of airiness like on the Sonic Youth-reminiscent ""Sex Witch"". Tjhung ties both ends together with a subversive, sneering pop affectation. The formula holds out until you reach the penultimate track, ""Dead Air"", which is introduced by Hardiman with the disaffected line ""In my heart there is only blood"" before the band rages into a six-minute wall of guitar feedback and distortion. It’s an inferno of twisted sounds and whammy bar dive bombs cascading over plodding, melodic bass chord changes with no let up. There’s an urge to skip through it to get to the more traditionally framed album closer, ""Calypso"", but there’s something indefinably enigmatic about the intense soundscape that makes you weather the assault. It’s evident that Deaf Wish can adopt just about any sound or style that they want to, and that’s what they seemingly tried to do on Pain. For many other bands, that approach could muddy the waters or create a convoluted listening experience, but this doesn’t happen here. They choose to be themselves—each one of them—and it works.","On their first LP for Sub Pop, the Australian punk rockers Deaf Wish actively fly in the face of adhering to a singular sound.

But it played host to a unique performance this past June, one that closed the week-long Kingston on the Edge art festival. Bandleader and legendary reggae artist Earl ""Chinna"" Smith, alongside more than a dozen singers, drummers, members of the Jamaican Philharmonic, and a local opera singer, made up the ""Binghistra"", providing a combination of Rastafari nyabinghi drumming and classical music.

The 4/4 shuffle of its rhythm, which stems from three specific drum sounds (akete, funde, and bass) was first heard in the theatre back in the 1950s, when bandleader Count Ossie, hailing from a Rastafari camp in the hills of East Kingston, was first invited to perform as part of a Christmas variety show. Rastafari: The Dreads Enter Babylon 1955-83, Soul Jazz's most recent in a line of high-quality compilations, provides a window into Kingston's past, acting as a soundtrack to this narrative that reaches back to Count Ossie's first and subsequent performances at the legendary Ward to draw a line directly from Rastafari to the rise of reggae as an internationally recognized type of music. It is nyabinghi drumming that provides the foundation for reggae, and Soul Jazz makes this argument explicit by kicking off the compilation with Count Ossie and the Rasta Family's ""Africa We Want Fe Go"", taking the traditional Rastafari nyabinghi chant and drumming and adding electrified reggae bass. This sets the tone for all selections: to demonstrate that link between the spirituality of Rastafari and the development of the unique sound of Jamaican music. Reggae may have developed into genres other than Rastafari music, as any listener to dancehall or lovers' rock reggae can attest, but none of these types of music would exist if it weren't for those origins in Rastafari. Cementing this fact, a quarter of the tracks feature Count Ossie alongside various drummers and musicians. Tracks with the Mystic Revelation of Rastafari and the Rasta Family provide more traditional approaches, with the ""Tales of Mozambique"" and ""Narration"" pairing historical recounting with rich, percussive background. Organist Leslie Butler and vibraphonist Ronald Downer accompany Count Ossie's drum group on two separate tracks that place soulful reggae and jazz sounds alongside the Rastafari rhythms. These were both produced in the early 1960s by Sonia Pottinger, who went on to become a successful reggae hitmaker throughout the 1970s, producing classics such as Ken Boothe's ""Lady with the Starlight"" and the Melodians ""Swing and Dine"". Further focusing on the importance of the drum, the compilation contains two tracks with Bongo Herman, a man whose name reveals exactly the talent for which he is known. The bongo complements snippets of harmonized chorus and praises to Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie. The telltale layered drums of nyabinghi are deceptively simple, with their foundational bass hitting on the 1 and 3, but there are improvisational opportunities everywhere, from the creativity of the akete player to the endless variety of chants and songs, spoken word and harmonizations, that can all find accompaniment. And this compilation is full of this rhythmic storytelling, reaching back to the roots of African drumming while demonstrating the innovations of Rastafari. The mid-'50s mento-sounding ""Ethiopia"" of Lord Lebby and the Jamaican Calypsonians pairs banjo and bongo bounce with lyrics about the centrality of the East African nation to Rastafari belief. Though there are about 10 years between the late-'60s ska of ""Haile Selassie"" by Laurel Aitken and the 1970s roots reggae ""His Imperial Majesty"" by Rod Taylor, both point to the importance of Ethiopia's last Emperor to the Rastafari movement. ""Hail the Words of Jah"" is a hagiography of Haile Selassie presented in soothing falsetto by Congos member Ashanti Roy and an early drum-accompanied Mutabaruka poem, ""Say"". The interesting addition of the youthful voices found on child star QQ's ""Betta Must Come"", raises some questions about the time range of the title, given that it was recorded in 2005. But it demonstrates how the nyabinghi sound extends into a new generation. The inclusion begs the question of other pertinent additions: Recent reggae revivalists like Chronixx, Kabaka Pyramid, and Jah9, to name but a few, have also kept the sound current. There are artists who gained fame in the 1990s and have claimed affiliation to the Rastafari movement, such as Buju Banton, Capleton, and Sizzla—all who make use of Rastafari rhythms as well as themes. Their absence feels like a missed opportunity. However, the 40-page-plus accompanying booklet touches on the music post-1983, suggesting that this might be part one of a series of compilations—given the power of the music, one can only hope. The extent of the information provided in the liner notes is as good as can be when the goal is to encapsulate over a century of spiritual, socio-economic, and cultural history, not just of Rastafari, but of both colonial and independent Jamaica and Jamaican music as well. Yes, it's a reasonable introduction, but it might have been an idea to point to some of the many, many additional sources on Rastafari. This would reflect the reality that Rastafari, much like the music of this compilation, is dynamic and varied, consistently resisting any efforts to pigeonhole. And although the tracklisting jumps around a little between decades, making it difficult to get a sense of chronology, it's clear that Rastafari consciousness has found its way into just about every type of Jamaican music, from drum compositions to calypso, mento, ska, reggae, and beyond. As the title says, ""the dreads enter Babylon""—and they leave no stone (or style) unturned.","Rastafari: The Dreads Enter Babylon 1955-83*,* Soul Jazz’s most recent in a line of high-quality compilations, provides a window into Kingston’s past, drawing a line directly from Rastafari to the rise of reggae as an internationally recognized type of music.

"L​.​P​.​1. aka ""14 Year Old High School PC​-​Fascist Hype Lords...",The Coneheads,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeddc0084474cd0c198d/1:1/w_160/328bd840.jpg,2015-07-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20701-lp1-aka-14-year-old-high-school-pc-fascist-hype-lords/,Erste Theke Tontraeger,"Yeah, that's the full title: *14 Year Old High School PC-Fascist Hype Lords Rip Off Devo for the Sake of Extorting $$$ From Helpless Impressionable Midwestern Internet Peoplepunks L.P. (*The alternate title could be When the Pawn Hits the Devo.) The Coneheads are nothing if not self-aware. The Northwest Indiana punk trio actively resist the goofy mechanics of the music industry in 2015, cobbling together bits of late-'70s popular and unpopular culture to create their own hidden galaxy. Their first vinyl release is actually a comp of two 2014 mean, crude, and acutely hilarious tapes: Canadian Cone and Total Conetrol, the latter of which is curiously going for $200 on Discogs now (hopefully just another outsized joke). If those newfound close-ups of the most-distant Pluto had a cartoonish soundtrack, it could be Coneheads—this is some of the most extraterrestrial rock music around. (Referring to your audience as ""peoplepunks"" seems like calling fans ""earthlings."") Coneheads do steal from the art-rock of their Midwestern forebears—a previous band of theirs did a hardcore cover of ""Mongoloid""—but they mutate those robot sounds with a raw, rare grasp of punk history and a breakneck sense of pacing. It sometimes sounds like a four-track has been set up inside of a cardboard box with three people playing three different songs, including unlikely nuggets such as ""I Used to Be a Cheesepuff"", the tale of a guy who ""[goes] to school in studs and leather."" Just as you think a minute-long track has run its course, a demented riff will jump back in for the final three seconds. Though skilled players, they use their instruments in a way you might if you'd just landed on Earth and never held one before—so while Coneheads may ""rip off Devo,"" per the title, their weirdness seems more spirtually akin to, say, the Shaggs. When he sings, vocalist/bassist Mark Winter actually sounds like a Conehead, his voice flat and nasal, with words spit so fast as to make the listening process a delightfully obnoxious blur. But Winter's words are pissed as hell, brimming with disdain for authority, the ""chumps"" of the outside world, and himself. On the angry 67-second blast ""Violence"", he smugly references the ""pathetic human race"" alongside a thick, rubbery, rocketspeed bassline (a mere 10 seconds is reserved at the end for a guitar solo). ""Hack Hack Hack"", a song literally about taking an axe to your enemy, appears in two versions—one of which is a creeping minimal synth rendition—because why not? The best tune here must be ""Big City Baby"", clocking in at 41 seconds, a middle-finger to the bourgeois faux-intellects of major cities: ""I got a big city baby, she's just like me/ We both listen to the Smiths, ain't that interesting?"" But cities are not restricted to geography in 2015; earlier he snarls a warning at his critics, ""You don't even know who the fuck I am/ You and your Internet snooping can burn in hell."" (True to form, they make fun of Pitchfork on the album sleeve.) Make no mistake, Coneheads despise big cities. For a band that clearly takes the ethos of ""what we do is secret"" to heart, the closer ""Way Things Am"" is an anti-mission statement: ""I like the way things am/ I can stay with any luck/ An uninteresting jaded fuck... When it comes to all good things/ I'm the sole authority/ So shove it."" The band steam-rolls through a genius, hyper-compressed cover of Talking Heads' ""Psycho Killer""; while David Byrne is busy shaking his fist at a cloud because New York has changed, Coneheads are laughing all over his song. If Kurt Cobain could hear Coneheads' recent cover of ""In Bloom""—rudimentary and unrecognizable—he might cry tears of joy at their terrible racket. It behooves us to remember that Coneheads—with its premise of clowny aliens stranded on Earth—started as an ""SNL"" skit in 1977, just as punk was taking shape, and the reference hangs over this analog outsider music like a gravitational pull towards that era. Coneheads, however, are the center of their own tiny local scene alongside Big Zit, CCTV, and Liquids, as documented on their own compilations: Cool Bands, Cool Bands 2, Cool Bands 3. This crew has ties to Chicago hardcore, but Coneheads' alien approach and bizarro time signatures remind me of late Vermont synth-pop freaks Blanche Blanche Blanche more than anything going on in hardcore. Their cult and deliberate enigma are palpable: they included ""I Am a Coneheads Fan"" bumper stickers with the album, and they share phone numbers on their releases that you can text to inquire about new material, or whatever. (This spring, to learn more, I tapped out a text message to one of the numbers, found inside a Liquids tape, but it felt more like dropping a letter into a well or unleashing a carrier pigeon.) Since the release of these two endearingly peculiar cassettes, Coneheads have been subject to the nebulous and perennial cycle that is ""punk hype""—an odd elixir of divisive chatter on blogs, message boards, and word of mouth that can go far in 2015—but not without good reason. It's true, for instance, that Coneheads turned down an opportunity to work with Jack White's Third Man Records. And Coneheads' appeal is not dissimilar to the stranger side of a New York band that recently worked with the label: Parquet Courts. This album has been ""released"" in the most minimal sense imaginable—it first surfaced earlier this year from small German label Erste Theke Tontraeger, also responsible for a collection last year by Coneheads comrades Lumpy and the Dumpers, and is now, apparently, fleetingly available stateside from the band at shows, but who knows. They do not sound like they want to be found.","The Coneheads are nothing if not self-aware. On their first vinyl release—a compilation of two crude 2014 cassettes—the Indiana punk trio are making some of the most extraterrestrial rock music around, fueled by their hatred of big cities, authority, and themselves.

Yung Rich Nation,Migos,by: Craig Jenkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af9dc0084474cd0c1ae0/1:1/w_160/2db9f289.jpg,2015-07-31 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20843-yung-rich-nation/,AtlanticQuality Control300,"As a young rapper with a fresh record deal, there are a few ways to navigate your first formal release. You can sidestep hype and release a juiced-up approximation of your pre-album mixtapes, as Young Thug did this year on Barter 6, a stunning but low-stakes offer that didn't seek new listeners so much as drag them in with sheer oddball magnetism. You can play ball with terrestrial radio, genuflecting to popular regional sounds and shopping for chart-topping guests with label money but also running the risk of losing sight of what made you intriguing in the first place. This is a well-trodden path littered with experiments too awkward to fly but too funded to fail, ill-remembered debut albums by Wale, Meek Mill, B.o.B, and the like that it would take dedicated stylistic retrenchments to undo. Another strategy is to forsake fan and label expectations to charge full bore into something scary and new. Vince Staples and No I.D.'s anemic, apocalyptic dance party Summertime '06 was a challenging, unexpected gear shift, jarring and immediate as shin splints. Yung Rich Nation, the debut album from Atlanta's Migos, toys with a few of these methodologies. Throughout, the group leverages a further push toward pop sounds initiated on last fall's Rich Nigga Timeline with the harder edged meat-and-potatoes street rap of last spring's No Label 2. But what's missing is a lot of the goofy spirit and momentum of 2013's Young Rich Niggas, which drilled the group into the national consciousness with the madcap ""Hannah Montana"" and ""Versace"". The first five songs on the new album establish a plodding brutality, thanks in large part to darkly cinematic production from the Honorable C.N.O.T.E.; the lyricism is sharp and the cadences more varied than usual, but grim early album autobiographical cuts like ""Migos Origin"" and ""Street Nigga Sacrifice"" will likely scare off a casual listener drawn to the group by a ""Fight Night"" or ""Handsome and Wealthy"". These are all solid album cuts, but laid out in a row at the top of the tracklist, they're uninviting. The album opens up around ""Highway 85"", a white-knuckle cop chase sequence on the interstate highway that runs from Virginia through the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama aided by a C.N.O.T.E. production mining the sparse, Moogy funk Dr. Dre hasn't made much since the second N.W.A. album. Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff's tales of cruising out of run-ins with the law are gripping exercises in verse-length storytelling from a group whose lyrics tend to get absorbed line by outrageous line as humor. This classic gangsta rap sound is Yung Rich Nation's most intriguing fit; ""85"", along with ""Gangsta Rap"" and ""Street Nigga Sacrifice"", serves up a poignant reminder that Southern rap and West Coast rap have commonalities that stretch back decades before Jeezy and 2 Chainz hopped on DJ Mustard beats. They also prove that the Migos don't need a big ugly trap beat to get busy. (See also: Social Experiment's ""Familiar"".) Lead single ""One Time"" pops up in the middle of the album suggesting that Yung Rich Nation could've been sleek and mercenarily hooky if the group wanted, but then the Chris-Brown-by-numbers rap&B collaboration ""Just for Tonight"" follows, illuminating what happens when an impressionable act courts spotlight too openly. The one is effortless and fun-loving; the other, labored and unnatural, like Migos guesting on someone else's album instead of the other way around. Neither one carries that feeling, which was so palpable on their early mixtape hits, that the Migos had arrived at radio thanks to a magical collusion of undeniable skill and personality. They feel like concessions. Yung Rich Nation avoids many pitfalls that render major label rap debuts forgettable or else regrettable but sacrifices a world of possible intrigue in sticking to its guns. It hints at weirder records it could've been but, in choosing the sampler platter over a more brash dish, ultimately comes across as safe. Peppering what seems to want to be a street album with quirky little singles that jut out perpendicularly from the rest of it makes for a record unsure of whether it should shirk commercialism or embrace it. In a time where we're keen on young Atlanta talent but casually disinterested at the first indication the hit parade's about to subside, there's not much room left for the Migos to keep figuring out how to present themselves in a mainstream field of play. The rhyme skills and lurid way with imagery that first brought the group to national attention remain on display throughout the album, but YRN's warring agendas suggest a few more tries are in order for the Migos to get their formula sorted.","The rhyme skills and lurid way with imagery that first brought the Atlanta rap trio Migos to national attention remain on display throughout Yung Rich Nation, their major-label debut.

Explora EP,Florian Kupfer,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afb95e6ef95969321e58/1:1/w_160/3d9c0279.jpg,2015-07-30 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20860-explora-ep/,Technicolour,"The German producer Florian Kupfer comes from the lo-fi end of the techno spectrum. His music is unvarnished and thick with distortion; most tracks feature a single drum machine and a synthesizer or two, and they swim in line noise and tape compression. But that gritty affect is a means, not an end. He can be bruising, as on the recent ""Discotag"", where he flips vintage rap samples and petulant bass buzz into a contemporary take on hip-house, and tender, as on last year's ""Feelin"", with its melancholy hook, ""I can't stop this feeling."" He can be eerie: ""Bridge"", from a recent WT Records release, pairs wind chimes with a thudding kick drum in a way that suggests a record left skipping its run-out groove long after all the people have gone home. And he can be unrelenting: On last year's ""Head"", the steady rattle of a fire-alarm bell rings for minutes at a time—mixed, to deliriously dissonant effect, with the whine of rubbed wineglass rims. Until now, Kupfer has recorded mostly for labels like L.I.E.S., Rush Hour's No 'Label' offshoot, and Willie Burns' WT Records—a small circle of likeminded peers who share his suspicion of the shinier, happier aspects of mainstream dance music. His Explora EP appears on Technicolour, the house- and techno-oriented singles label under electronic heavyweight Ninja Tune, but he keeps his cards as close to his chest as ever. In fact, it's probably the heaviest, most brain-bending thing he's done yet. ""Explora (Slave)"" sets the record's abject tone with an invitation that quickly turns menacing. ""Explore your fantasy,"" coos a sensual voice, but it dissolves into a cyborg's growl; tri-tone synth stabs drip like the stalactites of a sex dungeon. It's slow to get going: two-and-a-half minutes pass before the beat drops in earnest, and once it does, all that introductory tension is channeled into shuddering machine rhythms and scissor-handed hi-hats. Flecked with acid and analog to the bone, it's reminiscent of Bam Bam's ""Where's Your Child"", Phuture's ""Your Only Friend"", and other '80s Chicago house cuts where pitched-down voices and bad vibes ruled the dancefloor. But its sleazy, sinister energies are a walk in the park compared to the beaten-down resignation of the next track, ""Headpiece"". This one shuffles along at a dirge-like 57 beats per minute, and its listless drum track might as well be a screen door swinging on its hinges in heavy weather. The opening notes, bulbous and blown out, sound a little bit like the electric bass melody of Swans' ""In My Garden""—surely a coincidence, but the comparison feels appropriate, if only because industrial music's blasted affect plays such a key role in Kupfer's music; he's as much a student of Wax Trax as he is of Trax. The real magic is in the way it builds over the course of its long, exhausted haul, distortion and dub delay and the EQs all flickering unsteadily, soaking up the unmistakable energy of the live-in-one-take jam. ""Brute Force"" is the slightest of the EP's four tracks, to the extent that it sounds a little bit tossed off; it's a monotone eighth-note synth chug set against muted kicks and a ragged open hi-hat. (It does sound a little bit like Barnt's ultra-stripped-back jams, but it lacks their gonzo energy, having neither dynamics nor development.) But he makes up for it with ""Shpel"", the EP's final cut. It's the record's most bare-bones track, but also its most engrossing. Here's where he really gives into his industrial leanings, wreathing sumptuous wooden thumps in pitched-down shrieks and gravelly voices slowed to the point of unintelligibility. This one goes on for nearly 12 minutes, and while nothing ever really happens, it doesn't need to; for fans of atmospheric dread, its whiff of freezer burn is plenty exquisite. This one isn't even obviously analog in nature; any number of techniques might be responsible for its resonant central tone. But the track takes away an important lesson from Kupfer's lo-fi studies: sometimes, learning to do without is the best way to find your focus.","The German producer Florian Kupfer comes from the lo-fi end of the techno spectrum.

Sketches From An Island 3 / Bush Society,Mark Barrott,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa49d034d5c69bf4749/1:1/w_160/859f845d.jpg,2015-07-30 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20849-sketches-from-an-island-3-bush-society/,International Feel,"In 2009, a new dance imprint located in Uruguay and called International Feel began issuing a string of mysterious, uncredited singles. Soon followed a parade of artists with names like Rocha, Efeel, the Sonic Aesthetic, Bepu N’Gali, Parada 88, Boys From Patagonia, and Young Gentlemen’s Adventure Society, each treading the squishy ground between downtempo and nu-disco, favoring the sorts of sounds that Europeans on holiday would recognize as ""Balearic."" A few years on, the imprint up and relocated to the island of Ibiza and soon after, most of these works were revealed to be the work of labelhead Mark Barrott, who went with his own name for last year’s breezy Sketches From An Island, which compiled two earlier EPs. Recently, Barrott announced the release of the third installment of his Sketches From An Island series via the Drip subscription service, explaining the digital fan club thus: ""For me, my ‘moments of joy’ come from making music in a studio and then attempting to reach out with that music and communicate with like minded souls to form a connection."" The four-song EP, which is now getting a physical release via International Feel, continues along the same trajectory as the previous album, to the point where the library funk of opener ""Right 4 Me"" brings to mind SFAI’s opener ""Baby Come Home"", right down to the melody being conveyed via a flute plug-in. Charming as the ditty is, it feels like a retread. Titlewise, ""The Mysterious Island of Dr. Nimm"" scans as a sequel to the prior album track ""Dr Nimm's Garden of Intrigue & Delight"". But while the latter is taken at a leisurely pace, this EP track features darker bass and layers of clattering percussion, bamboo flutes, chimes, and bird calls, reminiscent of jungle foliage. The other two tracks favor the kind of polyrhythmic pulses that bring to mind Music for 18 Musicians as rendered at a luau, gentle as a sea breeze, or on closer ""Der Stern, Der Nie Vergeht"", Cluster had they lived in Ibiza rather than in rural Germany. While the EP is pleasant enough, it doesn’t stake out much in the way of new terrain. If anything, it’s a slight step back after Barrott released a two-track ""Bush Society"" single earlier this spring. Although most of its components are light and buoyant, ""Saviours or Savages?"" carefully builds tension, its percolating rhythms never quite releasing. The 10-minute ""Bush Society"" is the most ambitious and successful of Barrott’s tracks to date. Like many of his songs, it begins with ambient bird calls and a distant thunderstorm, then adds rattles and hand percussion. It suggests the brightness of a Brazilian track (think Airto) but the bass synth growls that lurk beneath the percussion give it a sinister edge. Between a vocal sample evocative of the Mbuti Pygmy chants from the Ituri Rainforest and the menacing acid underpinnings, ""Bush Society"" sounds light and dark at once. Its 10 minutes bring to mind island life itself, in that time feels both suspended and passing far too fast.","In 2009, a dance imprint located in Uruguay began issuing a string of mysterious, uncredited singles, each treading the ground between downtempo and nu-disco.

You Never Show Your Love EP,Jessy Lanza,by: Maud Deitch,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa2b1335d7bf1699f93/1:1/w_160/4423b24b.jpg,2015-07-30 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20848-you-never-show-your-love-ep/,Hyperdub,"Since Jessy Lanza released her debut Pull My Hair Back in September of 2013, the electro-R&B landscape has become significantly more crowded. Her debut effort with Junior Boys' Jeremy Greenspan was a well-produced, confident effort that nonetheless was at times a bit too restrained, if only because Lanza's vocal power was otherwise so apparent in the few instances in which it was allowed to shine through. Those hints seemed to suggest there would be more of her in future efforts. On Lanza’s new EP, You Never Show Your Love, on UK-based label Hyperdub, you can hear those same glimmers of promise. Lanza’s voice on the EP’s title track is light and smooth, floating over the languid beat in a way that almost brings to mind a sunnier Sade. The EP was produced by Teklife’s DJ Spinn and Taso, and the beats are pure footwork. While the title track is more of a slow jam, the beat slowly orbiting Lanza’s vocal, the rework, featuring founding Teklife member DJ Rashad’s beats used posthumously, is up-tempo and glitchy, contrasting with Lanza’s floating vocal to great effect. This chameleon-like quality is one of Lanza’s signatures—her vocals are versatile, and tend to melt into a mix rather than overpowering it. This is a commendable skill, especially in a house singer, but there are many moments when you wish the music would be more about her, and less about the beat. While the EP is atmospheric, it does nothing to separate Lanza from the scene that has grown up around her. Her vocals skew more purely house than FKA twigs or Banks, but she lacks their same showmanship or melodrama, and it's difficult to imagine the niche she would fill. You Never Show Your Love is a small sampling of the Canadian vocalist's work, however, and her choice in producers speaks volumes to her curatorial vision. If That Voice were to assume a place in the forefront of the engaging, boundary-pushing beats she picks for herself, she could sound larger than life.","Jessy Lanza’s new EP, You Never Show Your Love, features remixes from founding Teklife member DJ Rashad, whose beats were used posthumously.

Living Legend,Gunplay,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6b13d197565213a296/1:1/w_160/30c0a111.jpg,2015-07-30 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20807-living-legend/,Def Jam,"Gunplay is a blast from the past for rap obsessives. His precise lyrics and fluid rap style reflect the studious flows and manic personalities of hip-hop in the late 1990s—Redman, Busta Rhymes, or Rawkus-era Eminem. Had his debut album emerged in those years, he might have become a larger-than-life star. As it stands now, he is more living anachronism than Living Legend. The MMG rapper's Def Jam debut is being released four years after ""Rollin"" first sparked his street buzz nationally. Anyone expecting a classic in the vein of Muddy Waters will leave disappointed; for a charismatic rapper with a bombastic presence, his official debut feels slighter than it should, less a late '90s renaissance than a fading reminder. Living Legend isn't bad, exactly. It's a consistent release with no substantial misfires, full of densely packed verbiage and grand gestures, reminiscent of a time when technique, style, and personality seemed inseparable, interrelated qualities in a rapper's arsenal. The best songs have a profundity that transcends the packaging around them: the wistful Miami sunset of ""Just Won't Do"" recalls his earlier career highlight ""Bible on the Dash"", its opening lines mirroring that song's most famous couplet (""I asked the pastor, what's the fastest way to heaven…?"") before shifting into a spare narrative that sketches the hard-earned wisdom of a damaged man onto a twilight canvas. The recklessness of his public image—and sometimes, his real public behavior—belies, even magnifies, the earnest reflection that illuminates moments like these. He recaptures this potency only occasionally. Closer ""Dark Dayz"" comes closest, with no wasted lines and artful, writerly composition that suggests simultaneous moods of pride and torment: ""Happy-face sticker on the brick, still feeling miserable."" Images pop, as he shifts effortlessly from the visual to the abstract, an interconnected web of ideas that suggests the craft of a detail-obsessed aficionado. As a writer, Gunplay is one of the best in rap, when he wants to be. And he's not limited to ""deep thoughts""-type records; on more brolic cuts, like ""White Bitch"", his lyrics are vividly original: ""Skinny as pasta with a big ol' mossberg/ Squares in my trunk and white all in my nostrils."" The album's midsection sags under its relative banality: Rick Ross feature ""Be Like Me"" sounds like a generic version of records Ross has been releasing over the past four or so years. And ""Chain Smokin'"" wastes a clever hook with a song that feels like a kush coma for more than three minutes, a must-fast-forward dead zone until Gunplay's verse. Lead single ""Wuzhanindoe"" is solid, but also dated, a cutting-room-floor version of guest rapper YG's spring 2014 release My Krazy Life. It also draws attention to the relative disparity in quality between the two artists' album statements. By any standard, Gunplay is the superior talent: bar-for-bar, emotional resonance, depth of feeling. But while his lyrics fill the page with evocative, fully-rendered ideas, his album feels like a half-step; YG's revitalization of '90s West Coast tropes, meanwhile, found the rapper exceeding his limitations song after song. And that's Gunplay's major weakness: his art is focused on some powerful particulars at the expense of the whole. Perhaps, as a 36-year-old rapper who's lived quite a life—most of it, in fact—outside the studio, it's unfair to expect more. The distance between his standout records—""Rollin"", ""Jump Out"", ""Bible on the Dash""—and the average Gunplay song is considerable. Concept-driven cuts like ""Tell 'Em"" and ""White Bitch"" are lyrically strong, but are easily forgotten once the album has receded. The pathos of his unrealized potential deepens the colors of his best work, hinting at artistic depth that remains out of our sight.","Gunplay recalls the manic personalities of late-'90s hip-hop: Redman, Busta Rhymes, Rawkus-era Eminem.

"Greatest Hits, Vol. 1",Teenage Time Killers,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8fc0084474cd0c1aca/1:1/w_160/2e56aa3c.jpg,2015-07-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20835-greatest-hits-vol-1/,Rise,"Congratulations are in order for Teenage Time Killers, the massive, metallic brainchild of Corrosion of Conformity's Reed Mullin and My Ruin guitarist Mick Murphy: with the arrival of their long-gestating debut LP, the duo may have very well set a Guinness World Record for the biggest supergroup ever (excepting, of course, one-offs like USA for Africa and Artists for Haiti). Three years ago, they set out on a mammoth mission to recruit their friends, contemporaries and tour-mates and forge The One Punk Album To Rule Them All. Of course Dave Grohl signed up; from Them Crooked Vultures to Sound City Players, the Foos frontman's got a veritable addiction to side projects. Jello Biafra, Lamb of God's Randy Blythe, Queens of the Stone Age's Nick Oliveri, Slipknot's Corey Taylor: the roster might as well be metal's answer to The Masked Marauders, except the Teenage Time Killers are entirely real, and unfortunately, wholly underwhelming. Over 20 individual vocalists scream, sing, bark (and in Biafra's case, ramble about Sean Hannity) on Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 backed by various guest musicians; Grohl takes on bass duty on over half the tracks, with Sunn O)))/Goatsnake guitarist Greg Anderson plugging in for similarly long stretches. Listening to the humdrum backbeats of ""Ignorant People"" and ""Plank Walk"", you'd have difficulty picking these two out of a lineup. This vagueness carries over into the album's instrumentation as a whole, with some exceptions. Bad Religion guitarist Brian Baker brings some timeless So-Cal punk to ""Barrio"", an album highlight featuring Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba that's practically written for top-down summer drives, and the thrashy, ever-so-sludgy fretwork on ""Ignorant People"" instantly belies the involvement of Anderson. And so proceeds Greatest Hits, Vol. 1, not so much a punk album as it is a pageant. One minute, Clifford Dinsmore is staging a tepid, one-man BL'AST! reunion on ""Power Outage""; the next, Jello Biafra is stumbling onstage to deliver a minute-and-a-half ""Ode to Sean Hannity"" (yes, dude, we know Fox is evil). The LP's second half is a doldrum of reheated hardcore (""Big Money"", featuring Fear's Lee Ving) and second-rate sludge (""Your Empty Soul"", with a grumbled lead from Red Fang vocalist Aaron Beam). When the self-titled closer, a TV theme song of sorts, barrels in to whisk the entire thing away, it feels like a last gasp rather than a final hurrah. Mullin et al had the chance to make something truly epic—who wouldn't want to hear a heavy-as-fuck response to ""We Are the World"" from dozens of metal's finest? Instead, the 20-track album plays out like a more dudely version of that ""Rock of Love"" episode where contestants have 30 minutes to bang out a killer tune for Bret Michaels' amusement. Rather than build off each other's styles and arrive at a cumulative, comprehensive sound, Teenage Time Killers' revolving cast have conflated quantity with quality, resulting in a pedestrian product that, at best, offers a decent soundtrack to throwing back beers at Punk Rock Bowling.","The debut album from Teenage Time Killers, the brainchild of Corrosion of Conformity's Reed Mullin and My Ruin guitarist Mick Murphy, features guest spots from Dave Grohl, Jello Biafra, Lamb of God's Randy Blythe, Sunn O)))'s Greg Anderson, Queens of the Stone Age's Nick Oliveri, Slipknot's Corey Taylor, and others.

Earth,Sweet Cobra,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af915e6ef95969321e1a/1:1/w_160/7440a8ed.jpg,2015-07-29 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20836-earth/,Magic Bullet,"Sweet Cobra have spent the past decade, plus change, doing two things: pumping out noise, and pissing off genre purists. Steeped in Illinois' mid-'90s alternative rock boom—Local H, the Jesus Lizard, et al.—the trio gave off a grungy first impression, only to dash it by incorporating out-of-town touches: a hint of New York hardcore, a tinge of post-hardcore á la Unwound, and on their most recent outing (2010’s Mercy), some splashes of Savannah sludge. On their fourth LP Earth, the Chicago crew push their sound even futher, aided by Hum’s Matt Talbot and Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou on co-production duties. Cuts like ""Old Haunts"" and ""Complaints"" pack enough firepower to compete with peers like Torche and Doomriders; but where the aforementioned bands would rather barrel down the cliffside first and ask questions later, Sweet Cobra regard the speedometer with a careful, cumulative eye, with occasionally poppy results: ""Repo"" sounds like a Snow Patrol song on steroids. One of the most underrated tools in Sweet Cobra’s arsenal is their sharpened sense of restraint: a necessary, and yet frequently overlooked, step in building a proper sludge assault. ""Future Ghosts"" guides a soft-spoken melody down a gurgling, muddied undertow of a bassline. The anxious post-punk of ""Sunburned Sons"" provides a master class in momentum, and the album’s warm, six-minute closer ""Walls"" feels concise and organic. Earth isn’t perfect, and Sweet Cobra’s charisma and compositional prowess don’t except them from the occasional flat note. Without a clear dynamic arc, ""He Tall He"", the album’s puffed-up ode to self-loathing and being ""[sent] down the river with... shit ideas,"" stumbles and buckles under its exaggerated weight. Meanwhile, lead vocalist Botchy Vasquez’s supple tenor lacks the substance to make glammier, radio-ready cuts like ""Flight Risk"" and ""Stiff Fits"" really shine. Despite his bad habit of tacking on unnecessary sharp notes to the end of his phrases, the guy's one of the most underrated vocalists in his niche, eschewing the throaty styles of Torche’s Steve Brooks or Baroness’ John Dyer Baizley for a headier approach that, in turn, makes the music feel less stifling. A little breathing room goes a long way, and in an atypical move for swampy albums of its ilk, Earth succeeds because it doesn’t attempt to downright bury the listener—it’s a slow, sweet smothering.","On their fourth LP Earth, the Chicago sludge crew enlist Hum’s Matt Talbot and Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou.

as if to each other...,R. Andrew Lee,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af74ea9e61561daa6460/1:1/w_160/934f4439.jpg,2015-07-29 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20814-as-if-to-each-other/,Irritable Hedgehog,"In recent years, pianist R. Andrew Lee has rocketed to prominence in the world of modern and contemporary classical music, thanks to his sterling technique as well as his curator's attention to pieces in need of greater hearing. In 2013, Lee brought us the first professional recording of Dennis Johnson's long-lost, 1959 work November—a five-hour-plus minimalist breakthrough that inspired La Monte Young (and by extension, composers such as Terry Riley and Philip Glass). Lee has also recorded post-minimalist touchstones by the likes of composer and early Village Voice critic Tom Johnson, and Wandelweiser-collective member Eva-Maria Houben. Long-duration pieces that employ repetition (and sometimes outright silence) have given a sense of unity to Lee's discography, thus far. And while his latest release, a 25-minute recording of Jay Batzner's composition ""as if to each other…"", doesn't exactly shatter that brand, it does show off Lee's skill at playing electro-acoustic works. After progressing through five gorgeous minutes of attractive (and contemplative-feeling) arpeggiated chords—in which top notes are constantly changing, and roving around the piano's upper reaches—Batzner's composition introduces a wisp of prepared electronics. Here's where plenty of well-meaning contemporary classical pieces torpedo themselves (often by sounding cheap or hidebound enough to be confused with rejected haunted-house soundtracks). Batzner's tones clear the initial sniff-test, simply by being well-judged. But his compositional instincts are also strong: up until the entrance of the electronics, slower-moving notes in the piano's lower registers have been alternating with more active, higher-pitched chords. The electronic field enters the picture right after Lee simultaneously strikes both extremes of the keyboard for the first time. Along with the resonant echo of the collision, the electronics create an icy, austere beauty. The piece's middle section luxuriates in the immersive blurring of acoustics and electronics. By the sixteenth minute, we hear overlapping, tinny samples of Lee's playing, which creates a feedback loop, as everything builds into a peak and slowly dies away. It can be difficult for a musician not to become subservient to the media requirements of a piece like this one, but Lee's playing is never just a helpmate; his interpretive choices sound explicably human throughout. Likewise, this release—the first professional, solo-composer recording of Batzner's work—reflects Lee's ongoing, admirable desire to champion works that haven't yet had the chance to reach icon status.","Pianist R.

Risveglio,Alessandro Cortini,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af635e6ef95969321dbd/1:1/w_160/9b3ac53a.jpg,2015-07-29 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20802-risveglio/,Hospital,"If you dabble in the small-world subculture of analog and modular synths, Alessandro Cortini is difficult to avoid. The Los Angeles-based multi-instrumentalist posts on the message boards, appears in the documentaries, and turns up at conventions repping for popular modular designers like Make Noise and Verbos. A member of Nine Inch Nails since the late 2000s, he’s earned a certain amount of mainstream alt-rock visibility, but there’s a substantial portion of his audience that likely found out about him by watching YouTube videos in which he monkeys around electronic unobtanium like the Buchla 700. He’s a gearhead’s musician. His solo synthesizer records only reinforce that role. Cortini has a knack for making esoteric instruments like modular synthesizers seem cool and approachable. If you’re coming to electronic music via post-rock or even from film soundtracks, Cortini's music is easy to connect with. His compositions are spare and repetitive, but also melodic—employing warbly cyclical melodies that sometimes recall John Carpenter’s early '80s film scores or the work of Boards of Canada. Though he's often in proximity to instruments that epitomize electronic music's squealing id, Cortini's solo music is pretty dialed in. Risveglio is Cortini’s second full-length for Hospital Productions, the label run by Prurient’s Dominick Fernow. Like its predecessor, Sonno, the album was composed while on tour using a portable studio setup. On that album Cortini used only one instrument, the Roland MC-202—a monophonic synthesizer/sequencer. Here, he expands the palate, adding a second element, the Roland TB-303. Both of these synths were heavily used in dance music during the '80s and '90s, particularly the TB-303, which provided the unmistakable squelchy bass sound that defined acid house. However, you will hardly recognize either of them on Risveglio. In these songs, Cortini sets up static patterns that are gradually tweaked and mutated, using effect pedals (delay, reverb) to create a sense of development. The constant motion and shifting textures of sequenced synthesizer music (think Manuel Gottsching's ""E2-E4"") often make it feel fluid and watery. This is not exactly the case with Risveglio. It’s organic and propulsive, but the sound is eerie and claustrophobic rather than shimmery and ebullient. Cortini may have recorded it in a hotel room, but ""Lotta"" sounds like it was put to tape in an underground bunker. In a genre where compositions are frequently driven by density and accumulation (both in terms of sound and of hardware), Cortini’s music is notable for its economy. Because of the instruments involved, no song can involve more than two active melodies at one time. Complex chords and harmony are not possible. These limitations make the music easily identifiable and distinctive. And despite the noise and murk, it's easy to listen to—once you're a minute into one of Risveglio's songs, you pretty much know what it is and where it's going. It's music that is alien and strange, but also familiar.","Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist Alessandro Cortini has been a member of Nine Inch Nails since the late 2000s and is also part of the small-world subculture of analog and modular synths.

Cascade / The Deluge,William Basinski,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afe413d197565213a371/1:1/w_160/91f2b7bd.jpg,2015-07-29 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20900-cascade-the-deluge/,Temporary Residence,"Brian Eno and Harold Budd loom large over all piano-based ambient music, and William Basinski’s Cascade is no exception to this rule. They spring to mind as soon as the first notes slip out, and the music reaches the same core of beatific sadness. But it gets there in its own way. After all, Budd played live on Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror and The Pearl, filling metronomic piano lines with human presence, while Basinski doesn’t play a note on Cascade. The tape-loop-and-delay technique that produced it is more akin to Eno’s on Ambient 1: Music for Airports, though again, Basinski does it his way. Instead of a plush, pristine sound full of regal pauses, he unleashes a continuous scrawl of murk. This is but one of the things you think about while listening to the same Basinski piano loop for a very long time. Cascade is very simple. A high minor arpeggio darts purposefully forward and then turns into a scatter of reflections as a midrange note tolls a few times in answer, followed by a distantly trumpeting howl. It lasts for a matter of seconds and then repeats—surge, collapse, glide—for 40 minutes, followed by a brief coda of Arvo Pärt-like sacred stillness. There is little sound in the low range, so the whole structure seems to hang over an abyss. With no variation at the macro level, the music shouldn’t describe much more than a figure skater tracing an infinity sign. But it has endless variation at the micro level, which creates the sense of a paradox—repetition that is impossible to grasp, slipping ceaselessly through your fingers. Cascade is released alongside The Deluge, where the same piano motif is process as to become more garbled, throwing longer and longer shadows over itself, and stormy frequencies overtake the placid weather of Cascade. By halfway through, a long serpent of digital tape echo has all but swallowed the motif, but it keeps glinting through. It’s the sound of  something being almost remembered, something that’s nagging at you but won’t quite slip into focus. The comparatively brief ""The Deluge (The Denouement)"" splices a different fragment of piano with passages of maddened, Caretaker-like shortwave radio orchestration, with dark bass growing in under it like black mold. Cascade is a new work, though ""new"" is always a slippery term with Basinski, whose oeuvre is as nested as matryoshka dolls. Not only is the loop drawn from the archive of recordings he made in the '80s, but he also already used it, in an easily recognizable form, on 92982, where it enters the piece shortly after the 40-minute mark. Is it a coincidence that you could replace the first 40 minutes of 92982 with Cascade and arrive at a new, continuous piece? With Basinski, it’s hard to tell. He certainly doesn’t like endings—his pieces make you keenly aware that they’re just audible portions of infinite lines—and he treats little bits of captured time like bottomless wells. Disintegration Loops is his standout work because it dropped the illusion of eternity, letting us hear the tape decaying on the reels. Basinski admitted, with crushing poignancy, that things end. But on Cascade, he’s back to forestalling that knowledge through repetition, which is what gives his abstract pieces their surprising sentience and unaccountable melancholy. The machine is doing the work, but the composer has done the thinking and feeling, and that makes all the difference.","William Basinski doesn’t play a single note on his new album Cascade: the tape-loop-and-delay technique that produced it is akin to Eno’s on Ambient 1: Music for Airports. It comes with The Deluge, a related studio recording where Basinski filtered Cascade through gradually elongating feedback loops, creating the sound of something being almost remembered.

Momentary Masters,Albert Hammond Jr.,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa1c0084474cd0c1aea/1:1/w_160/e1a857e7.png,2015-07-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20847-momentary-masters/,Vagrant,"Unlike so many instantly iconic rock phenomena before them, the Strokes didn’t so much turn boring as frustrating. From 2006’s First Impressions of Earth onward, they’ve sounded like a band constantly second-guessing itself—one that knows it has to evolve beyond a signature sound, but unwilling to commit to a direction. That erratic behavior has extended to frontman Julian Casablancas’ sideline pursuits, whether it as a Daft Punk-approved synth-pop singer or polarizing prog-punk provocateur. But the solo career of guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. has emerged as a beaming ray of light poking through these turbulent skies—as his main band sounds more confused with each new album, his own songwriting has turned more precise and concise. That said, the refinement in Hammond’s work is less a reaction to the Strokes than the result of significant changes in his personal life. In contrast to the art-pop aspirations that fuelled his first two solo albums, Hammond’s 2013 EP, AHJ, was a slight, scrappy four-song affair. But it bore the weight of considerable baggage: he spent much of the record’s press cycle coming clean about going clean, kicking a prolonged addiction to cocaine, heroin, and ketamine he claimed was draining him of $2,000 a week. If AHJ was a tentative toe-dip back into solo recording, Momentary Masters is a confident full-body dive. Like its predecessor, the new album isn’t afraid to draw comparisons to Hammond’s day job; rather than try to establish an identity separate from the Strokes, it reasserts the carefree charm and hooky immediacy that’s gotten lost amid the band’s latter-day experimentation. And unlike, say, Angles or Comedown Machine, Momentary Masters manages to inject a little funk and finesse into the Strokes’ wiry rock schematic without forcing the issue, interlocking Hammond’s signature, spidery fills with ""Tetris""-tight rhythms that will have you double-checking the liner notes to see if Nikolai Fraiture and Fabrizio Moretti were recruited for the record. (They were not—that’s AHJ-era touring bassist Jordan Brooks and drummer Jeremy Gustin doing the yeoman’s work.) For an album reportedly inspired by Carl Sagan, the 10-song, 36-minute Momentary Masters is remarkably lean and focused. The title refers to the famed astronomer’s description of our infinitesimal standing in the universe at large; it could also scan as a comment on the Strokes’ own experience as one-time hype magnets, and the struggle to stay relevant after the spotlight points somewhere else. ""Sometimes, the sun goes behind the clouds/ You’ll forget the warmth that could be found,"" he laments on the opening ""Born Slippy""—not a cover of the Underworld classic, but perhaps an oblique, cautionary evocation of that track’s hedonistic Trainspotting associations. If the song draws from the same well of influences as the Strokes—the chorus is even underpinned by a rewrite of the ""Marquee Moon"" riff—Hammond forsakes Casablancas’ disaffected cool for a down-to-earth humility befitting of a former next big thing, and the seize-the-day urgency of a recovering addict who no longer takes anything for granted. And just when you think you’ve got a handle on the song’s A/B structure, Hammond introduces subtle but substantial changes—a pointillist guitar-solo breakdown, new variations on the chorus melody—that transform the song’s scale from modest to majestic. At the outset, Momentary Masters suggests a parallel history for the Strokes if they had signed to DFA instead of RCA, with the louche groove and synthesized disco strings of ""Power Hungry"" bridging the early-2000s divide between L.E.S. rock dives and Williamsburg warehouse parties. The album even boasts a spiritual successor to ""Losing My Edge"" in ""Losing Touch"", though, buoyed by the song’s spirited new-wave sprint and towering chorus, Hammond sounds happy to be leaving hipsterdom behind. That sentiment is reinforced in more plaintive fashion on a drum-machined cover of Bob Dylan’s ""Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright"", which initially seems like an outlier on the album, but proves to be its thematic centerpiece. Embracing the song’s don’t-look-back sentiment, Hammond blazes through Momentary Masters’ breathless second half with a series of direct-hit power-pop pick-me-ups that channels the guttersnipe grittiness of vintage Strokes—from the double-timed ""Modern Age"" stomp of ""Razors Edge"" to the ""I Can’t Win"" echoes of ""Side Boob""—but with a tuneful flamboyance that reminds you Hammond is the biggest Guided by Voices fan in the group. (And, no doubt, Bob Pollard would approve of a nonsensically evocative title like ""Drunched in Crumbs"".) ""Now that we’re not perfect, we have to be good,"" Hammond sings on ""Touché"", like someone who’s being extra-careful to not squander their second lease on life, but who’s liberated from the pressures and anxieties that drive one to bad habits in the first place. As the song’s taut rhythmic drive loosens into a gloriously goofy chicken-scratched guitar solo, Hammond reinforces the notion that, while rock'n'roll may be the gateway to a lifetime of vice, it can also be the most effective form of rehab.","As the Strokes sound more confused with each new album, Albert Hammond Jr.'s own songwriting has turned more precise and concise. His latest album reasserts the carefree charm and hooky immediacy that’s gotten lost amid the band’s latter-day experimentation.

King Heavy Metal,Ricked Wicky,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7c9d034d5c69bf470e/1:1/w_160/1204a034.jpg,2015-07-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20820-king-heavy-metal/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","It didn't take long, but Ricked Wicky—the latest undertaking from ex-GBV frontman Robert Pollard—is starting to feel like a proper band. Ricked Wicky, if you'll recall, is the so-called ""sophisticated arena rock band"" featuring Pollard, constant companion Todd Tobias, former GBV drummer Kevin March, and Dayton lifer (and relative newbie to the Pollard universe) Nick Mitchell; their latest, King Heavy Metal, follows their debut I Sell the Circus by a scant five months. The second LP from any post-GBV Pollard enterprise always feels a little like a dare: as the project starts to define its own borders, there's always the sense that the famously restless Pollard could abandon this one just as blithely as he has so many others. Still, Ricked Wicky feels different. Mitchell, for one, has clearly ingratiated himself to his new boss; after a few scene-stealing cameos on I Sell the Circus, he gets a strong supporting role throughout King Heavy Metal. And Pollard—content, presumably, with the way this latest venture is shaping up—turns in a weird, wide-ranging set. Chiming opener ""Jargon of Clones"" could just be the out-and-out loveliest Pollard track of the decade, a swaying self-examination that finds our Uncle Bob deep in dialogue with himself. ""This Has Been My Picture"" is similarly lovely; after a lengthy buildup, its triumphal, harpsichord-ticked chorus makes for a well-earned payoff. And the svelte, surefooted ""I'll Let You In"" is a top-flight Pollardian rocker, a hard-charging, brain-sticking wonder in the grand tradition of ""Motor Away"". Of late, the best Pollard records split the difference between spontaneity and craftsmanship; too much (or little) of either, and the whole thing starts to feel overworked, undercooked, or some combination thereof. The songs Pollard brings to Heavy Metal are smart—and occasionally downright elegant—without resorting to all the look-at-me bells and whistles that bogged down 2013's scatterbrained Blazing Gentlemen. Not that they're all winners; the dirgey ""Walk Through Glass"" takes a beat too long to get where it's going, and ""Earth Among Men"" lays a thick layer of Psychocandy fuzz atop one of the set's more threadbare melodies, in the hopes that no one notices. And then there's ""Come Into My Wig Shop"", a surefire top-five contender for weirdest Pollard song. Slinky spy-movie keyboards? Check. A bizarro-world version of the ""Thunderstruck"" intro? Sure, why not. ""Wig Shop"" is more science project than song, its goofball verses grafted awkwardly into a sundazed chorus. It shouldn't work, and it doesn't; still, after so many years of Pollard padding out albums with gormless ballads, blandiose rockers, and barely-there sketches, the sheer chutzpah of ""Wig Shop"" is almost enough to redeem it. ""Wig Shop"" is a lot of—probably too many—things, but boring isn't one of them. ""Wig Shop"" is a Pollard-Mitchell co-write, one of Mitchell's three writing credits on King Heavy Metal. His ""Weekend Warriors"" is either the Who song they never got around to writing or the shameless pint-hoister the art-damaged Pollard won't quite allow himself to pen. Either way, it's a hoot, a would-be anthem for every heavy-lidded 9-to-5er staring down another early Monday alarm call. To its credit, ""Warriors"" cuts to the quick and guzzles straight from the bottle; to its detriment, Mitchell's other contribution, ""Imminent Fall From Grace"", does much the same. The metaphor-eschewing ""Grace"" finds Mitchell doling out a stern warning to a high-flying character who's due for a fall. If Mitchell's ""Warriors"" is a better-than-average Roger Daltrey bite, ""Grace"" is sub-Eddie Money bar-rock. Ill-fitting and uninspired, it's the record's sore thumb, an unusually earnest, uncomfortably literal song floating in a sea of Pollardian abstractions. Just two records in, it's only natural that Mitchell and Pollard are still feeling each other out; given how capably Mitchell's slotted himself in with Pollard—whose many idiosyncrasies long ago calcified into his distinctive style—elsewhere, this misfire seems easy to chalk up to growing pains. While King Heavy Metal isn't quite as front-to-back consistent as I Sell the Circus, its aims are higher: a surefire sign of a band getting comfortable with themselves.","In its second release in one year, Ricked Wicky—the latest undertaking from ex-GBV frontman Robert Pollard—is starting to feel like a proper band.

On that track, Caralee McElroy made a rare vocal appearance to sing, ""I can weep through my own midnights"" and ""I know it’s stupid to dream/ That you might think of me as a man."" Like Xiu Xiu in their softer, more reflective moments, Adult Mom, the Purchase, N.Y. guitar rock project helmed by songwriter Steph Knipe, scrawls gentle notes to self all over their music. Momentary Lapse of Happily externalizes many of the same queer anxieties that manifest in Xiu Xiu’s work, but in a lighter, warmer cadence more reminiscent of Knipe’s contemporaries in Eskimeaux, Girlpool, or Elvis Depressedly. Knipe writes and sings with a dose of humor that balances lyrics like ""one day I’ll set fire to your car"" (from ""2012""). The violence in their words isn’t a joke, but humor helps temper the incendiary impulse behind it. Sometimes you have to choose whether to laugh or scream, and only one kind of outburst is considered socially acceptable. But with Adult Mom’s anger comes a fierce yearning for growth. On ""Survival"", Knipe sings, ""I survive because I have died,"" as if shedding identities like old snakeskins were the only way to keep moving forward unhunted. Often there’s a bitterness ringing the words, but also an ember of hope for the future at their core. Though much of Momentary Lapse plays like the residue of deeply private self-soothing (""I hold my own hands in crowds,"" Knipe sings on ""Be Your Own 3am""), Adult Mom nods to friendship and communal healing throughout. Band banter breaks up some tracks, while Knipe references their friends by name in certain lyrics. Adult Mom teeters on the line of needing companionship and also fearing it, of needing to externalize feelings while remaining unsure of whether those feelings can be understood or even heard. Momentary Lapse is an anxious record, and at times a tentative one, as though Knipe felt stifled in the process of articulating just how stifled they feel. ""It is okay to feel doubt/ But just know you’re gonna find a way out,"" they sing on ""Told Ya So"" between cheery strikes of keyboard. It’s one of many songs on the album that feels like a love letter to a younger self, something that can never actually be sent to its intended recipient, but can be reframed for a stranger out there who needs to hear it.","Adult Mom, the guitar rock project helmed by songwriter Steph Knipe, scrawls gentle notes to self all over their music.

In it, La Havas twirls through an empty house singing of the unique invincibility that comes post-healing: ""Our polarity shifted around/ There was nothing else left holding us down/ But it's just gravitational/ We are unstoppable!"" Warm and affirming, the track eases listeners into a complex, layered album with La Havas' earthy notes complementing meditations on love. La Havas, whose soulful tunes place her most often in conversation with artists like Alice Smith, Laura Mvula, and Corinne Bailey Rae, handles her six-string acoustic with elegance and precision. Where she is less graceful, and at times even awkward, is the integration of more electric sounds. ""Never Get Enough"" alternates between her trademark lullaby and brash chords to almost jarring effect. The tonal shift matches the urgency of the cat-and-mouse lyrical arc, but the abrupt jumps add discordant conflict to an otherwise harmonious track sequencing. The song feels erratic, ill-suited to the pleasant lilt of La Havas' smooth voice. ""Grow"" alternates between acoustics and strong percussion, but its melodic shifts build gradually, matched by La Havas' rising vocals. Though La Havas is best known for her dreamy love songs, she shines naturally when exploring her own internal world. ""Green & Gold"" traces her coming of age through motifs from both her Jamaican and Greek backgrounds: ""I'm looking at life unfold, dreaming of the green and gold/ Just like the ancient stone, every sunrise I know/ Those eyes you gave to me, they let me see where I come from."" The nods to her mixed race heritage are childlike in their innocent inquiry, but the track still retains its maturity; its strong percussive notes deviate from her tendency toward ballads, evoking the same island influence depicted in the track's lyrics. The album's strongest ballad, the stunningly simple ""Wonderful"" showcases her at her finest: sultry, nostalgic, and sweet. The track is a gorgeous ode to love lost, its chorus enchanting: ""But wasn't it kinda wonderful?/ Wasn't it kinda wonderful, baby?"" With slow snaps punctuating La Havas' voice, ""Wonderful"" seduces as it soothes. It is the soundtrack to slow motion surprise encounters with an ex. La Havas weaves contentment with a charged reflection on past romance to tantalizing effect: ""You can trip, flick a switch negative/ Break the circuit between us/ But electricity lingers/ In our fingers."" Melodic interruption of ""Never Get Enough"" notwithstanding, Blood is an almost seamless album. Tracks flow into one another with the fluidity and serenity of rain into a freshwater pond—light, refreshing, natural. But there is substance moving here, weight in the currents. La Havas' even, powerful vocals ride syrupy strings with grace and latch onto sharper rhythms with authority. She is deft and adaptive, at once inspiring dancing and melancholy reflection: La Havas is always in motion.","The English songwriter Lianne La Havas' voice marries youthful lightness with a gravitas most often ascribed to artists well beyond her 25 years. Her complex, layered second album is dynamic and poignantly self-assured.

Knockin' Boots,Julio Bashmore,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af5c5e6ef95969321db5/1:1/w_160/ddba8780.jpg,2015-07-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20797-knockin-boots/,Broadwalk,"A lot of grown-up club kids have felt gratified—vindicated, even—watching vintage house music finding large crossover audiences thanks to the efforts of Disclosure, Jamie xx, and a small army of lesser-known producers doing their best to channel the sounds and energy of the Warehouse and Paradise Garage. While this wave of revivalists has been good about citing their sources and highlighting the original artists in their DJ sets, their actual music occasionally suffers from an overabundance of respect. House music was born out of a hacker mindset, and treating it with kid gloves, instead of finding a way to innovate on the old sounds, robs the music of one of its most vital elements. Producer Matt Walker (aka Julio Bashmore) got his start in Bristol's dubstep scene, but he claims that his first exposure to dance music came through his older brother's vintage house records, and house seems to be his true calling. His breakout 2011 single ""Battle for Middle You"" combined classic house revivalism with a quintessentially Bristolian combination of sub bass frequencies and icy synths. The resulting track had all the feel of a long-lost Chicago treasure being rediscovered. Since then, Walker's lost some of the Bristol chill, but kept his focus on house, to impressive results. His debut album, Knockin' Boots, could actually be the best LP-length statement to come out of house's reawakening. Walker's a nonspecific revivalist who draws inspiration from every point on the genre's timeline—""Rhythm of Auld"" emulates the kind of hard-edged disco funk that house was built on (including a spookily dead-on vocal part by J'Danna, who sings on three of the album's tracks), while ""She Ain't"" sounds like the funkily robotic stuff Cajmere was doing 20 years later with a dash of ghetto house raunch sprinkled on top. He's not bound to any sort of outsized sense of responsibility to authenticity, though, and he freely adds his own personalized flourishes to the recipes he's working from. ""She Ain't"" ends in a glitchy breakdown that would've been very out of place in the mid-'90s. On some tracks he goes even further—a gently percolating bump combined with BIXBY's aching vocals peg ""Let Me Be Your Weakness"" as a stab at circa-1988 soulful house, but the rest of the arrangement is a fascinating mutant mashup of '80s freestyle and turn-of-the-millennium UK garage. After ""Battle for Middle You"", Walker started collaborating with Jessie Ware, and some of her pop ambition seems to have rubbed off. It doesn't have anything as world-crushingly catchy as Disclosure's ""Latch"", but Knockin' Boots has enough pop hooks to interest people who don't normally listen to dance music outside the club. Much of the credit should go to the cast of vocal talent, which includes J'Danna, BIXBY, space-funk auteur Seven Davis Jr., star songwriter Sam Dew, and South African rapper Okmalumkoolkat (who helps to pull hip-house into pop's globally connected present on ""Umuntu""), but Walker also has a talent for making tracks that can jack your body but also get stuck in your head. Walker's already carved out a spot for himself on the worldwide pop scene with the Dew-fronted ""Holding On"", which has been on heavy rotation on Apple Music's Beats 1 Radio. House's danceability and deep utopian streak have helped it take root around the globe, spinning off more variations than even the most ambitiously imaginative house music fan could have pictured back in the days when Ron Hardy was spinning the smooth soul chopped up over thumping beats that ""Holding On"" tries—very successfully—to emulate. Now that house has conquered the world, it's feels right that a younger generation is bringing back the sounds of its earliest days for a victory lap, but it feels even better to know that there are artists like Walker involved who can keep pushing them into the future.","The debut album by Matt Walker, aka Julio Bashmore, revives and tweaks the sounds of vintage house. Walker's a nonspecific revivalist who draws inspiration from every point on the genre's timeline, and Knockin' Boots could actually be the best LP-length statement to come out of the reawakening of vintage house music.

Presence / In Through the Out Door / Coda,Led Zeppelin,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeb09d034d5c69bf45b8/1:1/w_160/623e1dfc.jpg,2015-07-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20668-presence-in-through-the-out-door-coda/,AtlanticSwan SongAtlanticSwan Song,"In the first six years of Led Zeppelin's existence, they released seven albums' worth of music, and nearly all of it was brilliant. During that time, everything seemed to go their way: they had a bottomless well of songs built on the blues, early rock, British and American folk, psychedelia, and R&B; they had the greatest riff machine the world had ever known in Jimmy Page, and they had hard rock's quintessential drummer in John Bonham. But given their penchant for excess and the hyper-intense life they lived as the world's biggest rock band in the '70s, there was no way it could last. They were getting older and growing tired; they did too many drugs; they were too isolated. In the five-and-a-half years between the February 1975 release of Physical Graffiti and the death of drummer John Bonham that ended the band in September 1980, they released just two albums—Presence in March '76 and In Through the Out Door in August '79. The two LPs, newly reissued (along with 1982's posthumous odds-and-ends comp Coda) to round out what will almost certainly be the last large-scale catalog effort in the lifetime of the band members, were easily their weakest. But both are redeemed by the fact that they are also easily their two strangest. Presence and In Through the Out Door are opposites. The former was very much driven by Jimmy Page, who wanted badly to keep the band busy during a time of retrenchment following the serious car accident that injured Robert Plant in August 1975. The recording is ultra dry and the simple guitar/amp interface is front-and-center; just one song features an acoustic instrument, and the album has barely any keyboards. Page's strong hand led to an album that puts the focus on the playing and makes the fewest concessions to pop music. It has also developed a cult following in a way that no other single Zeppelin album has. (""Presence is just perfection,"" Jim O'Rourke told Time Out Tokyo, and given his preference for clean and crisp engineering and arrangements, his admiration makes perfect sense.) It's the Zeppelin album that was least embraced by the radio, with its lengthy songs and general aversion to hooks. But the hard and brittle sound of Presence (at points, it sounds like a Shellac album) has much to admire, not least because you can hear the contributions of each band member so clearly. There are moments of space and silence and very little standing in between the instrument and the listener. Throughout the album, bassist John Paul Jones and John Bonham are so perfectly in tune they seem like a single organism. Listen to how Jones' bass syncs with Bonham's kick drum on the tumbling stop/start masterpiece ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"", which certainly ranks with either's greatest moments, or the loping ""Hots on for Nowhere"", where the pauses serve as a third rhythm instrument. Page keeps his parts unusually lean, emphasizing percussive force over atmosphere. Distortion is used sparingly, as is reverb; though the songs contain many layers of guitars, the focus is on overlapping lines and counterpoint, even at the expense of riffs. One thing Presence most certainly is not is Plant's album; he sang these songs from a wheelchair, still recovering from a car wreck, and his voice sounds pinched and thin on the group's least inspired tunes. Indeed, the overall lack of melody on Presence shows you just how underrated Zeppelin were in that department (as does the previously unreleased bonus track ""10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod (Pod)"", a blandly pretty piano-led instrumental with a chiming acoustic guitar that's the closest Zep ever got to yacht rock). It might be their weakest album, but Presence is among the most special; none of these songs sound like they could have come from another record. It's hard to believe that In Through the Out Door was the work of the same band. By this point, Page, deep in the throes of heroin addiction, had mostly checked out, and Bonham's chronic alcoholism was reaching a terrifying end stage. Robert Plant's five-year-old son died unexpectedly in 1977 and his grief almost caused his exit from the band. Out of this turmoil came Zeppelin's most singular record, if far from their best. With Page out of commission, Plant teamed with Jones, always the group's steadying force, and they wrote colorful songs that heavily featured synthesizers. Most of the '60s and '70s veterans who made a synth-heavy album in the '80s were responding to broader trends in pop, but In Through the Out Door doesn't sound like a reaction to anything, least of all new wave. The general mood is dark and inward; Plant's words are often hard to make out, and when you do catch lyrics they are especially cryptic. But there's something restless and experimental about it too, a feeling of open-ended structures being explored. Out Door is defined by its production sheen; even the most famous guitar part on the album, Page's beautifully broken solo on ""In the Evening"", sounds like it's been run through a dozen pedals and filters. The dirge ""I'm Gonna Crawl"" is utterly shapeless, not a ballad so much as a drawn-out moan; ""South Bound Suarez"" comes at country-tonk from bizarre angles. Where Zep once had direct homages to the music of their youth, now they were creating weirdly synthetic mutant versions of them. Sometimes, as with the Sun-era Elvis trifle, ""Hot Dog"", they didn't quite work, but the Latin-inspired ""Fool in the Rain"" is a unique creation that still sounds fresh. The piano is used as a looping rhythmic instrument in the Cuban tradition—there aren't chord changes, exactly—and the feel of the whole is circular and strange. John Bonham, whose nervous system was ravaged by a daily vodka intake that would stop most people's hearts, somehow managed one last burst of genius and created his most memorable and lasting drum line (hear it in isolation and marvel at just how deeply in the pocket he could still play, the utter mastery of his feel). ""Carouselambra"", a bizarre proggy rave-up that stretches for more than 10 minutes, is impossible to compare to another song. Coda, collecting outtakes (of which Led Zeppelin did not have many), followed in 1982. The big story on this reissue is the release of tracks recorded by Page and Plant in what in the early '70s was still called Bombay. The tabla and strings certainly bring to mind the flavor of some of their experiments in global music around the time, but truthfully there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the ""Bombay Orchestra"" tracks. Beyond the new curiosities, Coda's offerings range from one of the band's best single songs (""Hey Hey, What Can I Do""), which was originally relegated to a B-side, to a fantastic III outtake (""Poor Tom""), to a couple of essential live cuts, to a skippable drum solo (""Bonzo's Montreaux"") and an exhausted rocker that truly feels like the end (""Darlene""). ""Ozone Baby"", recorded during the In Through the Out Door sessions, would have easily been that record's catchiest and most accessible song. Coda is a great listen with a skip button close at hand. Revisiting their final records, it's clear that Zeppelin didn't exactly go out on a high note. But they didn't exactly fade away, either. True to their model, they did something no other rock band of their stature has before: They took a couple of wrong turns and changed into something else rapidly before vanishing. These sets will always leave a peculiar taste in the mouth of Zeppelin fans, but they affirm they were the rock band of the '70s, the decade when rock music ruled the world. Even in their exit, they carried themselves with a majesty and strangeness that simply couldn't be replicated.","The final two Led Zeppelin LPs, Presence and In Through The Out Door, have been reissued, along with 1982's posthumous odds-and-ends comp Coda.  While easily their weakest albums, they are redeemed by the fact that they are also easily their strangest.

Practice What U Preach,DJ Roc,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8c9d034d5c69bf4725/1:1/w_160/25f85c91.png,2015-07-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20832-practice-what-u-preach/,Duck N' Cover,"Clarence Johnson—better known as DJ Roc—is one of Chicago footwork's more underrated veterans, despite having made some of the scene's most approachable projects. In a genre often pigeonholed as repetitive and raw, Roc's production style throughout his nearly 15 years in the game has maintained a fine balance between streamlined minimalism and organized chaos. He favors clarity over experimentation for its own sake, and often, his tracks are formatted in the style of a pop or rap song, with distinct bridges, choruses, pre-choruses. His 2010 Planet Mu debut, The Crack Capone, was one of the first great footwork full-lengths, a subtle and often overlooked gem from the era in which footwork began to seep into the global dance underground. His latest, Practice What U Preach, is a concise, eight-track mini-album on Swiss footwork label Duck 'N Cover Records. More than any other footwork release this year, it's a study in control, all of its rough edges polished into sharp points. Roc's strong suit has always been deft, tricky sample manipulation. He has a keen eye for detail, and a knack for successfully juxtaposing clips that seemingly shouldn't work: on Crack Capone, he made Kid Cudi's hokey Lady Gaga-sampling ""Make Her Say"" barely recognizable, interspersed Evanescence with the ""Twilight Zone"" theme and crunk adlibs, and gave edge to Robin Thicke's pillow-soft ""Lost Without U"". The latter track remains one of Roc's best, and its ethos—making easy listening just a touch harder—guides much of Practice What U Preach. The title track is built around an extended sample of Barry White's 1994 song of the same name, and serves as the ultimate example of Roc's eye for raw material. Halfway through the original, White's delivery edges just slightly out of time on the pre-chorus, chopping up his own rhythm in real time in a pattern that uncannily suggests footwork. It's a window into Roc's seemingly gut-driven sampling instincts; elsewhere, on ""The Worst"", he molds Jhené Aiko's mellow break-up song of the same title into something desperate and urgent. ""Lowend Unity"", a shout-out to the Low End neighborhood on Chicago's south side, gathers choppy snares and syrupy sax solos into neat, tight knots and then lets them unravel and ride out. It's the smoothest a footwork album's sounded in 2015, though it's not without its moments of catharsis: ""Destruction"" pounds organ loops into Lex Luger-style blasts, a battle track in the Spartan sense. Roc's style has often intersected with hip-hop, albeit never quite as overtly as DJ Rashad's (though he is perhaps the only footwork producer to have been sampled multiple times by Lil B). But Roc's a juke producer as much as he is a footwork producer, and perhaps his closest parallel is to DJ Slugo, the juke pioneer with whom he's frequently collaborated. Both make finely crafted, approachable, and surprisingly subtle tracks that know when to build momentum and when to let things unfold organically. ""Ready or Not"", a sleek but dramatic orchestral juke track, is perhaps the album's best demonstration of how much Roc can do with so few components, its intricate structure a counter to anyone who still thinks footwork tracks are simple.","Clarence Johnson—better known as DJ Roc—is one of Chicago footwork's more underrated veterans, despite having made some of the scene's most approachable projects.

CASHINTHEBATHROOM EP,ILLFIGHTYOU,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af85ea9e61561daa647c/1:1/w_160/9272b928.png,2015-07-27 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20827-cashinthebathroom-ep/,self-released,"It's tempting to suggest there's nothing subtle about Tacoma's ILLFIGHTYOU. Everything you need to know about them is in their name, right? All caps, no spaces. (As opposed to all caps with spaces.) The three members are named UGLYFRANK, Khris P, and EvergreenOne. Both of their releases, and all songs on each, are tagged in the same ALLCAPSNOSPACES fashion. A casual listen reveals a sound that's part-West Coast shit talk, part-Pharrell layered beats, and all brash. You can probably almost hear a song based on these ingredients in your head right now. And maybe your estimation wouldn't be too far off, but what you would miss would be how charming and fun their music has consistently been, from even before their 2013 self-titled full-length when they were just frequently-hilarious dudes with a Tumblr. Like a glass of water after 10 shots of whiskey, ILLFIGHTYOU's CASHINTHEBATHROOM EP chases this year's glut of serious-minded spring and summer hip-hop albums. Two years after their debut, the appeal of ILLFIGHTYOU is even more apparent—they sound effortless, and they're clearly having a blast. Khris P and UGLYFRANK trade verses with the temerity (if not complexity) that made Clipse so much fun, or the 2014 model of Rich Gang so electrifying. And ILLFIGHTYOU's sound definitely owes a lot to not just Clipse, but a lot of mid-'00s Pharrell work: think of the line Fam-Lay toed between menacing and joyful. FRANK grounds the music with a delivery that's both deadpan and knives-out (the first verse on the album includes vivid images like ""sniffing coke up in the movie theater"" and ""I'm angry and hella faded, I'm flipping vehicles back"") but also works as Khris's logical foil: Khris has a naturally mercurial voice and he covers more territory, delivering the line ""stacking turkey burgers on my damn plate"" and bragging about having your girl in his mentions all in the same verse. His flow is so natural that ""Oracle"" fades with him still rapping: The sense you get is of having caught a tantalizing glimpse of a guy with better things to do than rap this effortlessly. ""FLASH"" is the best song here, opening with Bill Paxton's famous line from Aliens, ""game over, man, game over!"" It contains my favorite line, Frank's ""Had a dream I got murked and bought a ticket to heaven/ Nah I woke up, popped a perc and I purchased another necklace,"" which somehow interpolates a dark, self-effacing Kanye line from ""Can't Tell Me Nothin'"" into something even darker. The line is punctuated by Khris yelling ""hey!"" in the background, underlining how much fun these guys are having trading verses. And then the chorus riffs on Tribe's ""Award Tour"" just because it can. The recipe is simple, but potent: casual irreverence with a pinch of nihilism. In 2015, with the Internet bubble of ""weird rappers"" giving way to either novelty hits like ""CoCo"", the pop appeal of ""Trap Queen"", or whatever the Awful Records guys feel like doing, ILLFIGHTYOU occupy an interesting middle space: their in-house produced beats knock and sound 0f-the-moment, but the in-jokes and hooks have an almost throwback appeal to them. It's helpful to have someone around to remind you that rap doesn't have to be so dark to make an impression or communicate something meaningful, and in this context ILLFIGHTYOU are surprisingly refreshing. When the last time you heard it like that?","Like a glass of water after 10 shots of whiskey, ILLFIGHTYOU's CASHINTHEBATHROOM EP chases this year's glut of serious-minded spring and summer hip-hop albums.

VII: Sturm und Drang,Lamb of God,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef09d034d5c69bf461e/1:1/w_160/9f12c9a7.png,2015-07-27 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20714-vii-sturm-und-drang/,EpicNuclear Blast,"We do not live in a golden age of major-label heavy metal. Gone are the days when many of the worldwide form’s biggest innovators earned large budgets from still-larger companies or bidding wars occurred for the most brutal new prospect. Though there are exceptions, most modern metal backed by largesse aims so squarely for genre rigidity and predictability that it’s hard to believe it requires humans to make. It’s as though the stuff comes from a factory in some anonymous and once-economically depressed flyover town, conveniently produced in five-band package tours that are almost impossible to distinguish but easy to absorb. Meanwhile, the new metal records that seem destined to matter as masterpieces, like Tribulation’s recent Children of the Night, arrive largely from the indie fringes. After three decades under Rick Rubin’s aegis, even the mighty Slayer have decamped to an indie for the forthcoming Repentless. During the past decade, Lamb of God have struggled with such a fate. Since signing to Epic Records for their third album, 2004’s Ashes of the Wake, they’ve often seemed a rather regimented metal band. Every two or three years, they would churn out another 10 or so songs, with big grooves and death metal outbursts decorated by lots and lots of guitars. Randy Blythe was a rampaging frontman, the kind who encouraged that you get loud with his tirades. But Lamb of God always teased the edges of their sound, trying to push beyond their meat-and-potatoes metal reputation with each release. It’s as if they felt guilty about their well-heeled position on Epic and tried to use it to gradually inch away from stylistic and financial safety, somehow back toward the fringes. By the time they issued 2012’s Resolution, such distractions had wantonly diluted their strengths, resulting in an abysmal record of mediocre hooks and banal studio gimmicks. Despite the highfaluting combination of Roman numerals and German words it takes as a title, Lamb of God’s very good seventh album, VII: Sturm und Drang, is a satisfactorily settled record, arguably their first such effort in a decade. Sturm und Drang takes decidedly few chances. Instead, it sticks mostly to up-tempo numbers, countered only by a clean-singing ballad that soon enough heads for the pit and a righteous stomper that eventually sublimates into something like shoegaze with the help of Deftone Chino Moreno. All of these songs are studded with enormous refrains and driven by a sense of urgency that Lamb of God have forsaken in recent years. When Blythe’s distended scream rips across howling amplifiers at the start of ""Still Echoes"", or when ""Delusion Pandemic"" snaps right into a belligerent stomp, it’s as if they’ve finally got too much to say to fuck around with being fancy. By not trying to be overly interesting or involved, Lamb of God have made one of their most alluring albums in years. The newfound energy and efficiency seem to stem, in part, from between-album trauma: In 2012, months after the release of Resolution, Czech police arrested Blythe in a Prague airport. He spent five weeks awaiting trial for a manslaughter charge after he pushed a teenaged fan, who subsequently died, off the stage at a concert there two years earlier. Blythe was acquitted, but the process hung like a cloud around the band. They scrapped plans for shows and talked about taking a long break. Rather than languish, however, Lamb of God reassembled in the studio and got to work on several songs that examined the frontman’s time in prison and his rather hostile feelings at large. The obvious approach worked: ""Still Echoes"" explores the Nazi history of Prague’s Pankrác Prison, his anger for the subject animating the song with feeling. The guitars twist and scrape like the anxious hands of a very nervous person. It smartly points to Blythe’s prison time without exploiting it, powerfully suggesting that his stint inside allowed him to think about the rest of the world’s problems just as much as his own. And though the irrepressible ""512"" is named for the cell where Blythe spent some time, it’s penned from a much broader perspective. He serves not as the prisoner but as the spokesmen for them. ""My hands are painted red/ My future is painted black/ I’ve become someone else,"" he screams in one of the band’s best choruses ever, deflecting much of the blame at a society that creates its own criminals. He lodges similar criticisms during the bracing-and-racing ""Footprints"", a song about environmental degradation, and the wonderfully thrashing spree ""Delusion Pandemic"", a madman philippic on Internet culture. As laughable as Blythe’s hook about mockingbirds being fed to wolves may be, it’s an irresistible moment. As with the other numbers about self-immolating heroes, Nazi assassins, or media distortion, every song on Sturm und Drang feels like an outburst unmitigated by extraneous tinkering or trials. The production is dense, thin, and minimal, the guitars and drums pushed tight to give all these lyrics extra oomph. The fancy features are limited to a talkbox solo here and a Henry Rollins-like spoken-word bit there. Rather than distract from the hooks, they only reinforce them through contrast. No, Sturm und Drang isn’t a landmark of major-label heavy metal, but it is a reminder of just how very good one of its biggest bands can be when they have something to worry about other than trying so hard to be important.","Despite the Roman numerals and German words in its title, Lamb of God’s seventh album is a satisfactorily settled, gimmick-free record. VII: Sturm und Drang, featuring a guest spot from the Deftones' Chino Moreno, is also the metal stalwarts' most alluring album in years.

Man Plans God Laughs,Public Enemy,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929afa09d034d5c69bf4742/1:1/w_160/b090d3c3.jpg,2015-07-27 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20846-man-plans-god-laughs/,Spitdigital,"Earlier this year, Public Enemy's classic 1990 album, Fear of a Black Planet, celebrated its 25th anniversary. Almost 25 years to the day after Chuck D's piercing shouts bookended Radio Raheem getting choked out by the police in front of onlookers in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, Eric Garner suffered the same fate. Since then, the police have killed Michael Brown, John Crawford III, Ezell Ford, Tamir Rice, Rekia Boyd, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, and many, many more unarmed black men and women. Public Enemy's message is more relevant now than ever. Almost on cue, the group is back from a three-year hiatus with its 13th studio album, Man Plans God Laughs, a timely release that repackages classic Public Enemy motifs for a renewed struggle. The group seems revitalized by the current movement and, as a longstanding, outspoken voice for civil rights, anxiously seeks to lend its support in the ongoing fight for black lives—there's even a passing mention of the #BlackLivesMatter campaign. Chuck D is refocused and often sharp, using his strained, but still booming chants to rally allies. When he shouts, ""So, it's cool to be black until it's time to be black,"" on ""Mine Again"", a song about African pride, it's as much a call-to-action for African-Americans as it is reprimand of cultural appropriators. The two major points of emphasis remain mobilizing the black base and challenging anti-black tyranny. The message is delivered heavy-handedly, but that's always been the group's method; the main difference between Man Plans God Laughs and Public Enemy at its critical best is that the former isn't bracing or forceful in any impactful way. It lacks bite. There's no punch. Public Enemy's tone has always been angry, confrontational, and conspiratorial, and there's no group in history better equipped to weaponize black nationalism against white supremacy, but here the battle waged is at least partially against a spiritual adversary. The title originates from an old Yiddish proverb—a weird bit of irony for a group that has frequently been accused of anti-Semitism—and the record is lined with similarly out-of-place religious subtext (on ""Those Who Know Know Who"", Chuck fires subliminal barbs at the devil; there's no sympathy for the same foe in the intro). Scriptural buzzwords like ""evil"" and ""wicked"" pop up unexpectedly as descriptors. There's no piety, merely a fixation with ""the great Satan"", who plays a puppet master figure in the periphery, and this only splits focus and limits the commentary's potency. Chuck told Rolling Stone that this would be ""the most intense Public Enemy record of the century,"" but 2007's How You Sell Soul to a Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul??? was much fiercer and more substantial. Man Plans God Laughs isn't intense; it's concise, and though it can't quite muster up the heavy strikes of other PE projects, it benefits from brevity. Many of the tracks barely clock-in at two minutes, which suits Chuck's fragmenting rap style, Flav's fading wail, and DJ Lord's compact scratching. Things click on all cylinders with the skipping ""Lost in Space Music"", where Chuck and Flav play up the emcee-hype man dynamic. When given space, like on ""Corplantationopoly"", the veteran can still be exhilaratingly bullish, rumbling through with weighty appraisals of race politics. But Chuck's voice isn't the same weapon it once was, Flav's ad-libs aren't as timely and his appearances are less waggish, and the shifting rap tide hasn't done the group's traditionalist sensibilities any favors. You can feel the difference. Man Plans God Laughs is entirely produced by longtime Bomb Squad member G-Wiz—who also produced the majority of How You Sell Soul—and some of his beats slap, particularly ""Praise the Loud"", which is augmented by DJ Lord scratches. But many others blatantly pander to rap radio, and some are just busy for no reason (""Give Peace a Damn""). Where previous PE releases this century have often sounded dated, this one often sounds forcibly modern, the sonic equivalent of your tech-challenged granddad trying to use Spotify. At one point, Chuck utters the words 'Turnt up brand."" ""Earthizen"" attempts to reimagine the tired alphabet rap concept, but sputters, adding a cringeworthy hook: ""The earth without art is just, 'eh'."" Even for all its faults, though, this record doesn't lack the distinct, aggressively pro-Black energy that originally made Public Enemy a voice for the oppressed masses. That's what has always been the most important thing at the music's core. The message is still there, the delivery is just less effective now.","The group is back from a three-year hiatus with its 13th studio album, Man Plans God Laughs, a timely release that repackages classic Public Enemy motifs for a renewed struggle.

The Most Lamentable Tragedy,Titus Andronicus,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aede9d034d5c69bf4608/1:1/w_160/3c501d64.jpg,2015-07-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20702-the-most-lamentable-tragedy/,Merge,"If you've been to Brooklyn venue Shea Stadium in the last few years, you might have encountered Patrick Stickles sitting at the door, selling tickets to shows with crowds far more diminished than those drawn by his band, Titus Andronicus. Such remember-your-roots DIY ethos has always been central to the band’s existence, because at a time when bands are more flexible than ever about taking money to survive, Titus Andronicus are specifically beloved for their refusal to compromise. They start charity funds so their music can be kept out of advertisements; they snidely refer to Kendrick Lamar as a shoe spokesperson, an attitude both rigidly simplistic and technically true. The Clash were hyped as the ""only band that matters,"" a dubious claim because it was invented by their record label. But for their fans, Titus Andronicus is this type of group. They turn a great, burning eye upon the world and spare no one from their observations, not even themselves. For listeners attracted to rock'n'roll as both flagellating whip and eternal flame, this is powerfully enticing—especially if you also believe the world is on the perennial edge of collapse. (Ironically, they take a similarly analytical approach to the ugliness in themselves and in the world as Kendrick Lamar—only, of course, they'd never sell any shoes.) Their status was cemented by 2010 breakthrough The Monitor, a wildly ambitious album that used the Civil War as a metaphor for Stickles' life. It was desperate music made for desperate people, filled with howled lamentations about the sorry state of society wrapped around riffs that forced your shoulders out of their sockets. But the follow-up, 2012's Local Business, was unexpectedly dour. Hesitant to accept his band's new position in the music industry, Stickles pulled back. The first line asserted that everything in the world was ""inherently worthless,"" and only grew more precisely negative as it went onward, critiquing the middle-class bubble that allowed a band like them to exist. Music fans will accept a certain amount of doom-and-gloom—many times they actively court it—but there are limits. Few people want to listen to a rock song about why listening to a rock song is bad. That Stickles spent the next few years telling his Twitter followers that Local Business was better than The Monitor (in a run of tweets now gone after he deleted his timeline earlier this year) seemed to cement its status as metaphorical garlic, meant to ward off the punks-in-name-only who today might discover the band through listening to Beats 1. So when reports first emerged that the band was writing a 30-track rock opera, it sounded outrageous—a pointed gag from Stickles that would probably culminate in, like, an album full of Crass covers. How do you go bigger than an album that uses the Civil War as a metaphor for one's life? But it wasn't a joke: Almost two years later, they announced The Most Lamentable Tragedy, a 29-track, 93-minute rock opera that immediately restored their claims to outsized ambition, as only a 29-track, 93-minute rock opera might. The Most Lamentable Tragedy is a story told in five acts that follows the Hero, an unnamed man (who's someone like Stickles) in an unnamed city (which is somewhere like New York) grappling with his neuroses. He's confronted by his doppelgänger—an alternate self that seems to have everything figured out, and pushes him to find solace outside of sin. It’s a protracted allegory for manic depression, which Stickles has publicly struggled with since the band first came to attention. Here, he’s reversed course from the literal transcription of his life’s struggles on Local Business (no ""My Eating Disorder""), instead interpreting them to fit his larger vision. The Most Lamentable Tragedy is their least specific album—no granular references to obscure Jersey baseball teams—but their most universal, less dependent on empathizing with the suburban sad sack. The music encompasses everything they’ve ever sounded like: There are knotty guitar anthems filled with chords like power lines thrumming with electricity (""No Future Part IV"", ""Stranded""), hot-breathed hardcore exhortations (""Look Alive"", ""Lookalike""), vamps on musical theater where Stickles sounds somewhere between Billy Joel and Meat Loaf (""I Lost My Mind"", ""No Future Part V""). They filter the visceral riffage of Thin Lizzy (""Lonely Boy""), the all-hands-on revelry of the E. Street Band (""Fatal Flaw""), and the whiskey-soaked romanticism of the Pogues (""Come On, Siobhán"") through a fiery, punk-indebted perspective. True, those are reference points on previous albums, but here the elements blend together like a hearty soup. Fifteen musicians are credited on the record (such as Owen Pallett, who handled the strings) and there's a feeling of camaraderie in the production; at times, it feels like the album was recorded in one, rambling live take over a long night. The album’s ambitions aren’t only limited to the story, which Stickles has eagerly detailed at the former Rap Genius. Instead, it considers their discography as one giant super-structure. It's packed with callbacks to previous work, which any modest Titus head should be able to pick out. The references range from obvious (""More Perfect Union"" follows The Monitor's ""A More Perfect Union""; ""I'm Going Insane"" is a reprise of Local Business' ""Titus Andronicus vs. the Absurd Universe (3rd Round KO)"") to esoteric (lyrical homages to ""No Future"" and ""A More Perfect Union"", amongst others) to potentially meaningful: The titular character in ""Mr. E. Mann"" is the ""Electric Man"" from Local Business, which was written about a real-life incident in which Stickles was hospitalized after gripping a live microphone during rehearsal for a show. The idea that electricity and electroshock therapy can cure depression is an old one, hence the smudging of fiction and reality to suggest that the shocks Stickles inadvertently received may have created this fictive doppelganger, who appears to the hero (""I met a mystery man/ On a magic morning"") and offers a hopeful path toward clean living. Of course, these layers of potential interpretation are secondary to the fact that ""Mr. E. Mann"" is simply an enjoyable song, guided by Stickles' sensitive vocal performance and the convergence of harmonica, piano, and strings into what sounds like glistening dew on that magic morning. You don’t need to know that Stickles was shocked by a microphone to enjoy ""Mr. E Mann"", just as you don’t need to know that he’s from New Jersey to understand the hero's sense of psychic isolation. But like the Hold Steady, the mythology offers deeper enjoyment for anyone willing to burrow into it. On their earlier albums, Titus Andronicus perfected the art of writing confrontationally self-effacing anthems. Their most potent and most recognized refrains—""You will always be a loser"" and ""Your life is over""—took on a therapeutic nature when being screamed by crowds of young men and women in the throes of rock-show-as-catharsis. By contrast, the mantras on The Most Lamentable Tragedy look inward. ""I hate to be awake""; ""I can control something inside of me""; ""It's alright""; ""I only like it when it's dimed out""; these are confessional observations that sound scribbled in the margins of some diary. Stickles has sounded more personal than this, but never less acidic. This is angst that’s approachable, rather than the starved nihilism that colored their previous records. With that in mind, the one-two punch of ""Come On, Siobhán"" and ""A Pair of Brown Eyes"" is where the record unlocks. In their cover of the Pogues classic, they tweak a few lyrics to change the mood: ""One winter's evening/ Stoned as hell."" It's marijuana that the hero consumes in this version, not alcohol, because while booze dulls the senses, a real marijuana high makes one ultra-perceptive of all the conditions in one's life. Sifting those thoughts to find some clarity is like navigating a minefield... but here, the hero has a revelation that despite his baleful world view, despite the push and pull between his inner selves, despite the tide of disgust felt toward his surroundings, salvation is possible through someone else. The feeling might be as ephemeral as the high, but for a moment, life looks wide open. It's the first time the band has explicitly sung about love, the transmutation of brutal pessimism into beatific optimism. This is not maudlin sentiment printed off a Hallmark card, but a hard-fought conclusion following a lifetime of despair. The feeling isn't eternal; a few songs later, the relationship has ended and the hero is plunged back into his depression. But the mood has shifted by ""Stable Boy"", the last proper song on the album. Over a weeping chord organ, Stickles gazes at the yawning void of ""forever"" and decides that for all life's dissatisfaction, 'tis better to have lived than not at all. ""Stable Boy"" was recorded with the same cassette recorder used for ""Fear and Loathing in Mahwah, NJ"", the first song off their first record, which captured Stickles' need to do wrong to everyone who'd done wrong by him. The two tracks sound like bookends to the Titus Andronicus project, introducing and resolving Stickles' profound anxieties about life—the running theme through all of their four albums. It's not necessarily a happy ending, but it's one they fought for. And so: It's taken five years, but they've finally answered the grand expectations created by The Monitor. They could go anywhere from here—record that album of Crass covers, become a full-time bar cover band, or even happily break up. At the very least, they can stop writing songs titled ""No Future"".","The Most Lamentable Tragedy is a 29-track, 93-minute rock opera that grapples with Titus leader Patrick Stickles' manic depression. It is their least specific album but their most universal: The music encompasses everything they’ve ever sounded like and restores their claims to outsized ambition after the somewhat dour Local Business.

Watkins Family Hour,Watkins Family Hour,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7d9d034d5c69bf4710/1:1/w_160/f105a79f.jpg,2015-07-24 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20821-watkins-family-hour/,Thirty TigersFamily Hour,"Most people think of ""records"" as discrete objects, collections of smaller pieces strung together into a whole. But rarely do we think of records as records: documents of specific places, times, people, ideas. Watkins Family Hour accurately falls under both of those definitions. It’s an eponymous album born out of the monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean and Sara Watkins at Los Angeles’ Largo for more than a decade. Now, with this record, those of us outside L.A. can finally get a peek at what they’ve been up to each month. The Watkins were best known in the early 2000s for their band Nickel Creek, a progressively minded roots trio that took tradition and imbued it with new energy that earned them a Grammy and a large international following. The band’s frontman and mandolin player Chris Thile has gone on to earn more acclaim than his bandmates in the decade since they called it quits (save for a record and reunion tour last year), but the Watkins are no slouches: guitarist Sean remains a tremendously skilled flatpicker, while Sara’s songwriting and fiddling has always been sharp. They’ve both put these chops front and center on the solo records they’ve released over the years. Watkins Family Hour, an 11-track LP comprised entirely of cover songs, feels like it could’ve been a live recording at any one of the group’s Largo conventions. They begin with Robert Earl Keen’s ""Feelin’ Good Again"", a mellow celebration of finding unexpected moments of joy. It’s an appropriate opening for a record that feels analogous to a live experience: it’s the obligatory ""Hey, welcome everyone, we’re so happy to be here."" From there, Watkins Family Hour arcs across toe-tapping numbers—some faster, some slower—before closing with the ""fare thee well"" reprises in the Grateful Dead’s ""Brokedown Palace"". All that’s missing is stage banter and some between-song tuning. While the Watkins siblings lend their name to the marquee, the Watkins Family Hour has always operated under an open-ended definition of ""family."" Fiona Apple is perhaps the brightest star of the fold on the album, though she never eclipses her cohorts. It’s a pleasant surprise to hear Apple flex her vocal might in a genre outside her usual realm with ""Where I Ought to Be"", and her execution is immensely satisfying. Where Skeeter Davis leaned more toward self-pity on her original 1961 recording, Apple’s vocals streak the song with anger and hurt, breaking the record’s overall complacent tone. ""Hop High"", with Sara Watkins taking the vocal lead, injects the back half of the album with more intrigue as a cautious introduction yields to fiery fiddle licks. Elsewhere, Watkins Family Hour hits a number of country and Americana sweet spots: there’s the plaintive ballad ""She Thinks I Still Care"", the mournful drinking tune ""King of the Twelve Oz. Bottles"". And while they also include a Roger Miller song, they made an unexpected choice from his catalog: ""Not in Nottingham"" is from Disney’s 1973 movie Robin Hood. Greg Leisz’s pedal steel buoys the record throughout—that instrument can help songs soar with a twangy breeziness or damn them to goofy ""Hyuck, howdy-y’all!"" hell. Similarly, Benmont Tench’s honky-tonk organ and piano contributions are welcome additions to the arrangements. When bands we like cover songs we love, our best hope to relive those special moments is usually through sideways videos recorded on cell phones and uploaded to YouTube. But with this crystalline collection, Watkins Family Hour offers a more compelling insight.","Watkins Family Hour is an eponymous album born from the decade-plus monthly residency hosted by siblings (and ex-Nickel Creek members) Sean and Sara Watkins at Los Angeles’ Largo.

Days,Earthly,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af0f13d197565213a1fd/1:1/w_160/2a53d0e7.jpg,2015-07-24 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20738-days/,Noumenal Loom,"Sometimes you can tell a lot from the smallest details of a project. The suffix ""ly"" in the name ""Earthly"", for instance, nods subtly to how this pair of North Carolina noisemakers create music not necessarily of Earth but cobble together fragments from their terrestrial experience into a rough resemblance. The album title may account for the sheer amount of time ex-college roommates Edaan Brook and Brint Hansen have spent together, working through school, hanging out at home, writing songs, or just getting to know each other. You can hear that time in Days—the lifeblood of its tracks is an endless collection of samples that would've taken years to assemble, let alone arrange into music—and sense that close friendship, too. Look at the cover: two strange, colorful faces stare blankly, content to simply be in the same place. But maybe that's all a bit too serious for music like this, because if nothing else, Days wants to have fun. Earthly finger paints with found sound, plays tag with sequencers, jumps rope with drum machines, seesaws with FX pedals, and pigs out on bubblegum melody. You can imagine sing-songy opener ""RGB"" as the theme for a CGI ""Rugrats"" reboot, or ""Ice Cream""'s carnival bounce as a Cartoon Network interlude. One particularly exuberant track is straight-up called ""Games"", and though it wastes no time dropping PlayStation samples into its iridescent chords, the music plays like an anthem for indoor kids who discovered their kindred spirits at noise shows and dance parties. Days doesn't make you feel like a kid so much as it reminds you how great it can be to act like one. Surrealist as they are, Brook and Hansen frequently dip into the uncanny valley, and it's where their best ideas are found. Not unlike Oneohtrix Point Never or Holly Herndon, vocals are chopped and pitched into tuneful glossolalia, occasionally allowed to speak in daffy non sequiturs. And it's often impossible to discern exactly what other sounds Earthly recorded, dismantled, and pieced back together for any given track. Was that a pan flute fluttering in the background of ""Honison Climber""? Did they sample a soda commercial for ""RGB""? You may want to pick apart the layers, but it's better to soak in the frenzy; all those moving parts would be nonsense on their own, but together amount to a baffling electronic spectacle. It's unlikely you'll hear another album like Days this year, but it's not without predecessors. The influence of early aughts psych noise courses through the music, as if it's a love child conceived during the first Black Dice and Animal Collective tour. But the offspring has grown independently, learning to speak its own language with new slang and more deliberate syntax. The sound resembles fellow audio collagists in places—Javelin's playful No Mas, early Prefuse 73, Matmos, and the Books are all here. But throughout the record, Brook and Hansen discover new ways to surprise and thrill, making unexpected turns with each consecutive track. Even low-slung drifts and beatless shimmers aren't off limits in their topsy-turvy digital funhouse. Maybe ""balanced noise album"" is an oxymoron, but so is ""adult playground."" Indeed, Days is both.","The North Carolina noisemakers Earthly mix the psych noise of early Animal Collective and Black Dice with the audio collages of the Books, Matmos, and Prefuse 73.

Y Dydd Olaf,Gwenno,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af305e6ef95969321d79/1:1/w_160/eda4cb19.jpg,2015-07-24 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20765-y-dydd-olaf/,Heavenly,"Back in 2000, Super Furry Animals' Mwng became the first Welsh-language album to get into the UK Top 20. It's still the only one to ever dent the charts' upper reaches. There are almost a million Welsh speakers in the UK, but Welsh-language music struggles for recognition outside of Wales. At worst, it's treated as a novelty, a fate that you can only hope doesn't befall Cardiff-born Gwenno Saunders' debut solo album, reissued this week on Heavenly after its initial appearance on local label Peski last year. Y Dydd Olaf is named for Welsh author Owain Owain's 1976 sci-fi novel in which world-conquering robots turn humans into clones. Nine of its songs are in Welsh while the closing track is in Cornish, which is supposedly the primary language of around 600 people. Saunders used to front kitsch girl-group the Pipettes, which she recently dismissed as ""playing a role that had already been written."" Y Dydd Olaf also plays into an entrenched role—the gentle Welsh-language pop revolutionary set out by the likes of SFAs and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci—but it's a natural fit for Saunders, who establishes herself as a visionary of synth-pop moods and textures. Owain's original story is confined to the title track and ""Fratolish Hiang Perpeshki"", which isn't Welsh, but the nonsense words that his characters start spouting when cyborg forces corrupt their minds. Owain's protagonist, however, retains his individualism by writing diary entries in Welsh, which stops the robots from getting inside his head. Saunders uses that concept to underpin a record about the importance of preserving cultural identity in order to resist corporate death—which in turn, only a relatively tiny audience will actually be able to understand. English notes accompanying the album translate songs that explore the artist's role in a downtrodden society, and the way that technology gives misogyny yet another platform, which compounds the problem of sexism in minority cultures that still promote traditional gender roles. Saunders confronts Cardiff's unimaginative civic planning and highlights the dependable march of nature, weighing up the clash between old and new worlds. For those without crib notes or a native ear, the idea of language-as-protector shines through in the intimate soundscape that Saunders creates along with her producer husband (and Peski boss) Rhys Edwards. Her palette is kosmische, recalling the likes of Stereolab and Can, but her soft-edged synths, intermingling with field recordings from Cardiff Bay, makes her evocation of space domestic and comforting, like a transmission from a house party on the moon. She has a tendency to stick to one song structure: her languid take on that gorgeously hushed language sits atop an insistent guitar or synth part that spirals somewhere heavenly in the chorus. The magic, though, is in the spellbinding tones she weaves throughout. The piano on opener ""Chwyldro"" (revolution) sounds bent and worn, and guides out Cornish closer ""Amser"" (time). ""Fratolish Hiang Perpeshki"" sounds like a forlorn death disco for Owain's doomed population. ""Stwff"" starts with a bright piano recalling the swirl of a French carousel, or Nino Rota's sweeter film scores, though it comes to feel as disquieting as the drowned lounge band swing that underpins ""Calon Peiriant"" (the heart of the machine). On ""Stwff"", a song about growing up and learning how to fit in, Saunders sings (in Welsh): ""I can only apologize for feeling the frustration/ Young and ambitious in a minority culture/ I joined the middle but it didn't really impress me."" Her treatise on the importance of staying true to your identity finds extra weight in the fact that she tried to live another way and came back, shaken up by the loss she felt during her pop outing. Y Dydd Olaf is a crucial minority language record, but Saunders' beguiling melodies and execution also make it one of the best British debuts of 2015.","Gwenno Saunders used to front the girl-group the Pipettes.

How Does It Feel,MS MR,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af81c0084474cd0c1ab0/1:1/w_160/534069b2.jpg,2015-07-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20824-how-does-it-feel/,Columbia,"The New York duo MS MR resembles a pop-art design firm, a partnership of sorts that happens to offer pop music among other holdings. Lizzy Plapinger and Max Hershenow met as Vassar students, after Plapinger started the label Neon Gold as a thesis project. They rolled out the Candy Bar Creep Show EP on Tumblr in 2012, and their followup debut Secondhand Rapture came with ""visual treatments"" for all of its songs. Their song titles often feel like songwriting-workshop prompts (""Dark Doo Wop""). Like Marina and the Diamonds, MS MR offer pop that strives to hit its marks and offer something further: the viral hit and reactionary think piece about it, all in one. How Does It Feel is their second full-length album, and the larger sense that they’re a smartly conceived rollout plan in search of indelible songs has never really stopped dogging them. They seemed interesting in 2012, and they seem interesting in 2015. But the songs don’t speak the same subversive and interesting language of their publicity. Plapinger is a powerful singer, someone who very much sounds like she belongs perched on footlights. But the aesthetics of her songs with Hershenow remain timid and careful: There are no mind-warping sounds to match the visual boldness of their videos, and none of Plapinger’s lyrics have the crisp, memorable economy of her album and song titles. If pop art traffics first in unforgettable iconography, then MS MR fail the basic test: You could be listening to other people when you are listening to MS MR, and it’s often easy to imagine that you are. If there are no calling-card songs here here, there are several solid ones: ""Painted"" turns Plapinger’s tense, brittle recitation of the words ""What did he think would happen"" into a rhythmic tattoo. The song seems to be accelerating slightly for its entire length, obsessive irritation gathering force. On ""No Guilt in Pleasure"" (another one of those mission-statement style song titles), tiny thumb pianos share space with tarmac-sized synths, while Plapinger dips into the throaty, throbbing lower end of her register. In general, MS MR have a much better feel for ""small, tense, and interesting"" than they do for ""big and soaring""—the verses crackle with friction and ideas, while the choruses taste generic. When ""No Guilt in Pleasure"" and ""Wrong Victory"" scale up into their Big Hooks, the flavor drains out of the music as the volume builds. Plapinger’s lyrics also often clunk where they should soar. The synth-pop ""Tunnels"" builds a cool and autumnal atmosphere, but Plapinger trips through it with wordy lines like ""Silence and motion on this quiet tread/ Searching for lanes that don’t lead to the end."" They are conversational in a way that fights the basic impulse of pop lyrics, which is to distill emotions to a fine point. You can usually hear the semicolons in Plapinger’s lyrics, which struggle to wedge layered impressions and fleeting thoughts into the stark, four-color backdrops of the music. This is often a problem when you approach a genre—in MS MR’s case, pop music—with the stated intention of subverting or commenting on it. Genre writing is a complex enough game all by itself. Unless you are blessed with some illuminating thunderclap of genius, your efforts to ""subvert"" those tropes usually just renders them inert.","The New York duo MS MR resembles a pop-art design firm, a partnership that happens to offer pop music among other holdings.

Miles Davis at Newport 1955-1975: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4,Miles Davis,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af76c0084474cd0c1a9b/1:1/w_160/8ad6295d.jpg,2015-07-24 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20816-miles-davis-at-newport-1955-1975-the-bootleg-series-vol-4/,ColumbiaLegacy,"Even the most optimistic fan might not have been able to foresee the long-term vitality of Miles Davis' posthumous catalog. Thanks to multi-disc box sets that have unearthed all the (thrilling) studio sessions that went into iconic fusion albums such as In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson, and On the Corner—as well as Columbia's more recent focus on unissued live performances in its Miles Davis Bootleg Series—the trumpeter-composer has remained an ever-renewable resource in the catalog. (If the branding reminds you of the label's back-pages approach to Bob Dylan, you're not wrong.) On the whole, this feels appropriate, especially when the artist under consideration created and then ditched exciting new stylistic languages with Picasso-like abandon. But a nagging question also hovers around each new deluxe set to come off the 21st Century assembly line: How long can the party last, before we get into the realm of record-company rehash? Unlike ""Bootleg Series"" sets that are more easily understood as essential, this four-disc volume strides through different decades of the Davis story. So at the outset, we get crisp, acoustic-instrument performances of tunes like ""'Round Midnight"", while at the far end of the box, we're delivered to the high-humidity atmospheres of the rock-tinged, experimental funk of Davis' 1970s lineups. The set's connecting thread is the Newport Jazz Festival—the legendary, still-running summer concert stage that Davis first stepped onto in 1955 (as a member of a brief ""All-Star Jam"" that included Thelonious Monk). Later in that decade, Davis took a hard-bop sextet (including John Coltrane and Bill Evans) to Newport, not long before it went into the studio to cut Kind of Blue. Are these early Davis appearances at Newport classic? Of course. But in the main, the music on the first disc of this box has been available for a while. As has a nearly half-hour portion of this volume's third disc (recently included on the album Bitches Brew Live). Moreover, while Davis certainly made a point of getting his various groups to the Newport festival—both its U.S. and foreign-touring iterations—there's little sense that the destination much influenced his fast-moving aesthetic development. (Unlike, say, the post-Summer of Love concerts at the Fillmore collected in the third Davis Bootleg Series release.) So instead of being wall-to-wall necessary, this Bootleg Series edition is simply three-quarters-revelatory. But what is legitimately new here is as good as anything else in the Davis-rarity series. The second disc gives us multiple, intense sets by the trumpeter's ""second great quintet,"" which traveled to Newport in both 1966 and 1967. The back-to-back sequencing of these performances shows how fast Davis' music was developing, even from within a particular lineup. (Compare the thrashing, second version of ""Gingerbread Boy"", from the 1967 date, to the more restrained 1966 iteration.) And the final disc's rarely-heard 1971 band—including Keith Jarrett on electric piano—puts its own spin on some of Davis' most familiar fusion-era tunes (including a cool-strutting ""Bitches Brew"" that leads into a majestic, slow-burning ""Funky Tonk""). The powerhouse performance in the box, however—a true drop-everything-and-call-your-friends-over-to-listen concert—is a 47-minute stretch on disc three, which puts the spotlight on a 1973 Davis band that would later go on to form the core of the ensemble on the live album Dark Magus. For some connoisseurs, Dark Magus represents Davis' point of peak-fusion—propulsive, densely textured, and grooving. But one thing that recording also has is longueurs. (It was a double-album, after all.) The 1973 gig included in this box isn't just more compact, it's nervier, too. While Pete Cosey's wild electric guitar pyrotechnics sound great on Dark Magus, his playbook of liquid licks also feels fully figured out—it's a command performance by a Davis group member who has had years to drill this particular music. By contrast, his playing on ""Turnaroundphrase"", the opening tune from this newly issued 1973 set, is more darting in nature, and alive with the sound of the guitarist figuring out a way through Davis' ferocious composition. Likewise, soprano saxophonist Dave Liebman—the only acoustic axe in this lineup—sounds as though he's fighting his way toward a state of audibility. When his keening playing joins up with Davis's own wah-wah-enhanced trumpet moans, the sound reaches flourishes of intensity that rival (and perhaps eclipse) those on Dark Magus. (The 1973 set is such a different-sounding beast, it hardly matters that its setlist is largely similar to that of the latter album.) The liner notes included with this Bootleg Series release refer to Davis' ""heath challenges"" during this period, and his reduced range on the trumpet. And yet the 1973 gig still shows Davis' bandleading and arranging skills to be working at a high level, hard living be damned. Despite the fact that those talents weren't intimately connected to the Newport Festival, particularly, they lend this box set a stable, running theme—whether Davis is leading his sextet with Coltrane, his second quintet, or else the various fusion lineups represented here. You can quibble with the inclusion of familiar material in a Bootleg Series package, but you can't argue—not yet, at least—with the unreleased depths of the Davis vault.","Opening with crisp, acoustic-instrument performances and ending with rock-tinged, experimental funk, this 4xCD ""Bootleg"" collection strides through different decades of the Miles Davis story. The powerhouse performance here is a 45-minute stretch that puts the spotlight on a 1973 Davis band that would later go on to form the core of the ensemble on the live album Dark Magus.

Many Levels of Laughter,J Fernandez,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7fb1335d7bf1699f58/1:1/w_160/9e2cbcac.jpg,2015-07-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20822-many-levels-of-laughter/,Joyful Noise,"Back in 2012, J Fernandez sidelined his day job as a cartographer and released a pair of indoorsy bedroom-pop nuggets packed with Adderall-infused Byrds riffs and cabin-fever ambience. Three years and about as many interviews later, the Chicago songwriter remains elusive on his debut album, and yet easier to pin musically: the songs on Many Levels of Laughter are intricate, introspective, and self-contained, while hinting at a world just beyond the scope of the music that’s too dauntingly ordinary to warrant investigating. While Fernandez crafts a distinctive blend of dextrous, spidery guitars and quivering organ, he’s practically anonymous as a lyricist. The record opens insisting that ""Communication is a waste of time"" and follows the theme. ""Please don’t listen to me,"" he implores on ""Casual Encounter"", as if his presence center-stage were some kind of mistake. ""Read My Mind"" depicts a similar glossophobia within a muted relationship, its ambiguous opening line–""No conversation, and everything is fine""–poised between pre-breakup denial and passive-aggressive petulance. Fernandez is emotionally static, his problems less exclaimed than exhaled, so it’s no surprise when, for stretches of the record, his voice disappears entirely. Musically Many Levels of Laughter has a neat breadth: His jauntier, jazzier passages explore the bits of Tim Buckley’s Starsailor that Doldrums bypassed on Lesser Evil, while interlude ""Markers"" deploys curious, playful paddling sounds against an odd, melancholy jingle. His hooks have nuance and charm–you can hear the cognitive cogs whirring behind ""Apophis""’s squiggling organs, the shivery up-strokes in ""Between the Channels"". But even at the record’s most kaleidoscopic, Fernandez sings cautiously, as if each note were subject to stringent security checks before leaving his mouth. ""Break your habits, try a different route,"" he croaks on closer ""Melting Down"", a flash of wishful thinking as eerie, lunar synths orbit an ambling krautrock beat. As if to keep him company, a gently stirring bassline kicks in, heaving itself up the fretboard. The forward momentum is welcome, albeit akin to the flicker of daylight in a dark room as an oscillator fan tickles the curtains. After 30 minutes of cosmic despondence, though, that reprieve almost feels misplaced. Rather than celebrating isolation, Fernandez' songs use the languid, daydreamy haze of bedroom pop to hint at the pathos of wasted life.","The songs on the Chicago bedroom-pop songwriter J Fernandez's Many Levels of Laughter are intricate, introspective, and self-contained.

The Soul Is the Arena,Mario Diaz de Leon,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7013d197565213a29f/1:1/w_160/43d2e546.jpg,2015-07-23 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20811-the-soul-is-the-arena/,Denovali,"If you don't follow classical music, it might surprise you to hear a living composer professing admiration for metal, noise, and ambient drones. But that's how things have been for decades now—going back to the early 1980s, when guitar-centric composers like Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham started fusing underground rock with post-minimalism. Today, it's common for young conservatory talents to name-check alt-derived noise artists alongside modernists like Karlheinz Stockhausen. In that respect, Columbia University composition grad Mario Diaz de Leon is on-trend: the promotional material for his latest release of chamber pieces cites both Stockhausen as well the abrasion specialists in Wolf Eyes. (Diaz de Leon comes by the latter reference point honestly, having collaborated with group member Nate Young in a duo that goes by the name Standard Deviance One.) When he's not working in chamber-music mode, Diaz de Leon also sometimes goes by the moniker Oneirogen—a guise which finds him splitting his attention between an electric guitar and a synth setup, ultimately creating a wash of doomy chords and spacey soundscapes. It's a sound that can make sense on a Liturgy bill. What makes Diaz de Leon stand out from his peers, though, is his ability to distill these influences into a balanced aesthetic. Plenty of people can write a one-off ""amplified"" piece for chamber musicians, but few artists have built a language as stable and rewarding as Diaz de Leon's. His first solo-composer album, Enter Houses Of, was released in 2009 on John Zorn's Tzadik label, and showed him to be adept at weaving opulently distorted electronics with virtuoso acoustic-instrumental parts, written for players drawn from the International Contemporary Ensemble. The noise throbbed with snarling exuberance; the woodwinds doled out haunting harmonies. The Soul Is the Arena is Diaz de Leon's latest chamber-music album since Enter Houses Of, and it's both shorter and more all-encompassing. In three different pieces that collectively stretch just over 40 minutes, he gives listeners two riff-rollercoaster duos and a 20-minute, chamber-band essay of grim, beguiling beauty. The opener, ""Luciform"", is a duo between Diaz de Leon's electronics and flutist Claire Chase (a recent MacArthur ""Genius Grant"" awardee). Over the course of its 13-and-a-half minutes, Chase's flute sometimes often carries the melodic line, while the electronics swoop in big, sine-wave-surfing curves behind her. At other points, Chase's breathy sound is just a complement to the rampaging crunch of the composer's programming. The fast switches are what keep the piece interesting. The second duo piece is the album's title track, and it asks for Joshua Rubin's bass clarinet to go into reed-squawk mode. (Rubin manages this risky, awkward move with impressive grace.) Later on, the instrumentalist and the pre-engineered sounds partner up for a memorably precise and glitchy passage. The work packs a hell of a lot into nine-and-a-half minutes—so much so that you might need a little bit of a breather. Diaz de Leon has you covered on that count with the album-closing ""Portals Before Dawn"" (on which he plays synths alongside a sextet of instrumentalists from the International Contemporary Ensemble). The composer tried a similar strategy to close out Enter Houses Of, but this longer, more gradually surging and receding composition gets more out of the composer's ambient fascinations. Diaz de Leon hasn't put out an uninteresting release yet, but this compact and wide-ranging album is now the best introduction to his refined feel for instrumental extremity.","Columbia University composition grad Mario Diaz de Leon combines an interest in Karlheinz Stockhausen-style modernism with a love of metal, noise, and ambient drones. He's collaborated with members of Wolf Eyes and written for chamber groups, and on his latest album, he combines his interests seamlessly into music that throbs with snarling exuberance.

Radiance and Submission,CFCF,by: Clayton Purdom,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af27b1335d7bf1699eca/1:1/w_160/e3446fb3.jpg,2015-07-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20757-radiance-and-submission/,Driftless,"I never gave up on night bus. Along with glo-fi, seapunk, witch house, and a host of other disyllabic hashtags, ""night bus"" was derided during the great microgenre boom of the early 2010s—irrefutable evidence, it was thought, of the Internet's insistence upon inter-genre incest. But unlike a lot of its contemporaries, night bus was never as easy to define as influence + influence or adjective + genre. Named after a Burial track but as easily applied to the music of 50 Cent, Tim Hecker, the Eurythmics, the xx, and Vangelis, night bus was more a tone or a mood than a genre in and of itself. It was often categorized as midtempo, minimalist post-dubstep—trip-hop, sort of—but its proponents always stretched it to more disparate moods and eras. As someone drawn to those touchpoints, it was nice to finally have a name for it all, an easy-enough way to connect Björk, ""Twin Peaks"", and Birdman. The Canadian electronic producer CFCF, too, has always been attached to night bus—he was a frequent poster on the message boards that birthed the term, and his 2010 mix Do U Like Night Bus helped crystallize the breadth of music to which it might be applied. He has, in the intervening years, stretched that mixtape into a trilogy of nocturnal, reflective volumes, including last November's Night Bus 3, which was knowingly subtitled ""Death of Night Bus"", as if in acknowledgment that, yea, all microgenres must pass. This is probably just as well. A couple years after its invention, night bus is the last standing of its contemporaries—and yet CFCF will not let it go softly. Even his proper studio records can feel like academic experiments within the night bus aesthetic, further defying its easy categorization by leaning into its applications in quiet storm (Outside) or minimalism (Music for Objects). All of which is to say that, while the largely acoustic, ambient Radiance and Submission is the furthest afield CFCF's projects have ever gotten from his midtempo electronic roots, it still feels of a piece with his discography. The mood remains nocturnal, even if the bus has made its way out of the city and now rattles through a pitch-black desert. This is sparse, windswept music, full of warm, circling guitar plucks, gathering echoes, and long, slow fades. Like all of CFCF's music, it is exquisite in its details, as when the haze of cicadas buzzing throughout ""Tethered in Dark"" finds a rhythm in a palm-muted riff, all before receding back into the fog of circling insects. There are surprises, too, if subtle ones: ""La Soufrière"" begins with a similar naturalistic buzz, but halfway through blooms into something startlingly songlike. It's one of the shortest tracks on a short album, but, as with recent short-players by Earl Sweatshirt and Thundercat, Radiance and Submission holds together thanks to the clarity of its vision. This patient, almost painterly approach to songcraft has always defined CFCF's work, which might on other records have faded in instead with soft synthesizers before five minutes of smart, pulsing boom-bap. Over 60 minutes, this meticulousness could all feel a bit too polished, but Radiance and Submission bucks that by forming itself entirely out of the interstitial moments. The establishing shots and denouements of his compositions are here turned into the raw material for something strange and fascinating and (for him, at least) new. He has mentioned Chris Marker's indescribable film travelogue Sans Soleil as an influence in the past, and its compositional method—the reassemblage of the periphery into a focal point—could well be part of it. Night bus was always about intermediary spaces, anyway: a long trip home from a club, an overnight journey spent staring out the window. If there's a through line to the musical works we categorize with the term, it's their quiet ability to transform these lonely moments, to make a pair of headphones not a way of shutting out the world but of letting it in.","The largely acoustic, ambient Radiance and Submission is the furthest afield Canadian producer CFCF's projects have ever gotten from his midtempo electronic roots, but it still feels of a piece with his discography.

Time? Astonishing!,Kool KeithL'Orange,by: Mosi Reeves,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7813d197565213a2af/1:1/w_160/df0c2a62.png,2015-07-23 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20817-time-astonishing/,Mello Music Group,"The North Carolina producer L'Orange has spent the last few years slowly building a signature sound, rooted in the past yet wholly his own. You can trace a line between his MPC rips of vinyl back to Madlib's zonked-out tapestries on Madvillainy, and Daedelus' surrealist lounge music for The Weather. But over the past few years, and especially in 2015 through projects like The Night Took Us In Like Family (the latter made with L.A. rapper Jeremiah Jae), the man who bears the same name as Gilbert Bécaud's 1964 French chanson has cobbled something unique. On his best work, he stacks his snatches of vocals into something approaching a narrative, adding bebop and exotica tones and keeping rhythmic tension from slumping. His second project this year finds him collaborating with Kool Keith on Time? Astonishing! Structurally, it's an adventure, heavy on vague metaphysics and B-movie ramblings about space travel. One of its charms is hearing L'Orange adapt his sound to fit the mercurial Kool Keith's style. He abandons the ornamental quirkiness of The Night in favor of yearning melodies, like the melancholy guitar loop of ""Twenty Fifty Three"", or the choral harmony and dusty jazz piano od ""Meanwhile Back Home"". The vocal samples are still there, though. On ""This New World"", he layers ""underwater"" effects onto a snippet of Flavor Flav asking, ""What goes on?"" and makes it resemble an outtake from Parliament's ""Aqua Boogie"". As for Mr. Keith, listeners will note parallels to his vaunted Dr. Octagonecologyst, especially when it comes to the bludgeoning, Automator-inspired bass thump of ""Dr. Bipolar"". However, Time might hew closer to Keith's criminally underrated 2006 collaboration with Tom C, Project Polaroid, which also found him speaking in a halting delivery, underlining the weight of his words. Here, it seems as if he's floating through the music, then going silent as it swirls around him. His restrained performance pays the most dividends on ""The Wanderer"", where he bends together incongruent images in his familiar Bronx drawl: ""The structure of combat is like Wrestlemania contracts/ Genetics make the eye contact/ Shaggy mister boom back denim/ I have nothing to prove in slacks."" Then there's his bizarre battle rap on ""I Need Out of This World"": ""Come again if you're a male with a fitted wearing a toupee/ I can get you an inside job wearing daishikis."" Keith's deliberate opacity and ""upper-class penmanship"" is trailed by a panoply of guests. On ""The Traveler"", he drops a tantalizing verse—""See the cerebrum, how fast I'm passin'""—and then cedes the spotlight to J-Live, who ""disappear like I never here."" Mr. Lif hijacks ""Twenty Fifty Three"" with Boston-accented super-scientifical madness. Open Mike Eagle tackles ""Meanwhile, Back Home"" alone, with Keith nowhere to be heard. Blu, MC Paul Barman (of all people), and MindsOne—individually, they range from serviceable to splendid. But cumulatively, they distract from the chemistry between the album's two main performers. Then again, perhaps Kool Keith and L'Orange are satisfied with conjuring a mood of amusingly hallucinatory hip-hop that lasts just over 30 minutes, and then evaporates like a pleasurable high. Whether it will be remembered as Time passes remains to be seen.","The North Carolina producer L'Orange's latest project finds him collaborating with Kool Keith.

Star Wars,Wilco,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af94b1335d7bf1699f79/1:1/w_160/f81f39b6.jpg,2015-07-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20838-star-wars/,dBpm,"Jeff Tweedy leads a band of escape artists—""ex-Uncle Tupelo,"" ""alt-country,"" ""dad rock"" are all boxes from which Wilco has managed to break free. Their most recent restraint has proven trickier because it essentially translates to ""Wilco"". Between the self-conscious retromania of Wilco (The Album) and the self-produced, self-released The Whole Love, their last two LPs strove for comprehensiveness, containment, cohesion. They were rightly received as ""Wilco being Wilco"" and offered ""something for everyone"" except potential new listeners, drawing boundaries around their old ideas. In a concrete way, Wilco’s ninth studio LP Star Wars is their most accessible and least demanding, a free download equalizing the Wilco evangelist and those who swore they’d never pay one red cent for their music.  Star Wars is also Wilco’s shortest and least agenda-driven album since their debut, two things that actually lend it a novelty that endures beyond its instantaneous release. For its first minute or so, Star Wars sounds like a record Wilco might have been required to give away for free. The skronking opener ""EKG"" has drawn valid comparisons to both Sonic Youth to AIDS Wolf, though it’s one of Wilco’s least jarring experiments in instrumental noise—compare it to the 15-minute migraine simulation of ""Less Than You Think"" or ""Poor Places"" submerging in a drowning pool of static and ""EKG"" is downright charming. It’s the first thing you might expect to hear from a band trying to familiarize themselves with each other after their longest break between records. It’s playful rather than confrontational, deflates any kind of self-importance projected on the band, and aligns with the $0 asking price, lawsuit-baiting title, and feline cover art—this record is loose, low-stakes, and fun, adjectives that no one has used to describe Wilco since Being There. That’s something of a feint. Star Wars bears many signifiers of an off-the-cuff recording—the second-longest track is 3:50, and most are filled with all manner of ""what’s this pedal do?"" sound effects. The topsy-turvy glam-folk of ""More…"" becomes cemented in thick distortion, a theremin-like squeal seeps through the otherwise subdued ""Taste the Ceiling"", ""Where Do I Begin"" backflips into a coda of reversed drums. But think back on a decade of Wilco songs that regularly rode triple-guitar soloing past five minutes and ask if Star Wars is really the sound of them jamming. This is Wilco at their most concise and airtight; the frayed edges, loose wires, and sonic pockmarks are all considered decisions coming from a group of technical wizards with unconventional tastes that treat post-production like a tattoo artist, engaging in very detailed and skillful defacement. Any discernible influence is unlikely, but Star Wars could be heard as a long-awaited convergence with Spoon, the band who overtook Wilco as America’s most reliable and subtly inventive band in the studio. As with Transference or Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, Star Wars scans as pop songwriting and rock music, though devoid of blunt force and obsessed with tactility, right down to the word choices. As with ""War on War"" and ""Impossible Germany"", ""Random Name Generator"" takes a phonetically catchy, abstruse phrase and repeats it until it becomes an unshakeable hook. It’s a veritable sonic topographic map, every single instrument close mic’d and enlarged to show texture: Tweedy’s comforting and disheveled vocals are audio two-day stubble, drums get dipped in bristling flange, you can pick out exactly which pedals on Nels Cline’s effects board are being used. Star Wars quickly develops its sonic character, and if it must have a label, ""mini-rock"" suffices. For one thing, these are the most compact and aerodynamic Wilco songs, aligning with a host of new-to-them glam precedents who punctured rock’s chest-puffing machismo. The pinched EQ’ing and stylishly sheared fuzz riffs of ""Random Name Generator"" tips a top hat to T. Rex; the Suicide-al ""Pickled Ginger"" removes the ""blues"" from 12-bar blues and replaces it with post-punk rigidity and blacked-out negative space; ""You Satellite"" continuously wraps itself in seemingly endless layers of high-thread count bedsheets, recalling the unsavory reveries of Velvet Underground. And while nothing on Star Wars can cut you into ribbons the way ""Via Chicago"" or ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"" or ""At Least That’s What You Said"", it's piercing and subtle enough to get under your skin. Compared to the sadsack reflections on domestication of Sky Blue Sky, Star Wars strikes at a kind of empty nester fatalism signified by the ""separate, but together"" connection of ""Where Do I Begin"", or, more succinctly—""We’re so alone/ We’re never alone."" The narrative of Star Wars is driven by a fluid mix of devotion, commitment, and stubbornness, three qualities that are related but not synonymous. ""I could never leave behind the part of me that you refuse,"" is the sort of thing you might hear from a couple who are comfortable enough to snipe at one another, while, ""Why can’t we tell when we’re in hell?/ Why can’t I say something to make you well?"" speaks to the desperation underlying most prickly jokes. ""Taste the Ceiling"" hard-sells the LP’s most important lyric, the one that attests to unusual urgency of Star Wars: ""Why do our disasters always creep so slowly into view?"" Perhaps disasters are always in the frame, but judging from the communication failures and speakers-speaking-in-code that goes on here, it's more likely they don't get called for what they are until its too late. While you never can really tell with a lyricist as cryptic and elliptical as Tweedy, Star Wars hints at a congruence between his own cautious confessions and Wilco’s sensible risks—while this could just be a dry run for a conventionally released ""event"", the fact that they're challenging themselves is rewarding enough on its own. Though Sky Blue Sky was met with the coolest reception of any Wilco album, it’s the one that remains the most interesting since A Ghost Is Born—like every record from Wilco’s elite run that spanned the kaleidoscopic roots-rock archive of Being There to A Ghost Is Born’s abstract Americana, it was fully committed to an idea Wilco hadn’t tried before. Because Wilco sounds about 85% committed to a truly new idea, Star Wars is their strongest record in a decade; and if Wilco have another truly great one in them, history strongly suggests it’ll be devoted to sounding nothing like Star Wars.","With its $0 asking price, lawsuit-baiting title, and feline cover art, Wilco's latest album is loose, low-stakes, and fun, adjectives that no one has used to describe Wilco since Being There.

Subjective Concepts,Strange Wilds,by: Corbin Reiff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6a9d034d5c69bf46f5/1:1/w_160/0c6e9a12.jpg,2015-07-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20806-subjective-concepts/,Sub Pop,"It’s very difficult to listen to the debut album from Strange Wilds and not think about Nirvana. As a punk rock trio based out of Olympia, Wash. signed to Sub Pop Records, the band can hardly escape the comparison, but the tendency is all the more irresistible given how closely they mirror the sound and aesthetic of Nirvana's earliest work. All of the key elements are present within the first 30 seconds of the opening track ""Pronoia"". A spongy, clean guitar sound, punched up with overdrive, thickened with a chorus pedal and a burbling  up-tempo bass riff packaged in the standard loud/quiet/loud framework. We’ve all tasted meals made from this particular recipe before. Subjective Concepts isn’t a bad record. It's well-produced, and the band clearly has a vision for the sound they want: The hard thwack of the drums sounds great, the bass keeps things punchy and taut, and the alternating clean and massively fuzzed out guitar tones are varied enough to keep things interesting. The problem is, their vision feels a little too clear, and far too often, you can almost hear the names of the bands—Sleater-Kinney, Mudhoney, the Melvins, and of course Nirvana—echoing in the heads of the band members as each song plays through. There are a few times when the overall dynamics of the song seems to get away from them. Singer Steve Serna has a tendency to slip into a speak/scream reminiscent of mid-'00s screamo bands like Asking Alexandria or Saosin. In those instances, like on ""Pareidolia"" and ""Egophilia"", the choruses become indecipherable battering rams that bludgeon the skull. Alternatively, ""Autothysis"" is perfectly understandable, but completely flat in the way it’s delivered; a monotone voice without any hint of insecurity, anger, or resentment drolly questioning an unnamed person ""do I look like him/ I bet I do, I do"" over and over again. The moments where the band breaks away from the expected become the real highlights. ""Lost and Found"" is the mostly oddly paced song on the record, featuring a genuinely weird, plodding drum break accented by random guitar stabbings before kicking into a screeching bridge section and flowing back into the chorus. Ten songs into an album where every dynamic shift feels like a bus arriving on schedule, the wrench thrown into the machine is a welcome reprieve. ""Don’t Have To"" is another gratifying mix-up, where the band dives past their late '80s/early '90s Pacific Northwest fixation into the foreboding tones of early Black Sabbath. In each case, the break from uniformity underscores how good Strange Wilds are at mimicking a specific sound, and how dutiful they are in doing it. They are a powerful outfit, and Subjective Concepts is cohesive and fierce. But there's a fine line between ""influenced by"" and ""outright derivative,"" and Strange Wilds chip away at it with each hit of their stomp pedal.","As a punk rock trio based out of Olympia, Wash. and signed to Sub Pop, Strange Wilds can hardly escape the comparison to Nirvana on their debut LP.

Mable,Spraynard,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af625e6ef95969321dbb/1:1/w_160/c4c370e0.jpg,2015-07-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20801-mable/,Jade Tree,"Pop punk exists to voice a narrow set of emotions, and per the Descendents, it's never supposed to ""grow up."" Still, you can move the furniture around a little, make some tweaks here and there. Spraynard's third album Mable does away with the sophomoric song titles (""Internet May Mays"", ""Are You Ladies Familiar with the Work of Zach and Cody""), paper-thin mixing, and pitchy vocals of past releases for a buttoned-up (but nonetheless boisterous) sound. With Mike Bardzik —a musician/producer known for his work with the Casualties and Everyone Everywhere —manning the boards, Spraynard’s punkish project has graduated from bedrooms and basements to a bigger stage. Lead singer Pat Graham is much more confident in his ability to hold a tune this time around: His nasally tenor is more grounded and melodically consistent, even on shoutier tracks like ""Bench"". As with peers such as Modern Baseball and Algernon Cadwallader, Spraynard cater to the awkward ones, the losers; as the album’s opening line puts it, boldly and matter-of-factly: ""I am every person that you’ve ever ignored/ I am the flaming bag of dog shit on your porch."" Embedded as nostalgic groupthink and suburban malaise may be within the modern pop-punk blueprint, Spraynard's sonic and lyrical concerns are less successful when they toe the tropes. ""Lost Boys"" is the perfunctory nihilistic ditty about ""fuck[ing] up just for the hell of it,"" ""Pond"" the romanticized portrait of a hometown haunt. As with Modern Baseball’s You’re Gonna Miss It All and Man Overboard's Real Talk, (ostensibly) female subjects are recurrently portrayed as thorny, shallow subjects oblivious to the pain they inflict. ""I asked you to hang/ You just looked away,"" Graham whines on ""Out of Body"", ""I’ve got nothing to say/ I think I want to die."" Heartbreak and social rejection are two of pop punk's lyrical cornerstones, sure, but lyrics like the aforementioned couplet—or ""Medicine""'s awkward likening of a lover to sleeping pills—tread dangerously close to self-pitying excess. Graham ultimately spends more time looking inward than outward on Mable*,* and it’s these reflections that constitute its crux, as well as its biggest source of interest. On cuts like ""Buried"", the warm guitars, ""woah oh"" choruses, and peppy rhythms obfuscate suffocating feelings of agoraphobia and anxiety. ""Pond"" takes a Sisyphean glance into the mirror—""I hate my own body, but I am fucking lazy/ I sit here wanting change but just keep doing the damn thing""—only to shrug it off with a silver-lined retort: ""What’s the use in trying to survive if we don’t do what makes us feel alive?"" There are a few melodramatic stumbling blocks, and some painfully awkward moments, but melodrama and awkwardness sort of come with the anthemic-pop-punk territory. Spraynard serve up endearing honesty within the crucible of FM-friendly pop punk, and their music is better suited for long summer drives than late-night mope sessions; it’s introspective, but also accessible. Mable might not be a knock out of the park—""Bench"" sounds like lukewarm Weezer, and the five-minute ""Out of Body"" seems out of place—but it might be one the catchiest sets of pessimist punk songs since Fireworks’ Oh, Common Life.","Spraynard serve up endearing honesty within the crucible of FM-friendly pop punk, and their music is better suited for long summer drives than late-night mope sessions; it’s introspective, but also accessible.

Even if you believe Bonte's assertion on ""Perfect"" that, ""Summer is the shortest season/ It's up to you and me to give it meaning,"" individual days tend to feel long and languid and listless. This much comes across in the way Stay Wild fixates on a single, simple situation that can stretch out infinitely. ""Phone"" is exactly what it sets out to be, a jilted complaint about the obvious irony of an iPhone being used for everything except its primary purpose: ""Is it too much for you to pick it up/ When we both know you never put it down?"" Bonte allows himself the luxury of dejection worth wallowing in, but these down moments allow for a bounce-back. On Stay Wild’s more spirited tracks, Bonte give voice to the emotions hinted at by ""You Can"", a striking single from last year’s Hiding EP. ""You Can"" had almost nothing in the way of intelligible lyrics, though it certainly sounded like drunken memories of either a rave or a massive sporting event. Something major definitely happened. Little on Stay Wild brings to mind that song's blissful levitation—the album as a whole is more grounded. Still, it holds true to Bonte’s request on ""Perfect"": the record isn’t likely to inspire the action itself, but rather the subsequent reflection that gave it meaning.","Stay Wild is more of a mood piece than a soundtrack for mood swings, an album where everything is fed through the same sun-dazed, saturated prism. But Tearjerker remains a rock band, just one that works up a slow, steady sweat.

Infinite Dissolution,Locrian,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aefec0084474cd0c19c6/1:1/w_160/8d30d8c5.jpg,2015-07-22 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20724-infinite-dissolution/,Relapse,"The more music Locrian create, the less sense the metallurgists seem to make: That is the implicit lesson of Infinite Dissolution, the most adventurous and accessible album the once-prohibitively esoteric band have ever made. During these nine tracks, they buoy black metal with kaleidoscopic guitar solos and punctuate cinematic three-piece suites with transfixing synthesizer serenades. Screamed anthems find and then finesse an unexpected threshold between post-metal and post-punk, while some of the band’s most grim vocals ever provide the friction against their most gorgeous and warm musical setting to date. With Infinite Dissolution, Locrian continue a series of impressionistic explorations devoted to apocalyptic apprehension—or ""hymn[s] to the deluge,"" as they put it at one point here. Somehow, though, these soundtracks to oblivion come to feel redemptive and even empowering, like torches made only to work in the most extreme dark. For half of their career, Locrian were a duo whose hard-shelled hybrids of harsh noise textures and heavy metal structures felt compelling but often stable. Terrence Hannum and André Foisy built bleak expanses of brutal sound, where considerations about technical and cultural obsolescence fought through sheets of dissonance and walls of distortion. Their recordings were aggressive and ruminative, less concerned with acute crescendos than cumulative atmosphere. But in 2010, for the album Crystal World, Locrian enlisted Steven Hess, a Chicago improviser with a long and impressive résumé of collaborative electronic abstraction. The moment was an oxbow: Locrian’s ideas crystallized around the skeleton of Hess’ drums, and their music began to take new shapes and gather sudden speed. Urgency and bravado entered their vocabulary. By the time Locrian issued their full-length Relapse debut, 2013’s Return to Annihilation, the trio were able to talk about the influence of Genesis and make music that offered up evidence. Despite Locrian’s doomsday obsessions, *Infinite Dissolution—*much like the last five years of Locrian at large—depends upon a wide-eyed sense of musical wonder. Locrian’s evolution has hinged less on a refinement of their style and more on an expansion of it, so that new influences and impulses operate inside of their general roar. This spirit is obvious from the start of Infinite Dissolution, which exposes facets and folds of Locrian that never before seemed to exist. The brilliant opener ""Arc of Extinction"" begins like a Locrian creeper of not so long ago, with piercing noise and saturating tones shaping a broad drone. Powered by Hess, though, the song steadily escalates, moving from a slow-motion march into a sustained sprint of blast beats. Locrian have touched on black metal before, but here, they perfectly tuck it into their past. The speed animates the animosity. The tumult counters a guitar solo so bright it seems excised from a Rainbow record. The effect is both beautiful and frightening, much like the lyrics of death and rebirth that Hannum sends into the squall. The brief poem at the center of ""Arc of Extinction"" highlights another crucial element of Locrian’s evolution, because you can barely hear Hannum. Instead, his words are massaged deep into the mix, so that they are part of a whole and not its obvious leading edge. Likewise, during the strangely triumphant ""The Great Dying"", the obvious vocal hook yields the foreground to the band, the chant becoming the de facto bass for a band without one. After a decade together, Hannum and Foisy have erased many of the boundaries between their electronics and electric guitars, their synthesizers and their manipulated shouts. During the dénouement of ""KXL I"", for instance, the strangled riff, static-caked vocals, and screeching circuits congeal into one righteous din, a single symphony of terror. Hess has not only learned their logic but also enhanced it. In the past, ""Heavy Water"" might have been a formless cloud of hazy effects and echoing glissandos, but he gives the record’s cold comedown a pulse and purpose. During Infinite Dissolution, Locrian make very involved music seem effortless, allowing the sound to support the emotion rather than overpower it. That’s what they’ve tried to do for a decade. In their salad days, Locrian seemed to issue new music constantly. A stream of seven-inches, CD-Rs and cassettes arrived one after another, as though Hannum and Foisy had nowhere else to be for five years. But Hess joined the band, and Hannum split Chicago for Baltimore. The complicated schedule and the precipitously slower pace have been boons for Locrian. They have had time to incorporate new touchstones without letting them overrun the band, and they have had time to approach each additional layer with diligence. There is so much pressure to speed up as a band these days, to not give any bit of online notoriety an instant to disappear. But Locrian chose to slow down and create consecutive meticulous albums. They are isolated and involved worlds of sound—safe, as one song suggests, from our own ""wreckage of a mighty dream.""","Infinite Dissolution is the most adventurous and accessible album the once-prohibitively esoteric band Locrian has ever made. On it, they create soundtracks to oblivion that feel redemptive and even empowering.

Dirty Sprite 2,Future,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6f5e6ef95969321dd1/1:1/w_160/3d56dd9d.jpg,2015-07-22 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20810-dirty-sprite-2/,EpicFree Bandz,"The same week Future announced the release date for Dirty Sprite 2, his third official retail release, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft completed the first-ever flyby of Pluto. Its data has been revealing the dwarf planet as an icy, complicated world, still in geological flux, marked by a bright, heart-shaped feature in the center of much darker terrain. It’s not just an apt parallel for the rapper, who named his expectation-defying debut after the misunderstood planet: it’s the ultimate symbol for the latest and most relevant phase of Future’s career. The stars have never been more uncannily aligned for the man born Nayvadius Wilburn, the reigning king of Atlanta who’s deployed a trilogy of album-quality mixtapes since last October to recapture some of the goodwill lost as he’s figured out what kind of artist he wanted to be over the past three years. There’s been a backlash against sophomore album Honest in the past year—even Future has distanced himself from the project, which he released before the ugly demise of his relationship with ex-fiancée Ciara. But Honest wasn’t a bad album by any means; it was just confused. It was obvious Future was being tugged in too many directions at once: the sledgehammer street bangers, the poignant lone ranger ballads, the big-name collabs with Kanye and Pharrell. The album’s emotional nucleus was ""I Be U"", the ex-romantic’s most stunning love song to date. But it was no coincidence that it saw Future learning to empathize with his partner by literally becoming her, projecting himself onto her being (compare it to the similarly-titled but far less resonant bonus track ""I’ll Be Yours""). He was caught between dissonant identities: the wide-screen romantic who made songs with Miley Cyrus, and the hustler from Little Mexico, Zone 6, who flirted with death on record. ""I think I lost my heartbeat for a second and a half,"" he chanted dispassionately on the title track of Dirty Sprite, the 2011 mixtape to which DS2 nods with its title. ""Tried to make me a pop star, and they made a monster,"" Future snarls on ""I Serve the Base"", a skuzzy, fiendish track that busts down DS2’s doors early, its Metro Boomin beat built around what sounds like a sacrificial lamb’s last minutes of life. That pivot from hero to villain is the album’s central conceit, the culmination of the journey from Monster’s wounded hedonism to the numb howl of 56 Nights. The cruel irony is that Future was great at being a pop star, at least in a mercenary sense; Pluto, with its glossy ballads about looking for love with a flashlight, remains one of the best major label rap debuts of the last five years. But he remained visibly uncomfortable in the spotlight, stepping out in matching designer with Ciara like Atlanta’s begrudging Montague. There is no such self-consciousness on DS2. Its universe is bleak and unforgiving, a redemption story for a man who is certain it’s too late for his soul to be redeemed; instead of a triumphal arc, we burrow deeper and deeper into Future’s dystopia. Before we hear his voice at all, on intro track ""Thought It Was a Drought"", we hear the slosh of codeine stirred into soda, the dull snap of ice cubes crackling in styrofoam. The only songs that resemble anything like radio hits are mostly pre-released and relegated to the bonus tracks (""Fuck Up Some Commas"", ""Trap Niggas""), and the only feature is Drake, who does a commendably bitter Future impression on ""Where Ya At"". There is no room for misinterpretation: Future does not want to be your role model. This is music for nihilists, for the reckless, for those who embrace darkness because they don’t see another option. With his run of post-Honest releases, Future has made it clear who he would like to speak for, and who he is no longer interested in courting, and his recent work is an obvious gesture towards his day-one fanbase who supported him pre-Pluto. Most of the production is handled by Metro Boomin and 808 Mafia’s Southside, with a few appearances from Zaytoven and a small handful of Atlanta trap mainstays. All these guys have an obvious synergy with Future, with whom they’ve worked for years, and their chemistry provides a cohesiveness and clarity of vision missing from his previous two albums. But as a stylist and a technical rapper, Future’s operating on a level unmatched in his five-year discography, early mixtapes and all. As a storyteller, he’s evolved considerably, his lyrics crystallizing into a specific poetry. ""A product of them roaches in them ashtrays/ I inhale the love on a bad day/ Baptized inside purple actavis,"" he raps on ""I Serve the Base"". Miniscule yet significant details come into crisp focus, like a series of tightly framed, disorienting closeups. On ""Kno the Meaning"", which doubles as an oral history of the Beast Mode and 56 Nights tapes, we meet his Uncle Ronnie who washed cars and Uncle Don who robbed banks, snapshots of the men he once looked up to. Future was always straightforward, never ashamed to confess his depression or infatuation, but the narratives never felt so focused, nuanced, or vulnerable than here. Lucidity is a poignant theme in his recent work, since he seems to be constantly seeking to escape it. For Future, razor-sharp memory is a curse, one that even month-long benders cannot break. (He spells this out on ""Hardly"", one of Monster’s more underrated tracks; ""Hardly, hardly, hardly forget anything,"" he croaks, obsessing over moments with a deceased friend.) Thus is the strange and singular beauty of DS2, as ugly as its themes may be: it is at once detail-oriented and hazy, painfully coherent while advocating against coherence, creating an atmosphere like club spotlights piercing through fog machine and blunt smoke, or the beam of a lighthouse searching in the dark for a shipwreck. This dissonance creates the album’s essential tension between what Future literally describes and what he truly feels. ""I pour two zips/ I’m feeling way better,"" he crows on swirling, melodramatic ""Slave Master"". ""Way better,"" here, is fraught with subtext—the transcendent but fleeting relief of giving in to temptation. This isn’t an album that giddily champions substance abuse as a rock star trait, as his Future Hendrix persona once may have. Reckless drug talk and boilerplate trap themes are undercut by incessant bitterness, loathing, and nausea. ""God blessing all the trap niggas"" is more than just a shout-out to people who grew up like he did, it’s a sincere plea. ""I know the devil is real,"" he promises on ""Blood on the Money"", one of the album’s most stunning productions, somehow austere and baroque at the same damn time. Future thumbs through blood-stained bills, reminded of the life from which he ascended but can’t ever really escape, as much as he may have tried.","Dirty Sprite 2 brushes aside the pop overtures of Future's sophomore album Honest. Building off a powerful three-mixtape comeback run, DS2 is bleak and unforgiving, a redemption story for a man who is certain it’s too late for his soul to be redeemed; instead of a triumphal arc, we burrow deeper and deeper into Future’s dystopian universe.

Snooty Garbagemen,Snooty Garbagemen,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af569d034d5c69bf46da/1:1/w_160/bf7d7ff6.png,2015-07-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20792-snooty-garbagemen/,12XU,"Garage rock purists might rejoice at the presence of the Snooty Garbagemen. They appeal to a slightly older garage sensibility, before the cherubic sweetness of Burger Records, crystallized in early-2000s Detroit bands like the Piranhas and Clone Defects. The Texan trio's eponymous debut feels unwieldy and fetid, proudly brainless, and committed to the primacy of a punchy rhythm section and seething guitar riffs. Snooty Garbagemen's opener is a statement of intent: a minute and a half of rollicking drums and a careening riff that renders the usual vocabulary of chords and strumming inadequate. Lots of rock records use fidelity and effects as an off-putting hide, but few make guitars sound so unnatural and ingratiating at once: they are warm and full, but in a gross way. The guitar tone feels less like something picked out on steel strings than some mutant extension of singer Tom Triplett's rancorous vocals. The only way for Snooty Garbagemen to feel any woozier, you might think, is for it to go backwards, which happens on ""Cigarette Juice"", an album highlight. The Sandlot's classic tilt-a-whirl puke scene is set to the Champs' sinister and weirdly vindictive instrumental ""Tequila""; ""Cigarette Juice"" could soundtrack the remake for regressing adults, which would inevitably star Johnny Knoxville. That sort of lumpen idiocy is a good look for Snooty Garbagemen, a trio drunk on the gospel of I ain't gonna wanna whose lyrics reflect the hostility of a petulant brat. Triplett is hysterically incredulous on ""Superman"" and exhausted with everything ""lame"" and ""so fucking dumb"" on ""I Quit"". ""I Can't Find My Keys"" features choice lines like, ""This happens every morning/ This happens all too frequently,"" whinnied out with such feverish despair that they teeter into comedy. Triplett's Cro-Magnon missives attack relatable, quotidian annoyances with the outsized rage that we're all compelled to repress in polite society. ""Don't Know to Play Guitar"" is the big stroke of irony. Triplett hails from OBN IIIs and Real Energy, among many other bands, drummer Josh Wolf plays guitar in the Secret Prostitutes (and dons a massive ""Rock N Roll Nightmare"" chest tattoo), and recently-departed bassist Manie Chen is likewise steeped in Texan punk circles. Snooty Garbagemen is a venerable power-trio, attuned to one another's rhythmic lurches and assaultive physicality with a nuance that's unique to journeyman players. It's what makes this fairly straight-ahead rock'n'roll full-length engaging from start-to-finish. That ensemble feel, rather than its air of ferocity, is also what distinguishes Snooty Garbagemen from its peers, past and present. And nowhere is plain proficiency more evident than in Triplett's guitar solos, which stand out as rather beautiful and inspired against their ugly backdrop, like some sort of uncannily resilient butterfly flitting up from a trash heap.","Snooty Garbagemen appeal to a slightly older garage sensibility, crystallized in early-2000s Detroit bands like the Piranhas and Clone Defects.

White Reaper Does It Again,White Reaper,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af58c0084474cd0c1a6b/1:1/w_160/eeda9002.jpg,2015-07-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20794-white-reaper-does-it-again/,Polyvinyl,"The Dickies are a great band: trailblazing, deceptively sophisticated, vastly enjoyable, and wholly underrated. It's hard to imagine White Reaper not sharing this opinion. White Reaper Does It Again, the cheekily titled debut album by the young, Louisville-spawned foursome, traffics in much of the same elements that the Dickies pioneered in the late '70s: bouncy pop-punk underpinned with classic songcraft; hockey-rink-ready keyboards. In particular, White Reaper's singer/guitarist Tony Esposito sings almost exactly like the Dickies' Leonard Graves Phillips, all stuffy-nosed sneers and bubblegum-blowing vowels. Luckily, the Dickies aren't the only influence on Does It Again—nor does the album's derivativeness in any way dampen its snotty, romantic charisma. On ""Friday the 13th""—the only song on the album in a minor key—an ominous opening by keyboardist Ryan Hater sets the tone for a campy horror-meets-new-wave mash-up. And on ""Candy"", Esposito and company splice in some Sweet-style glam-rock swagger. ""On Your Mind"" even goes so far as to directly lift the melody from the original power-pop wellspring: The Who's ""The Kids Are Alright"". It's all pulled off credibly, though, with plenty of perspiration and wild-eyed reverence poured into the pastiche. Bassist Sam Wilkerson and drummer Nick Wilkerson are brothers, and rhythm is clearly in their DNA; ""Wolf Trap Hotel"" simply rages, shearing off all subtlety in a flurry of adenoids and adrenaline. But even when things get as breakneck as they do on ""B.T.K."", Esposito's hooks are piercing, precise, and endearing. And when, on the slower, more supple ""Sheila"", he lets himself cut loose, his vocals approach full-on croon. Barring a couple of forgettable, filler-feeling tracks like ""Don't You Think I Know?"", the biggest drawback of Does It Again is the production. It doesn't sound bad, but the washed-out reverb and pushed-to-the-front keyboard creates a distance that the band sounds like they are constantly fighting to push through. Songs this punchy should land effortlessly. Still, Esposito's yearning and dissatisfaction come through clearly: ""I've got it bad, you know/ Give me a double dose,"" he sings on ""Pills"", and it doesn't matter what he's singing about. It's our job to fill in that blank. White Reaper knows how to work that ambiguity, just as its navigates its unabashed influences to locate that perfect midpoint between ""nerd"" and ""numbskull.""","The Louisville-based foursome White Reaper traffic in bouncy pop-punk, full of stuffy-nosed sneers and bubblegum-blowing vowels, that recall classic acts like the Dickies.

The Blade,Ashley Monroe,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af7213d197565213a2a2/1:1/w_160/7c841bb9.jpg,2015-07-21 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20813-the-blade/,Warner Music Group,"In retrospect, it was inevitable that Ashley Monroe would re-record ""Has Anybody Ever Told You?"" The song has been in her repertoire for nearly a decade, and has long been her signature tune. She first recorded it back in the late '00s, when she was an upstart from Knoxville and when Nashville had even less time for young female singer-songwriters than it does now. Monroe had signed to Sony, which in a no-faith vote had released her debut, 2009's Satisfied, digitally instead of physically. Soon, she would be on her own again. Many artists might have simply disappeared, but Monroe simply switched her career GPS to take her down less-traveled industry routes: performing on the Ten Out of Tenn tour in 2009 (which featured ten emerging singer-songwriters from the Volunteer State), recording an EP with Trent Dabbs, working with Jack White on a Raconteurs single and a Wanda Jackson album, and forming a supergroup called the Pistol Annies with friends Angaleena Presley and Miranda Lambert. So, by the time she re-signed with a major, Monroe had re-established herself as a cult commodity in Nashville, and her ascendency looked certain. In 2013, she released what amounts to a comeback, Like a Rose, one of the best country albums of this decade. The history of ""Has Anybody Ever Told You?"" also shows how Monroe's conception of country music has remained constant throughout all the professional twists and turns. Her original was spare and direct, with as few instruments as possible to get the point across, but the version on her new album The Blade is fuller and denser. It sounds made by someone with many more resources at her disposal, yet it retains its stateliness, its essential intimacy. Even with more musicians involved, Monroe makes the song sound like a whispered exchange between the listener and herself—less a profession of desire than a reassuring embrace. The old song fits perfectly on the new album, which is less about the vagaries of relationships than the trauma of their aftermath. As such, it may not have the immediacy of Like a Rose, which was all about finding and asserting your identity both professionally and personally. Yet The Blade has its own specific character, its own set of concerns, even if it does take Monroe a few songs to settle into the album. Opener ""On to Something Good"" is a statement of unflinching optimism by an artist who might have succumbed to bitterness ages ago. The title track hinges on a devastating break-up metaphor: ""You caught it by the handle, and I caught it by the blade."" Rather than belt that line, Monroe wisely dials it back, sounding like she is already getting on with living with the hurt. The theme of The Blade isn't the wound, but the salve. As such, some listeners new to country music—enticed by the success of recent efforts by Kacey Musgraves, Brandy Clark, and Presley—might write off songs like ""Weight of the Load"" and ""From Time to Time"" as platitudes, the kind you might find on sympathy cards. Country, however, does these sentiments better than most genres, and the best country makes extroversion sound compassionate and humane. When Monroe is singing about her own travails, as she does on the upbeat ""Winning Streak"" (which is actually about losing) or the satisfyingly dark ""Dixie"", she manages to convey a very specific and detailed perspective, to suggest a very real human being within the song. Like so many country albums, especially recent ones by Monroe's friend and bandmate Miranda Lambert, The Blade could be stronger if it was more streamlined and sequenced with some kind of overarching narrative in mind, but that's almost beside the point when the album sounds so damn good. Once again Monroe worked with Vince Gill and veteran engineer Justin Niebank, and together they hint at pop directions while never abandoning classic country traditions. This is country music for headphones, intricate and inventive and endlessly detailed. A looped beat opens ""From Time to Time"" with a rigid meter, but it loosens up gradually until it recalls something recorded decades ago at Muscle Shoals. On ""Winning Streak"" Monroe is joined by what sounds like the ghosts of the Ray Conniff Singers, egging her on toward disaster. And perhaps that's the secret to Monroe's longevity in a cutthroat business where radio rules and women are dismissed as ""tomatoes"": Digging in its past, she still finds sneaky ways to point towards country's future.","Ashley Monroe is a country singer with a peripatetic career: She has worked with Jack White in the Raconteurs, with Wanda Jackson, and belongs to the trio Pistol Annies with Miranda Lambert and Angaleena Presley. She follows up her strong 2013 comeback LP Like a Rose with another collection of songs that hint at pop but remain rooted in classic country traditions.

Seraph,Mas Ysa,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af31ea9e61561daa63eb/1:1/w_160/d74e3834.png,2015-07-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20766-seraph/,Downtown,"Before Thomas Arsenault even had a note of music available online, he turned eyes and ears with gripping, show-stealing solo performances while opening for Deerhunter in 2013. He appeared to fit the new archetype for super-sincere singer-songwriters, hunched over synths rather than an acoustic guitar, forgoing stationary strumming for something as emotive physically as it is vocally. The elite in this small class all have a defining characteristic that comes close to being a superpower—Tom Krell's facility with R&B, James Blake's composure, Autre Ne Veut's dramatic flair, and so forth. Arsenault's persona is still predicated on him really meaning every word he says. His dominant mode is aerobic '80s synth-pop reshot in HD, overlain by vocals that are confrontational in either a hypothermic quaver or a full-chested bellow. Arsenault shuttles between these two poles during his major-label debut Seraph, though it never seems as if he's trying to skew one way or the other. Therein lies its appeal, the way it feels both exhausting and unplanned, one guy speaking his truth directly and on impulse. Seraph doesn't feel quite as singular as 2014's Worth EP—the vocal volatility and disorienting dynamics that distinguished ""Shame"" are portioned out to individual tracks and there is no longer a clear distinction between ""proper songs"" and shorter ""interludes"". But what Seraph forfeits in immediate impact is compensated for with range. Arsenault proves adept in a number of styles—zero-gravity M83 balladry (""Sick""), a surprising turn towards mid-'00s drum-circle indie (""Running""), and a pounding EDM instrumental that actually provides relief at Seraph's center. There are also a handful of coed duets that provide welcome contrast and perspective—Hundred Waters' Nicole Miglis guests on the dramatic split-screen soliloquy of ""Gun"", whereas the back-and-forth of ""I Have Some"" is as close as Seraph gets to unabashed fun. Seraph might be shifty, but Arsenault still works with blunt force. The opening title track barely has a melody, both Arsenault's voice and a thick synth shuddering like they're initiates of the Polar Bear Club. The spellbinding intensity is maintained on ""Margarita"", a plainspoken, heavenward plea for his mother to not die on him. He is a maximalist singer and a minimal lyricist, his words so terse and direct that when they hit awkwardly, they also do so loudly. This works against the lullabies which should provide the greatest impact—the grass is cut and so the gawky snake metaphors show on ""Garden"" and while the closing ""Don't Make"" is clearly heartfelt, it's too pushy to be touching. ""Suffer"" is the most aggressive and the most memorable track, and it's possible these two things are correlated. The song fuses the clenched-fist, down-strummed acoustic-electric guitars and leatherette drum pads of Twin Shadow's Confess with lyrics that read like a shitfaced text message —""I don't want another one/ I don't wanna learn nobody's touch/ She won't want to drink this much/ Fuck her,"" Arsenault biting down hard enough on the last two syllables to draw blood from his tongue. Arsenault has said that he's ""not proud of the person in that song"" and every time I hear it, I admire his audacity for even including it on Seraph. The mental state of ""Suffer"" is embarrassing and horrifying and Arsenault wisely forgoes any sort of apology or justification: Being in touch with your emotions doesn't mean you get to choose how you feel at all times, after all. Even if it's not a very healthy place to be for over four minutes, everyone has likely been there. And that appears to speak most emphatically to Seraph's aim—it doesn't intend to take you places, but rather to get inside your head and stun you right where you stand.","The multi-instrumentalist Thomas Arsenault (aka Mas Ysa) returns with a major-label debut that is more diverse than 2014's Worth EP, but retains its stunning emotional directness. The music succeeds in how it feels both exhausting and unplanned, one guy speaking his truth directly and on impulse.

Live at the Fillmore East October 4th & 5th 1968,Sly and the Family Stone,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af715e6ef95969321dd9/1:1/w_160/b3c06718.jpg,2015-07-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20812-live-at-the-fillmore-east-october-4th-5th-1968/,EpicLegacy,"When Sly and the Family Stone recorded their gigs at the Fillmore East in New York City, they were one of America's best live bands, but they were also a one-hit wonder. They'd had a Top 10 single in 1967 with ""Dance to the Music"", but their follow-up, ""Life"", and the album of the same title, had both stiffed. The plan, apparently, was to release an album of the Fillmore gigs to show off what the Family Stone could do on stage—and, perhaps, get some traction with the free-form FM radio stations that were popping up all over. A few months after the shows, ""Everyday People"" became the massive hit the band needed—a song that echoed their own racial and sexual integration—and the live album was set aside. (Stand!, released in May, 1969, didn't include any of the new songs played at the Fillmore East gigs.) Somehow, the Fillmore tapes were never edited down to an album until this year, when a vinyl-only double-LP, sequenced by the Roots' ""Captain"" Kirk Douglas, appeared for Record Store Day. This wider-scale release, though, isn't that selection: it's a four-disc set of all four Fillmore sets in their entirety. That means we get multiple renditions of the long, jammy pieces that would have been the spine of a late-'60s Fillmore East album: ""Are You Ready"" and ""Music Lover"" (both, in their way, prototypes of ""I Want to Take You Higher""), a cover of ""Won't Be Long"" (from Aretha Franklin's second album) sung by keyboardist Rose Stone, an extended version of the Dance to the Music album's ""Color Me True"", and a frenetic medley of A Whole New Thing's ""Turn Me Loose"" with Otis Redding's ""I Can't Turn You Loose"". A 35-minute, six-song Live at the Fillmore East would have been a drop-dead classic on the order of Sly and the Family Stone's next three actual albums, or nearly so: the missing link between James Brown's extended funk workouts, Norman Whitfield's psychedelic soul, and the progressive rock that was evolving among the Family Stone's Bay Area neighbors. The band's half-dozen-or-so vocalists sound great, especially Sly himself, and the stop-on-a-dime arrangements are thrilling. But if you care about Sly Stone in 2015, after decades of dashed expectations and bungled comebacks, you probably care enough to want to hear the outtakes and alternate versions from the album-that-might-have-been alongside the real thing. True enough, the minor tracks and oddities on this set are illuminating: a relaxed rendition of (Louis Armstrong's version of) ""St. James Infirmary"", a show-ending flourish called ""The Riffs"", a version of ""M'Lady"" that detours into a long, spectacular vocal breakdown. It's fun to hear how different the band's performances could be from show to show, too. Still, collecting the entire Fillmore East engagement also reveals the Family Stone's curious weaknesses, especially recycling riffs from song to song and relying on a handful of instrumental and vocal tricks. Sly and the Family Stone were a groove band above all, and their classic lineup rarely got to stretch out on record before it fell apart in the early '70s. Fillmore East isn't the hit-making, up-with-people pop group commemorated on their Greatest Hits, or the embittered, shaken genius-plus-backup of There's a Riot Goin' On and Fresh. (It's not the first live album by the original group, either: their complete set from 1969's Woodstock festival was released in 2009 as The Woodstock Experience.) But this set is the document we've been missing of the onstage Family Stone of legend: the tightly knit extended family that sang and played together, the group that magically united black and white audiences. If it doesn't quite live up to their radiant reputation, it comes pretty close.","This four-disc set captures several shows by Sly and the Family Stone at New York's Fillmore East.

Personal Sunlight,SassyBlack,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6db1335d7bf1699f42/1:1/w_160/363b23dd.png,2015-07-20 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20809-personal-sunlight/,self-released,"Since they broke through via guest spots on Shabazz Palaces's Black Up, THEESatisfaction have been floating somewhere in the space between Georgia Anne Muldrow's astral visions and Erykah Badu's earthly perception. Their strain of rap&B is tinged with cosmic insight but always tugging earthward, mingling calls for acknowledgement, autonomy, and freedom with utopian visions and sinuous grooves. In the event that liberation actually comes, their music suggests, people will still need to dance. As the singing half of THEESatisfaction, Catherine ""Cat"" Harris-White's sideline recording DIY EPs as SassyBlack has given her additional room to express her insights for a couple years now. Categorizing her music in part as ""hologram funk,"" Harris-White's vocals sink into the similar hypnotic chants and plainspoken wisdom that she brings to her main gig. It's in a simpler form, sure; Personal Sunlight, her latest Bandcamp release, harmonizes with itself in a way that seems more intent on delivery than message. It's the timbre of her voice, spread out along hooks-turned-mantras, that resonates the most. She runs it through fields of beats that are simple, minimalist, sometimes even forgettable in isolation; the fluttering, pendulous synth-guitar riffs in opening cut ""(Dance in My) Personal Sunlight"" is the closest this six-track EP comes to a memorable melodic element that arises from Harris-White's production rather than her voice. But the drums are catchy in their slipperiness, and keep a sense of focus in the track when Harris-White reels off into subtly melismatic runs. Her voice carries all the style and vibrance the music needs: Her repeated hooks locate an exact and satisfying balance between nonchalance and urgency (she nails it best in ""Thriller (Game Healer)""). Her messages are simpler, more general, and more abstract than the Afrocentric core of EarthEE, but if the personal is political, Personal Sunlight isn't a departure at all, really. Harris-White credits this album as the product of a certain epiphany: ""I woke up one day and realized my life's full potential. With this new found (previously understood, yet never truly fully actualized) reality, I created"". What exactly it was that removed this last remaining block for her isn't specified, even on a pretty matter-of-fact record that rides on simple messages of radiant inspiration (""(Dance in My) Personal Sunlight""), the self-absorption behind environmental neglect (""What's the Sun WithOut the Rain""), and the unrestrained thrill of pure love (""Splish Splash (My Lovin on FLEEK)""). But even when the ratio of what she says to how she says it tilts this far toward the latter, it's not hard to feel the weight she brings to her voice.","As the singing half of THEEsatisfaction, Catherine ""Cat"" Harris-White's sideline recording DIY EPs as SassyBlack has given her extra space to express her cosmic-tinged visions.

Psychic Reader,Bad Bad Hats,by: Tess Duncan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af5db1335d7bf1699f23/1:1/w_160/9daba456.jpg,2015-07-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20798-psychic-reader/,Afternoon,"Previous to Psychic Reader, Minneapolis-based trio Bad Bad Hats released a few lo-fi demos via Bandcamp. Along with kazoo solos and rewritten Shania Twain verses came effervescent indie-pop track ""Super America"". In it, lead vocalist/guitarist Kerry Alexander strolls gas station aisles gazing longingly at its sugary treats, and in the same breath reveals similarly hedonistic desires for her love life: ""I want a sweet tea and a heart that won't break.... I want an Icee and a nice boy to date."" On the surface , the song seems a bit wide-eyed. But it ends up reflecting how self-serving cravings address our basic human needs—physical and emotional—without satisfying them, and the end result in both cases is empty, whether caloric or romantic. Psychic Reader builds upon the unconventional structure and sticky melody behind ""Super America"", but now Alexander's self-aware concerns are less one-dimensional. Her vocals will undoubtedly earn her cursory descriptors like ""sweet"" or ""childlike,"" but her seeming innocence is belied by her apt songwriting. She's an expert at translating her own experiences into poignant, universal stories. On the bouncy, immediately accessible opener ""Midway"", Alexander confesses, ""I knew that I'd leave you by the middle of June/ You touched me on my shoulder blade, soft like a tomb/ I wanna hear you tell me you don't know what you'll do/ The words you were not saying nearly filled up the room."" She speaks with astute cognizance—she's the first to admit her contradictions because she's already come to terms with them. There are quirky electronic noises sprinkled all over the LP, a sign that Bad Bad Hats are a new band trying things out. The blaring, robotic effects on the caffeinated ""Shame"" come close to distracting,  although they're matched by some appropriately noisy guitar freakouts. On the album's pillowy title track, cooing waves of ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" blend in seamlessly with atmospheric, ping-pong-ing synths, a slithering chord progression, and offbeat percussion patterns. The Hats leap into yet another direction with their least-produced track, ""Things We Never Say"". If you were to close your eyes, you might think Alexander was singing into your ear, and really, that's the only way to record an acoustic song that's this unnerving. Alexander takes age-old subject matter—unrequited love—and manages to articulate the accompanying swirl of messy emotions without sounding cliché: ""You never say you love me, but you never let me fight you/ Can't get you off my mind babe, so I bought this dress to spite you/ I wear it 'cause I hate you, 'cause you don't know what you got/ Then I'll wear it to your house and I'll let you take it off."" When she concludes, ""I wanna be the one who holds you/ I wanna be the one who says goodnight,"" it feels less like a plea and more like a liberating declaration. There's a distinct purity to the cadence of Alexander's voice, one that works to maintain its grip on the record's more experimental tinkerings. The final track, ""Spin"", sounds like Bad Bad Hats time-traveled from a 1998 alt-rock radio station, pumped full of glossy, uptempo guitars reminiscent of Eve 6 or Gin Blossoms. It's a strange choice, but a catchy chorus and fatalistic lyrics give the song a sweet-and-sour appeal and charming enthusiasm. The band's fluctuations from track to track aren't entirely unexpected—this is their debut full-length after all—nor are they unwelcome. However, their capricious inclinations wouldn't be able to hold their own without Alexander's visceral songwriting. This is where Psychic Reader's nuances are buried, within her complex perspective that's at once clever, fresh, and earnest.","Psychic Reader is the first LP from the Minneapolis indie pop trio Bad Bad Hats. Vocalist/guitarist Kerry Alexander's pure voice might be called ""sweet"" or ""childlike,"" but her innocence is belied by her apt songwriting, which translates her experiences into poignant, universal stories.

Lost Time,Fox Millions Duo,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af60c0084474cd0c1a79/1:1/w_160/5112a196.png,2015-07-20 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20800-lost-time/,Thrill Jockey,"The most surprising news about Lost Time—the two-track collaboration between Kid Millions and Greg Fox—is that it took so long to happen. Millions and Fox are the two busiest drummers in experimental music, bounding between projects with the zeal and energy of potent valence electrons. Both have bands that pushed them into prominence. For Millions, it’s the pantheistic weirdo crew Oneida, known for extended adventures into rock’s most distant corners, both onstage and off. For Fox, it’s the flinty black metal band Liturgy, known for testing the boundaries of that genre and irking its old guard in the process. But Millions and Fox treat those acts as launch pads, not landing pads. Fox, for instance, leads his own freak-out act Guardian Alien, is the newest member of Zs, and collaborates with Ben Frost, Colin Stetson, and PC Worship. Millions, meanwhile, drums with Spiritualized and Laurie Anderson, helms the drum ensemble Man Forever, and released duo records with J. Spaceman and Borbetomagus’ Jim Sauter just last year. Their collision seems, then, inevitable if not overdue, an obviously great idea that each musician had to squeeze into packed dockets. Lost Time, however, does not sound like an obligation, a date on a calendar meant to be fulfilled. At its best, it feels like an opportunity for two daring drummers to explore with and without their kits. Recorded during two workaday sessions in 2014, these dual tracks find the pair testing diametric impulses with equal zeal—building and filling a sidelong groove for the meditative ""Post Encounter Effect"" and treating grooves as anathema for the explosive ""Telegy/Time Lapse"". For both pieces, Fox and Millions step behind and then away from their sets, accessorizing the ""drum duo"" concept with guitars and electronics, samples and screams. The choice affords Lost Time unexpected approachability. The first side speaks as much to Lightning Bolt as it does to Albert Ayler, the second as much to Swans as Max Neuhaus. You can practically hear each drummer’s enthusiasm for simply playing (but not playing simply) on ""Telegy/Time Lapse"", a 20-minute opening marvel of momentum and cooperation. A murmur of looped electronics yields to an outburst of drums, with Millions and Fox interlocking their very heavy, very fast, very long rolls and fills. They continually escalate and de-escalate, creating a seesaw that emphasizes just how meticulous and powerful they can get. Sometimes, they stop altogether; other times, they play so hard you wonder how they know where each limb will land. Instead of two titans squaring off, the sound suggests a spirited conversation between equals, each offering distinct but complementary voices and thoughts on a shared interest. Fox has studied with Milford Graves, a pioneering jazz drummer who has, in recent decades, used heart monitors to help build musical frameworks. Midway through ""Telegy/Time Lapse"", the drums disappear, replaced temporarily by the amplified heartbeats of Fox and Millions and, soon, solid sheets of industrial noise. When the drums return, they slyly mirror those biomechanical rhythms, suggesting that both of these musicians were born to do exactly this. When the track hits its ecstatic peak, Fox howls and hums maniacally behind the beats. The élan is visceral, contagious. But where that first piece is immediate and demanding, ""Post Encounter Effect"" attempts to be immersive and hypnotic to the point that it borders on soporific. Fox and Millions begin with a wide, swinging beat, syncopated cymbals splashing over a regimen of tom-toms. For 20 minutes, this rhythm sits mostly still. Meanwhile, they saturate the space between their kits with a panoply of drones—loose-stringed acoustics and phosphorescent electrics, muzzled trumpet and squelching synthesizers. The hope, it seems, is to commingle the ideas of opposing minimalists Steve Reich and La Monte Young by balancing the eternal tones of the latter with the rhythmic latticework of the former. But the idea is more interesting than the execution, itself a listless piece whose subtlety morphs into tedium long before the track expires. In recent years, two other drummers, Jon Mueller and Jonathan Kane, have applied similar principles to much more dynamic work in their respective bands Death Blues and February. Perhaps because it seems so redundant, ""Post Encounter Effect"" feels like a cerebral exercise for Millions and Fox. They are much better when the exchange is physical, as on ""Telegy/Time Lapse"", a piece so urgent and expressive it’s a shame the side ever ends.","Kid Millions (Oneida) and Greg Fox (Liturgy) are the two busiest drummers in experimental music.

St. Catherine,Ducktails,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af79c0084474cd0c1aa1/1:1/w_160/b4cc3584.jpg,2015-07-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20818-st-catherine/,Domino,"Recorded in several cities as Matt Mondanile's other band Real Estate was touring in support of Atlas, St. Catherine makes one thing clear right out of the gate: You can take the boy out of the Garden State, but you can’t take the Garden State out of the boy. Mondanile has been upholding this truism for the better part of the past decade with both of his bands, nurturing a wistful, contemplative sound that, while far from the heartland rock New Jersey holds dear, will still strike a chord with anyone who has ever gone down the shore. Having shaken the once-fashionable lo-fi aesthetic that marked the project's early work, Ducktails found its surest footing with 2013’s more varied The Flower Lane. But if that album found him expanding the Ducktails sound, fifth album St. Catherine finds Mondanile cautiously shuffling his way back into his comfort zone, churning out the kind of pretty, melancholic daydreamers he cut his teeth on. It’s hard to fault Mondanile for going back to basics, especially considering that he’s still one of the most unassuming but instantly recognizable guitar players in his respective orbit, and both his knack for cozy melodies and skills as an arranger are intact. But there’s a feeling of trepidation that hangs over the record as it favors familiarity over all else. Fortunately, Rob Schnapf, who co-produced Elliot Smith’s Either/Or and XO, helped Mondanile get St. Catherine across the finish line. It’s an appealingly clean sounding piece of work with serious attention to detail, from the simple but perfectly EQ’d drums to brightly-lit acoustic guitars to those swooning string arrangements. The sound is there, but the songs on St. Catherine don't have the substance to match. Having Julia Holter guest on ""Church"" is a good look, as her voice lends a needed extra dimension to Mondanile’s wiggy compositions, but even her contribution just kind of floats on by. This is Ducktails’ most discriminating and tasteful album, but the project is at its best when there's a certain amount of exploration even within its narrow parameters.","St. Catherine was recorded in several cities as Matt Mondanile's other band Real Estate was touring in support of Atlas.

No Life For Me,WavvesCloud Nothings,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af5fb1335d7bf1699f27/1:1/w_160/88c05d11.jpg,2015-07-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20799-no-life-for-me/,Ghost Ramp,"It's an algorithmic dream date: Google ""Cloud Nothings"" or ""Wavves"" and in each case the other band is one of the top entries in the ""people also search"" field. The overlap is inevitable: two critically acclaimed indie rock bands that actually rock, ones that qualify as pop and punk but somehow not pop-punk. Yet, Wavves X Cloud Nothings represents a sudden intersection after the two artists have spent the past five years aiming in opposite directions. Dylan Baldi wants esteemed producers to act like P90x coaches, helping him shed the flabby baggage of his earliest recording for something meaner, leaner, and shredded, whereas Nathan Williams employs them like high-end makeup artists. You'd have to go back to 2009 for the last time Wavves and Cloud Nothings were functionally similar, or No Life For Me can save you the trouble. Before the turn of the decade, both bands were solo projects manufacturing confectionary nuggets about being young, bitter and bored, wrapped in metallic hiss—the equivalent of eating chocolates without removing the foil. There's no obvious reason for either Baldi or Williams to be nostalgic for this period, as their careers have continued to evolve and prosper along with their music. Maybe they're eager to revisit a time when their every move wasn't subject to scrutiny, though slapping both of their highly recognizable brands on the cover doesn't exactly lower expectations, despite the modest rollout. Still, this album is the most effortless music either has produced in years, which ultimately serves as proof of how easy it is for both Baldi and Williams to write good songs and also the care it takes to make them great. There are solid hooks scattered all over No Life For Me, and they sound like they could've been knocked out in five minutes—each melodic note notches in the expected place over thrumming power chords and steady drums. The seven proper tracks are all opportunities to parse the fine difference between urgency and immediacy: much of No Life For Me happened without much noticeable struggle, but did it need to happen? In the end, ""Wavves X Cloud Nothings"" manages to be misleading on numerous levels. It implies a full partnership or at least participation from both bands—this is essentially ""Wavves feat. Dylan Baldi"", as it calls on Nathan's brother Joel as a producer and his drummer Brian Hill, who is not Jayson Gerycz. Hill is a fine drummer but he's not one of the few plus-value drummers in rock music, a guy who can singlehandedly change a band's trajectory and take a song from an 8 to a 10. This might've reflected more on Baldi than Hill had the dreamy, drumless closer ""Nothing Hurts"" not been the LP's highlight. However, ""Come Down"" and the title track are essentially Cloud Nothings deep cuts with a solid rhythm section that never pushes against Baldi's vocals, never threatens any kind of chaos. It's possible Hill could've provided these things had No Life For Me been the result of more protracted sessions, but you might come out of this record thinking Gerycz is somehow still underrated. Moreover, the nominal ""X"" implies a factorial relationship between the two acts—maybe this could've been a muscling up of Wavves' wiry surf-and-skate physique or the achromatic bleakness of Attack on Memory or Here and Nowhere Else given a suntan. Tilt that ""X"" 45 degrees and you've got a more accurate formula: This is more an example of addition, two artists with very similar writing styles piling on top of each other. In fact, Williams and Baldi are virtually indistinguishable emotionally or sonically here. The same themes of intransigence, ennui, and self-pity that serve as the basis for nearly every one of their previous songs is shuffled and endlessly reworded, Wavves and Cloud Nothings lyrics turned into magnetic poetry tiles grabbed out of a bag. Their blunt admissions never sound insincere despite being shared and workshopped, just pro forma—""I'm such a fucking mess/ Don't know at all how it's gonna go,"" ""I feel it open up around me."" ""Sometimes, you'll find nothing ever comes down."" Looking at the most recent, productive relationships between established songwriting entities—Run the Jewels, FFS, for example—there's a provision of contrast, a clear quid pro quo where each party has something the other wants or needs. Whether or not there's chemistry between Baldi and Williams, there's no volatility. They don't even sound like they're having fun: the bummer attitude was a given, but neither is inspired to go beyond their own sonic boundaries, nor is there any sign of friendly one-upmanship, no indication that a truly great idea from these sessions wouldn't be tucked away for private usage. That wouldn't be much of an issue had this partnership reflected its low-key creative process by having Wavves X Cloud Nothings go by a different name or having the results given away as a freebie or just a lark. But No Life For Me is a 21-minute record with two instrumentals that costs $10—the same price you could pay for Attack on Memory or King of the Beach. Which is to say that Wavves X Cloud Nothings didn't need to result in a good album to justify its existence, but No Life For Me did.","No Life For Me, a team-up release between Nathan Williams of Wavves and Dylan Baldi of Cloud Nothings, is the most effortless music either has produced in years.

Cinco De Money,Ty Money,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af179d034d5c69bf4665/1:1/w_160/8ff9d537.jpg,2015-07-16 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20745-cinco-de-money/,self-released,"It's easy to stay hidden in Harvey, Ill. Ty Money is a young street rapper from the gritty suburb to Chicago's south, and his talents transcend his city's bleak profile. Although Harvey is virtually unknown nationally, in Chicagoland, it's known for rappers like the east coast-inspired duo Naughty and Kane—with whom Ty recorded ""Sibley Boyz"" in 2011. That song showcased Ty's slick, lyrically dense rap style, one reminiscent of the narrative-oriented tradition that propelled T.I. in Atlanta back in the early 2000s. (It may explain why the Grand Hustle CEO was reportedly courting Ty for a deal in 2014.) Ty's latest tape, the gripping Cinco De Money, is his third, and the first to realize a coherent vision, updating his style without sacrificing his strength as one of hip-hop's most talented new writers. Cinco De Money is a dark and depressing record to be sure, the rapper's brutal assuredness set in stark relief against a canvas of hopelessness. But it is engaging in a way that belies its somber subject matter. The album is an immersive visit to Harvey's Sibley Boulevard, a main strip that takes on mythic connotations in Ty's lyrics, his own Queensbridge projects or Bowen Homes. The music moves in continuous descending circles, a musical Escher drawing, giving a downward pull to everything. Some productions, like the grim vocal sample on ""Just Bars"", are skittishly somber, while others creak back and forth with the inevitability of a porch swing. Ty is a lyrical rapper, but his dense thickets of wordplay are more concerned with depicting scenes and telling stories than drawing attention to their own cleverness. In the last few years, there's been a tendency among popular rap artists, particularly in the South and Midwest, to take a hypnotically repetitive rhythmic approach—think Migos, or, more locally, King Louie. On Cinco De Money, Ty meshes his older lyrical style with this punchier delivery. The effect works, somehow—his intricate rapping, dense with euphonic syllables and clever wordplay, is stickier, more urgent than ever before. Unlike the Migos, whose lyrics are often appreciated moment-to-moment, his words tend toward narrative cohesion, a thread of ideas best understood in toto. The effect is like a jagged EKG, in which each pulse is horizontally compressed. Ty defies easy categorization, which is part of why his new work feels so vital, but also might be part of why he's still mostly undiscovered. He's a rapper's rapper, but not a traditionalist. At a time when so many artists aim for the pure, simple gestures, Ty Money aims for an amalgamation: the confluence of rewind-worthy wordplay (""Couple old shooters, call 'em Robert Horry""), evocative imagery that focuses on the details (""Wipin' down the shotty with a napkin""), and a compelling personal narrative. This is street rap that is as much about the blues as Future's ""Trap Niggas"", which captures a similar tire-spinning-in-mud futility with very different tools. The album's spark, its magnetism, lies in the balance between the crisp precision and forceful confidence of Ty's rapping and the taut  unease of his bars, which suggest a lifetime of existential anxiety.","Ty Money is a young street rapper from the south Chicago suburb of Harvey.

Universes,Seven Davis Jr.,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af255e6ef95969321d6c/1:1/w_160/2bc5d1df.png,2015-07-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20756-universes/,Ninja Tune,"For listeners who discovered Seven Davis Jr. via his joyous 2013 single ""One"", the release of his debut album is cause for celebration. It marks the culmination of a two-year period in which we've had only teasing glimpses—an EP here, a Prince cover there—at his unorthodox take on house and funk. But for the Houston-born, Los Angeles-based musician, Universes marks the completion of a much longer process and a vindication of his methods, as well as a rebuke against those who doubted him along the way. Davis' moment has been a long time coming. He grew up in a gospel family and got his first look inside the music industry early on. He discovered house and techno while living, and dancing, in San Francisco; for a while, he ghost-produced for rappers, but his own productions, he has said, were deemed too strange. ""I made a lot of this music many years ago and other labels and artists hated on me for it,"" he recalled around the release of The Lost Tapes Vol. 1, a compendium of his early work. ""They said it was too weird, too different, sounded like drug music."" In fact, it was drug music, but at some point, he kicked his habits, and in that sense, it's possible to read Universes as a testament to the soul-cleansing power of funk. Once upon a time, negativity established the limits of his vision: ""I Don't Give a Fuck"", the opening song on The Lost Tapes Vol. 1, complained, ""You need to go find a hobby"" and ""Stop being a hater""—understandable sentiments, perhaps, but the prosaic lyrics didn't measure up to his production talents or his powerful voice. But the far more assured Universes is swept up in the power of positive thinking, both lyrically and musically. The gorgeous, introductory ""Imagination"", a dreamy nod to the sound of D'Angelo's Voodoo, gives way to ""Freedom"", an uptempo riot of stuttering drums and disco vamps that can barely contain its giddy cheer. In ""Sunday Morning"", he pares down the production and puts his voice center stage: ""Bet you never had a love like this before,"" he sings in a loop, and it's not just the lyrics that do the talking; it's his playful voice, swooping and diving, the very embodiment of joy at its most seductive. ""Everybody Too Cool"", a sly romp splashed with organ and falsetto, is even more joyful, as Davis taunts, ""Mr. DJ/ Don't play this in the club/ 'Cause people don't dance no more/ Everybody too cool for school""—a clever bit of reverse psychology, because good luck standing still in the face of his loping, rolling groove. Davis' own history as a house dancer is evident in his music's wild gyrations; even when he's laying down four-to-the-floor rhythms, he imbues them with more bump and flex than most contemporary dancefloors will be used to. Case in point: ""Good Vibes"", a co-production with Julio Bashmore that loops its squelchy chords and rickety drum machine, as though 1993's Daft Punk were trying to worm their way back to Minneapolis, 1985. But there's a somber side to the album, too. In ""Fighters"", the album's emotional centerpiece, he layers his voice into a mournful, wordless mass, over which he offers a lament for America's racist violence. He keeps the details vague, but that winds up contributing to the song's depiction of fruitless violence and misspent energies, all of it summed up in the line, ""Everybody's hoping for peace but they're doing it all wrong."" It's the album's most musically adventurous song, too, skulking along in a strange, 5/4 time signature, the murk mirroring the exhaustion of the lyrics. The album perks up after that; ""Afterlife"", a wheezy keyboard sketch, finds Davis brushing the dirt off his shoulder: ""I will love, I will love, I will love/ Let 'em hate, let 'em hate, let 'em hate."" And ""No Worries"", one of the album's sprightliest jams, is a kiss-off of the most carefree kind. Throughout it all, his arrangements burst with a vitality that belies their modest construction. The sounds may be humble, not that much more hi-fi than his early demos, but their vision of funk as lifeblood is never anything less than radiant.","For listeners who discovered Seven Davis Jr. via his joyous 2013 single ""One"", the release of his debut album is cause for celebration. Universes is a testament to the soul-cleansing power of funk.

Credited to Suzanne Kraft, an alias of dublab DJ Diego Herrera, Green Flash did nu-disco infused with a low-slung pacing and a warmth not unlike a cassette tape left on the dashboard at midday. It was soon followed by the Horoscope EP and a handful of more Balearic cuts from Herrera's other band, Pharaohs, suggesting that more floor-filling tracks lay ahead. But when Missum, Kraft's next release for Running Back, came out last year, it showed Herrera not leaning in but rather taking a step back. The record was actually a reissue, but it showed a different side of him: The drums turned down to register as gentle pulses, samples of old boogie records gave way to chord organs and saxophone lines that mimicked deep breathing exercises, unfurling slowly and deeply across each track. Missum revealed the mellow, contemplative side of Suzanne Kraft, which in comparison to the DJ tracks, might have sounded anomalous. With Talk From Home, it instead illuminates that the unhurried pacing of those first dance singles might be the outliers. Released on the Melody As Truth imprint out of the UK, Talk From Home isn't an homage to new age music per se, but it does take cues from the more chilled-out end of the ECM and EG catalogs. ""Two Chord Wake"", with its brushed hi-hat programming and measured snares, might have the most pronounced beat of the album, yet even with flares of guitar spiking above the rhythms, it pads about gently like music for children’s television. ""Never Heated"" might be carved out of Julee Cruise’s exhales, a wordless vocal paired with a simple figure on bass guitar and a tube amp buzzing like cicadas. Throughout, Kraft gets the most out of the simplest of ingredients, ""Male Intuition"" imparting its contemplative vibe with little more than a guitar line couched in reverb and echo that brings to mind Durutti Column. Other moments of the album sound like something Mark Isham might have cut around the time of Vapor Drawings, just at the border between breezy and cheesy. The pads of the title track at first bring to mind a Muzak version of ""King of Pain"" but as the track evolves, a bath-warm depth is revealed. The beatific slow swells of closer ""The Result"" brings this all too-brief outing to a close, but Talk From Home is the ideal soundtrack for taking a leisurely stroll rather than frantically Ubering to reach a destination.","Suzanne Kraft is an alias of the L.A.-based dublab DJ Diego Herrera.

Communion,Years & Years,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af8ac0084474cd0c1abf/1:1/w_160/e8fd434e.jpg,2015-07-16 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20831-communion/,Interscope,"Almost all forms of music seek to speak, from time to time, of love, and from time to time of sex. But pop music stands alone in its obsession with their convergence point, where they become interchangeable or indistinguishable or simply confused with one another. ""Is it desire, or is it love that I’m feeling for you?"" Years & Years singer Olly Alexander asks, in characteristically dramatic fashion on ""Desire"", and the law of pop melodrama demands that the question go unanswered. So it goes with the music: is it the easy populism of Years & Years’ honed, slick dance-pop that intoxicates, or a transmission of deeper truths? But why separate the two? The majority of the songs on the British trio’s debut album Communion marry thematic precision with the broad kinetics of great pop songwriting, mingling self-loathing and doubt with a redemptive, near-bloody-minded push to prettiness and uplift. Only the excellent single ""Shine"" is as upbeat as it is up-tempo, and even then the happiness feels so hard-won it can’t help but imply its opposite. The songs carefully map the contours of gay sensuality, filtering lust through a variety of counterparts: not just shame, but vulnerability, self-awareness and annihilating self-abandon. Where Bronski Beat once crafted colossal club-pop out of tales of marginalization and abuse, Years & Years occupy a more subtle, liminal contemporary world, one of feeling isolated amidst a crowd of bodies. ""I’ll do what you like if you stay the night,"" Olly bargains on ""Real"", and then later offers on the seductive slow-grind of ""Take Shelter"", ""do what you want tonight/ It’s alright."" On ""Worship"", he promises ""I’m not gonna tell nobody ‘bout you,"" and finally, on the wracked, gorgeous closer ""Memo"", he begs, ""Let me take your heart/ Love you in the dark/ No one has to see."" In each case the character of the song is made small and powerless by the asymmetry of desire, which renders the stadium-chant backing vocals and sun-from-behind-clouds synth bursts more perverse and exhilarating than they have any right to be on their own. Remove or ignore that contradiction, and Years & Years’ musical familiarity might breed contempt. You could dismiss their overblown choruses and sculpted electro-house arrangements as just the most commercial manifestation yet of a decade’s worth of also-ran bands reimagining '80s and '90s club-pop; MGMT’s ""Electric Feel"" strained through Disclosure’s snappy post-garage percussion and Sam Smith’s middlebrow wallowing. But Years & Years don't dilute this formula, they distill it: Communion’s biggest hit thus far, the high-gloss anthem ""King"", attains a kind of formal loveliness not witnessed in this genre since Madonna’s ""Get Together"" almost a decade ago. Here, and on the album’s other highlights, the air of mercantile anonymity feels generous rather than cynical, the music as anxious to accommodate its imagined audience as Olly is his lovers, to be the song that made you dance all night even though you can’t remember a word of it now (i.e. to be the best song ever, as One Direction rightly observed). How else could you end up with a song like ""Worship"": a bright xylophone bounce for the verses, and a chorus that references gospel via diva-house via the Wanted’s ""I Found You""? Appropriately, the band sounds too delirious to feel any shame. Years & Years are weakest when seeking to project dignity, a noble bearing up in the face of life’s torments and disappointments (""Eyes Shut"", ""Gold"", ""Without""). Then, the arrangements veer towards placating grand gestures, and Olly’s ""soaring"" vocals threaten to become cloying. Conversely, the ballad ""Memo"" is perhaps the album’s pinnacle, at least in part because of its defiant specificity. Over slow piano chords and halting percussion, Olly describes in fragile falsetto his infatuation for a straight male friend (""You see yourself in another way/ I try my best but I don’t ever change""), doomed to be unrequited although perhaps not unconsummated (the repeated refrain, ""I want more"", works either way). Although its lip trembles with the tremulousness of its longing, at another level ""Memo"" is ice cold: what kind of love, it asks, would place lovers in such an impossible bind? Again, there's no answer on Communion, but you can always return to the dancefloor and try to find it again.","The British dance pop trio Years & Years’ debut album marries thematic precision with the broad kinetics of anthemic pop songwriting, mingling self-loathing and doubt with a redemptive, near-bloody-minded push to prettiness and uplift.

Magnifique,Ratatat,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1c5e6ef95969321d56/1:1/w_160/1b6a67e3.jpg,2015-07-16 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20749-magnifique/,XL,"Sometimes, as an artist, you can revisit the same well and pull different types of water—think of Real Estate, or Chaz Bundick of Toro Y Moi, or Kurt Vile. And then, sometimes, you're just repeating yourself, like Ratatat. There’s nothing regressive or cynical in Ratatat’s consistency, because I do believe these two guys are making the music they want to make (see their game Genius annotations here), but I also think that on Magnifique, their fifth record, the well has dried up. There’s something about not being able to tell five years has passed between records that makes you wonder about an artist's evolution. When Ratatat were at their peak (for my money, 2006’s Classics), the duo crystallized an aesthetic that was similar to chillwave before chillwave existed: a rudimentary, simplistic dissection, then careful re-assembly of, modern music’s most elemental pieces (keyboards, guitars, beats) that amplified the simple beauty of the bare necessities and evoked layered feelings of nostalgia. But, more often than not, Ratatat’s music has felt like a tasteful accessory, something that reminds you of other, more progressive electronic music, but mostly sounds great while trying on sweaters. There are little gestures at switching things up, like the steel guitar on ""Supreme"". But it disappears as unceremoniously as it came, leaving no real impression other than, ""oh that’s the song with the steel guitar."" This is Magnifique's real issue: It’s not that the album is bland, it’s that it doesn’t really do anything or go anywhere. No matter how skillfully they may blend sounds, like on the dense ""Abrasive"", or the playful if thin ""Cream on Chrome"", or the lite-funk of ""Countach"", nothing leaves an impression. There’s no emotional core or tension. An uncharitable soul will say that’s always been the knock on Ratatat, but, especially after a half-decade absence, it seems awfully relevant now. ""Nightclub Amnesia"" works itself into a nice groove, complete with one of the album’s most memorable riffs, but it’s also hard to imagine the song working on any dancefloor or anywhere else than the tamest apartment get-together. Even when Ratatat spent earlier releases like they were specifically working this angle—the barest, most minimal take on party music suitable for coffee-shops—they backed it up with memorable hooks or tones. Magnifique fades from memory as soon as it ends. Fitting, then, that the most memorable song is a cover, the penultimate ""I Will Return"", offered as an emotional climax to the record. A quick listen to the Springwater original reveals something about the song’s stakes—and how it should affect the listener. It feels cosmic, triumphant. Ratatat cleans it up and rehashes it, like the sleek reboots of last decade’s blockbuster hits. It seems confining to suggest that Ratatat's best music is often collaborative. But that’s also their most memorable and essential work, from Kid Cudi to their unofficial but rewarding remixes to the great Despot single produced by E*Vax. It's never seemed like their tone and vibe was substantial enough to last an entire album. And five records in, it’s hard to argue otherwise.","When Ratatat were at their peak, the duo crystallized an aesthetic that was similar to chillwave before chillwave existed.

Heaven Is Earth,Self Defense Family,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3d5e6ef95969321d88/1:1/w_160/f6d3556c.png,2015-07-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20775-heaven-is-earth/,Deathwish,"Self Defense Family frontman Patrick Kindlon's first words on Heaven Is Earth are, ""The earth is not my concern"" and for a solid five minutes, he lists 19 people, places and/or concepts that likewise are not his concern (""your kid"", ""to compete"", ""your day""). The guitars bend with the willingness of steel girders and with every line, Kindlon strains like he’s waiting for a spotter to assist him. By the time it collapses in an exhausted heap, Kindlon’s point has been made by omission: Self Defense Family is his sole concern, the means and the end—the song itself is titled ""In My Defens Self Me Defend"". It speaks to the curious nature of the band—they’re a shape-shifting, inclusive and absorbing entity that somehow still feels closed off from society. Heaven is Earth is Self Defense Family’s second LP in two years—they’re an extraordinarily prolific and collaborative band that’s more willing to play the traditional album cycle game while defying the idea that it needs to consist of four guys going into a studio to knock out a 45-minute record and tour through the writing of the next one. Despite having over a dozen releases under the name End of a Year, they had no issue changing it once Kindlon decided it made them sound like a ""local metalcore"" band. You’ll have to read the credits to keep up with their constantly rotating personnel; it’s currently six deep, though that’s always subject to change. Heaven Is Earth was also recorded in four different studios with four different, esteemed engineers, including Kurt Ballou (Converge) and Jonathan Low (the National, Kurt Vile)—more a tribute to their reputation than any kind of budget. And the video for lead single ""Talia"" is filled with stock wildlife footage, meant to be ""directly ripped off from the Talk Talk ‘It’s My Life’ video"" and the opposite of the typical ""band playing in a warehouse"" clip. Their contrarian thinking and freewheeling structure belies the circumscription and cohesion of Heaven Is Earth. In the lineage of Steve Albini, Andy Falkous and Pissed Jeans’ Matt Korvette, Kindlon sings with constant aggravation, a smart-ass frustrated by the dimwitted and probably even more so by the intellectuals. They’re not as ascetic nor abrasive musically, however—Heaven Is Earth is a warm and often rich recording. But it’s one that doesn’t trust conventional displays of beauty, especially shoegaze. There’s all the whammy bar abuse and tonal clusters of the genre, but it’s gone straight-edge, with none of the disorientation and gushing ambience. ""In My Defens"" segues into ""Talia"" and is distinguished entirely on its inclusion of harmonica and piano, which are employed for groaning ambience—a Swans song in miniature. Self Defense Family make good on their name throughout *Heaven Is Earth—*there are no hooks, the songs are mostly stationary and stonefaced, waiting for you to fuck up so they can pounce. This is music that doesn’t play offense, it just takes offense. Traditional, confessional songwriting seems to be a particular pet peeve, which he addresses on ""Basic Skills"" (""peer review, I handled that poorly"") and ""Everybody Wants a Prize For Feeling"". However, it’s unclear whether the surprisingly clean jangle of both these songs contradicts Kindlon’s mocking of basic indie rock or serves as a deeper means of parody. Kindlon isn't the type to have trouble getting his point across, but sometimes he appears to resist making direct points. ""Ditko"" pits simple acts of kindness against overt acts of social antagonism to ruminate on ideas of possession: one man watches your laptop while you take a piss, another pees on your lawn. Kindlon asks, ""But that’s not ownership, is it?"" and reveals his ultimate point: ""the hardest part of partnership...to possess and appreciate."" The title track juxtaposes man and animal, heaven and hell, the cerebral and physical, and the mention of an unnamed risible, self-pitying Boston artist is somehow capable of tying it together. But regardless of its intent, the arid, mirthless nature of Heaven Is Earth becomes wearying even after a half hour. Self Defense Family are interesting, Kindlon has interesting things to say. But Heaven Is Earth finds few ways to enhance what you could gain from Kindlon’s interviews or the lyrics sheet—an album that’s literally more interesting on paper.","Heaven Is Earth is Self Defense Family’s second LP in two years.

LP,Container,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af84b1335d7bf1699f5d/1:1/w_160/b7b08e6b.jpg,2015-07-15 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20826-lp/,Spectrum Spools,"Ren Schofield was a member of the noise scene before he started his one-man techno project Container, and you can hear this anarchic influence seep into the clean lines of his current work. ""I like things raw and kind of sloppy,"" he told Resident Advisor in 2012. ""I like things when they're not perfect."" That sensibility is what makes Container’s records so compelling and unique. His songs live on the verge of chaos, and though they never actually fall apart, the threat remains. At the same time, his adherence to regular rhythms and logical changes makes each track focused and orderly, at least compared to abstract noise. So you can dance to Container’s music without falling over, but you can also chill to it without falling asleep. The mix that Schofield has hit on is so potent that he hasn’t needed to change it up much so far. There’s not much difference between this new album and his previous two full-length efforts, which perhaps explains why he gave them all the same generic title of LP (all the songs on each have one-word titles, too). Still, dig in closely and subtle modifications and peripheral developments emerge. He’s made some movement toward a denser, busier mix. That trend began on last year’s Adhesive EP—perhaps the best distillation so far of his vision—and it continues during this album’s quick, 27-minute sprint. The moments where things sound like they’re spilling over, bleeding outside of the track's imaginary lines, are when LP is most thrilling. The overlapping drum-machines in opener ""Eject"" give the sense that Schofield is discovering the beats as he makes them, a tone matched by the found-footage video constructed by Valerie Martino (aka noise-beat-maker Unicorn Hard-on). ""Cushion"" starts like a straight dance track, but eventually metallic whirrs and siren calls pile on like rugby players in a scrum. The peak is closer ""Calibrate"", a hypnotic mess of stark hip-hop rhythm and hyperactive static. All of the above tracks drive firmly in Container’s established lane. It will be interesting to see if Schofield ever feels compelled to steer his rumbling vehicle into some unexpected left turns. His omnivorous creativity—a clear openness to all types of sounds—suggests he could carve a new path without losing sight of the one he’s already crafted. But whether or not that ever happens, what he’s done with Container so far is enough to ride out for a long time.","Container's Ren Schofield works at the border of techno and noise, and you can hear this anarchic influence seep into the clean lines of his current work.

Sing Into My Mouth,Ben BridwellIron & Wine,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aed79d034d5c69bf4600/1:1/w_160/d856197e.jpg,2015-07-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20697-sing-into-my-mouth/,BrownBlack Cricket,"It’s hard to get a clear read on Talking Heads’ ""This Must Be the Place (Naïve Melody)"", the closing track on their 1983 album Speaking in Tongues. David Byrne sings with such dry detachment that I always think of him as an alien who has landed on Earth to observe the mating rituals of human beings. Even as he describes the customs, he lacks an understanding of the emotions that motivate them, so what should be mundane imagery comes across as foreign and strange: ""You got a face with a view,"" he offers as a compliment, then adds, ""I’m just an animal looking for a home."" Yet, the song is so well-observed, so wide-eyed and naïve that it never comes across like a parody of marriage and commitment. Instead, that alien sounds like he might envy us humans and our needs. This must be the place, indeed. On Sam Beam and Ben Bridwell’s rendition of the song, which opens their new joint covers album, they remove all ambiguity and alienness from the original. The setting is folksy, with an acoustic guitar, a gentle percussive thrum, and Beam’s yearning vocals replacing the original’s burbles of Afropop percussion. The main character is no longer an outsider looking in on humanity, but an insider looking outward. It’s as straightforward a cover as you could imagine, removing a layer of meaning from the original, and you know what? It actually works. Maybe it’s the upbeat tempo and the jumpy guitar licks, which evoke a certain kind of domestic contentment. Or maybe it’s the way Beam sounds like a dude trying to say something just beyond his range of expression, without resorting to pop-song clichés: kiss, desire, love, marriage, life. In their reading, the song becomes a testament to the impossibility of saying anything new, even if the vividness of emotion is endlessly renewable. And here’s the catch: Beam and Bridwell aren’t bemoaning those creative limitations, but celebrating the overwhelming complexities of simple human connection. Presumably, the album sprung from this particular cover, which also serves as the source of its title: Sing Into My Mouth. But none of the 11 songs that follow sounds quite so well conceived or executed; nothing is nearly as daring in its interpretation. There are moments when the project brings out the best in both Beam and Bridwell, whose day-job acts have been on a run of ho-hum albums for several years now. Without the reverb of early Band of Horses, Bridwell sounds particularly animated on Ronnie Lane’s ""Done This One Before"" and especially on Cale’s ""You Know Me More Than I Know"", which features some of his most robust vocals—to the point where he’s unrecognizable. Likewise, Beam has a set of strictly structured songs to rein in some of the more elaborate arrangements that have dogged recent Iron & Wine albums. It suits him well on Sade’s ""Bulletproof Soul"", with its barroom noir ambience and side-scrolling pace. It’s not hard to imagine Sing Into My Mouth pointing the way forward for both artists. And yet, Sing Into My Mouth is never quite the sum of its most interesting moments, mostly because there seem to be just as many clumsy or complacent moments. Beam’s take on El Perro del Mar’s signature ""God Knows (You Gotta Give to Get)"" sacrifices the rhythmic thrust of the original as well as its essential melancholy, which leaves him with nothing beyond an awkward, even ugly vocal melody. And somehow Bridwell manages to make ""There's No Way Out of Here"", penned by David Gilmour but originally recorded by Unicorn, sound as pallid and dippy as America. As ungainly as these covers are, at least they stand out. Too many of these songs strike the same tone of beery introversion and chummy camaraderie—both of which could be defining aspects of the pejorative genre known as bro rock. It’s an odd flaw considering the diversity of the source material. It’s not surprising to hear them tackle Bonnie Raitt, JJ Cale, or the Marshall Tucker Band, but it’s a bit more of a stretch to hear them apply their voices and laidback sports-bar folk-rock to Sade, Spiritualized, and the Numero Group’s Eccentric Soul series. What works so well for ""This Must Be the Place"" has a flattening effect on these other selections. Instead of opening up new possibilities in the originals, Beam and Bridwell unwittingly demonstrate how limited certain songs can be and therefore how unsatisfying certain covers can sound. Essentially they have taken tunes from a wide variety of genres and rendered them all as blah folk rock. Or, to take a page from the bottles on the album cover: They’ve taken a flight of regional microbrews and made them all taste like PBR.","Sing Into My Mouth is a covers record by Band of Horses' Ben Bridwell and Iron & Wine's Sam Beam.

Instrumentals 2015,Flying Saucer Attack,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeaf9d034d5c69bf45b5/1:1/w_160/7aaf446e.jpg,2015-07-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20667-instrumentals-2015/,Drag CityDomino,"Now that enough time has passed, it's been interesting, as someone who came up in the '90s, to see what's transcended the decade and what hasn't. At that time, the mostly forgotten Flying Saucer Attack were important to a lot of people invested in underground psychedelia and noise. The Bristol duo of David Pearce and Rachel Brook, who were dating for a time, often slapped a somber landscape on the front of their albums—sunsets, dark trees, scattered cloud formations, blue moons—and the music matched the pastoral mood these pictures evoked. On any given FSA album, lo-fi folk feedback and whispered vocals collided with delicate and spaced-out strums and just enough tape hiss. There was tripped-out forest-jazz stuff with bongos and horns. (Matt Elliott of the affiliated Third Eye Foundation contributed percussion, drums, clarinet.) They covered bands like Wire and Suede and did a seminal take on the old folk song ""Sally Free and Easy"", and later covered Skip Spence. The first record, a self-titled collection released in 1993, bore the phrase ""Rural Psychedelia,"" and that stuck. Flying Saucer Attack recorded most of their output at home, not in a proper studio, and you could tell, though you'd more likely think they're recorded it in their backyard at night. In any case, they'd remind you, with little messages on their albums like ""compact discs are a major cause of the breakdown of society"" and ""home taping is reinventing music."" Most of their early material was vinyl only. Brook left the band in the 1996 to concentrate on her other project, Movietone, and the liner notes for the Chorus compilation from that same year featured the sentence: ""This album marks the end of FSA phase one."" In retrospect, the best material emerged from that first phase, when FSA was two people in a room. In fact, if you want a place to start with FSA, your best bet would be the 1993 self-titled debut and 1995's Further along with the two early compilations, 1994's Distance and the aforementioned Chorus. There was plenty of material after that, often in 7"" and single form, but none had quite the same magic. And, now, after a 15-year hiatus that finds FSA deep into ""phase two"" (or maybe ""phase three""), Pearce is back with a FSA album recorded solo at home and entirely on guitar. It's his first proper release since 2000's The Mirror, which was a collection in the spirit of the earlier work. The 57-minute Instrumentals 2015, on the other hand, is stripped back and spare, a series of 15 untitled instrumentals that often feel like interstitials—bridges or ladders to something else. (The lack of titles is interesting for someone who always had so much to say, even if you couldn't really understand what he was singing half the time.) The music is often reminiscent of the silvan Bay Area psych of the Jewelled Antler Collective, and the elegant, air-born recordings of New Zealand experimental guitarist Roy Montgomery (Dadamah, Dissolve), with whom Pearce collaborated in 1997 on a noisy three-song EP. The second song on that EP, the melancholy, meditative ""And Goodbye"", is echoed a bit here, though that older track featured buried drum rumbles and crashes and bigger explosions. Instrumentals 2015 is not necessarily about dynamics: it's pretty and sprawling, even when certain songs only last for a few seconds. As far as the FSA canon, it bares some similarities to 1996's Hawkwind-echoing In Search of Spaces, which was pieced together by another underground New Zealand legend, Bruce Russell (of Dead C, A Handful of Dust) with tapes from live performances. Like the collaboration with Montgomery, though, it was weirder and noisier than this new set. Some of these 2015 songs flit by without much of an impression, but then you'll get the sturdier drift of a piece like ""Instrumental 4"", which has the holy, ritualistic ambiance of FSA's best work or the clanging ""Instrumental 6"", a short, Harry Pussy-esque bit that adds imploded grit before the melancholic, majestic folk-drone of ""Instrumental 7"". But as the album goes on, the mood flatlines into a gentle, somber, not very compelling middle zone. The collection closes with its two longest pieces, the almost eight-minute ""Instrumental 14"" and the almost 10-minute ""Instrumental 15"" (which could almost be a new-school Earth track). Both are fine, but could've been shorter, which is something you could also say about the album as a whole. The D-side of the 2xLP version of Instrumentals 2015 was etched by Rachel Brook, now Rachel Coe, a sweet touch, and maybe one justification for the record being so long. Otherwise, after a 15-year pause, it would've been nice to have a little less music that offered more to latch onto. The strangeness and slightness of Instrumentals 2015 is admittedly refreshing in our age of overdoing it, and it does fit with the whisper that is Pearce's overall career arc, but when placed next to Flying Saucer Attack's best music, it still comes off like a faint echo.","After a 15-year hiatus, David Pearce of the drone/dream-pop outfit Flying Saucer Attack is back.

Born in the Echoes,The Chemical Brothers,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef95e6ef95969321d1c/1:1/w_160/d30e9d5e.jpg,2015-07-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20721-born-in-the-echoes/,Astralwerks,"""The future? I’ll see you there!"" These words come in the middle of the latest album from London dance music survivors the Chemical Brothers. It could be a sly nod to their influence on this decade’s global electronic boom. Back in the mid-1990s, acts like the Chems, Fatboy Slim, and the Prodigy were primed to vanquish guitar rock once and for all while ushering in a squelching age of rave. It didn’t work out that way and, soon enough, Limp Bizkit were dragging their knuckles all the way to the top of the charts. Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons’ radical mix of acid house, hip-hop, and shaggy psych was deemed just another pop fad. But now, with EDM festivals drawing millions of fans around the world and spiritual big beat descendants like Diplo and Hudson Mohawke helping to shape the Hot 100, it’s clear that the Chemical Brothers were both ambassadors and soothsayers. And they’re still around. They deserve to gloat. Then again, the line could also suggest something more sinister. It’s taken from a spoken-word performance by iconoclastic 76-year-old Canadian poet bill bissett, whose idea of ""the future"" involves scentless flowers, two-headed babies, and other marks of a hellish apocalypse; for every hit of ecstatic futurism, they seem to be saying, there is an equal and opposite dose of reality. Meanwhile, the music of ""I’ll See You There"" finds Rowlands and Simons once again tripping out on the past, as howled backmasking and frenzied drums criss-cross in an effort to once again capture the headiness of their own psychedelic pop ur-text, the Beatles’ ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". All of which leads us to the eternal present—the now—which happens to be a place that suits the Chemical Brothers quite well. Born in the Echoes is the pair’s eighth album and it continues the creative resurgence ignited by their brilliant last full-length, 2010’s Further, which served as something of a career reset following a decade of flagging potency. But whereas that album was marked by extended dancefloor workouts, seamless DJ-style transitions, and an overall feeling of loved-up euphoria, Echoes is more of a grab bag: Enormous festival fillers and hard-nosed club bangers rub up against wondrously bizarre studio experiments and some of the best pure pop songs Rowlands and Simons have ever made. Like fellow '90s innovators Daft Punk, the Chems have managed to last more than 20 years in part because they are smart enough to prioritize mindless immediacy. The two upper middle class boys bonded while studying history at Manchester University at the height of the city’s ecstasy heyday; they would read Chaucer’s bawdy Canterbury Tales and then head over to The Haçienda and flail about with 1,000 of their new best friends. They quoted British novelist Evelyn Waugh on an early EP title and then sampled roughneck New York rapper Keith Murray on their ageless classic Dig Your Own Hole. Simons recently returned to the world of academia (and will miss this year’s Chemical Brothers tour dates because of it), while Rowlands recently summed up the duo’s objectives thusly: ""We're just really into making funny sounds and putting them into some kind of order that makes sense … Not every song has to be the meaning of life."" So on Echoes we get Q-Tip spouting motivational pizza box rhymes over rubberband basslines on future sports montage soundtrack ""Go"" followed by St. Vincent staring into the suicidal void of a performer’s high on ""Under Neon Lights"", which peaks with a guitar (or is it a synth?) solo that searingly recalls ""Bulls on Parade"". We get the viscous funk of ""Taste of Honey""—replete with buzzing bee cameo—next to the taut title track, which features a coolly distant vocal from Cate Le Bon and sounds like a worthy tribute to the late, great psych auteurs Broadcast. Then Beck shows up at the end to help Rowlands and Simons create the finest New Order song in ages. ""Wide Open"" makes the inevitability of losing it—life, love, inspiration—sound terribly triumphant, and just as the track hits its climax, Beck wisely gets out of the way, making room for undulating waveforms that bristle and burst with all-too-human imperfections. Talking to Spin about his Big Beat contemporaries in 1999, Ed Simons suggested, ""There’s surely going to come a time when those kind of tricks—all the drops and builds and rhythm changes—aren’t going to trigger the same responses in people."" Of course, the same could be said of today’s insta-nuke dance tracks, the ones that try to cheat death by just running away from it really fast and really hard. And, to be fair, the Chemical Brothers have deployed plenty of drops and builds and rhythm changes across the last two decades. But Rowlands and Simons’ version of the future isn’t one of narrow-minded annihilation; there are levels to it, along with paths that connect everything from the Fab Four to ""Funky Drummer"" to Phuture. Part of a fast-moving culture always looking for the next high, the Chemical Brothers remain steadfast—eyeing the past and future while living in the here and now.","Born in the Echoes continues the creative resurgence ignited by the Chemical Brothers' brilliant last full-length, 2010’s Further.

The Life and Times of Raphael De La Ghettó,Nadastrom,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af6cb1335d7bf1699f3e/1:1/w_160/d144388c.jpg,2015-07-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20808-the-life-and-times-of-raphael-de-la-ghetto/,self-released,"The small Los Angeles label Friends of Friends marked its 5th anniversary last fall with plenty to celebrate. In its first several years, the imprint became a bastion of the West Coast beat scene, releasing singles by veterans like Daedelus while nurturing the careers of artists like Shlohmo, Salva, and others who mined the shared turf of instrumental hip-hop and dance music. But as Friends of Friends added even more friends to its roster, its still-nascent identity became harder to parse. Artists like Perera Elsewhere strayed from the label’s established template and significant time and energy was spent promoting lofty projects like Deru’s 1979 multimedia website. Even Shlohmo, once the label’s flagship artist, released his latest LP on True Panther, swapping in his hip-hop bona fides for prog and angst. So it’s nice to see that, with several of its projects in 2015, Friends of Friends appears to have adopted a back-to-basics approach. DJ duo Nadastrom contributed to the trend early this year with their self-titled full-length debut. Now they’re back with a new mixtape, The Life and Times of Raphael De La Ghettó, which, with its gutbucket funk breaks, instrumental hip-hop, and subtly ambitious conceptual peg, represents FOF at its loosest and most free-thinking. The tape is built around samples from an early episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. In the episode, Will joins a poetry club and in order to impress the women in the club, invents the ""street poet"" named Raphael De La Ghettó, improvising basic poems on the spot and attributing them to his creation. Though the show is sly about what it’s doing, this is, of course, a creative reinterpretation of hip-hop’s origin story. It follows that Dave Nada and Matt Nordstrom use the character as inspiration for the kind of breakbeats and samples that would have inspired block partiers to start throwing rhymes together on the spot. In a recent interview, they clarified that they used digital tools to try to replicate a loose, analogue sound and you can hear that in the summertime rumble of ""Raphael’s Theme"" and the percussive funk shuffle of ""Extra Curricular"", one of many tracks named for a memorable line from the show. The breezy nostalgia of the early tracks here would be worth visiting for its own sake, but the producers also channel the sneaky-deep ethos of Fresh Prince. As lighthearted and clunkily formulaic as the poetry episode is at times, it still manages to insert allusions to vogueing, the black power movement, and a respectful reading of an Amiri Baraka poem. The Nadastrom mixtape follows suit, revealing its depth on the later tracks ""Raphael’s Word"" and the flute-looping ""Gettin’ Thanked"". The first of these, one of the strongest tracks here, conjures up a jittery California soul underpinned by a religious plea that adds notes of paranoia and melancholy to the tape’s largely carefree tone. These more thoughtful bits slow things down, but they’re not long enough to allow the tape to stiffen into self-seriousness. The last track breaks back into raw, fun, backyard house that recalls the vogueing in the initial minutes of the episode, before winding down with a lovely sample of Tyrone Davis’s ""Turning Point"". It’s the exclamation mark on a sure-handed soundtrack for pool parties, barbeques, and other summer evening pursuits, on which low stakes are countered by the calm expertise of two producers helping to stoke new excitement for their still-young label.","The L.A.-based DJ duo Nadastrom follow a self-titled debut from earlier this year with a breezy, sneakily deep mixtape built around samples from an early episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

Innocent Country,Quelle Chris,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af5ac0084474cd0c1a6f/1:1/w_160/c73e8d50.jpg,2015-07-14 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20795-innocent-country/,Mello Music Group,"Detroit rapper Quelle Chris has developed a distinct persona over the last several years: He's the funny dude with whom you can laugh about smoking weed and sexual cardio. He's always clever, and his nasal pitch goes well with the hazy funk beats he creates. Yet his new album, Innocent Country, is ruminative in a way we've never heard before. Quelle's 2013 full-length, the breakout Ghost at the Finish Line, found the MC/producer assessing the indie grind; Innocent Country is the inner dialogue of a man trying to understand his logic, no matter how random it is. Yet Quelle doesn't fully articulate his views here; instead he just muddles through them. In a good way, Innocent Country resembles early Slum Village: The music has a cassette-worthy hiss that solidifies the album's nostalgia, and Quelle—whose Bandcamp is full of low-key gems—doesn't speak directly to his listeners. He flubs lines and trails off in other places. It's shoegazing in a pure form; he's just talking it out, hoping you catch a line or two. That's most prevalent on ""Well Running Deep"". It feels like Quelle is rapping alone to a mirror, reciting the words from his rhyme book and locking them into memory. ""I barely eat, and barely sleep,"" he raps, ""'cause when I sleep, I'm just reacquainted with mistakes and paths that are way gone."" Beneath the humor are the regrets he first examined on ""Loop Dreams"", a Ghost standout produced by Chris Keys, who handles all the beats on Country. The sound is loosely built around dusty drum breaks, and sonically, Keys seems influenced by early '90s West Coast rap—Cypress Hill or the Alkaholiks. The soundtrack moves between wistful and nonsensical moments, which leads to a strong alliance with Quelle who, across several projects, uses conversational flows of disconnected thoughts. He strings those meditations into effective one-liners that somehow stick, even if they don't make sense. Quelle's impact isn't so much in what he says, but how he says it—with a blunted, nonchalant tone that draws comparisons to Redman. There's no shortage of randomness on Country: ""Murphy's Law"", featuring Crown Nation collaborator Denmark Vessey, is carried by a lo-fi Dilla-inspired beat (think Slum Village's ""Fantastic"") where the two riff on whatever comes to mind: houses getting robbed, pork belly, stock trading, and hedge funds. The next song, ""Drugfest TooThousandToo"", is a show-of-hands survey for your favorite narcotics (""Y'all fuckin' with them shrooms?!... How 'bout the meth""). Druggy satire is Quelle's thing, but Innocent Country is equally refreshing when the rapper reflects. On ""I Asked God"", Quelle revisits some old demons while the music conveys sullen remoteness. Yesterday, he says, ""everything was where it belonged, but something went wrong."" Quelle wakes up, dusts himself off, and tries to move forward. Yet, for reasons he can't fathom, he simply cannot. ""Maybe it's the drink, maybe need to put down the bottle, or maybe I'm drunk/ Maybe it's the weed, maybe stop hittin' them high notes, or maybe I'm skunked right now."" On Innocent Country, Quelle asks these kinds of questions without getting clear answers. Certain revelations take time to appear.","Innocent Country is more reflective than Quelle Chris' previous work. He's trying to make sense of his inner thoughts, no matter how random or conflicted they may be.

Whine of the Mystic,Nap Eyes,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef6ea9e61561daa6377/1:1/w_160/e327c686.jpg,2015-07-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20718-whine-of-the-mystic/,Paradise of Bachelors,"Nigel Chapman is not the first guy to play on the rich homophony between ""wine"" and ""whine""— both can help people loosen up a bit, but they’re also physically intolerable in excess. In all likelihood, Chapman is the first guy to use it in the context of an Omar Khayyam text. Whine of the Mystic is a necessarily dense title for a band like Nap Eyes, its multitudes containing additional multitudes. This is a drinker’s album, for the kind of drinker who does so alone, publicly, poring over popular 11th-century tomes. And like most other musicians you’d associate with this pastime, Chapman speak-sings dense lyrics in a nasal, weary bray tinted with sarcasm—the content portrays him as a wise man, the delivery as one someone who isn't 100% trustworthy. It’s no surprise then that Chapman, ruminative dude he is, has thought through this image of himself and what it says about him and what he wants it to say about him. While Nap Eyes works up a Kiwi-rock rollick on ""No Man Needs to Care"", Chapman struggles to get to the revelation contained in the title—""Well, I was reading in my book/ Just so that everyone would come take a look/ Nobody even dares."" Chapman doesn’t seek companionship at the moment, it’s the noticing that gives him pleasure. Meanwhile, on ""Delirium and Persecution Paranoia"" he analyzes the meaning behind every gesture—""What am I trying to say by way of/ Eat with my door in a closed position?/ What am I trying to say to you/ When I sleep with my door in ajar position?"" Still, Whine of the Mystic is musically plainspoken and direct. There’s enough rhythmic jangle and lead twang to have it scan as ""rootsy"" or ""folksy"" even though Nap Eyes don’t actually appear to be a folk or roots band. Perhaps they are if you consider the G0-Betweens or the Velvet Underground as their respective nation’s folk music. Whine of the Mystic was recorded live with no overdubs, and they sound limber enough to let loose, but capable of keeping it together. As untraceable feedback leeches through the mix, Seamus Dalton’s constant kick drum stays just enough within the grid during ""Dark Creedence"", while ""Delirium and Persecution Paranoia"" and ""No Fear of Hellfire"" emulate Chapman’s mental cycling by vamping out for over seven minutes; they're all highlights and all come off like impromptu, extended live versions of songs originally planned to clock in at half their length. Chapman’s a biochemical researcher by trade, a career that presumably requires so much focus and passion that there’s no off-switch. The same could be said for being a musician, so naturally songs about Nap Eyes (""Night of the First Show"") mingle with ones that incorporate Chapman’s day job. ""Make Something"" could certainly be about the drudgery that accompanies both—""By and large, my only success comes from the things I do begrudgingly."" It also has him complaining of, ""One sickness of brain protein aggregation/ One of upregulated oncogene""—rifle through your old biochem notes and Chapman’s referencing the growth of cancer cells to explain a hangover or heartbreak. Granted, the vocabulary interrupts the flow of the music like tiny cork pieces in your wine glass, but they’re necessary for Chapman to establish his personal P.O.V. within music that deals in very familiar tones and ideas—at any given point, he could be mistaken for Dan Bejar, Adam Granduciel, Cass McCombs, and of course, Dylan or Van Morrison. It won’t be long before we find out the degree to which Nap Eyes developed their own voice—Whine of the Mystic was a short-run 2014 release in their native Halifax, reissued by Paradise of Bachelors in anticipation of an LP due next year. For the time being, Chapman is more inclined to question his own inner monlogue. On ""Dark Creedence"", he finds himself at mass on Christmas Eve, drinking sacramental wine even though he can’t understand the reasoning behind it. At least until he recognizes how the ritual parallels with his voluntary usage of wine as a spiritual guide and mental lubricant rather than a blotter. He sighs, ""Just get my drinking under control/ And I will live again,"" but note he doesn’t plan on quitting, just finding the right balance.","Whine of the Mystic is a necessarily dense title for a band like Nap Eyes.

Retarded Alligator Beats,The Alchemist,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3bb1335d7bf1699eea/1:1/w_160/389d9fc6.jpg,2015-07-14 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20774-retarded-alligator-beats/,ALC,"Over the last few years, Alchemist has made the successful transformation from A-list beat provider to down-for-whatever oddball. Cooking up ""GTAV"" cuts alongside Oh No with one hand and wrangling up wild prog-psych headnod beat-tapes with the other, he somehow still has enough in the tank to work with everyone from Curren$y to Domo Genesis to Prodigy and to fuel idiosyncratically great supergroup projects like Gangrene, Step Brothers, and Durag Dynasty. It's an understated portfolio, but an amazing one, and it should elevate him out of the ""recommended if you like Madlib"" pantheon onto anyone's short list of greats. Retarded Alligator Beats (eesh, that title) is another notch in the belt, even if it's kind of a shallow one—after all, it's only 20 minutes long. But since Alc's spent so much of his free (and paid) time plunging into the weirdo-sample abyss, even his less-substantial stuff finds a way to cohere. This time, it's through a dense patchwork of clipped soundbites, which offer alerts about train-derailing kids (""Retarded Alligator""), acid trip narratives (""A Million Cigarettes""), missives taken from '70s flicks like Black Caesar (""Muscular Infant"") and The Gravy Train (""Kirk Fuckin Douglas""). These loosely connected pop-cultural riffs on power, money, drugs, violence, and corruption echo in some of Alc's jittery beats, like the four-note suspense-sting keyboards on ""Muscular Infant"" and a thousand-yard-stare of an acid-blues guitar lick on ""Seven Minutes"". Retarded Alligator Beats is over in a flash, a bunch of ephemeral tracks that hint at the wider, weirder stuff Alchemist's been doing this decade. But even on a snapshot of an album like this, he can't keep from letting his love of headknock beats shine through. The 8-millimeter piano chords on ""Jane Meets Chrissy"", choppy loops of ""Holy Tabernacle"", and sizzling '70s synthesizer noodling of ""Drug Break"" all have some authoritative drum breaks underneath. That goes double for ""Voodoo"", the only rap track and one of numerous opportunities Alchemist has given Action Bronson to be unpredictably outlandish (""I'm not fat, I'm only robust/ Crash the Jeep into your crib until it blows up""). So with all that recent and omnipresent work going for him, how badly would you really need an EP-length mostly-instrumental mix of his, especially so soon after last month's fantastic Israeli Salad? I mean, yeah, it's got a coloring-book cover if you're into that kind of novelty (drawn by Nick Gazin, the guy behind the Run the Jewels artwork), but otherwise we're not hurting for Alchemist releases. Still, getting a little slice more is fine, really. What with being put out on his own odds-and-ends-heavy label and having a pretty low-stakes whateverish feel to it, Retarded Alligator Beats is a fun diversion that feels like it was made in an afternoon, not out of some kind of first-draft laziness, but because Alchemist's gotten to the point where the trip from inspiration to production feels more-or-less instantaneous.","Only 20 minutes long, this instrumental EP of beats by Alchemist hints at the wider, weirder stuff the producer has been doing this decade.

Something More Than Free,Jason Isbell,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae965e6ef95969321c8a/1:1/w_160/144b2195.jpg,2015-07-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20648-something-more-than-free/,Southeastern,"Jason Isbell's fifth studio album opens with a familiar face. The narrator of the cheery ""If It Takes a Lifetime"" is a man settling down after years on the road, adjusting to an empty house and a dead-end job while acclimating to the lowered expectations of a lonely life. The song's chief conflict is summed up by the line, ""I keep my spirits high, find happiness by and by."" There's more than a little bit of Isbell the touring musician and recovering alcoholic in that narrator, not only in the lines about the road (""I thought the highway loved me but she beat me like a drum"") but also in the references to not drinking (""I don't keep liquor here, never cared for wine or beer""). ""If It Takes a Lifetime"" sounds like Isbell playing a game of What If: What if his solo career hadn't taken off after he departed the Drive-By Truckers eight years ago? What if he hadn't emerged as one of the most popular voices in the thriving Americana movement? What if he had just settled down in one of the small towns he depicts so vividly in his lyrics? It's a fine song, sporting a spare, defiantly upbeat arrangement and a melody that celebrates rather than laments the narrator's situation. With an eye for telling details that accrue into specific settings and characters, Isbell is one of few songwriters today who can turn a line like, ""Working for the county keeps me pissin' clear"" into a solid earworm. And yet, I can't quite shake the feeling that I've heard ""If It Takes a Lifetime"" before, in some iteration or another, at some point in Isbell's catalog. Five albums plus two live releases into a solo career, any songwriter will find his themes solidifying, his sound coalescing into something recognizable and, if he's lucky, something completely distinctive. ""If It Takes a Lifetime"", however, introduces an album that contains too few surprises. These are, as usual, not story-songs so much as they are character sketches: Very little happens beyond a character reflecting on past mistakes and present circumstances, which means the narrative arc—the big decisions, the major conflicts; in short, the action—has been consigned to the distant past. As a result, Isbell's narrators tend to be surprisingly passive, observing the world without doing very much. ""I don't think on why I'm here or where it hurts,"" notes the main character on the title track, who lives in his own memory more than in the present world. ""Children of Children"", which serves as the album's centerpiece, wrestles with some tangled issues in a family with ""five full generations living,"" but Isbell seems more interested in the romance of sepia-tone photographs than in the reality of a great-great-grandparent. It's an odd hull of a song, whose weirdest element is the way it borrows the female hardship of childbirth only to bolster male drama: ""All the years I took from her just by being born,"" the narrator says of his teenage mother, even though he's really talking about the burden of his own guilt. The arrangement is spare and languorous, with Derry DeBorja's Mellotron adding a windswept quality to the music. Isbell and producer Dave Cobb put that instrument to fine use on Southeastern, where it played like a jerry-rigged orchestra and conveyed an immense sense of isolation. On ""Children"", however, the ersatz strings generate only ersatz drama. In general, the music does little to distinguish these characters or enliven the lyrics. Cobb is one of the most adventurous producers in Nashville, and together they have made Isbell's sparest record yet, with an austere palette dominated by acoustic guitar. The results are noncommittal: not quite folk, not quite country, definitely not rock. Even Amanda Shires' fiddle sounds stripped of the eccentricities she typically brings. It's a shame, as Isbell's home state boasts a lively and surprisingly diverse music scene, with bands like Alabama Shakes, St. Paul & the Broken Bones, and Wray slyly subverting and therefore rejuvenating Southern conventions. Isbell is obviously familiar with the music of the region, yet Something More Than Free sounds nondescript and—worse—placeless. In 2015, Southern identity occupies the center of a number of heated debates, and few artists are better poised to comment on its complexities than Isbell. But race has never been a compelling issue for him, and while class underlies every one of his songs, he long ago stopped writing about it with much acuity. His approach has become internalized, rooted in a self-consciously literary first-person perspective. And while he's created strong work within these parameters, I still lament the lack of urgency to engage with anything too far beyond the reach of his customary stand-ins. Isbell once again shows the world through familiar eyes, but here it just feels like we've seen it all before.","Something More Than Free is Jason Isbell's sparest record yet, and feels noncommittal: not quite folk, not quite country, definitely not rock.

But the shared imperative is tension, which is exactly where Negative Scanner excels on its eponymous debut. For the Chicago foursome, it's at once a conscious goal and the consequence of a band threatening to fly off the rails. Suffused with desperation and determination, the songs on Negative Scanner trudge from forbidding valleys to staggering peaks. The players' physical exertion is palpable:drummer Tom Casling punctuates white-knuckled eighth-notes with frantic cymbal strikes, bassist Nick Beaudoin opts for down-strokes, and dual guitarists Matt Revers and Rebecca Valeriano-Flores hold back, chiseling riffs down to just a few needling notes. For a fast and barbed record, it might seem counterintuitive to cite the players' restraint, but they frequently shove out or delay anticipated climaxes and chord changes. Those moments are especially charged and frenzied – much more invigorating than if the group just cut loose when expected. Coupled with trebly, sinuous production, it lends Negative Scanner the feel of skittering on a knife-edge. Valeriano-Flores' pressurized bellow also distinguishes Negative Scanner from similarly zipped-up post-punk acts. Syllables arrive in fits and spasms, like clusters of jabs, making her titular refrain in a song like ""C.P.D."" exceptionally stirring, especially given its ghastly lyrical impressions of assault. ""Tireless violence / It decides if you submit to it,"" she projects above the arresting chill of two alternating guitar chords. ""Don't set me free, C.P.D. / Get off easy, C.P.D.,"" she sputters at the end, each letter landing like an indictment. On ""Saturday Night & Sunday Morning,"" Valeriano-Flores audibly resists the urge to yell, which hard-boils her enunciation into the fraught, warbling shout of a fighter on the other side of exhaustion. Negative Scanner's earlier catalog, which consists of two EPs released in 2014, featured a couple glimpses of pop in the midst of chaos, particularly on ""Ambitious People."" Negative Scanner makes good on this impulse with the platinum projectile ""Would You Rather"", but otherwise seems unconcerned with bright melodic flourishes. The band's accomplishments here are harder earned. ""Planet of Slums"" vamps on static notes with increasing vigor until feedback envelops and turns it to scree. The same thing happens with Valeriano-Flores' vocals,  which ascend with  perceptible effort. But ""Pity"", the closer, is Negative Scanner's loftiest statement. For an album that's so concerned with how to configure a crescendo, ""Pity"" is a fitting endnote. At its apex, Valeriano-Flores trumps all of her earlier performances with an exultantly delivered line that yearns for even more: ""Do you want to get higher? / Do you want it, do you will it?"" Forget punk and post-punk, ""Pity"" is a blasted ballad – and a potent demonstration of how tension is most rewarding when it snaps.","The Chicago foursome Negative Scanner excel at creating tension, which sets them apart from similarly zipped-up post-punk acts.

Summer Mirage EP,Chester Watson,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af38b1335d7bf1699ee5/1:1/w_160/c5bf4698.jpg,2015-07-13 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20772-chester-watson-summer-mirage-ep/,self-released,"Last year, the 18-year-old Florida rapper Chester Watson released his second album, Tin Wooki. The 28-track, 70-minute album is a sprawling work that allowed the laconic young rapper to explore the depths of his mind and ability. He had a hand in producing 15 tracks from Tin Wooki, many of which are left as instrumentals. The album is an introduction to the jazzy, downtempo mood of Watson's music, as well as his heady, alliterative rhymes. Summer Mirage is Watson's first rap release since *Tin Wooki (*he's released three beat tapes in the interim). A 19-minute EP with just six songs, Summer Mirage is more easily consumed than its predecessor, and also finds Watson better in command of his free associative, internal rhyme-heavy style. Watson operates in the darkness on Summer Mirage, surrounded by sparse, bass-driven beats. Most songs begin with a loud noise as an introduction: a heavy xylophone on ""Chosen"", a thump and a door creak on ""Deep Sea Tundras"", a flat, UFO-like synth on ""Wrath of the Guided"". From there, Watson unleashes his unassumingly brilliant lyrics. Like his obvious influence Earl Sweatshirt, Watson rarely strays from his natural monotone, and his delivery is never strained. In that way, Watson's voice is as much a platform as it is a tool for his wordy bars. The EP consists mostly of the 18-year-old's musings, both abstract and mundane. His near-stream-of-consciousness lyrics connect the lines with tangential thoughts and homophonous words. On ""Islands"", for example, he works his way from a maze to Greek mythology to teenage nerves: ""I think I'm done/ Lost inside this maze, I think it's won/ Now I'm gazing at the sun/ Son of Hades, wish Poseidon would have claimed me/ I'm at one, with the spaces and the waves, and yet I quaver breaking blunts."" Through sound alone, he maintains a logic to the mental leaps within the bars. Watson succeeds most when rhyming for the sake of rhyming. On ""Chosen"", he demonstrates MF DOOM's uncanny ability to articulate every little syllable of every word with precise rhythmic cadence: ""See, my kindness is diminishing/ Five bitches and middlemen/ Process to belittle them time-ticking."" (Watson underlines the influence with a reference to Madvillainy's ""Curls"" later in the song.) The words don't have a natural internal rhyme, but Watson enunciates each syllable so particularly that he creates his own rhyme-like scheme. Watson does his fair deal of self-mythologizing on Summer Mirage. He is, once again, very aware of the ridiculousness of some of his own claims: He calls himself a ""self-proclaimed pharaoh of the future"" on ""Deep Sea Tundras"", a tacit acknowledgement of that boast's inherent flimsiness. Like a young DOOM, Watson masks himself behind a persona of grandeur (though not literally). We learn little about Watson, but he'd like to keep it that way. We, instead, get a mix of his presumed daily activities and some pseudo-philosophical contemplations (""The moon is my conscience/ In tune with the waves and the loom on the starship""). But, again, Watson's rapping is so strong that it covers any flaws or lack of revelations in his songwriting. His raps are so enthralling that it is up to him how much of his own life he'd like to put into his music.

Don't Just Sing | An Anthology: 1963-1999,Karin Krog,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4cb1335d7bf1699f06/1:1/w_160/32106ab2.png,2015-07-13 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20787-dont-just-sing-an-anthology-1963-1999/,Light in the Attic,"""Ode to Billie Joe"" would seem to be an uncoverable song, one whose meaning, whose melody, whose imagery is so bound to Bobbie Gentry that it's become inseparable from the woman who made it famous. Yet, just a few years after it became a hit stateside, the Norwegian jazz singer Karin Krog recorded a version with a Scandinavian rhythm section and American tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon. Gone are the familiar acoustic guitar theme and the cinematic strings. In their place is a constantly dissembling jazz-funk groove: bass, drums, and piano playing against each other, Gordon riffing like he’s in an entirely different song. But the musicians themselves are only playing in service to Krog, whose voice leaps and flutters and twirls around the consonants. She effectively transplants the song from the Deep South to some other, slightly fantastical terrain, lending it a fragmented funk momentum that transforms it completely. It’s an amazing feat of vocal interpretation, presenting the human voice as a tool for musical and narrative abstraction and Krog as a formidable artist. Recorded in 1970, ""Ode to Billie Joe"" was shelved for 30 years, first appearing in 2000 as a bonus track on a CD reissue—available only in Europe or as a pricy import elsewhere. Krog has been a prolific performer and recorder, yet few of her albums—either solo or collaborations with Gordon, Archie Shepp, Steve Kuhn, and John Surman—ever made their way beyond the continent and certainly not to America. Highly respected by jazz musicians and jazz fans, she somehow managed to glance off the U.S. market, despite—as ""Ode to Billie Joe"" makes clear—the fact that she has a lot to say about this American art form. So Light in the Attic’s new career retrospective is not only the first official Krog release on this side of the Atlantic; more promisingly, it implies an ongoing reissue series that will introduce the singer to a whole new audience. To call Krog a ""singer"" does seem limiting, as the album title makes clear. She doesn’t just sing on these 16 tracks; she practices something akin to vocal sculpture, reshaping even familiar words into new sounds and lending them a vivid physicality. As she draws out her vowels and carves against her consonants, she makes the syllables sound like physical objects: keys on a xylophone, strings on a piano. As a result, even standards become de-standardized. Her finest moment may be a seven-minute cover of Coltrane’s ""A Love Supreme"", on which voice replaces sax as the lead instrument. It’s a form of scat singing, although Krog seems to be mimicking the texture and tone of a synthesizer rather than a soloing horn or reed instrument. Ignoring chronology altogether, Don’t Just Sing presents a well-rounded and adventurous artist. The comp is less concerned with the shape of her career and more interested in the breadth of her abilities. The well-selected covers (Gentry, Coltrane, and Joni Mitchell) reveal a musician finding inspiration beyond the confines of jazz, while the collaborations suggest a vocalist who engaged closely with other musicians and played off of them intuitively. In this regard, of course, Krog is not necessarily unique: Betty Carter and Nina Simone and Sheila Jordan were doing similar things nearly contemporaneously. What truly distinguishes the Scandinavian from her American peers is her easy means of abstraction: the way she turns each words into a new piece of onomatopoeia. ""As a Wife Has a Cow"", which she adapted from a Gertrude Stein poem, overlays her vocals until the words shed their meaning and become pure sound. Similarly, she fills ""Images in Glass"" with shards of syllables, which sound sharper than the actual samples of shattering panes. It’s less a song than a multimedia installation. That recording in particular demonstrates the degree to which Krog used technology to manipulate her voice, not just looping and layering but distorting it to find ever newer shapes. It’s no coincidence that nearly every photograph in the liner notes for Don’t Just Sing shows her with a microphone in her hand: Such equipment was a crucial aspect of her performance, a useful means of not just singing. As her career progressed—and, crucially, as technology caught up with her imagination—Krog’s music grew more unearthly, less and less anchored to traditional song structures. On ""Tystnaden"" she oohs and ahhs, mews and sshhhes, as though testing out the range of her own instrument; that flight of fancy morphs so fluidly into her cover of Herbie Hancock’s ""Maiden Voyage"" that you’d swear she dreamed them up as complements to each other. In fact, they were recorded five years apart. Don’t Just Sing sketches out an exciting career, and hopefully additional reissues will fill in the details.","The Norwegian jazz singer Karin Krog, who practices something akin to vocal sculpture, has been a prolific performer and recorder.

Ghost Notes,Veruca Salt,by: Estelle Tang,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af4bc0084474cd0c1a4d/1:1/w_160/eb14938e.png,2015-07-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20786-ghost-notes/,El Camino,"By choosing the title Ghost Notes, Veruca Salt confront common fears about band reunions head on. Will reconciliation be an excuse for nostalgia? Will the group be content to fall into old habits? This is the Chicago band’s first album with founding member Nina Gordon since 1997, and its opening sounds play like a knowing joke. On ""The Gospel According to Saint Me”, a fuzzy and sinuous bassline that could have come from 1994’s American Thighs burbles quietly before being cut off by sharp chords, giving way to Gordon’s bell-clear vocals: “I wanted to live/ So I pretended to die.” The sound is familiar and so is the sense of mischief, and if there’s a phantom around, it wants to party. If Ghost Notes doesn’t do much we didn’t already know Veruca Salt could do, that’s not such a bad thing in light of the group’s checkered history. From their earliest success with 1994’s “Seether”, their music was straightforward: infectiously poppy with a grungy rock underpinning, delivered by two frontwomen (Gordon and Louise Post) who were feminist but not overtly so—more the Breeders than Bikini Kill. Their music became glossier and sharper with their second album, Eight Arms to Hold You, which deployed single “Volcano Girls” like a grenade filled with superglue and silly string, and then, mysteriously and abruptly, Gordon departed in 1998. With Shapiro already having left after recording Eight Arms to Hold You, Lack also exited, and Post oversaw a few newly constituted versions of Veruca Salt with dwindling success while Gordon struggled as a solo artist. Gordon and Post are complements, tempering each other’s extremes while mutually enhancing strengths, and they’ve always been preternaturally skilled at transforming rotten experiences into triumphant anthems. Ghost Notes acknowledges this on “Black and Blonde”, the title a kind of sobriquet for the singer-guitarists and their contrasting aesthetics. Here, buzzing guitar and heavy drums underline Gordon’s angelic vocals except during the bridge, where their harmonies trill like a regretful music box. The juxtaposition makes their respective hard and sweet approaches sing, as on “Come Clean, Dark Thing”, where plain country-inflected verses alternate with a chorus backed by wailing guitar bends and Post’s scraping screams. The song’s lyrics prod and encourage, a “Hold On” for the 2010s: “Come clean dark thing/ You can breathe the air again.” It’s a sterling example of Gordon and Post’s assistive interplay and lucid sensitivity, and it’s an album highlight. It’s clear that Post and Gordon are exhilarated about reuniting, and that joy is Ghost Notes’ main theme. “She’s the flame and I’m the glow,” declares Post, and if their glee wasn’t obvious enough, the “Laughing in the Sugar Bowl” video shows an old photograph of the two burning in reverse—a reference to their 1998 split—then a shot of the older but wiser band members jamming, and the girls whispering to each other like besties, twin Gibson SG Standards at the ready. It’s an infectious friendship romp, marking a new chapter in the band’s Nina-and-Louise mythology. The most common sin here is that the music can veer toward generic, forgettable rock. Sometimes the songwriting relies too heavily on swelling harmonies and crescendos, and occasional lyrical clichés grate. “Bang bang my head against a wall of sound,” shrieks Post on “Empty Bottle”, a song otherwise quietly prepossessing and handled expertly by producer Brad Wood. “The Sound of Leaving” showcases the versatility of Post’s voice, which can be one moment delicate, a petal on water, and a bewildered howl the next. But the track is complacently constructed, incorporating a basic guitar solo and a repetitive outro that feels more like a shrug than catharsis. Apart from not futzing with the formula, the most compelling evidence of Ghost Notes’ looking back rather than forward is that some of its songs actually were rescued from the ‘90s ashes of the band. Album closer “Alternica”, a sprawling, slow-paced epic about alienation, loss, and hope that draws on dreamy imagery, is a spiritual sister to “Earthcrosser”, the final track on Eight Arms to Hold You. Not only does it hark back to the sonics of a previous era, but its evocation of a music-related space with a sci-fi name—“All hail Alternica”—is almost adorably old-fashioned. But so what if Veruca Salt’s return isn’t about doing something new? At its core, Ghost Notes, and the band who made it, wouldn’t be what they are if they didn’t celebrate their own homecoming. As they sing at album’s end, “In the end it comes around/ Comes around again.”","The '90s alt-rock mainstays return with their first album with co-frontwoman Nina Gordon in the fold since 1997. They more or less pick up where they left off, as Gordon and Louise Post temper each other’s extremes while mutually enhancing strengths.

Currents,Tame Impala,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae46c0084474cd0c188c/1:1/w_160/04192b63.jpg,2015-07-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20578-currents/,Interscope,"After two Tame Impala albums that centered on Kevin Parker's withdrawal from society, he has entered the stream of life on Currents. And he's lonelier than ever. The bemused, occasionally melancholy isolation that defined Innerspeaker and Lonerism has metastasized into heartbreak, bitterness, regret—feelings that can actually kill you if left untended. This is a breakup record on a number of levels—the most obvious one being the dissolution of a romantic relationship, but also a split with the guitar as a primary instrument of expression and even the end of the notion that Tame Impala is anything besides Kevin Parker and a touring band of hired guns. Because of these shifts, the question of whether Currents is better than his first two albums is beside the point: it stands completely apart. Parker has never minced words about his intentions, and there's a song here called ""Yes I'm Changing"". The music communicates even more clearly: Currents' opening salvo ""Let It Happen"" has barely any audible guitars and makes ingenious use of a passage where it sounds like a half-second loop is accidentally stuck on repeat. It's a despairing, open-ended psych-disco hybrid whose closest modern analog is Daft Punk's Random Access Memories—a record that cast disco, yacht rock, and dance pop as shared founts of old-school, hands-on music-making. In this sense, the album reimagines and expands Tame Impala's relationship to album rock—like Loveless or Kid A or Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, it's the result of a supernaturally talented obsessive trying to perfect music while redefining their relationship to album-oriented rock. There's more care and nuance put into the drum filtering on ""Let It Happen"" than most bands manage in an entire career of recording. Currents is the result of many structural changes, most of which exchange maximalist, hallucinatory swirl for intricacy, clean lines. As we knew from ""Elephant"", the song that Parker sheepishly admitted ""[paid] for half my house,"" Parker is good at writing catchy, simple guitar riffs. But he’s also somehow the best and most underrated rock bassist of the 21st century, and it’s not even close on either front. The near total absence of guitars means there is nothing remotely like ""Elephant"" here. But this allows the bass to serve as every song’s melodic chassis as well as the engine and the wheels: ""The Moment"" actually shuffles along to the same beat as ""Elephant"", though it's a schaffel rather than a trunk-swinging plod, its effervescent lope and pearly synths instantly recalling ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" or even Gwen Stefani and Akon's ""The Sweet Escape"". ""The Less I Know the Better"" merges Thriller's nocturnal, hard funk with the toxic paranoia of Bad. And make no mistake, Parker is writing pop songs here, and doing them justice. During the lead-up to Lonerism, he claimed he wrote an entire album of songs for Kylie Minogue and had to stress he wasn't joking. Perhaps appearing on one of 2015's biggest pop records inspired him. Either way, the external or internal pressure to keep his pop impulses at bay are gone. Nearly every proper song on Currents is a revelatory statement of Parker’s range and increasing expertise as a producer, arranger, songwriter, and vocalist while maintaining the essence of Tame Impala: Parker is just as irreverent working in soul and R&B as he is with psych-rock. ""Nangs"" and ""Gossip"" function as production segues, pure displays of ""How'd he do that?"" synth modulation that prove Parker sees himself as a friendly rival of Jamie xx rather than someone who sees a strict DJ/""musician"" binary. While the sitar-like frill on ""New Person, Same Old Mistakes"" has hints of shimmering Philly soul, there's also engagement with the dubby textures and repetitive melodies of purple R&B. And for good measure, there's a bridge where Parker makes a modern studio take sound like a forgotten, vinyl breakbeat and drops it mid-track like a jarring DJ transition—a trick most effectively used on Yeezus' ""On Sight"" and ""I Am a God"". While Parker will never not sound like John Lennon, this time, he imagines a fascinating alternate history where the most famous Beatle forsakes marriage and the avant-garde for ""Soul Train"" and Studio 54. On Innerspeaker, Parker's melodies were effectively smudged with reverb and layering—once drawn with charcoal, now they're etched with exacto knives. As a result, the singles on Currents could be covered by anyone, and Parker has advanced to the point where he can write and sing an immaculate choral melody on ""'Cause I'm a Man"" and have it sound like a soul standard. ""'Cause I'm a Man"" also puts Parker's personal life front and center in a new way. The chorus (""I'm a man, woman/ Don't always think before I do"") finds him in league with Father John Misty's I Love You, Honeybear and My Morning Jacket's The Waterfall, taking an unsparing and often unflattering look at masculinity and romance, examining what qualifies as biological instinct and what qualifies as mere rationalization for wanting to fuck around and/or be left alone. The emotional power of Currents comes from its willingness to accept that relationships will expose an introvert's every character defect. Parker's lopsided inventory is revealed on ""Eventually"", which exposes the false altruism often used to justify ""it's not you, it's me."" The structure of the chorus (""But I know that I'll be happier/ And I know you will, too/ Eventually"") makes it plain that it's always about me first. And even if Parker honestly wishes eventual happiness for ""you,"" he wants it to arrive on his schedule. On ""The Less I Know the Better"", he calls out an ex's new lover by name and plots his empty revenge (his ""Heather"" to her ""Trevor""). By the next song (""Past Life""), Parker passes her on the street and considers giving her a call not because he cares or wants to get back together, just because he can. He fools himself into thinking a new routine of picking up dry cleaning and walking around the block, which he enumerates in a mumbled, pitched-down monologue, constitutes a new existence, but it's all part of the same continuum. Currents could be called a ""transitional album,"" but what Parker seems to realize is that all albums should be so named, because life is transitional. This is why ""Let It Happen"" leads off Currents rather than serving as its climactic laser-light show. It's a dazzling, impossibly intricate song about resisting the temptation to micromanage your life. And it may be a companion piece to ""Feels Like We Only Go Backwards"". Notice that Parker presciently phrased the lyric with *we—*whether it's about a partner, a fanbase, or just the construct of one's self, there's always the tendency to seek comfort and stability rather than dealing with the dissonance between two entities that are inevitably subject to changing at different frequencies. The kicker was even more prescient—""Every part of me says, 'go ahead'."" And so Currents ends up being Parker's most convincing case for solitude yet—he knows that perfection can only be achieved inside the studio and progress is the ultimate goal outside of it.","Nearly every song on Currents is a statement of leader Kevin Parker's range and increasing expertise as a producer, arranger, songwriter, and a vocalist. Parker is writing pop songs here, and doing them justice, and Currents is the result of a supernaturally talented obsessive trying to perfect music.

The Conny Plank Session,Duke Ellington,by: Ron Hart,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af22c0084474cd0c1a06/1:1/w_160/14a0836a.jpg,2015-07-10 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20754-the-conny-plank-session/,Grönland,"When the Conny Plank estate revealed that they have in their possession a recording of the experimental German producer and big band titan Duke Ellington in the studio together, it was indeed a surprise. But given the Duke's decades-long track record of taking creative risks, the two disparate minds coming together made a certain kind of sense. Plank, who got his start as the soundman for famed German actress/singer Marlene Dietrich, was a maestro at multi-tracking, creating alien atmospheres for pioneering experimental rock acts such as Guru Guru, Cluster, Kraftwerk, and Neu!.  Plank wasn't entirely foreign to jazz, having done sound the year before for fellow countrymen Alexander von Schlippenbach on the piano great's seminal album The Living Music and Nipples, the free-jazz classic by saxophone colossus Peter Brötzmann. Ellington, meanwhile, usually worked with a large ensemble and an even larger imagination for where to take it, a combination that seemed custom-made for multi-track recording. As with the rest of Ellington's rich and storied career, a combination of fate, savvy, and mutual connections brought the aging bandleader and the vanguard engineer together for a brief time at Rhenus Studio in Germany's Harlem of kosmische muzik, Cologne. Perhaps the most intriguing thing about this session, which contains three takes apiece of two different songs, is how Ellington's Orchestra comes across when filtered through Plank's audio setup. For a producer whose work is so affiliated with heavy doses of pitch bending, echo, controlled reverb, and other forms of early electronic sound manipulations in his work, it's wild to hear how natural this recording is, as though Plank—himself a great admirer of the Duke—knew not to trifle with music that writer Henrik von Holtum compares to Johann Sebastian Bach in the liner notes to this release. ""With both Bach and Ellington, you can sit down at a piano simply to go through it building chords and something great always happens,"" he explains. ""This music is so rich, and it is virtually indestructible."" On the three versions of ""Alerado"", it is the combo organ work of Wild Bill Davis that takes center stage. Here, Davis picks up where he left off upon joining Ellington in 1970 for a leading man role on ""Blues for New Orleans"", the opening track off that year's New Orleans Suite. By the time they get to the third take, Davis seems to have discovered his inner Billy Preston, taking the brass section to a church somewhere between a cathedral and a ballpark, running full stride in a way that wastes no second of the opportunity provided to him by Duke, who seems happy to let Davis take the wheel. But if there is any evidence from this session of a direct creative connection between Duke and Plank it is on the set's second track, ""Afrique"". Duke is front and center, and there's a discordance in his playing that suggests an admiration for Cecil Taylor or Andrew Hill. This song would wind up, in its more percussion-driven form, on Afro-Eurasian Eclipse, a record revered for its excursions into African folk music, Southern R&B, and even rock'n'roll. But on the three versions of ""Afrique"" recorded with Plank, Ellington can be heard exploring minimalism as expertly as his most vibrant, Technicolor playing from the heyday of swing. When Ellington entered Rhenus Studio in the summer of 1970, the story goes that his goal was to use the space to record some stock material for later use. He didn't realize that he was working with one of pop music's bold visionaries. In hindsight, it's a meeting as monumental as such fabled unions as Prince and Miles Davis or Keith Richards and Gram Parsons; the kind of gigs music nerds book in their heads. Only, for this one there's hard evidence of its existence, a coming together of a great American icon and an adventurous young soundman from Deutschland that's as beautiful as it is unorthodox.","When the Conny Plank estate revealed that they owned a recording of the experimental German producer and jazz great Duke Ellington in the studio together, it was indeed a surprise. Perhaps the most intriguing thing about this session, which contains three takes apiece of two different songs, is how Ellington's Orchestra comes across when filtered through Plank's audio setup.

Atheist's Cornea,Envy,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeeaea9e61561daa6367/1:1/w_160/051baa4b.jpg,2015-07-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20712-atheists-cornea/,Temporary Residence,"Atheist’s Cornea arrives after the longest break between Envy albums, but that’s immaterial—the Japanese post-hardcore titans have reached a point of being so embedded within their genre that they can disappear without really going away. Their splits with Thursday and Jesu are crucial documents of post-hardcore diplomacy as is their working relationship with Mogwai, reaching out towards post-rock, metal, and emo. Bands that incorporate some combination of those elements—Deafheaven, Touché Amoré, Mono, to name a few—sing their praises. They may have singlehandedly legitimized screamo. All of which sets up quite nicely for Atheist’s Cornea: it can be framed as a ""triumphant return"" and also an opportunity to reappraise their overlooked past work without having to go through the trouble of reissuing it. But after five years that reiterated how much Envy has influenced other bands, for 40 minutes, Atheist’s Cornea plays out a complete role reversal. ""Blue Moonlight"" starts with a 20-second salutation of wayward, delayed notes that gets decimated when the band enters with a typical, consumptive roar. This move doesn’t get repeated all that much throughout Atheist’s Cornea, though it’s a proper introduction in promising, ""this is a post-hardcore record that will have pretty moments."" Its means of making good on that promise go as expected. ""Blue Moonlight"" bursts apart in opposite directions much like Deafheaven’s “Dream House"", heat-seeking guitars skyrocketing towards the sun and drums keeping the rhythm of falling down a jagged mountainside. Meanwhile, the twin guitars of ""Ignorant Rain at the End of the World"" swordfight like early Thursday, swift clashes of sharp, clanging metal. Closer ""Your Heart and My Hand"" damn near namechecks an Explosions in the Sky song with its title alone, to say nothing of the tremolo-picked clean leads and drum crescendos and everything else that causes ""cinematic!"" and ""epic!"" to be dug out of critical wordbanks like a reflexive, glassy-eyed dig into a bag of popcorn. Fortunately, the specific textures of Tetsuya Fukagawa’s vocals aren’t as easy to imitate as Envy’s pedalboard setup. Compared to most of his peers, Fukagawa has a squat, muscular, and ugly tone rather than something shrieking or abrasive. Especially as the band becomes more slickly produced, Envy songs are immiscible mixtures where the vocals always rise to the top. It can be difficult for non-aficionados to distinguish what makes for a good vocalist in this realm, but Fukagawa clearly has range. Not in the multi-octave operatic sense—rather, he has a number of distinct modes of expression. Whether he’s dramatically muttering spoken word, letting out a blowtorch-intense, burnt-black scream, or a surprising sing-song cadence in ""Footsteps in the Distance"", Atheist's Cornea maintains an urgency that’s palpable even for those who don’t speak Fukagawa’s native language. Still, this is a tenuous foothold as the instrumentals of Atheist’s Cornea go through every ""emotional"" post-hardcore motion. They may boast more technical precision and higher production values than most—the gleaming open chord strums on ""Footsteps in the Distance"" sound like straight-up alt-rock triumph rather than some distorted approximation of it. Likewise, the tinkling Rhodes solo in the middle of ""Shining Finger"" is a legitimately new touch and there’s unassailable beauty in the sighing string arrangements of ""Ticking Time and String"" (naturally) and the cymbal washes of ""An Insignificant Poem"". It’s not Envy’s fault these effective means of establishing contrast are basically public domain tropes in post-hardcore. But Envy established their reputation of being one step ahead rather than in lockstep with their peers...it is their fault for assuming the risk of doing these things in 2015. There’s almost no way Envy intended to namecheck their progeny in such an orderly manner. But it does get to the troubling contextual effect of hearing them in 2015 rather than echoed in other’s work: Envy just sound like an Envy-influenced band now.","The Japanese post-hardcore titans Envy have reached a point of being so embedded within their genre that they can disappear without going away.

But by the time the singer dissolved the group in 2013—following four full-lengths and a number of singles—it seemed like he, too, needed a breather. Not long after Sic Alps called it quits, he released a solo record, Wot, under his own name. On Wot, Donovan took a break from skronk and hiss, focusing instead on acoustic guitar-driven sounds inspired by '60s folk and country music. The production values were more traditional and the subject matter slightly more earthly and universal. It was a relaxed and pretty set of songs, which may have been to its disadvantage. If you were drawn to Alps' for the topsy-turvy sounds, Wot might have come off a bit staid. In this sense, Peacers' self-titled LP is a course correction. Ostensibly a band, Peacers was recorded by Donovan and long-time collaborator and former San Francisco cohort, Ty Segall, who produced the album and performed on a number of the songs. It's not exactly Sic Alps Mk. II, but there are some clear similarities. The record's eerie psychedelic pop strikes a similar balance of order and chaos, with songs that rev up only to be subverted by detours into dissonance and static. The music is often wobbly and disjointed, with tracks like ""Mary Jane/Glorious Sunrise"" and ""Drama Ensues"" congealing into a groove only to vaporize with little resolution. The musical reference points have shifted away from Bob Dylan and back toward Syd Barrett and Tronics. As a singer, Donovan has exited his folkie phase and returned to his old self—tuneful, but disturbed, like a zombie Marc Bolan. And the bad vibes abound. Bitterness was a key component of Sic Alps. Living in a rapidly gentrifying San Francisco, Donovan and his bandmates sounded like defiant weirdo survivors, fending off a rising tide of dotcom normies. As their hometown buffed up, they staked a claim in the psychedelic fringe, willful outsiders keeping the candle lit for the city's storied '60s subculture. The band's final EP came with the epigraph, ""Digger gold vs. Google dorm. Real SF will rise again."" Peacers feels like a continuation of that attitude, though apart from one or two moments—closing cut ""Super Francisco""—it's rare that the message is clearly stated. Rather, it's implied in the disquieting and rubbery nature of the music. Donovan's songs plot out a course toward a grimmer, grimier, and freakier world. And depending on your perspective, that may be an attractive destination.","Peacers is the project of former Sic Alps frontman Mike Donovan, and their self-titled record was made alongside his San Francisco cohort Ty Segall.

Key Markets,Sleaford Mods,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3713d197565213a245/1:1/w_160/af08cc8b.jpg,2015-07-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20770-key-markets/,Harbinger Sound,"Jason Williamson's speaking voice is gloriously bilious: hoarse with fury, spraying plosives everywhere, turning up the kinked corners of his East Midlands accent as far as they'll go, cramming syllables into every line because nobody's going to fooken shut him up, mate. It's the cornerstone of Sleaford Mods' sound, underscored by double-tracking on crucial phrases; the music behind it is loops made by Andrew Fearn, the other half of the band, mostly from blunt basement-rock bass and drums. (On stage, the two of them are a delightful contrast: Williamson burning-eyed and venting, Fearn hanging back with a beer in his hand, bobbing his head and not even pretending to do more than press the start button at the beginning of each song.) Williamson and Fearn are both weary-looking white guys in their mid-forties, and they've been kicking around the music world long enough to not have an iota of idealism about it. The title of *Key Markets—*something between Sleaford Mods' third album and their ninth, depending on how you count—refers to a '70s-era supermarket, but it's also a canny reference to the way the band has been clawing its way up in the British music scene. It's been less than a year since Williamson was able to quit his day job as a ""benefits adviser,"" which provided the raw material for both their best-known older song, ""Jobseeker"", and the new album's ""Face to Faces"": ""Free money, mate, just fill in the form and if you can't then I can 'elp ya."" The state of a working class that politics have kicked in the face over and over is the central subject of Williamson's topical, allusive, syllable-drunk lyrics. His mocking rants spool out like bog roll yanked by a cat, occasionally rhyming, miraculously snapping into sync with Fearn's beats. ""Miliband got hit with the ugly stick, not that it matters/ The chirping cunt obviously wants the country in tatters,"" Williamson spits on ""In Quiet Streets""; it's not quite Eminem-caliber for either invective or internal rhyme, and it arrives two months after Ed Miliband resigned as Leader of the Labour Party, but it'll do. (Likewise, you need to have a fairly deep knowledge of both British politics and Britpop to parse a couplet from ""Rupert Trousers"": ""Idiots visit submerged villages in 200-pound wellies, spitting out fine cheese made by that tool from Blur/ Even the drummer’s a fuckin' MP: fuck off, you cunt, sir."") Sometimes Williamson sings, after a fashion, which is where Key Markets gets weird, in much the same way that early Fall records got weird when Mark E. Smith tried to carry a tune. (The creepily catchy ""Tarantula Deadly Cargo"", which may or may not be a scatological joke, would fit right in on the Fall's Dragnet, especially Fearn's asthmatic guitar plinks.) ""No One's Bothered"" is another sung one, the closest thing here to the form of the '70s punk that's deeply embedded in Sleaford Mods' art, and it's built on a smart trick from Fearn. His rhythm track is a three-minute extension of a punk song's bolting bass-and-drums intro, a loop of the few seconds before the guitar inevitably dives in—which it never does here. ""You're trapped? Me too,"" Williamson snaps. ""Alienation? No one's bothered."" The punk rock on which Williamson and Fearn grew up promised a lot of catharses that weren't actually forthcoming, so they don't even hint at those. But they've adopted its raw elements—crudity, spittle, black humor and unpretty voices—as durable tools to express discontent.","The title of *Key Markets—*something between Sleaford Mods' third album and their ninth, depending on how you count—refers to a '70s-era supermarket, but it's also a canny reference to the way the post-punk duo's been clawing its way up in the British music scene.

6613 EP,DJ Rashad,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af16ea9e61561daa63b3/1:1/w_160/1e729247.jpg,2015-07-10 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20743-6613-ep/,Hyperdub,"It's a safe bet that there are hundreds of EPs' worth of unreleased material from the late, great DJ Rashad, the beloved figurehead of Chicago's Teklife crew. Rashad Harden, along with lifelong friend and collaborator DJ Spinn, was at the forefront of footwork's manifest destiny until his tragic death last year; his last full-length release, 2013's Double Cup, is often considered the genre's high watermark. Posthumous four-track EP 6613 is the icon's first solo Hyperdub release since that album, and it arrives in a year overflowing with stellar footwork releases, as though some higher power attuned to avant garde dance music felt sorry for the world's loss. There's been Dark Energy, a vision from Gary producer Jlin's apocalyptic Afrofuture, and most recently, scene godfather RP Boo's Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints, its abstracted, essentialized structures evoking De Stijl compositions. In comparison, 6613 feels like comfort food—a return to Rashad's soulful side, though not without its own dark corners. The EP's four tracks form a gradient of intensity, shifting gradually from cheery and familiar to aggressive and disorienting. ""CCP2"", in collaboration with Spinn, eases us in with juked-out block party fare. Given warmth by Rashad's signature Rhodes melodies and punctuated by giddy whoops, it's the kind of track that can serve as a gateway drug to those used to four-on-the-floor patterns. (According to Spinn, he and Rashad used to call these ""grease tracks,"" stuff to lubricate the rawer, more rhythmically complicated tracks for unfamiliar club-goers.) Standout track ""Cause I Know U Feel,"" featuring DJ Gant-Man, is built around an jacked-up sample of Alicia Myers' 1984 disco jam ""You Got the Best of Me (Say, Say, Say)"" that dissolves into heavily-filtered, arpeggiated synth wails. The sweet, coy original becomes belligerent and overpowering, an innocent crush snowballing into obsession. 6613's second half breaks from the soulfulness, channeling a mood closer to the twitchy menace of 2013 cut ""I Don't Give a Fuck"". ""Ya Hot"", featuring Spinn and Teklife's Bay Area ambassador Taso, explodes with trap-style 808 patterns gone rogue; just as things start to get claustrophobic, a clearing opens, and whirring drum'n'bass rhythms creep into the open space. On ""Do Not Fuck""—a family affair that includes Taso, Spinn, and DJ Manny—Rashad somehow anticipated the current ubiquity of the Kill Bill siren in Atlanta rap, which spin and stutter over what sounds like the Ghost Valley level in ""Super Mario Kart"". It feels like an encroaching panic attack—although if some intrepid DJ doesn't blend it out of a 56 Nights cut in some after-hours warehouse in the coming months, this summer will have been for naught. If anything, this collection feels more of a piece with Rashad's Teklife Vol. 1: Welcome To The Chi from 2012 than the smoothed-out, syrupy vibes of Double Cup. That album housed the original version of ""CCP""; elsewhere, bright-eyed, polo-sporting Kanye snippets turn menacing and plaintive Gil Scott-Heron samples rumble and thrash. That was always Rashad's essential dichotomy: warm, contagious soul, reality-checked by punishing catharsis. In that way, his music not only echoed his own spirit, but the city he put on his back for so long.","The posthumous four-track EP 6613 is the footwork icon's first solo Hyperdub release since 2013's Double Cup. It feels like comfort food—a return to Rashad’s soulful side, though not without its own dark corners.

Cemetery Highrise Slum,Creepoid,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af0dc0084474cd0c19d8/1:1/w_160/efe5d854.jpg,2015-07-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20735-cemetery-highrise-slum/,Collect,"Midway through their new album, Creepoid's Pat Troxell proclaims that he is ""So sick, so worthless"" before waiting a beat and offering: ""What you see is what you get."" It scans as the Twitter bio of an ornery teenager, but this Savannah-via-Philadelphia band are well-versed in the art of translating ""the feels"" into a dissonant mix of grunge, psychedelia, and shoegaze, a chameleonic sound that's enabled them to tour with everyone from alternative rock bands (the Kills, Balance and Composure) to spacey outfits (Wooden Shjips, Marriages) to punks (Against Me!, Refused). Misery loves company, after all. Creepoid's first two albums, 2011's Horse Heaven and 2014's self-titled LP, revealed a heavy debt to '90s alt-rock—particularly Sonic Youth and Garbage, thanks to the shared vocal duties of Sean Miller and bassist Anna Troxell. The former's scratchy coo provides counterpart to the latter's airy moans, and by matching those subtle harmonies to seething, grungy backgrounds (as well as employing sonic quirks, like using a reel-to-reel tape machine from the '50s to record their debut EP), Creepoid have heretofore been able to avoid the paint-by-numbers redundancy suffered by similarly nostalgic peers such as Superheaven. It's a shame, then, to see them regress on their newest record, Cemetery Highrise Slum: a set of depressive shoegaze tunes that captures the sound without catching the spirit. Creepoid's exodus from Philly's DIY punk scene to one of the nation's most infamous sludge-metal strongholds bears the expected sonic hallmarks: swampy, heavy bass, percolating guitars, slower tempos. On tracks like ""Here"" and ""Calamine"", the foursome surrender to their own plodding grooves, coasting along on waves of reverb and letting the notes fall as they may. They're not averse to earworms: With its mournful guitars and Pumpkins-reminiscent churn, opener ""American Smile"" sounds tailor-made for coasting down roads on a summer's night; its chorus' directive to ""cough at the moon"" provides a welcome touch of morbid humor. Miller's drowsy tenor suits itself well to the band's lazy-river tempos, but the frequency and insistence with which he slides around the melody grows wearisome by the third track, and downright annoying by the end. Coupled with the meandering nü-gaze of ""Tell the Man"" and ""Eating Dirt"" (the latter of which swipes from Nirvana's ""Very Ape""), Miller's disdain for a solid, sustained lead vocal translates into a vague, often directionless listening experience, as well as an act of overcompensation for an unremarkable voice (though it bears mentioning Troxell's high, clean soprano provides welcome, but infrequent relief). And then there are the lyrics—for every ""cough at the moon,"" there's a muttered clunker like ""you shake my heart"" right behind it, indifferently delivered, an aural  ¯\(ツ)/¯. There's something to be said for the band's devotion to disorientation: it's a fucked-up record for fucked-up people, and its inherent queasiness is a part of its charm, not unlike Title Fight's similarly-woozy Hyperview. But whereas that band used shoegaze and sludge as references and jumping-off points, Creepoid treat it like the whole point, and the album grows wearying long before it's over.","The Savannah-via-Philadelphia band Creepoid offer a dissonant mix of grunge, psychedelia, and shoegaze. Their first two albums revealed a heavy debt to '90s alt-rock, and their new collection, Cemetery Highrise Slum, showcases a devotion to disorientation.

All Is Illusory,The Velvet Teen,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af2b9d034d5c69bf4685/1:1/w_160/3d870313.jpg,2015-07-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20761-all-is-illusory/,Topshelf,"Though All Is Illusory is the Velvet Teen’s first LP in nine years and is being released on a trendsetting label, I’m not sure it could be accurately called ""highly anticipated."" The California quartet released a few solid records of experimental, mid-aughts indie pop that were easy to overlook because they never quite fit into any sort of trend or local scene. In fact, their biggest moment since 2006 was probably accidental: they may have been momentarily confused with the German band Velveteen, who generated a brief period of notoriety in 2008 by disguising their own album as a ""leaked"" advance copy of Death Cab For Cutie’s Narrow Stairs (the Velvet Teen’s debut Out of the Fierce Parade was produced by former Death Cab guitarist Chris Walla). But the lack of expectations actually can benefit All Is Illusory by allowing Velvet Teen to establish a new identity. Topshelf has relaunched the careers of certified emo O.G.s Braid and the Jazz June and introduced them to younger fans drawn in by the leaders of the new school. Does this mean the Velvet Teen have been grandfathered into the genre? All Is Illusory suggests they have, but in an unexpected way—it might be the only record to ever fit into emo based solely on its drums. The Velvet Teen became a much more interesting band with the addition of Casey Deitz in 2006 and he’s been allowed the opportunity to serve as a de facto voice in addition to Judah Nagler. Deitz applies the spectacular technique of speed metal to everything you could learn from listening to Jawbox, Braid, the Promise Ring, and American Football records just for the rhythm sections—channeling the urgent, kinetic and unpredictable physicality that distinguished these bands from the more staid and slack ""college rock"" of the mid-to-late '90s. To clarify, Nagler has proven quite adept at the spirited, unhinged singing of this style, though it appears he may have taking a few vocal lessons since the Velvet Teen's quietly released 2010 EP No Star. He’s still as much of a belter as he was on Cum Laude!, only now he removes the distorted mic filters and projects into Buckley-esque ululations, dusky mutters and, on ""The Manifest"", a vocoder. Taken out of context, Nagler now sounds like he could’ve fronted one of those ""next Radiohead"" Brit-rock bands that cropped up at the turn of the century. As it turns out, his unorthodox, Yorke-ish means of enunciation and pronunciation also tends to wad up lyrics which might actually be better off being misunderstood. Lean into what Nagler’s actually saying and finicky, self-impressed bon mots cut against the plaintive narrator: ""Oh, finally a taste/ Words fall from my ellipses,"" ""If you can take my chaos, baby/  I’ll map your terrain."" That said, ""I was made from dust/ Call me Macgyver,"" makes me think he appreciates Dipset deep cuts. But this is Dietz’s album, and the emotional status of All Is Illusory is best demonstrated by actions rather than words. Deitz underlines the instability and wanderlust evoked by ""Sonreo"", as tricky fills and pivots allow him to keep pace with a player piano having a nervous breakdown. Erratic bursts of double time and pounded open hi-hats express the romantic hopelessness on ""Eclipses"", while the impulsive ""You Were the First"" is power pop played like a noise duo—it could pass for Vampire Weekend being covered by Lightning Bolt or vice versa. Either way, I'm not sure I've heard anything quite like it. Otherwise, I can say I have heard All Is Illusory before and you likely have as well if you lived through the mid-2000s and owned a record or two released on Barsuk. ""Pecos"" and ""Sonreo"" take after Menomena’s idea of pop collage, big, whirling synth loops, cut-and-paste production, and chunky percussion that focus on the band’s process rather than persona. But All Is Illusory is too reliant on Deitz’s involvement, and it slumps whenever he has to play a supporting role rather than the lead. Oddly enough, this doesn’t occur during the nearly 11 minutes taken up by ""Taken Over"", where the insistent, patience-testing repetition of its doleful melody is the entire point. Instead, ""The Giving In"" and ""Church or State"" are typical ""atmospheric"" mid-album padding, Deitz assigned to swaying waltz time and staid rattle and hum while backing pealing, gleaming Edge guitars. For all of their upgraded production, instrumental technique, and influences, All Is Illusory sounds like a record that primes the Velvet Teen to succeed around the time Cum Laude! was released—but making the best ""2006 indie rock"" record of 2015 makes them stand out in a way that they hadn’t managed yet.","The California experimental indie pop quartet the Velvet Teen never quite fit into any trend or local scene. Featuring the urgent, kinetic, and unpredictable drumming of Casey Deitz and a refined vocal approach by Judah Nagler, their first LP in nine years finds them establishing a new identity.

Ego Death,The Internet,by: Craig Jenkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af479d034d5c69bf46bf/1:1/w_160/64f3a61a.jpg,2015-07-09 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20783-ego-death/,Odd Future,"The renewed critical interest in soul and R&B music that sprung up around the rise of Miguel, Frank Ocean, and the like over the last four years has helped award some much-deserved prestige on the form after years of undue neglect, but the push broke as much as it fixed. The music commands more respect now, but the accolades are disproportionately showered on a boy’s club of talented, offbeat songwriters circuitously linked together under the banner of ""alternative R&B"" by little else than the fact they all had very good albums out the same year. ""Alt-R&B"" isn’t just circuitous, though; it’s not real. Cordoning off and lionizing an alternative quadrant of R&B dismisses gifted but traditional singers like K. Michelle as plebeian, and worse, it carries the subtle insinuation that this music can’t be—and hasn’t always been—delightfully weird. California soul collective the Internet frequently weather the alternative R&B tag, but hopefully their new album Ego Death will help shake the descriptor. It made sense around the group’s 2011 debut Purple Naked Ladies, a quiet collaboration between Odd Future affiliates Syd tha Kyd and Jet Age of Tomorrow architect Matt Martians. On Purple, Syd stepped out of her role as Odd Future’s house engineer into that of singer-songwriter for a batch of quirky, sometimes-crass tunes about the peaks and pitfalls of love and sex. Since then, Syd and Matt have expanded the project into a fully functional band. While the arrangements grew more accomplished between Purple and 2013’s Feel Good, the songwriting lagged, sultry and intimate, if, at times, not much else. Syd comes into her own as a writer on Ego Death, and the band steps up and reins Feel Good’s jazz-chords-for-jazz-chords’-sake extravagance into tight, hooky hip-hop soul. Ego Death is both spare and quietly musical, its crisp low end anchored in hip-hop as the rest of the band coolly branches out into jazz, funk, and rock. Think of it as an offspring of early neo-soul pillars like Groove Theory and Maxwell’s Urban Hang Suite, bedroomy but also lush and progressive. Ego Death is leagues too studiously retro to fit anyone’s idea of ""alternative,"" but it’s still plenty odd. These songs frequently take hard, unexpected turns: Opener ""Get Away"" is a tribal bass and percussion stomp in the verses (twice as sinister live) but gossamer and pretty around the choruses. ""Gabby""’s hip-hop strut melts into a psychedelic waltz-timed coda adorned with pretty, wordless melodies from Janelle Monáe. ""Girl"", the album’s Kaytranada-assisted centerpiece, hangs spectral keys over thick, heavy bass until the groove trails off into a spacey interlude. Ego Death’s short cuts get straight to the point, while the longer ones tease out instrumental sections without coming apart at the seams. The economic, purposeful instrumentation clears ample room to showcase Syd’s writing, and she’s got a war story here for every stage of love and loss: ""Special Affair"" and ""Go With It"" are horned-up player’s anthems (""Fuck what’s in your phone, I wanna take you home.""), while ""Get Away"" and ""Under Control"" beg a suspicious lover to stop nagging about girls she’s not cheating with. ""Girl"" is the big syrupy cohabitation ballad, the song couples will hug and sway through at the live show, but ""Partners in Crime Part Three"" raises the stakes, testing our duo’s mettle with a Thelma & Louise police chase. Syd taunts an old flame on ""Just Sayin/I Tried"", chanting ""You fucked up,"" but ultimately coming to peace with the break because she did everything in her power to stop it. Parsing Syd’s lyrics can feel like eavesdropping on a lover’s quarrel in a restaurant; she’s adept at tackling complex matters of the heart in a voice that’s both relatable and conversational. The Internet’s songs have always felt like scenes of salaciousness happening just out of earshot. Ego Death finally pulls us into the maelstrom.","On the Internet's third album, which features guest spots from Janelle Monáe, Vic Mensa, and Tyler, the Creator, Syd tha Kyd comes into her own as a writer. The band's purposeful instrumentation clears room to showcase her words, and she has a war story for every stage of love and loss.

FWA,Lil Wayne,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af5bea9e61561daa6435/1:1/w_160/36707d95.png,2015-07-09 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20796-fwa/,self-released,"In retrospect, 2011 looks like the turning point of Lil Wayne’s career. He was coming off almost a year in prison, and the last album he'd offered fans before beginning his sentence was early 2010's Rebirth, a misguided-if-actually-kind-of-endearing rock album. By the time he was free and the summer of 2011 swung around, the thought of new Weezy filled fans with feelings they would never have again: anticipation and excitement. We got Carter IV. Fast-forward to 2015 and, after four years of hit-or-miss releases, The Free Weezy Album. A set billed as a ""Tidal exclusive"" doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. Tidal is already looking like the MiniDisc of streaming services and it’s only been around for a few months. The existence of FWA starts to make sense when you realize that Birdman (and by extension Cash Money) has essentially taken what would be Carter V hostage, and Wayne is currently prohibited from profiting from new music. But, as an ""artist owner"" of Tidal, no one is telling him he can’t release things for free. The Free Weezy Album, then, has a double meaning. For every memorable line or couplet (on ""He’s Dead"", he flatly admits ""rest in peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten,"" and on ""Pull Up"", a clear Young Thug diss song, he pulls some vocal acrobatics, mimicking Thug's percussive, ratatat delivery) there are many clunkers (""she get hard dick and McDonald’s 'cause she so tired of them whoppers,"" from ""I Feel Good""). Closer ""Pick Up Your Heart"", a tedious attempt at channeling protégé Drake, features Wayne pleading ""I don't wanna do it no more"" but any kind of emotional resonance is nullified by a goofy spoken-word outro. His last words on this record are ""She said she wanted sprinkles, I said sprinkles are for winners."" Listening to FWA—which is slight by design and not any kind of statement release—I kept thinking, ""This is what listening to a new Dylan LP in the '80s must have felt like."" You knew you were in the hands of a living great, and you could convince yourself a few songs every few years were worth saving. Across FWA's 15 tracks and laborious 65 minute runtime, I can salvage ""Glory"" and maybe ""Without You"", but I can’t help but feel like the guy cherry-picking songs from Knocked Out Loaded. The effort and energy are there but the soul is missing, even when Wayne calls back to New Orleans bounce staple sample ""Trigga Man"", references TRU, or in the album’s funniest and oddly sweet moment, says ""it’s Lil Wayne, I been this shit since Lil Zane,"" which only reminds you of when he was young, hungry, and full of potential. It all raises the question: What do you want from Lil Wayne in 2015? Because let’s face it: 2007 Wayne ain’t walking through that door. Since 2011 and ""Grove St. Party"" with Lil B, how much Wayne music could be deemed essential? Has he crossed a ""Simpsons"" line where he’s been ""okay"" longer than he was great? Wayne will always wring a few memorable lines from any song, but how many of his mixtapes or singles or features have had staying power since then? Is this what we want from 2005’s best rapper alive? Are you the same person you were a decade ago?","After four years of lackluster releases, The Free Weezy Album, billed as a ""Tidal exclusive,"" doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.

Nina Revisited… A Tribute to Nina Simone,Various Artists,by: kris ex,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af21c0084474cd0c1a03/1:1/w_160/bfc15e27.jpeg,2015-07-09 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20753-nina-revisited-a-tribute-to-nina-simone/,RCA,"Nina Revisited… A Tribute to Nina Simone is an incredibly difficult project to come to terms with. That's partially due to an inability to come to terms with Simone, whose penetrating breadth and pointed sagacity, to this day, remains a source of both comfort and discomfort to listeners. It's also because the project—co-executive produced by Ms. Lauryn Hill, largely produced by Robert Glasper, and featuring almost a dozen key artists—doesn't seem to ever come to terms with itself. It's a tribute to Simone's legacy, but in many ways, it's not. Revisited arrives at a time of renewed interested in the pianist and singer's life and art, and as a companion piece to the must-see documentary W**hat Happened, Miss Simone? (Seriously, stop binging on whatever you're binging on via Netflix and push play.) In the past decade, the flame of Simone's heritage has been kept burning by Verve Records' Verve Remixed series, most notably on 2006's Remixed and Reimagined, which put the vocal stems of her RCA recordings through the mixers and production tools of a variety of DJs. The project featured renditions that not only updated a timeless artist, but also fostered inquiry about the voice, the phrasing, the poise that stood undaunted by all of the technology-assisted musical changes. By contrast, Revisited relies on contemporary singers updating Simone, and sometimes not doing the High Priestess much proper worship. There's issue to be taken with the choice of songs here. Numbers like ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"", ""Sinnerman"", ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"", and others, while being staples of Simone's live sets, are not her original numbers, reducing much of the album to covers of covers. Sometimes these work. Gregory Porter's rendition of ""Sinnerman"" translates well, but that's because Porter's voice—plaintive but confident—is suited to this kind of material, as he showed on the stirring ""1960 What?"" from his 2010 debut, Water. And the severely under-appreciated Alice Smith provides that album's best number with ""I Put a Spell on You"". Haunting and pleading, ""Spell"" is not just a song, it's a moment of abject desperation—picture the Weeknd on his second night in an in-patient rehab facility, curled up in a corner with debilitating withdrawal symptoms, and you’re close. If it doesn't make sense to describe this song by using another singer as metaphor, that may be because it makes no sense to pay tribute to Nina Simone with a Screamin' Jay Hawkins song. Regardless, Smith owns the fuck out of ""Spell"", much the same way Jimi owned Dylan for ""All Along the Watchtower"" and Bobby Shmurda took ""Jackpot"" from Lloyd Banks to make ""Hot Nigga"". If there's any justice in this world, no one will ever cover ""I Put a Spell on You"" again, whereas Usher's Salaam Remi-produced take on ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"", might as well be a Sinatra tribute. For her part, Ms. Lauryn Hill—who perhaps introduced an entire generation to Simone with the Fugees' ""Ready or Not"" when she rhymed that ""while you imitatin' Al Capone/ I'll be Nina Simone/ And defecating on your microphone""—provides five songs here (six, if you count that she's credited with producing the remake of Simone's ""African Mailman"" instrumental). These are a mixed bunch. ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" feels like a self-indulgent exercise to prove that she can sing in French; her remix of ""I've Got Life"" finds her not singing, but rapping—and pretty unconvincingly at that. In the same way that this project is sure to leave listeners wondering why Simone was important as a singer, ""I've Got Life"" leaves one wondering why Ms. Hill, full of empty narcissism and wordy pedantry, was very important as a rapper. Yet, when she's not sounding like a newcomer doing a poor L-Boogie impersonation, she comes through with a pitch perfect cover of ""Feeling Good"", and by the time she's running through riffs near the end of ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"", all is forgiven and we're reminded that Ms. Hill—a Black woman with classical aspirations, a dark-skinned Black girl posed as object of beauty, a pop culture fetish figure striving to be a social agent—has always been a generation's Nina Simone. Still, what's missing here is Simone's voice. Even though it appears on the album's final number—full and deep and wide and light on ""I Wish I Knew How It Felt to Be Free""—her metaphoric voice has been muted, akin to the way Kanye West covered her up with AutoTune on Watch the Throne's ""New Day"" and sped it up for ""Blood on the Leaves"", which turned ""Strange Fruit"", one of the most piercing songs in American history, into a mishmash about sidepieces and drugs and being down for your n-words. Simone's true endowment to culture is the steadfast way she engaged social issues and activated protest and love in her music. There's little of the fire and compassion that Nina Simone embodied on Revisited. (For that, it's urged that you check out 2008's excellent Protest Anthology, which mixed her more political numbers with contextual interview snippets.) What is here is Jazmine Sullivan's ""Baltimore"", which while not a Simone original, should have, for obvious reasons, been put to much greater effect. ""I'm never gonna come back here/ 'Til the day I die/ Oh, Baltimore/ Ain't it hard just to live,"" Sullivan sings strongly, but safely. It's personal, not political and it's disheartening. The album's most poignant political moment comes from Common, who breaks out of his placating Black coffee shop rap on ""We Are Young Gifted & Black"" to spit, ""Mississippi, goddamned/ Ferguson, goddamned/ Staten Island, goddamned/ Baltimore, goddamned,"" but without the inclusion of Simone's signature ""Mississippi Goddam"", the line is sure to go over the heads of many. With this shaping up to be the year that Nina Simone truly gets revisited—in addition to this album and the aforementioned documentary, there's a controversial biopic coming later this year—it's less important that this album do the job by itself of capturing Simone. (To be fair, not even What Happened, Miss Simone? does that.) Nina Revisited… A Tribute to Nina Simone seems geared towards introducing a contemporary to the High Priestess of Soul, and how well it does that remains to be seen. The album's inability to get it right is a testament to America's inability to come to terms with Blackness and Black genius, which was always at the core of Simone's struggle. In that sense, it's the perfect tribute album—just not in the way it intended to be.","Nina Revisited… A Tribute to Nina Simone, which arrives at a time of renewed interested in the pianist and singer's life and art, was co-executive produced by Ms. Lauryn Hill and features interpretations by Hill along with Usher, Mary J. Blige, Common, and others.

The Wild Animals in My Life,Flesh World,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aee3c0084474cd0c199d/1:1/w_160/50bd75e2.jpg,2015-07-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20707-the-wild-animals-in-my-life/,Iron Lung,"A world dictated by flesh—the colors, shapes, and birth organs that assign markers of identity—is not one that most thinking people want. But it is reality, and despite recent strides at dismantling how bodies direct society, it remains worth contesting. The Wild Animals in My Life does this subtly, with poise. There is nothing didactic about this heavy dream pop record, but it doesn't take long to decipher Flesh World's outsider perspective. The band is lead by vocalist/guitarist Jess Scott, formerly of C86-indebted pop-noiseniks Brilliant Colors—who, alongside Veronica Falls and Allo Darlin', released some of the more memorable records of the contemporary Slumberland era. It was at the San Francisco HQ of long-running punk bible Maximum Rocknroll that Scott met guitarist-synthesist Scott Moore, of the essential queercore band Limp Wrist, known for pissed, purposeful outcast spirituals like ""Punk Ass Queers"" and ""I Love Hardcore Boys/I Love Boys Hardcore"". Despite these seemingly disparate stylistic backgrounds, it's not surprising that Scott and Moore would come together. It seems rather inevitable that folks working in genres like hardcore and indie pop—where there are typically more sonic parameters, where things are tight, sped-up, compacted—would eventually want to free themselves and make impressionistic music like this. (As with 2013's self-titled EP, The Wild Animals in My Life is out on a small hardcore label, affirming their ties to that community.) Flesh World, now a punk-not-punk quartet, audibly revel in the newfound breathing space, tugging at the nuances of candied noise, brash '70s punk, and the gauze of shoegaze, fleshing out their emotional possibilities with disarming melodies. Scott's voice is patently, unconventionally gorgeous, more grave and poetic and goth than her sweet-pitched approach in Brilliant Colors, as if Nico joined a shoegaze band. In her old group, Scott once wrote a song about seeing Patti Smith (""Cult Face""), and here she joins the ranks of punk singers channeling the cool androgyny of Smith's expressive inflection into a DIY aesthetic. On the tender, harsh, and searingly honest ""Just to Tear Me Down"", Scott sings, ""I could hang myself out to dry/ From the storm of this fantasy/ Either way, you cut my faith,"" her syllables bleeding like watercolors, their tones ambiguous and beguiling. This vulnerability and strength plays out across Wild Animals in My Life, which hones on themes of alienation, blurred self-perception, and love that can swallow you whole, all with an uncanny calm. The sing-song title track almost starts with a lightness, before growing increasingly gloomy with each verse. Scott says the title was a National Geographic headline about a zookeeper, repurposed for the careless people around her: ""I know they're ruthless and uncaged/ I know they're thrashing and untamed."" You can hear them wear on her. Wild Animals' music sometimes sounds likes it's moving in opposing directions all at once, like tectonic plates diverging. Former Brilliant Colors drummer Diane Anastasio brings a barebones rhythm section, recalling the minimalism of Moe Tucker or Bobby Gillespie on Psychocandy, underpinning the whole record with a hypnotic tension. The band only occasionally races off on an ethereal 1-2 punk blast, as on the penultimate ""Your Love Is Like a House""; ""Shaved Head"", meanwhile, is a screeching tale of restless youth with a Sonic Youth sprawl. It all lends their music an alluringly monochrome, filmic quality. Flesh World have indeed been more likely to name-check underground queer filmmakers like Kenneth Anger and Bruce LaBruce as influences than other bands. They have been vocal about their interests in the queer histories of art and literature, in paying homage and following the thread. The Wild Animals in My Life was recorded with Canadian punk pioneer Don Pyle (of Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, authors of the ""Kids in the Hall"" theme song) who is from Toronto, which seems fitting—it's the city where queercore launched with the publication of the legendary '80s zine J.D.s (co-founded by LaBruce). Were Flesh World born a few decades earlier, Wild Animals tracks like ""Poolside Boys"" or the dire, rocketfire ""Strawberry Bomber"" could have adorned one of *J.D.*s' ""Homocore Hit Parade"" pages. Accordingly, Scott says she wrote ""Poolside Boys"", the record's most stunning track, after visiting an exhibit by 1960s pop artist David Hockney. She must have been staring down the vibrant, cerulean blues of his classic swimming pool paintings, the ones with nude men against modernist Southern California architecture, with so many implications of queer desire, like vintage visual love poems. Even without this context, ""Poolside Boys"" bursts wide open, washes of reverb, color, and light that glow more with the foil of their surrounding greys, and its sublime tones feel optimistic. Scott's words are simple—""I painted/ Something for David... Something beyond the brush/ Something I liked very much""—which makes it prettier, more mystical. Limp Wrist once said they put the ""core"" back in ""queercore,"" and here, Flesh World puts the ""dream"" back in ""dream pop,"" envisioning familiar sounds in a crucially different way. Square in the middle of a record that can be excessive, albeit endearing, in its dour veil is a moment of unrepentant brightness, beauty and hope.","On The Wild Animals in My Life, the San Francisco punk outfit Flesh World address themes of alienation, blurred self-perception and love that can swallow you whole with an uncanny calm. Their sound puts the ""dream"" back in ""dream pop,"" envisioning familiar sounds in a crucially different way, while staying true to their roots in hardcore.

Houston 3 AM,BeatKing,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1eea9e61561daa63c5/1:1/w_160/054fe9e2.jpg,2015-07-08 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20751-houston-3-am/,self-released,"Houston has quietly become one of the most exciting regional rap scenes this year, though you wouldn't necessarily know it from the charts. Sure, there's Chedda da Connect's ""Flicka Da Wrist"" and T-Wayne's ""Nasty Freestyle"", two unlikely hits that quickly charted on the Hot 100, bolstered significantly by Vine popularity. Those songs are catchy, if unremarkable; the real gems come from the perennially underwritten city's new guard, including BeatKing, the Sauce Twinz, Sosamann, 5th Ward JP, and Maxo Kream. These guys revere their city's traditions but understand rap stardom in the post-major label era; they worship at the altars of Fat Pat, Lil Keke, and Pimp C but also brand themselves with signature emojis (the triple water droplet, in the case of the Sauce Twinz) or take lyrical cues from whatever is trending on WorldStar. Still, RiFF RAFF and Travi$ Scott are the only major rap stars to break out of the city in practically a decade, and even they aren't what most would consider household names. Instead you've got guys like Drake and A$AP Rocky siphoning its swag and displacing Houston rap culture while its own icons, past and present, live within their own relatively self-contained universe. The ultimate manifestation of this skewed dynamic came earlier this year, when known Houston fetishist Drake hosted his second annual Houston Appreciation Weekend. None of its headliners hailed from Texas at all, save Bun B, who's technically from Port Arthur. Sauce Walka (half of the Sauce Twinz) called out the discrepancy in an Instagram video that weekend. That Houston 3 AM, the latest from H-Town's outsized class clown BeatKing, echoes one of Drizzy's preferred title formats could be sheer coincidence—but the dude's got such an irreverent wit that I wouldn't put the sly dig past him. It's the latest in his unstoppable stream of highly entertaining free projects over the past couple years, including last year's breakout tape Gangsta Stripper Music 2, his four-volumes-deep Club God series, and his joint release with Memphis legend Gangsta Boo. And while it's not quite as consistent as GSM2, it shows BeatKing expanding beyond the meme rap that built his buzz. BeatKing's a comedian at his core, and his raunchy, button-pushing humor is as sharp as ever here. The best showcase is ""That Ain't My Thot"", a riff on the Silkk the Shocker/Mystikal classic. The guy oozes charisma; it's hard not to be charmed when he calls himself a ""sexy fat boy"" with a caricatured lisp. To be sure, he's got his share of ""problematic"" themes. He treats sex and women (and especially sex workers) like he treats the rest of his subject matter: crudely and graphically. Taken at face value, there's a lot here that could potentially alienate female listeners, or anyone not into sophomoric humor. But I take comfort in the sense that he's the type who roasts everything and everyone around him, including himself: ""If I said I'm throwing money in a song, then I'm lying,"" he admits on the same track. As always, these are not songs made for quiet introspection—they require a club or a car for full activation. Some draw from current rap trends, mostly outsourced from Atlanta: self-produced ""Holup, Holup"" borrows the Kill Bill siren that 808 Mafia have all but trademarked this year. Even then, they are transformed by mere proximity to BeatKing, whose world reflects reality like a fun-house mirror. ""Chasing Dat Check"", featuring hometown hero Slim Thug, could've been a fairly standard-issue Migos impression, but BeatKing adds a layer of playful snark to its hustlers themes: ""Niggas wanna hate, they don't make sense/ Stevie Wonder at a skating rink,"" he deadpans. And perhaps more than any other members of Houston's new guard, BeatKing reps his hometown's musical legacy—nowhere better than on the title track, the tape's easy standout. Voice screwed to a guttural drag, he maneuvers seamlessly through multiple beat changes, including a water-logged ""Still Tippin'"" flip. It's some of his deftest rapping yet, and while ""freestyle"" rarely does what it says on the tin these days, there's a gut-driven ease here that suggests extemporaneity. It's a worthy tribute to Swishahouse freestylers of the late '90s and early '00s (and should prove eye-opening to anyone who still thinks RiFF RAFF's ""I done shook dice with Larry Bird in Barcelona"" style is an original). ""H"" slows a new jack swing sample to a syrupy crawl for a love song to his city, on which he nostalgically recalls the first time he saw the ""Still Tippin'"" video on BET in '05, in that singular stretch when Houston rappers ran the airwaves. ""'I'm still in love with the H, that'll never change,"" Chalie Boy sings on the hook. It's a poignant moment, whether or not the outside world hears it.","BeatKing is the outsized class clown of the regional Houston rap scene, and Houston 3 AM is the latest in his unstoppable stream of highly entertaining free projects over the past couple years.

Lucky 7,Statik Selektah,by: Jay Balfour,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af2cc0084474cd0c1a17/1:1/w_160/c8ff9dd3.jpg,2015-07-08 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20762-lucky-7/,DuckdownShowoff,"Lucky 7 is Statik Selektah's seventh and supposedly final producer compilation album. The title might be a joke, but it also signals an uncomfortable familiarity. Statik, whose real name is Patrick Baril, has unceremoniously pumped out hour-long projects like this for the last eight years, and just about all of them feature some three dozen rappers. Earlier this year Baril was asked about what motivates him as a producer and he responded, ""It's a really simple formula: fuck with artists that don't suck at rapping."" It's a pretty flat, dispassionate motto, but practically speaking, he's built the philosophy into an alignment with a batch of East Coast semi-underground rappers for the better part of a decade. On albums like Lucky 7 Statik corrals them into an assembly line and feeds them beats. As a producer, Statik isn't the type to push boundaries. His baseline sound is manufacturable with skill: a few similar drum patterns snap into place on almost all of his songs, a loose sample—guitar, horn, or twinkling keys usually—clicks on top, and a chorus is often, but less frequently recently, scratched out of a famous '90s vocal sample. It's a recipe for an unambitious palatability, but Statik has also definitely gotten better over the last decade, and at his best (which includes about a quarter of this album) he can coax out smoother, more alive grooves than this latter-day boom-bap formula usually allows. The worst thing here is the format—21 tracks and no continuity—not the music. Statik has loosened his tendency toward a three-rapper quota per song—though there are still far too many of them here—and it's easier to down the first few tracks in sequence because of the effect. On ""Another Level"", Rapsody delivers with less flash than the rest of the bunch but is nonetheless one of the most interesting. Her oddly placed inflections and abrupt rhyme schemes have become a hallmark, but it's still fun to soak up and parse. On ""Beautiful Life"", a best-foot-forward lead single, Statik musters up an '80s pop-inflected feeling for Action Bronson and Joey Bada$$, the New York rappers with whom he's most closely aligned. Bronson can make himself at home anywhere, but at worst the collaborations can run cold, a hazard of the format and Statik's production as much as anything else. Royce da 5'9'' sounds tired of his dexterity when he often revels in it elsewhere, but there's nothing in the choppy beat of ""Crystal Clear"" to charge him up. It's easy to mistake Illa Ghee for Sean Price on ""Gentlemen"", but at least the off-kilter loop Statik builds up from a prog sample suits them well enough to share the same space. Later, ""Top Tier"" gathers obligatory and disposable verses from Bun B and Styles P over the most middling production of the album. As a whole Lucky 7 sounds a lot like everything else Statik Selektah has done up to this point; the album is neither offputting nor particularly exciting, and it's hard to feel strongly about at all. A couple of the songs sound good enough to have just gotten cut from better solo albums, but that's not a strong selling point. To his credit, the guy churned a formal mixtape series into a bona fide discography. It's not surprising he's leaving the format behind, and he's certainly milked it for all it's worth.","Lucky 7 is Statik Selektah's seventh and supposedly final producer compilation album, and features contributions from Action Bronson, Joey Bada$$, Royce Da 5'9 and others.

Make It Happen / Holiday,The Tough Alliance,by: Cameron Cook,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af419d034d5c69bf46af/1:1/w_160/cc97265c.jpg,2015-07-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20779-make-it-happen-holiday/,Sincerely YoursLuxurySincerely YoursLuxury,"2004 was a long time ago. It may not always feel like it, but it was. Think about it—we didn't even have iPhones! Or streaming Netflix! Point being, we live in a different world than we did 11 years ago, and so does the Tough Alliance. While the Swedish synthpop duo's first set of EPs, Make It Happen and Holiday, were imbued with a sense of urgency and wacky newness upon their release, in the cold, harsh, retrospective light of a new decade, that sheen has sadly dulled a bit. The burgeoning tongue-in-cheek chemistry between childhood friends Henning Fürst and Eric Berglund is still present, but the edginess that set them apart is mostly gone. The ideas are there, though, and it makes for an interesting, if a bit frustrating, jaunt down memory lane. Not that it takes away any of TTA's many accomplishments since then—quite the contrary, revisiting these first forays into irreverent lo-fi pop territory make their subsequent releases shine all the brighter. Having not only founded cult record label Sincerely Yours in 2005 (and signed compatriots jj and Air France), and reached what may be their creative apex with 2007's stellar full-length A New Chance, Berglund has found ways to push his style of hyper-happy electropop even further with his acclaimed ceo side project. And granted, a lot of TTA's appeal resided not in their musicianship—although it can safely be said that that aspect was mastered over time—but their concept as a mock-dangerous party band rife with a sense of irony and humor. After all, this is a band comprised of two skinny white dudes who have been thrown offstage for swinging baseball bats at each other and sell Sincerely Yours-approved bulletproof vests on their website (sold out, we checked). Case in point: Make It Happen's closing track is a two-minute cover of 50 Cent's ""Many Men"", with Berglund nasally posturing: ""Many men wish death on me […] and niggas trying to take my life away,"" amidst samples of gunshots and Fürst's spiraling, droning synth line. The track is a testament to the time-capsule feel of listening to these early tracks in 2015: N-bomb deployment notwithstanding, it's incredibly ballsy for two Scandinavian guys to deconstruct and almost outright parody a song that's literally about being shot in the back nine times. Imagine the social media crucifixion that would occur if such a cover were to happen today, and while a lot can be said about the moral juxtaposition of gangsta rap and lo-fi pop, ""Many Men"" is also a testament to how far TTA were willing to push boundaries to stay true to their manifesto (even if, as Swedes, they may not appreciate the nuance of an American white person covering that song verbatim). It feels like it's in the last few minutes of Make It Happen that TTA chance upon their winning formula: dark, funny, cocky. That formula begins to be honed on Holiday and its eponymous opening track, which sees TTA embrace the light-hearted tropicalia sound that threads throughout the rest of their discography while holding onto that aforementioned dark streak. It's a bouncy, straightforward uptempo dance track, with Berglund's punk-tinged sneer lending it just the punch it needs not to fall into monotony. It's by far the highlight of the two EPs, its superficially bright demeanor hinting at the aesthetic peaks that the band were to reach by the end of the '00s. ""Velocity Boy"", a Primal Scream cover, veers back into highly entertaining faux tough-guy peacocking, with Berglund whining: ""Here I come again/ With vodka in my veins"" before hitting a chorus of ""I don't care at all/ Leave me alone."" TTA have been ludicrously accused of promoting hooliganism by authorities in their native Sweden, but their take on music and violence comes from such a studied place, one would have to be truly obtuse to take their bat-swinging postures seriously, which is what makes their band as a whole so fun. Having never officially broken up, and Berglund releasing ceo's second album last year, it would seem like perhaps new material from TTA wouldn't be completely out of the question sometime in the murky future. If that ever does happen, though, their early work may continue to pale, ever so softly, against the bright lights of their astounding highs.","Upon their release, the Tough Alliance's pair of 2004 EPs were imbued with a sense of urgency and wacky newness.

Pomegranates,Nicolás Jaar,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af539d034d5c69bf46d6/1:1/w_160/0361d785.jpg,2015-07-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20791-pomegranates/,Other People,"Nicolas Jaar has had the kind of career only possible in the digital era. After putting out a few singles, he released his one and only solo album, 2011's Space Is Only Noise, when he was 21 and still a student at Brown University. That record introduced a unique sensibility that centered on Jaar's expertly constructed slow-burn rhythms and his unusual voice, which looms between speaking, singing, and chanting in an almost comically low register. He had an aesthetic connection to minimal techno and its attendant fascination with dub, but his voice lent his music a pop sensibility that drew fans from outside electronic music circles. In the four years since, Jaar has done everything but follow up Space's success with another solo full-length. He steered the Other People label, which has a busy release schedule (including Jaar's own EPs) and has experimented with a subscription service. For a while he focused on Darkside, his psych-jam project with guitarist Dave Harrington, which got relatively huge until Jaar left it behind. He created installations and film soundtracks, started yet another duo, pulled off a full-album remix—Jaar's a multimedia artist, and the traditional album cycle doesn't fit his m.o. Pomegranates, an alternate soundtrack to Sergei Parajanov's 1969 avant-garde film* The Colour of Pomegranates*, is the producer's latest excursion, and it's one of his most unusual projects to date. The film, a non-linear depiction of the life of Armenian poet Sayat-Nova, has an ornate surrealism that for me brings to mind Matthew Barney, and the soundtrack often serves as a minimal contrast to the onscreen grandeur. Heard just as an album, Pomegranates often sounds like Jaar's version of musique concrète, with buzzing electronics, warped orchestral samples, and jittery recordings of scrapes and rustles coursing through the mix. Jaar's description of it as ""a weird collage of the ambient music I had made over the last 2 years"" is apt; it's an album of fragments, ranging from abstract sound design to pretty piano solos. There are long stretches, particularly in the early going, where it's more of a sound piece than what is usually described as ""music"", but the album's second half contains some of Jaar's loveliest tunes. While Jaar has always had a great ear for texture, his music has been defined by its rhythmic sense, a loping swing that has become his signature. Beats only crop up in a few places, and when they do, they snap you back to the producer's organizing aesthetic. ""Shame"", for example, with its processed vocal and slow groove, could easily be an interlude on a Darkside release. But the bulk of the record is filled with drifting tracks that defy classification. ""Pass the Time"" mixes room tone with a pinched vocal sample that sounds like it's been crumpled up and is being dragged around on a string. ""The Fool and His Harem"" sounds like broken Middle Eastern instruments half-playing a modal melody amid bursts of hiss. ""Beasts of This Earth"" brings to mind the near-music of Nuno Canavarro's Plux Quba, where tracks half feel like something that was found on the ground. If it's not always easy to locate Jaar in these soundscapes, there is always a lot to explore within them. Pomegranates' other notable element is something we've heard from Jaar since the beginning—piano, sometimes heard in isolation and sometimes mixed in with the electronics. ""Nothingness"" is almost unbearably delicate, as single notes are played and then electronically stretched into long and thin tendrils of sound. And the record's back half features the piano more prominently, most notably on the solo ""Muse"", which comes over like a nocturne mixed with a jazz ballad. The piano tracks serves as a kind of tentpole on the record, pulling it back whenever it threatens to seem too much like a collection of sound design without any particular shape. After the textures and the flow lure you in, the melodies rise to the surface, slowly, giving Pomegranates a quiet lingering power.","Pomegranates, an alternate soundtrack to Sergei Parajanov's 1969 avant-garde film The Colour of Pomegranates, is the latest excursion by the producer Nicolas Jaar.

Pattern of Excel,Lee Bannon,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af23ea9e61561daa63cf/1:1/w_160/d5cf4a93.jpg,2015-07-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20755-pattern-of-excel/,Ninja Tune,"Hip-hop is but a distant memory on Pattern of Excel, the latest album—and the latest reinvention—from Lee Bannon, the Sacramento-raised, New York-based producer born Fred Warmsley. Aside from a few incidental scraps, there are no voices here, and there are hardly any beats, either—just rumbling synths, quivering effects, placid electric guitar, and oodles of atmosphere. It's not inconceivable that you might mistake it for some forgotten post-rock obscurity from the mid-'90s. It wouldn't be the first time that Warmsley has looked to the past for inspiration. He got his start, as a member of Joey Bada$$'s Pro Era crew, making colorful boom-bap beats indebted to DJ Premier, RZA, and the Native Tongues era. Last year's Alternate/Endings, his first big step away from hip-hop, nodded to canonical jungle producers like Goldie, as well as breakbeat mavericks like Squarepusher and Luke Vibert. To dig back through his catalog—from the whimsical sample flips of The Big Toy Box to the transient random noise bursts of 2012's Fantastic Planet to the mutant jungle experiments of Alternate/Endings and its companion EP, Main/Flex—is to track the development of a restless musical sensibility. Ironically, then, one thing that distinguishes Pattern of Excel is its abiding sense of calm. The most turbulent sound on the album is the splash of water at the beginning of ""Good / Swimmer"", which opens the record. From there on in (save for one song, ""Inflatable"", that sounds like a shuddering drum'n'bass remix of Autechre), it's all smooth sailing—or smooth drifting, anyway. He's fond of resonant synths and grainy field recordings and silvery electric guitar run clean, offering a marked contrast to the tape hiss and distorted undercurrents that lie just below the surface. In ""Suffer Gene"", monosyllabic vocal samples spin slowly in midair like the pieces of a mobile. ""Shallowness Is the Root of All Evil"" ruminates on a guitar tone inspired by Ennio Morricone and Angelo Badalmenti, post-rock's patron saints of twang, and the pedal-steel returns in ""Disneµ Girls"", a lilting, romantic miniature in waltz time. It's not all so beatific; a few tracks hint at his industrial leanings. (Speaking to Interview last year, he mentioned Goldie and Coil as twin poles of his habitual listening.) The minute-long ""Dx2"" is a steel spring swathed in reverb, waiting to snap; ""Aga"" is the ghost of a boom-bap rhythm shrouded in gothic synths, part DJ Shadow and part Siouxsie. ""Artificial Stasis"" plays his dark side against his more dulcet tendencies to spine-tingling effect. As slow-moving guitar notes hover before a looming void, it brings to mind Ben Frost remixing Low. One wonders if the album's title is supposed to be ironic: while contemporary production software like Ableton often resembles a game of Tetris played on spreadsheets, Bannon's music refuses to be contained by the grid. In that sense, despite the differences in mood and tone, Pattern of Excel is a logical extension of Alternate/Endings. Even making drum'n'bass, his tracks didn't unfold in the usual ways; they were slippery and unpredictable, and while their sound wasn't lo-fi, exactly, it was hardly the hyper-engineered, studio-perfect sound of contemporary club-ready jungle. It was fallible and fucked up and proudly uninterested in functionalism. Pattern of Excel is similarly idiosyncratic—it feels, in many ways, like a fistful of sketches torn from the notebook and tossed to the wind. Making sense of the ways they fall is part of the pleasure of this quiet, cryptic record.","The producer Lee Bannon got his start as a member of Joey Bada$$'s Pro Era crew, but his releases chart a restless musical mind through breakbeats, jungle experiments, and more.

Perpetual Motion People,Ezra Furman,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af3a5e6ef95969321d84/1:1/w_160/15e7c082.png,2015-07-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20773-perpetual-motion-people/,Bella Union,"Nothing about Ezra Furman holds still. He loads his albums with frantic energy and watches them burn down to embers. Unlike the wiry, anxious music his brother Jonah writes with the Massachusetts band Krill, Furman's music hides little behind metaphor or enigma. He'd rather spit out all his problems than wrap them up into something oblique. He's kind of a projectile singer, firing off barb after barb as soon as they come to him. A playful, hefty romp through folk, blues, and plain old rock'n'roll, Perpetual Motion People marks Furman's first release with London imprint Bella Union. It's his third solo LP, but it matches tempos more closely with Mysterious Power, his 2011 release with his old band the Harpoons. Throughout his catalog, Furman has penned plenty of songs about his struggles with mental illness and self-destruction, and Perpetual Motion People continues that theme with tracks like ""Haunted Head"" and ""Can I Sleep in Your Brain?"". It also breaches identity and politics and love and loneliness, and the inherent instability of each. Furman indulges a couple saloon-ready crooners, like the loose piano jam ""Hour of Deepest Need"", but Perpetual Motion People shines when it's at its most kinetic. On ""Lousy Connection"", Furman bemoans the emotional vacancy of a life that moves at lightspeed over doo-wop backing vocals and swinging saxophones; he promises his ""undying affection"" to whoever will listen, though he's worried that the whole world is caught up in ""a game of worldwide karaoke"". But Furman is a clever enough lyricist to hit home that paradoxical feeling of manic isolation in just a few words: ""There's nothing happening, it's happening too fast."" More than anything else, Perpetual Motion People feels like a rallying cry against boredom. ""I'm sick of this record already,"" he sings on ""Ordinary Life"". ""Let's wreck all the preconceived notions we bring to it."" Furman, who publicly identifies as queer and genderfluid, sets ablaze traditional Americana frameworks with a yearning to be seen and heard the same way he feels. The friction between his sources and the direction in which he points them sets sparks flying throughout the album. He calls out for bodily autonomy and self-love on ""Body Was Made"", while on ""Tip of a Match"" he barks about never admitting defeat, even in the face of a long overdue apocalypse. Perpetual Motion People can never sit right in its own skin, and that's largely where its charm comes from. Furman is the kind of singer who seems to have crammed so many ideas into his head he can hardly decide which ones should fly out of his mouth first. While he's deeply indebted to traditional sounds and familiar structures, he comes alive most when he's sewing fissures into the forms he knows so well. Perpetual Motion People comes with its share of misbehavior, but there's still more room left for Furman to thrash.","Unlike the wiry, anxious music his brother Jonah writes with the Massachusetts band Krill, Ezra Furman's music hides little behind metaphor or enigma. Perpetual Motion People is a playful, hefty romp through folk, blues, and plain old rock'n'roll.

Sonic Praise,Ecstatic Vision,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af0813d197565213a1f1/1:1/w_160/2d5ccbe8.jpg,2015-07-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20731-sonic-praise/,Relapse,"Ecstatic Vision want to get you high. On the band’s five-song and very fun debut LP, Sonic Praise, the three Philadelphia bros holler about an ""astral plane where our herb will suffice,"" urge their audience to forego homes and bosses for a trip ""through the astral sea,"" and demand that you ""take the time"" to ""have a good time."" They ply this blatant, positive peer pressure through spiraling psychedelic rock. Roaring organs, screaming guitars, and the occasional squawking saxophone seem always to be preparing for another narcotic liftoff. The rhythm section is brawny enough to be the dope pusher. By the time Ecstatic Vision peak during ""Astral Plane"", a 12-minute triumph where cosmic chants arrive over bulbous bass and hand drums and spirited solos spill from most every break, Ecstatic Vision’s preferred platform sounds like a thrilling escape hatch, even if you don’t want to get stoned with these or any other dudes. During the next decade, many of Ecstatic Vision’s chief touchstones—Hawkwind’s Warrior on the Edge of Time, Leaf Hound’s Growers of Mushroom, Black Sabbath’s Vol. 4, Amon Düül II’s Yeti—will reach the half-century mark. Meanwhile, Led Zeppelin’s catalog, which Ecstatic Vision reference liberally during mid-song breakdowns and through general riff-led ascendance, has survived yet another round of extensive reissues. Those records have helped build legions of stylistic descendants, from outbound psychedelic rock acts and burly stoner metal crews to bleary-eyed synth trippers and meditative new age gurus. It’s tempting, then, to dismiss an act so indebted to an obvious lineage (and so enchanted with a drug that’s increasingly less taboo and criminalized) out of hand. In 2015, who cares if you like to get high and jam all the livelong day with your pals? Ecstatic Vision, though, doesn’t get lost amid the seeds, stems, and stars. For all the band’s talk of escapism and their musical animations of such, they don’t write, play, or record with stoned indolence or mindless indulgence. Rather, like Virginia’s Pontiak or New York’s White Hills, they funnel that enthusiasm into compelling songs. Each of these five tracks breaks the five-minute mark, but three of them barely get there. Collectively, they betray senses of economy and premeditation rare to this field. A study in efficiency and impact, opener ""Journey"" shifts quickly from an introduction of pretty, back-masked vocals to a burly power-trio throb, from a cowbell-driven bridge to an electrifying instrumental break. They never surrender to their self-induced haze, so the song remains magnetic even as bandleader Douglas Sabolick steps out for multiple solos. The similarly terse ""Don’t Kill the Vibe"" feels like waiting bait for the sort of rock radio DJ who still references roach clips on air. Like Sleep on uppers, Ecstatic Vision power ahead at length with one riff and one vocal melody. The dual parts fit like puzzle pieces, with layers of guitars and noise tucked inside and around the motion. ""Take what you want/ Take what you want now, baby,"" Sabolick shouts on repeat at the end. It’s the kind of simple refrain that could last forever, soundtracking some long, windows-down drive into the sun of a summer road trip. But it ends soon enough to make you crave more, an essential tenet of Sonic Praise’s success. To the same end, the new band’s prospects seem most exciting when they fold unexpected influences into Sonic Praise, especially during its two longest tracks. While ""Astral Plane"" ultimately charges through amplified bedlam and ricochets around a sharp riff, it works the patter of hand drums into the start. Somewhere near the middle, Ecstatic Vision accent a big bass-and-drum groove with stabs of dissonance and washes of chromatic textures. It sounds, briefly, like an early version of Nine Inch Nails, loosening up and zoning out. Almost as an afterthought, closer ""Cross the Divide"" suggests that Ecstatic Vision haven’t looked for ecstasy only in American and European rock trances. During one of the record’s most evocative moments, Sabolick nods to West African guitar styles while the band around him conjures the modal Middle Eastern electronics familiar from Omar Souleyman’s Western rise. The international jolt is a sudden reminder that, 40-plus years after many of its masterpieces were made, drug-induced rock needn’t be stale, stupid, listless, or long. Instead, the surprisingly incisive Sonic Praise is a celebration of higher aims in high times, for now free of many of the worst side effects.","Ecstatic Vision’s brand of heavy psych draws from Hawkwind, Leaf Hound, Black Sabbath, and Amon Düül II. On their debut LP, roaring organs, screaming guitars, and the occasional squawking saxophone seem always to be preparing for another narcotic liftoff.

"Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints",RP Boo,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af455e6ef95969321d94/1:1/w_160/8719a857.jpg,2015-07-07 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20782-rp-boo-fingers-bank-pads-shoe-prints/,Planet Mu,"If RP Boo, Traxman, and DJ Rashad constitute the John Coltrane (father), Pharoah Sanders (son), and Albert Ayler (holy ghost) of Chicago footwork, then Boo, aka Kavain Space, probably gets to be Trane. Others might have traveled further, but he was, arguably, the first. The son of a former Prince bassist, Space's work has a deferential sense of groove; while his peers Rashad, Jlin, and DJ Spinn take footwork outside of itself and draw in outside inspirations, Space seems largely driven by the desire to inspire footwork dancers. His productions lack the polish and lushness of Rashad's later work, which flourished and matured as influences like J Dilla were subsumed—it's no surprise that Rashad's work found a wider audience. But RP Boo's provincialism and focus have resulted in the kind of cleverness needed to continually impress dancers that, at this point, probably think they've heard it all. Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints, like 2013's incredible Legacy, comprises a mix of new productions and selections from his 15-year-plus production history. Space relies heavily on interwoven vocal samples and, relative to his peers, less on rattling percussion. This gives his tracks a weightless, labyrinthine feel, as exultations for the dancers hold conversations with wailing soul samples and various grunts and shouts. On the manic opener ""1-2D-20'2"" all of this happens over a tangled electro sequence as an unnamed barker shouts out names of locals and...venues? Moves? Crews? You could probably unwind some of the references with Internet searches and a helpful Chicagoan, but I find it equally exciting to just let the syllables pile up into little structures, and revel in how strange and consonant the phrase ""Crackaplaya Boo"" sounds amidst the bustle. ""Freezaburn"" is similarly satisfying, as samples unspool over snares that arrive at odd intervals; I wouldn't recommend trying to nod along, but the sense that Space remains in control of all this provides comfort. Regardless of the lip service paid to making this music strictly for the dancers, there are moments of strangeness and oddity strewn throughout Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints, and they serve to remind how an artist like Space can end up on a label, Planet Mu, still largely associated with IDM and outre electronics. I would like to hear Space explain what utility the chirping, alien voices that underpin the entirety of ""Heat From Us"" provide a battling footworker. It's easier to follow the contortions of ""Finish Line D'jayz"", whose refrain—""Mothafuck your favorite DJ""—hands the battle DJs a weapon to toss back at the dancers, or to trace the street names called out during ""Bang'n On King Dr."", easily the most conventional rhythm on the album. The horrorshow samples that drive ""I'm Laughing""—a detuned Tony Sunshine repeating ""I'm laughing at you now,"" a villainous cackle, and a lot of whistles—are easy to understand in the context of competition, but it's still strange, uncomfortable music seemingly incongruous with a bunch of people partying. Footwork's sound has expanded, from the fevered soul of Rashad and Spinn to Jlin's noisy, coal-black intensity. Space's work is fairly traditional in comparison—its stitches-showing madness feels, at this point, somewhat familiar—so Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints is a nice reminder that footwork's version of classic rock still overflows with bizarre juxtapositions and high-wire pileups. That anyone wants to dance to this music provides an architecture for all this peculiarity, and Space is no less adventurous or inventive for clinging to it.","While peers like DJ Rashad have gotten wider audiences, RP Boo remains one of Chicago footwork's pioneers. His tracks have a weightless, labyrinthine feel, and his productions seem largely driven by the desire to continually impress footwork dancers that, at this point, think they've heard it all.

Twelve Reasons to Die II,Ghostface Killah & Adrian Younge,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aefbb1335d7bf1699e83/1:1/w_160/4c752127.jpg,2015-07-07 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20722-twelve-reasons-to-die-ii/,Linear Labs,"The first Twelve Reasons to Die scanned like gangster fan fiction. It's Wu-Tang revisionist mob history, the rap equivalent of retroactively inserting Captain America into the World War II timeline. Longtime Ghostface Killah alter ego Tony Starks—Marvel's Iron Man, repurposed—acts as the enforcer for the DeLucas, a Cosa Nostra-esque crime family terrorizing 1960s Italy. He decides to set off on his own, falling in love with the boss's daughter in the process, and he is subsequently murdered by his former employer for his perceived treachery. Starks' ashes are then pressed into a dozen records, and when they are played he is resurrected as Ghostface, an embodiment of the departed's thirst for vengeance. It sounds like something out of a comic because it is—this is the same rapper who named his debut after an Avenger and commissioned a Marvel artist to ink the artwork for Wu-Massacre. Ghostface has always been enamored with the medium, and his colorful storytelling lends itself well to sequential framing. But Twelve Reasons to Die was rough around the edges, trying to fit too many moving parts into its ambitious conceptual framework. It was limited by obtuse exposition and lazy transitions as transparent as a strip's ""meanwhile…"" panel. The second installment in the saga, Twelve Reasons to Die II, hits the reset button, hopping decades and time zones, recycling the original blueprint but recasting Ghostface as an anti-hero. If Twelve Reasons to Die is a comic, then its sequel is the cinematic adaptation or a reboot of the franchise; the source material is the same, but the execution is tightened in places. It has a bigger-budget feel—stronger guests, better pacing, and a more careful consideration for its audience. RZA narrates the passages too tricky to rap. Adrian Younge warps thick '70s soul sounds into a concrete jungle. But mostly, T**RTD II is simply able to succeed where its predecessor failed with the benefit of hindsight. With a proper framing device, more capable bit players (Scarub and Chino XL), and closer attention to detail, Ghostface and Younge do a better job sketching out an alternate universe. The key to TRTD II is Raekwon, who stars as Lester Kane, an upstart New York City kingpin at war with the DeLucas in the mid-'70s and a foil for Ghostface's Starks. Here, unlike on his recently released gaudy solo album, Fly International Luxurious Art*,* he is noticeably comfortable, penning engaging underworld scenes. He remains an asset to modern Ghostface, whose yarns don't string quite as far these days. Peak Ghostface could tell an entire story in footnotes; this Ghostface is less subtle. But something happens to him rapping next to Raekwon: On ""King of New York"" he is as graphic as ever describing Kane (""the New York mob scene is just scared of his suits""). Seconds later, Rae chimes in as Kane, and the exchange breathes real life into the character, who plays a pivotal role in the plot. Raekwon's dense, barreling lyricism is perfect for the action sequences of ""Return of the Savage"" and ""Blackout,"" where gunfire is exchanged in flurries. Ghostface is still sometimes hilariously literal on TRTD II (""Bash him with a disco ball/ It's the '70s!""), but when challenged, like on the Vince Staples-assisted ""Get the Money"", he still comes up with great writing. Ghostface is the visible star at the center of the production, but he is backed by Adrian Younge, the silent star who stitches TRTD II together at the seams with his evocative soul instrumentation. His murky production does a lot of the heavy lifting dramatically: He creates the worlds in which these characters interact, and his work gives everything that happens texture. He chops sequence amplifiers all the way through the finale. At the end of TRTD II (spoiler!), Ghostface Killah is reborn as a mortal man in the body of Lester Kane, opening the door for a potential third and closing act to this trilogy (RZA: ""This is not the last we'll ever hear of Tony Starks/ In actuality, this is just the beginning""). If there is to be a TRTD III, hopefully it embraces the format and flow of this record.","If Twelve Reasons to Die was based on a comic, then its sequel is the cinematic adaptation or a reboot of the franchise; the source material is the same, but the execution is tightened in places.

Mercy,Active Child,by: B.

Mercy, surprisingly, feels like the soundtrack to a beach that is never too far away, so the taste of salt is still on your tongue.  It sounds like...yacht rock. ""Yacht rock"" probably isn't a tag any musician seeks out, since it carries more weight as parody or flat-out insult than genre descriptor. But there's something loose and happy to the energy, particularly on the album's first half: ""1999"" is built around mid-temp pianos and the soft clicking of unobtrusive percussion.  ""These Arms"" boasts a slinking, slow-dancing drum line, as does ""Never Far Away"", where it pulses behind rounded, coke-straw guitars. The fried electronics of ""Mercy"" add a jolt to the slightly sleepy, all-around lushness.  All of these sounds are secondary to Grossi's voice, which does not sacrifice body for altitude; operating in and around the falsetto, Grossi less resembles the fragility of How To Dress Well than the aforementioned McDonald. He has a strange way of condensing out of his chest voice into his head voice, like a rising updraft, and the split between the two is astonishing. ""Midnight Swim"" marks the beginning of Mercy*'*s more active second suite; weird and crystalline, the song conjures an alien beauty—like jellyfish in underwater caverns—and rides a thin line of eeriness and pulchritude. From here Mercy takes a decidedly more dance-y turn, maintaining the relaxed vibe while amping up the tempo. ""Temptation"" is sexy, carried on the strains of organs in lieu of harps, one hagiographic instrument swapped for another. It's a stronger sound, yet still casual; like the album itself, it seems just shallow enough to wade into and just deep enough to linger awhile.  Mercy is studiously lovely, like a brochure for paradise, and over its course it begins to feels like a sunset in Grand Theft Auto V: beautiful, but a replica.","Active Child's Mercy feels like the soundtrack to a beach that is never too far away, so the taste of salt is still on your tongue.

Glider,Heather Woods Broderick,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af14ea9e61561daa63b0/1:1/w_160/e39b3a02.jpg,2015-07-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20742-glider/,Western Vinyl,"Heather Woods Broderick’s Glider is for the weary. It’s for those who speculate where the time has gone, who hope someday to put their feet on the floor and feel something real, who feel kept in the dark by the ones they love. The record plays like the musical equivalent of an Andrew Wyeth painting: cold and dreary, rooted in an Americana sensibility that’s completely vague in its specific hardships but crystal clear in conveying the sheer lack of company, light, and happiness. Broderick is an accomplished musician and singer in Portland’s folk-music scene, having been a member of groups like Horse Feathers (along with her brother, Peter Broderick), Loch Lomond, and backing bands for artists like Alela Diane and Sharon Van Etten. And it’s been nearly seven years since her debut record From The Ground, which played like a more 2000s indie effort from the likes of Mirah, with sparser compositions and tone that made use of Broderick’s piano, guitar, and cello playing skills. But Glider is darker, less precious, and a record that feels as if it's been bound to a front porch rocking chair for decades now. In this sense, Glider is really about aura. Broderick’s voice is a loud whisper; you’ll find her, depending on the song, somewhere between Hope Sandoval and Elizabeth Fraser. And with her voice distant and fogged, she builds a skeleton of meaning through earthy and familiar (and therefore perhaps universally devastating in a Rorschach-test sort of way) images and feelings. She’s walked in the shadows, she’s hidden a bad lover’s letters away in drawers, she’s taking what she’s earned because she’s “had enough, enough, enough,” she echoes on the title track. “Never been one to shake my head,” Broderick sings in “Fall Hard”. “I can’t say it feels good.” It’s from these lyrical glimmers of feeling lost and tired in love and life that Broderick constructs bigger affection through instrumentals. From reverb-heavy piano ballads to grand orchestral compositions that weave in and out of audibility, she does a good job of building walls of sound that still maintain an intimate, bedroom-folk feel. It’s hard to know where Broderick lands as a musician and singer. Although a veteran of a close-knit folk-leaning scene her music isn’t particularly folksy even in an age of throwback singers like Jessica Pratt and Angel Olsen and re-inventors of the genre like Sylvan Esso or Hundred Waters. Her music could easily be of the blanket-label “singer-songwriter” variety but song writing doesn’t seem of great importance to her, at least in the final results of her shrouded vocals. She might be onto a strain of dream-pop, at least one that ditches the synths for strings. Regardless, her music is deeply familiar, even if it can’t be neatly boxed. On one of the Glider’s strongest tracks, “Wyoming”, Broderick does her best Cocteau Twins impression, with the track ending in an uncharacteristically loud and intense eruption of singing and guitar. Songs like “A Call for Distance” and “Mama Shelter” elevate Broderick’s music to a more soulful plane in their quick, jazz percussion and bass-lines, the latter with just the slightest echo of dancehall flair. The album’s closing sound, “All for a Love”, is an unmistakable, slowed-down sister to touring mate Sharon Van Etten’s “Tarifa”, even in its saxophone. And maybe it’s this familiarity that keeps Glider feeling stilted. The record walks well-treaded territory lyrically and musically. It almost feels like Broderick is imitating a Walden-esque romance of loneliness in the desert or the pines rather than crafting her own, or at least effectively and personally staking her place in it. Because while Broderick has the tool-kit to make a very pretty and sad sounding-record, nothing she builds here seems to really pierce anywhere where it actually hurts.","It’s been nearly seven years since multi-instrumental Portland musician Heather Woods’ debut, though she's kept busy as a member of groups like Horse Feathers and in backing bands for artists like Sharon Van Etten. Her new album*, Glider*, feels as if it's been bound to a front porch rocking chair for decades now.

Homesick,Matrixxman,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af205e6ef95969321d5d/1:1/w_160/2d9e337b.jpg,2015-07-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20752-homesick/,Ghostly International,"Sometimes versatility is an end in itself—you make different kinds of music because you want to, and because you can. But versatility can also be a side effect, an accidental byproduct of the process of honing in on your own sound. In his short but prolific career so far, Charles McCloud Duff has tried his hand at many sounds. As part of the club duo 5kinAndBone5, he produced the rapper Le1f's saucy, sax-driven ""Wut"". In the duo Amen Brother, with his frequent recording partner Vin Sol, he flirted briefly with B-more breaks and ghetto-house. An early track under his Matrixxman alias, ""Wicked"", laced dreamy synths with snapping percussion; not long thereafter, Matrixxman's ""God Created the Beat"", featuring Mykki Blanco, took a stab at ballroom house. As he's experimented with different variations on the deeper strains of house and techno, his own signature has begun to emerge. Matrixxman's productions are typically marked by their restraint (even when they bang); their pristine sound design (except when they're murky); their balance (except when they go off the deep end). His debut album, Homesick, displays a newfound and dogged single-mindedness. It is so intently focused upon its aesthetic—dark, ominous, sensually mechanical, all hot breath and brushed stainless steel—that it feels, in retrospect, like everything until now has been leading up to this. He has arrived at an effortlessly efficient vision of techno, chilly and not a little forbidding: no bullshit, no wasted movements. Duff told Resident Advisor that he was attracted to drum 'n' bass, his first electronic love, because ""there was this alienating feeling I was really drawn to. It was post-apocalyptic."" You can hear that fascination for the inhuman, or the post-human, all over Homesick. There are no voices, no acoustic instruments, no obvious samples, just analog pulses and electric currents. The bulk of the album tackles classic techno styles and tropes: The plucky arpeggios of ""Network Failure"" and ""False Pattern Recognition"" recall Robert Hood's nail-bitten minimalism; ""Red Light District"" is squelchy acid; ""Augmented"" is EBM tinted with tropical watercolors. Some of the most invigorating cuts are essentially just drum tracks fleshed out with a modicum of silvery tone, but half of Homesick takes place away from the dancefloor. ""Annika's Theme"" evokes Blade Runner with new age choral pads and a wistful melody; ""Packard Plant"", titled in homage to a Detroit landmark, cobbles Motor City tropes together into a kind of deconstructed techno. It's all smartly sequenced, right down to ""Dejected"", a minute-and-a-half-long metal drone that serves as a kind of dystopian palate-cleanser, and even the club-oriented tracks have the home listener in mind. For the most part, they're short, intense mood pieces, and they inform one another in the same way that paintings in a gallery seem to communicate with each other, sparking new meanings as the viewer's gaze crisscrosses the white cube. Homesick is not quite a concept album, but there's a ghost of a narrative visible in the record's bookending tracks. First, there's ""Necronomicon"", which opens the LP with nine-and-a-half minutes of greyscale throb, like Basic Channel rendered ultra-minimal and unusually menacing. (That's the record's longest track, by a considerable margin, which is kind of impressive; it takes some chutzpah to open an album with something this forbidding.) The closing ""Earth Like Conditions"", sounds almost optimistic, with its kosmische echoes and its green shoots of melody. If the bulk of the album tends to evoke a metal object hurtling through empty space, ""Earth Like Conditions"" feels like an escape pod to another world—or, at least, to Matrixxman's next record, where, one suspects, he'll have distilled his sound into an even more potent, concentrated form.","In his short but prolific career, Charles McCloud Duff, who produced rapper Le1f's saucy, sax-driven ""Wut"", has tried his hand at many sounds.

Dreams Worth More Than Money,Meek Mill,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af40ea9e61561daa6407/1:1/w_160/38819a43.jpg,2015-07-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20778-dreams-worth-more-than-money/,AtlanticMaybach,"Meek Mill's signature song remains ""Dreams and Nightmares"", the title track and first song from his first album. The rest of the album has more or less dropped from public consciousness, but the intro remains a resonant classic: When the song suddenly shifts tempo and mood, and Meek jumps into an urgent, bleating rap cadence (complete with lines like ""all I know is murder"" shouted with guttural intensity), he's introducing himself as the only rapper that matters for five minutes. The ""for five minutes"" qualifier is an important distinction: Meek's intensity is both the key to his appeal and his Achilles Heel. His mixtapes are often long and scattershot, while still containing at least a half dozen keepers, and his first album, and now the second, suffer a similar fate. Every few months, Meek drops an incredible single, or an eyebrow-raising feature, reinforcing the idea that his music works best in short blasts, harnessing his energy and expending it all at will. Recent non-album single ""Monster"" is an incredible song, but I can't imagine it being on this album; it's too concentrated. And I'm not even sure if 14 ""Monster""s is sustainable or desirable. However, Dreams Worth Than More Money is still a few clicks better than his debut, because it feels like Meek Mill is taking risks. Opener ""Lord Knows"" lays a Tory Lanez hook and a typically fraught Meek vocal performance atop sample from Mozart's Lacrimosa movement from his Requiem in D, a tip of the hat to how epic ""Dreams and Nightmares"" remains but also as a hedging of bets: Nothing could realistically top his first intro, so they reached all the way back to Mozart for a fitting backdrop. He's still rapping hard-hitting lines like ""Shout-out the judge that denied me my bail/it made me smarter and it made me go harder."" It's a great song, even if it can't match the bar set by ""Dreams and Nightmares."" ""Classic,"" a typically nimble, bouncy, Bangladesh track, is an atypical Meek move: he's rarely if ever sounded so airy, clean, fun, bright, and it's a good look. In fact, the album's biggest highlights are its biggest departures, from the druggy ""Jump Out the Face"" with Future (which would fit nicely onto 56 Nights), to ""R.I.C.O."" featuring Drake, and even ""Bad For You"" with Nicki Minaj. Meek has allowed these artists to ""take the lead"" on these tracks, and the album is better for it, because it opens the record up and gives Meek breathing room. It also keeps in line with the idea that a brief blast of Meek is the best way to experience Meek. The  '70s exploitation flick vibe of ""Stand Up,"" featuring an indelible two-line cameo from DJ Khaled, is another stylistic switch-up on the album's back end. And ""Cold Hearted"" is a surprisingly touching closer. Ostensibly riffing on a familiar rap trope—rebuking family and friends who turn on you once you taste success—it gains depth through little details, and ends up feelin more like an introspective testament to youth. Diddy, his voice sounding destroyed, offers a weirdly unguarded monologue, and Meek sneaks gut-check details like ""we started off as kids, stomach touching our ribs"" in a sing-song patter. It reminds you why you loved the guy in the first place: He accomplishes more with the sound of his rapping than other rappers do with entire albums. His understanding of rap as a vocal performance; his ability to summon powerful emotions; his combination of vulnerability, bravado, and a storyteller's sense of character and time—well, shit, those are all the hallmarks of a great rapper. Maybe it only all coheres in flashes, but if Meek Mill works best in bursts, then so be it.","Dreams Worth Than More Money takes a few more risks than Meek Mill's debut. With high-profile guest spots from Future, Drake, Nicki Minaj, and others, it has more breathing room and clears space for Meek Mill's unrelenting intensity. It also reinforces the impression that a brief blast is the best way to experience Meek.

Morning/Evening,Four Tet,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af05b1335d7bf1699e9b/1:1/w_160/dc2957da.jpg,2015-07-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20729-morningevening/,Text,"When Kieran Hebden began to play shows in support of his 2013 album Beautiful Rewind, one of the album's shorter tracks, ""Ba Teaches Yoga"", became a set centerpiece. Named for his recently departed maternal grandmother, the burbling track began to dilate beyond its original three-minute length as he kept performing it, eventually nearing the twenty-minute mark by the end of the tour. There might not be a direct sonic correlation between that track and the two twenty-minute tracks that comprise the entirety of Four Tet's eighth album, Morning/ Evening, but they seem thematically of a piece. The former pays tribute to his Indian heritage, the latter displays a structure that brings to mind Indian classical music. In the same manner that ragas pertain to certain parts of the day, Morning/ Evening has a biorhythmic specificity in mind.  Both tracks move between diffuse drifts of electronic tones and skittering drum programming. The ""Morning"" side begins with a straightforward tap of closed hi-hats and a deep thump that sounds flat at first, before a trickier pattern of programmed drums are overlaid. A melodic swell of bass then appears, as graceful, slow-moving and almost imperceptibly evolving as what you might find in early New Age music or the works of David Behrman. And then, just over a minute in, a bright, quivering Indian voice manifests, saccharine strings at play around her. Voices often factor powerfully into Four Tet's productions: think of the honeyed utterances of ""Love Cry"", the chopped pirate radio barks that underpin Beautiful Rewind, or the startling reconfiguration of J. Lo's ""Ain't It Funny"" on ""Pyramids"". But the loop of famous Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar, whose voice has adorned thousands of Hindi films over a seven-decade career, startles upon its appearance. It remains foregrounded for much of the duration of ""Morning"", receding around the eight-minute mark for some of Hebden's most complex drum programming, then reappears halfway through. In using a famous Indian playback singer, which he no doubt grew up hearing in his household, Hebden gives the track an opulent yet pensive feel, which in turn gives ""Morning"" emotional depth. ""Evening"" picks up where ""Morning"" left off, with a coffee percolator of a beat that never quite solidifies, instead leading into the kind of tones that recall early electronic music pieces like Morton Subotnick's Silver Apples of the Moon. Hebden allows each element plenty of space to breathe, striking a balance between the abstract and the accessible. Another wordless voice comes into focus about five minutes in, though my ears can't tell if it's Mangeshkar or another Hindu devotional chant. At around the twelve-minute mark, amid chimes and gentle digital processing, ""Evening"" drifts into near-silence, but just as you rise to play something else, it returns: a hi-hat figure arises, amid shimmering electronics and a kick. The inverse of ""Morning,"" the last five minutes of ""Evening"" gather velocity and strength, to where it seems everything is converging on a climax and payoff for this slow twenty-minute build. But right where a release might be expected, everything fades back out instead: You sense a desire to make a grand statement, but the dramatic dissolve doesn't quite stick the landing. Nonetheless, Four Tet's position in the electronic landscape is solidified: He's able to work on the experimental fringe when he wishes, or collaborate with Burial, Jamie xx and Skrillex. Even news of a possible Diplo team-up doesn't cost him credibility. The scope and ambition of Morning/ Evening is profound, and will hopefully inspire producers to take bigger chances and not be satisfied with pop- or club-friendly lengths. Even where Morning/Evening doesn't quite work, it's daring and expansive.","Four Tet's eighth album is made up of two 20-minute pieces, named ""Morning"" and ""Evening"". Both tracks move between diffuse drifts of electronic tones and skittering drum programming, and they tap into an expansive, emotional vein.

The Heart Is a Monster,Failure,by: Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aed2b1335d7bf1699e3d/1:1/w_160/6bac1855.jpg,2015-07-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20692-the-heart-is-a-monster/,INresidence,"On his commentary track for Failure's 2004 longform retrospective video Golden, bassist/guitarist Greg Edwards recalls the time that Steve Albini ""schooled me in how screwed I was for the rest of my life"" after signing a record deal. Albini, Edwards adds, ""wasn't totally wrong."" Maybe so, but Edwards was lucky in the sense that Failure never actually sold enough units to get swindled out of much. Moreover, Slash (then a Warner subsidiary that had retained some of its indie spirit) gave the L.A. space-rock/alt-metal trio an unusually wide berth when it came to creative control. The label even allowed Edwards and co-bandleader Ken Andrews to self-produce their 1996 opus Fantastic Planet*,* a sleeper classic that attracted a cult following after the band broke up in '97. With its dense layers of guitar distortion, gusts of compressed cymbal wash, and near-70 minute runtime, Fantastic Planet bears the familiar hallmarks of the CD era it was conceived in. But other than a longstanding affiliation with Tool, Ken Andrews and Greg Edwards didn't relate to the grunge-alternative paradigm at all. With The Heart Is a Monster, their first new LP in 19 years, they—along with returning drummer Kellii Scott—make a self-conscious attempt to revisit the scale and feel of Fantastic Planet. On the surface, that seems like a capitulation, but they manage to pull off the near-impossible feat of establishing continuity with their back catalog while also giving listeners a glimpse of what the band might have sounded like had it stayed together, and evolved organically up to this point. Edwards and Andrews went on to make more elastic music in Autolux and ON, respectively, but The Heart Is a Monster reminds us of how synergistic their creative bond was—and still is. Once again, Andrews brings most of the riff-oriented guitar and bass parts, vocal melodies, and engineering to the table, while Edwards contributes the more impressionistic bass and guitar ideas, as well as lyrics and a classic producer's sense of oversight. It doesn't take long for the magic spark between them to make itself apparent. On ""Hot Traveler"", for example, a plodding, metallic march dissolves into a dreamlike, suspended-gravity passage, as graceful as a field of fireflies on a summer night. On the other hand, the bridge of ""A.M. Amnesia"" benefits from what Edwards and Andrews have obviously learned during their time apart—i.e: art-damaged atmospheres à la Autolux and quasi-soulful bedside falsetto cooing reminiscent of Andrews' solo work. (""Soulful"" was the last thing you'd have called Andrews in '94, when he was belting out acid-fried lines about enlarged cockroaches and dead boys in dumpsters on Failure's sophomore effort Magnified.) Of course, these new sonic touches resonate more deeply thanks to the album's overarching lyrical themes. Just like in 1996, Edwards and Andrews anchor the music in a rich subtext that threads the songs together into a Pink Floyd-ian, almost topographical journey fit for headphones and extended bouts of sitting in your room with the lights off. In short, where Fantastic Planet (partially inspired by the 1973 René Laloux film of the same name) used outer space imagery as a vehicle to express Edwards' heroin-addled feelings of spiritual dislocation, The Heart Is a Monster shifts focus from outer to inner space and probes the deeper mysteries of sleep. The band spends the bulk of the album's 18 tracks exploring dreams, consciousness, memory, and the dissolution of self. Song after song after song, it's clear that Edwards and Andrews haven't lost their gift for walking the line between cerebral and dark. And it's precisely that charge of intellectual stimulation—spiked with an ever-so-subtle creep factor—that makes The Heart Is a Monster such a thrilling ride. Somewhat surprisingly, though, Failure circa 2015 engages most when it departs from the driving riff-rock that landed it on the map in the first place. ""Counterfeit Sky"", for example, rubberizes the band's penchant for dissonance and stretches it into a slinkier, sexier sound. And then, in the most striking wtf?… wait, this could actually be working! moment, the piano-driven ""Mulholland Dr."" literally sounds as if it could've walked off of From the Inside, Alice Cooper's 1978 album with three of Elton John's bandmates and John's lyricist Bernie Taupin. Meanwhile, The Heart Is a Monster contains no less than six ambient interludes. A whole separate album in that style would've been nice, but even in truncated form the interludes cast Philip Glass-ian shades onto the other songs and suggest that Failure's creativity is far from exhausted. Finally, there's ""I Can See Houses"", a song that pre-dates the band's 1992 debut Comfort. Prior to this version, only one, chatting-marred recording existed. But even without Edwards' fretless-bass flourishes that define the character of the original, the new ""Houses"" swells into a more sublime, highly finessed vision—the perfect mirror, in fact, for how Failure's sound has blossomed across the board. By reviving its the past, Failure has taken a most decisive step into the present.","The L.A. space-rock/alt-metal trio Failure's 1996 album Fantastic Planet is considered by some a sleeper classic, one that attracted a cult following after the band broke up in 1997. With The Heart Is a Monster, their first new LP in 19 years, they manage to establish continuity with their back catalog while also giving a glimpse of what they may have sounded like had they evolved organically up to this point.

The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty,Tyga,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af43c0084474cd0c1a3d/1:1/w_160/c247784f.jpg,2015-07-01 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20780-the-gold-album-18th-dynasty/,Last Kings,"Tyga is the guy in your group of friends who no one particularly likes but is always just kind of there. He spent the past year burning what few bridges he had left—most memorably, in a depressing triangle between himself, ex-girlfriend Blac Chyna, and labelmate Drake—and decorating his Egypt-themed clothing store like an Illuminati VFW hall. His pet Siberian tiger was confiscated by California wildlife authorities. He's currently dating 17-year old Kylie Jenner; it's a creepy and presumably illegal mess that doesn't seem to bother her bro-in-law Kanye West, the executive producer of Tyga's fourth album. The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty should've been the biggest look of T-Raww's career; instead, it's the casualty of YMCMB's implosion that no one was especially concerned about. He threatened to leak it last fall, claiming his best work was being held hostage: crickets. You can just imagine him texting Kylie when The Gold Album debuted, at long last, on Spotify last week: ""Can you remind your sisters to tweet the link to my album? ;)"" To be fair, the guy's had his share of moments. ""Rack City"" was the spark that ignited DJ Mustard's career; last summer's Young Thug-featuring ""Hookah"" was even better. He had semi-meaningful contributions to ""Bedrock"" and ""Loyal"", two very good, very dumb songs. And if you succumb to the darkness early on—letting it wash over you, baptizing you in its filth—his recent joint album with Chris Brown (Fan of a Fan) is actually pretty solid. It's exactly what you expect: a totally pleasant collection of Nic Nac beats, soaring hooks, and salty, chauvinist lyrics about how they're going to steal your girl and not even enjoy it, just to spite you. These songs succeed for reasons that have almost nothing to do with Tyga, but knowing when to show up is a talent in itself, and if there's one thing Tyga is great at, it's showing up. As Tyga would tell it, The Gold Album is his ""serious"" album, the one where he stops being polite and starts getting real. If you preordered the album back in January, you got an early download of the two lead singles: passable Drake impression ""Make It Work"", and the Kanye and Mike Dean-produced ""40 Mill"". The latter came with a self-directed video, in which T-Raww goes straight M. Night Strugglerap, becomes infected by church-dwelling demons, and ultimately tosses a single rose into his own open casket. (There's also an inexplicable subplot about fitness.) Both of these songs are decent enough; neither of these songs appear on The Gold Album. Nor does ""Hookah"", or the enjoyable single with Justin Bieber, ""Wait for a Minute"", that's now almost two years old. Instead, we have 12 microwave-nuked approximations of Drake songs circa 2013 and Kanye songs spanning from The College Dropout to Yeezus, with none of the wit, soul, or edge. At best, you can slip into a meditative zone wherein Tyga's tissue-thin voice fades into its surroundings, as on ""Wham"". But then you hear Tyga deliver a line like ""Hole in her neck from the fangs/ Pressure and pain"" with all the force of a clammy, limp handshake, and reality sets in. Tyga couldn't string two coherent lines together to save his life: each bar is a dead end, completely unrelated to the one that came before it. He is the converse of Big Sean—another guy who knows how to milk a Kanye co-sign for all it's worth—who raps like he is scrolling down an especially long iPhone note. Tyga raps like his bars are transcribed on the insides of fortune cookies that he must break open individually. Tyga doesn't even sound like he's having fun here; the prevailing mood is one of vague bitterness, directed at everyone, but particularly women. ""Poppa ran a hedge fund/ All his daughter do is give head,"" he raps on ""Shaka Zulu"", a blatant ""Started from the Bottom"" rip-off. On ""Muh Fucka"", T-Raww threatens to fuck your mom moments after he muses about how no woman will ever match his mother's love—one of the album's several instances of, shall we say, complicated family sexual dynamics. ""Pleazer"", the desperate, last-ditch single, sucks all the fun from its ""Freaky Tales"" sample so Tyga can detail how he's ""bout to catch a felony"" for a young woman whose interests include dick and, uh, dick. It seems possible featured guest Boosie might save the proceedings until he references ""Kardashian pussy"" and sends the whole thing spiraling down in flames. ""Hard for You"" is the token ballad; it's about exactly what you think it's about, and just to make things extra uncomfortable, Kylie has reported it's her fave. Yay! I wish there was anything on The Gold Album that matched the batshit, DGAF audacity of Tyga's creepy storefront or zoologically unreasonable videos: All-seeing eyes of Horus, pussies in sarcophagi, blood orgies in the Agape Lodge with L. Ron Hubbard and Jack Parsons. The closest we've got to any of that is a deeply unsettling moment near the end of cheap 808s & Heartbreak simulacrum ""Down for a Min"", where Tyga's kitten-like mewls are interrupted by what seems to be Siri's dark, DMT-smoking twin. ""Listen to the sound of my voice,"" she commands. ""Darkness will always follow the brightest star."" I'm not sure if it's intended to be motivational, or an attempt at subliminal Illuminati mind control—I'm too preoccupied by how similar the stilted, awkward patterns of her robotic delivery are to Tyga's own voice.","As Tyga would tell it, The Gold Album is his ""serious"" album, the one where he stops being polite and starts getting real.

Movies EP,Class Actress,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af0b13d197565213a1f7/1:1/w_160/7f043a79.jpg,2015-07-01 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20734-movies-ep/,CasablancaRepublic,"Class Actress’ Movies EP is either the best- or most poorly timed record of the year. Elizabeth Harper’s synth-pop project, dormant since 2011’s Rapprocher, has not only found a home with legendary disco label Casablanca Records but has gotten as a collaborator its key hitmaker, Giorgio Moroder, himself in the midst of a career revival. And Moroder’s signature sound of implacable synthesizers and L.A. night music has found its way over the past few years to critical darlings, megastars, and newcomers alike. On the other hand, Casablanca has chugged along in various degrees of half-existence over the past decade, home to two Lindsay Lohan records and, until recently, little else; the omnipresence of neo-disco means the genre has been killed, revived, then Family Fun Night-ified out of any of its former transgression; its key session players are well into another golden age of guesting on mediocrities and crap; and the man himself is working with flyweights like Mikky Ekko and Matthew Koma, with gruesome returns. It’s hardly Harper’s fault that her EP came out almost immediately after Moroder recorded a terrible album; and though she’s given varying stories to the press about when and how she became infatuated with Moroder, enough of the producer's sound throbbed through Rapprocher that her ambition seems sincere. And of ambition, there is no shortage—""I kinda wanted to be the next Donna Summer,"" she told Billboard, but their voices do share some similarities: suggestive, negligee-light, pairing well with synth strobes. Moroder, perhaps emboldened by working with a single muse again, turns in a more coherent production than Déjà Vu, more Midnight Express than EDM compilation. Movies is a rough concept album: the familiar cautionary tale, older than celluloid, of a woman chasing the lights of Hollywood, the movie version in which all love is unrequited, ""girlfriend"" is a term that belongs more to escorts than lovers, and everyone is constantly high on something (see: the album cover, an anonymous woman snorting lines off the skyline.) The test is whether it’s easy to fall for. The first half of the record is the closest to Class Actress’ previous sound, a triptych of songs on obsessive crushes. Returns vary. Languid lead single ""More Than You"" is competent, and whether it’s a limp ""Weekend"" reprise or a longingly indulgent sigh depends mostly on the hour of the night, the person on the mind, and the contents of the bloodstream. ""The Limit"" zips through a wind tunnel of an '80s production, and Harper flits between confidence and vulnerability at ease;  but it’s followed by ""High on Love"", which has a peppy production but a metaphor that was smoked dead before Moroder was born, never mind Harper; her uninspiring elaboration (""They keep you hooked like a drug. The best drug is another person. But when a person becomes a drug it’s dangerous…"") does not suggest much further depth. Originality aside, the main problem with Movies is that it can’t decide how much sleaze and drama it’s willing to commit to. The Neon Indian-produced ""GFE"", fitting its title, leans well toward the former, asking little of Harper but strutting, cooing, and sighing her way down double entendres, Studio 54 glitz, and vocoder scales, at which she is adept, but offers no glimpse behind the emotional curtain, which is either the problem or the point. ""Love My Darkness"" wants to evoke the self-consciously moody R&B of 2013 but actually evokes the self-consciously moody trip-hop of 1998; the production is thankfully more dynamic than either, but Harper relies so much on masochistic clichés that it hardly matters. The title track is the sole outlier: a strings-and-music-box ballad and the narrative’s cruel awakening: ""everything I do, I learned in the movies."" It’s cinematic, in that it requires the suspense of disbelief, namely the disbelief that what you are hearing isn’t actually ""Glory Box"" covered by Lana Del Rey—the elephant in the room, for any artist attempting this sort of self-destructive L.A. fantasy. As a Lana Del Rey song, it’s probably better than anything she’d have sung herself; as a piece of sequencing, it’s jarring, like a film skipping directly to its denouement, and might have been better served as a full album closer. And as a self-aware lament, it’s intermittently poignant but, like the album in full, hews a little too close to its conceit: entrancing if you let it be, in love with its star-size emotions, but hollow when the lights come up.","Elizabeth Harper’s synth-pop project, dormant since 2011’s Rapprocher, returns with an EP on the legendary disco label Casablanca Records. True to the original spirit of the imprint, Giorgio Moroder contributes production, as does Neon Indian.

Lemurian,Lone,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af35c0084474cd0c1a25/1:1/w_160/13dcd4d8.jpg,2015-07-01 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20769-lemurian/,R&SMagic Wire RecordingsR&SMagic Wire Recordings,"It's only been seven years since Matt Cutler released Lemurian, his first widely available album as Lone, so it might seem early for a reissue—but there are practical issues to consider. Dealmaker, the UK hip-hop label behind the original release, went dark after 2010. Cutler has since become known for his singular fusion of lysergic downbeat and serotonin-flushed rave throwbacks; it makes sense that fans would want to hear what came before his subsequent albums—Ecstasy & Friends, Emerald Fantasy Tracks, Galaxy Garden, and Reality Testing—established him a kind of King Midas in Mickey Mouse gloves. To sweeten the deal, Lemurian has been remastered, given striking new cover art (a big improvement on the original, which evoked Britpop cutout-bin CDs from the '90s), and, crucially, released on vinyl for the first time. It's easy to imagine that Lemurian was always destined for reissue treatment, if only because it was such a nostalgic undertaking from the get-go. The longing for a lost musical utopia is woven into its very fibers. Lone's debut outing, 2007's Everything Is Changing Colour CDR, was already an attempt to recreate the sound and style that Boards of Canada pioneered a decade prior, from the blurry family photo on the cover to track titles that hinted at synaesthesia, numerology, and other cornerstones of the Scottish duo's aesthetic. The music, meanwhile, brimmed with pitch-bent synths, woozy easy-listening samples, and shuffling hip-hop beats. But it was with Lemurian that Lone really immersed himself in his idols' tape-warping acid bath. The titles might have come straight from a Boards of Canada name generator—""Phthalo Blue"", ""Green Sea Pageant"", ""Maya Codex"", ""Lens Flare Lagoon""—and the music follows suit. If Everything Is Changing Colour represented Cutler's desire to sound like his heroes (""I heard Boards of Canada on John Peel when I was 12, and that was it,"" he told the Nottingham Post in 2008), then Lemurian found him mustering the chops to do so convincingly—and compellingly. Their hallmarks become his hallmarks: his synths are fat and rich and full, brilliant as a kaleidoscope full of diamonds. His chord changes evoke a wistful, nonspecific yearning, and the omnipresent wow and flutter lends an extra layer of temporal dislocation. Matching the distressed VHS-tape timbres, there are scraps of found footage running through ""Interview at Honolulu""; the soft-focus ""Girl"" samples the trailer from a racy European flick from the '70s. And he's no stranger to a beautiful place out in the country: waves lap in ""Under Two Palms"", a river runs through ""Orange Tree"", and birds chirp in ""Lens Flare Lagoon"". Beyond those literal references to nature, the whole thing feels sun-drenched and wind-kissed. He's fond of chords that rise up and away, forever drawing your attention above the shining horizon; his Doppler-effected de-tunings feel like sound that's been carried on the breeze from three counties over. Even the album's sequencing takes after Music Has the Right to Children and Geogaddi: in between the more fully fleshed-out songs, brief sketches suggest wide vistas before dissolving into thin air. ""Buried Coral Banks"" is as watery and mysterious as its title; ""Green Sea Pageant"", just a loop of too-bright keyboards and a scrap of voice, feels like a late-night public-access transmission spun into a locked groove. Like his heroes, Cutler has a thing for low-budget cable-TV aesthetics, and his digging game is strong: ""Phthalo Blue"" loops an easy-listening interlude from Bob Ross' The Joy of Painting and turns it into a woozy folktronic miniature that sounds almost like a Bibio tune. But Lemurian, to its credit, is more than just the sum of its inspirations. His approach to rhythm is looser than Boards of Canada's, for one thing. Cutler has cited Madlib as his other key influence, and it's easy to hear how Madlib and Dilla's slack, elegantly ramshackle timekeeping animate Cutler's own rumpled sense of swing. Where Boards of Canada's beats are often crisply mechanical, his slow-burning grooves crackle like the cherry at the end of a cone-shaped spliff; they shuffle along, shoulders hunched, hands stuffed in pockets, as though they were trying to go unnoticed. Sometimes lumpy, sometimes fluid, his beats feel unusually organic, as misused as that term can be—almost as though they grew themselves, like a burl, or a fungus. Lone's later albums would incorporate the cadences of Detroit techno and breakbeat rave, but Lemurian's intense focus on the expressive possibilities of hip-hop rhythms and looped chords lends to its success as a sustained mood piece, front-to-back. It's as though he heard a kernel of something in his favorite records and, not hearing enough of it there, figured out a way to extend it to fill an entire album. That we're still going back to it seven years later, after he moved on to four albums that are far more diverse, and maybe even more ambitious, is a testament to its success. If you're interested in immersing yourself in a phthalo-blue haze, there's no better place than this.","Matt Cutler, known for the lysergic downbeat and serotonin-flushed rave throwbacks he creates as Lone, released his first widely available album, Lemurian, seven years ago.

Wildheart,Miguel,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af035e6ef95969321d28/1:1/w_160/689223b5.jpg,2015-07-01 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20728-wildheart/,RCABystorm,"As perhaps the last vestige of grown-folks carnality in mainstream music, modern R&B trades in the archetypes of masculinity; sweaty abs and dirty talk pushed by loverboys (Usher) and bad boys (Jodeci). Prince's flamboyance remains one of the biggest exceptions in the genre's long and storied history, and the years since his purple reign are dotted with lonely acolytes: In 2003, André 3000 took a shot at hip-hop's rancorous masculinity—with the help of a smoking pink gun—on his rap-&-B manifesto, The Love Below. Some might say the tension of conforming to one-dimensional manhood contributed to D'Angelo's post-Voodoo unspooling. The current R&B landscape is painstakingly virile: From Jeremih to Trey Songz, Ty Dolla $ign to PARTYNEXTDOOR, men are singing about sex and love. But all of these supposed libertines are focused on the primacy of male pleasure, treating their sexual experiences with all the reverence of a bunch of wadded-up tissues. On Wildheart, his third full-length album, Miguel, the writhing, pompadoured soul singer, has a similar focus, but it's sex-positive instead of sex-obsessed, a crucial difference. Languorous and detailed, it transcends the genre's established narratives with a focus on pleasure and partnership instead of one-sided pursuit. If Frank Ocean is young soul's prismatic, consciousness-expanding Marvin Gaye, Miguel's the reliable Al Green. The first words on this album—""Don't ever sell yourself short... Trust your intuition... You know the plan, conjectures of society,"" from the reverb-y opener ""A Beautiful Exit""—are a testament to how Miguel's grown from radio-baiting R&B archetype to a maker of high-concept, genre-splicing pop music. Miguel has occupied a unique space in the awkward ""alt-R&B"" narrative of the last few years. Amidst the washed out presets and drum machines and drugged-out boasting of his peers, he was a guitar-toting outlier, more of a throwback to a sensual showboat like Ginuwine instead of a self-loathing narcissist like the Weeknd. The nag champa-tinged smokiness of earlier songs like ""All I Want Is You"", or the glowing synth arpeggios on ""Adorn"" and fuzzed out scales on ""Gravity"" expressed something more wholesome, hopeful, and musically psychedelic. (Even when he sang about drugs on ""Do You…"" it was all just a metaphor for love). On Wildheart, Miguel makes good on all of his cross-genre dabbling of the past five years, but unlike the track-based experiments that dotted his two prior LPs and five mixtapes, he extrapolates the heavy funk across an entire album. Miguel has long cited Prince, Freddie Mercury, and James Brown as inspirations, and on Wildheart he works through these icons. The album soars with shiny guitar lines and sky-high vocals, which reflect the mythic possibilities of California and his hometown of L.A. Unlike All I Want Is You or Kaleidoscope Dream, W**ildheart is almost entirely self-produced save for a couple of assists, including Cashmere Cat and Benny Blanco on the Cali soul-riffing ""…Goingtohell"". So Miguel is writing for Miguel, and he knows that his voice, heady like good coffee, will soar over the crunchy bass guitar lines of ""A Beautiful Exit"" and the sultry, obsessive ""FLESH"". When he wants to go digital, on ""The Valley"" and ""Destinado a Morir (Enter.Lewd)"", dilated, ragged synths and stretched-out strumming serve as a glowing bedrock over which he exhales explicit lyrics. The titular valley in the former refers to California's porn industry and he sets the scene like an R-rated kid's playground song: ""lips, tits, clit, sit."" It's the blood-red prelude to Wildheart's tender morning-after first single, ""Coffee"", and his writing is even raunchier than Kaleidoscope Dream's ""Pussy Is Mine"". The sequencing belies the real turn-on: Miguel knows where to find those hard-to-reach spots, and will bring you coffee in the morning, too. Focusing on Wildheart's overt eroticism is one way of listening, but it's impossible to overlook just how seriously he's taking craft. Like, sure, Miguel's take on #surfbort, ""Waves"", might be a vivid metaphorical construct, but the silky stack of harmonies on the bridge is absolutely stunning—maybe the album's most dazzling moment. Lenny Kravitz, another soul-subverting California dreamer, creates an airless cocoon of lust and lush guitars on ""Face the Sun"". ""What's Normal Anyway"" has careful guitar ripples and a steady beat, sturdy footing for Miguel's backstory to all of the skirt-chasing: ""Too proper for the black kids, too black for the Mexicans, what's normal anyway."" And the quiet moments explode without veering into bombast; think about the simple chord changes and placid drum loop of the Smashing Pumpkins' ""1979"" with a wistful story about a California stricken of sunlight—and that's ""Leaves"". On Wildheart, Miguel complicates his lothario backstory in a way that few of his peers have managed. A song like ""What's Normal Anyway"" speaks to multiple experiences of alienation, in both life and love. For Miguel, humanity is found between partners and between the sheets. And Wildheart's success might signal a shift in modern R&B, which is to say that perhaps we will finally move on from minimalism and petulant misogyny and sluggish synths to follow Miguel, along with Leon Bridges and Frank Ocean—the latter slated to return this summer—toward the next era of soul, one where sex is not an arbiter of masculinity but something that's simpatico with fun and feelings.","On Wildheart, Miguel makes good on all of his cross-genre dabbling of the past five years. The album soars with shiny guitar lines and sky-high vocals, while Miguel explores a sex-positive attitude that focuses on pleasure and partnership instead of one-sided pursuit.

X,Lucki,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1dea9e61561daa63c1/1:1/w_160/0e891087.jpg,2015-06-30 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20750-x/,self-released,"It's easy to be reductive when discussing, or processing, Lucki Eck$' music. Earlier this month, the Chicago rapper, then just 19, released his third mixtape, X, which scans like a pretty unsurprising extension of the aesthetic of his previous two mixtapes. Eck$' is murky, tonally somber music: the kind that is borderline overwrought, sometimes irksome in its refusal to get up from under its own weight, even for a minute. Affect-wise, there are resonances with the recent work of Earl Sweatshirt (Eck$ acknowledges the debt, being ""high as fuck off of that Earl Sweatshirt and Max B"" on ""Mac N Cheese""). The Odd Future alumnus' April album has been widely acclaimed, but has also spawned its share of categorical dismissals: usually, by listeners with limited patience for self-serious grand tours of the dark recesses of the post-adolescent mind (""I do like shit, and I do go outside,"" essentially). Eck$' tape is even more unrepentantly bleak, and stylistically provocative, combining Earl's insistent misanthropy with a kind of rap game senioritis; greasy, caution-to-the-wind flows and half-baked reflections are the order of the day. Appreciating Eck$' songwriting prowess and overall discipline—and crediting that he is something other than a one-trick pony, wielding tape-echo-heavy ambience as his primary weapon—requires closer listening. The rapper has altered his sound and focal points significantly over the course of his three releases; just compare the croaked axioms and eerie washes of X to his comparatively chipper 2013 debut, Alternative Trap. Though that tape sags under an excess of small-time pusherman shop talk and viscous reverb clouds, Eck$' delivery is usually liltingly melodic; in hindsight, the influence of the then-rising Chance the Rapper is unmistakable (the title is a play on Acid Rap: statement-of-purpose as mixtape title and invented Soundcloud genre tag). Eck$' breakthrough track from the project, ""Count on Me"", is driven by quaint pizzicato strings straight off of an Andrew Bird record. 2014's Body High, in turn, found Lucki smearing the colors on his sonic palette, shunting the lithe, nursery-rhyme hooks off to the side to accommodate more longform lyrical throughlines and rap over Björk—it's a drastically more difficult record. But somehow, it feels easier to lock in with the spare, dead-eyed X than either of these other two tapes; certainly, it's Eck$' most lovingly crafted release to date. The production operates in the same general realm as the previous material. The key chordal material is manifested in waves of impressionistic, mostly unidentifiable sound. Samples, when they crop up, are treated heavily, mimicking the crackly sound of aged 78s; otherwise, they are slowed down and phased in the mode of a vintage DJ Screw mix. But generally, on X, the drum sounds and patterns are crisp, moving closer than Eck$ has yet come to trap that is not ""alternative"" at all. They swing rather than plod, topped by careening cymbal purrs (the beat for the Chance-featuring ""Stevie Wonder"" is partially the work of Young Chop, the veritable Charlie Parker of Chicago drill production). Eck$' rapping bends to this newfound clarity. He's clearly storyboarding his ideas, or at least considering his next step more carefully on the spot. Song structures shift smoothly with new gestures in the production, or don't, when there's still life in just one sticky idea to squeeze out: Highlights ""Lowlife"" and the ""Still Tippin'"" sampling ""Still Steal"" build up momentum around deadly simple, plaintive refrains and narrow locked grooves. Elsewhere, Eck$ builds toward denser, more symphonic moments—see the sinister synth bass that builds under the tabla-driven ""Mac N Cheese"" (toward the line ""Got nightmares starring you"") or the lush ""None Other"", with its thinly sliced soul sample and tap dancing 808s. His verses, narratively, also seem to unfold with the expressive contours in the music. Tales of wasted hours, bad relationships, and ill-advised benders build toward unexpected admissions: ""I contradict often, I get it from my family/ So you can't blame me, baby, it's in my blood/ So if I'm disrespectful, just know that it's all love,"" he half-snickers on ""Still Steal"". Self-doubt and, at worst, self-loathing is the constant subtext, lurking behind every self-mythologizing moment, allowing Eck$ to push beyond the ""posted up on that corner like I been waiting on a ride or something"" braggadocio and caricaturish anti-heroism of his preceding tapes. If nothing else—right down to Eck$ assuming some of the production duties—the key to X's success is its palpable, overarching poise and control. Hearing attitude-for-its-own-sake and sloppiness as the locus means buying into the central illusion, confusing content for form. Sure, this is, for all intents and purposes, bleary Tumblr-ripe rap which coalesces loosely, begging for the use of ""drug-addled"" as both a general descriptor and an excuse for its surface eccentricities. However, there's a lot more to this music than slacker posturing; step in closer, and you'll discover the care in Eck$' design, and one of the year's strongest vanguard hip-hop albums.","Earlier this month, the Chicago rapper Lucki Eck$, then just 19, released his third mixtape, another collection of murky, tonally somber music. The lovingly crafted X is unrepentantly bleak, and stylistically provocative, combining Earl Sweatshirt's insistent misanthropy with a kind of rap game senioritis.

The Reach,Boogie,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af34b1335d7bf1699edf/1:1/w_160/40f9cd4d.jpg,2015-06-30 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20768-the-reach/,self-released,"Boogie is from Compton, with a slyly giggling voice that makes him a spiritual cousin, of sorts, to Devin the Dude. He has Devin’s gift for observational humor, for singing his own choruses, and for making songs that seem light but can cut deeper than you expect. His voice is light and unassuming and his flow gathers in clumps around the beat, like he is punching it affectionately in the arm rather than riding it. He has a lisp he does nothing to disguise on record, which adds up to a certain image: This is a guy who doesn’t really care about how he appears, someone comfortable with his own thoughts, with being himself. On last year's Thirst 48, that guy—shrugging, diffident, wry, full of little jokey insults like ""Man I swear Twitter turned lying to a talent”—seemed like someone to watch. His follow-up, The Reach, is a little darker, and a little more outwardly emotional, than Thirst 48, which kept the energy casual. The beats were quiet, tinged with some subdued horns and a general vibe of electric relaxation. The Reach opens with an expansive and melodramatic sample from Route 94’s ""My Love"", with Jess Glynne’s already-deep voice pitched down. It’s a wider-reaching sound than anything on Thirst 48, and Boogie sounds like he’s amping himself up a bit, trying to raise the stakes on his music. His lyrics are uniquely clear and instantly legible—on your first listen through one of his mixtapes, you generally come away having absorbed every word he’s said. This might seem like a strange or minor point to focus on, but it feels like part of Boogie’s appeal: His lyrics are plainspoken, funny, and sometimes poignant, and listening to him expound on his life is why you tune in. ""Further"" is a meditation on the effects of cyclical violence, and he sounds musing, hurt, and confused in turns. On the interlude ""God’s Work"", he remembers his mother’s eviction, sneaking back in to sleep in the apartment, eating dry cereal. ""Even when I’m quiet I be turnt/ And I ain’t trying to cause no riot with my verse,"" he raps, in what feels like a Boogie Manifesto. The production gleams with lots of warm horns, drums that sound like dripping faucets, and ribbons of vocal samples. It’s rap that sounds like it’s peeking out the window at the world, which is a feeling Boogie reinforces sometimes in his lyrics, which bristle with protective fear for his six-year-old son. On ""Make Me Over"", he is an aggrieved single dad, fretting about an environment that feels studded with threats large and small. There are moments where Boogie sounds silly, getting excited about girls on Instagram, annoying retweets, and people who buy followers on Twitter. If his ear for rapped hooks sharpened, he might land something like a calling-card song: ""Bitter Raps"", a  loose stream of insults and half-hearted gripes from Thirst 48, is the closest he has. Like his first tape, The Reach feels like a lovingly small-scale project, something to keep you good company in the privacy of your earbuds rather than at a party or in open spaces.","The Compton MC Boogie has a slyly giggling voice: His lyrics are plainspoken, funny, and sometimes poignant, and listening to him expound on his life is why you tune in.

My Love Is Cool,Wolf Alice,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aec1ea9e61561daa6321/1:1/w_160/cb7c158f.jpg,2015-06-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20680-my-love-is-cool/,RCADirty Hit,"What a relief it is that the next big British indie sensation isn't a bunch of anointed lads with stadium-sized savior complexes. Wolf Alice's debut album is one of 2015's most anticipated homegrown debuts, thanks not to them running their mouths or having the right management, but three years of hard touring punctuated by just four EPs. In the UK, My Love is Cool is being touted as grunge’s second (or, ninth) coming, when really it affirms the tentative coming-of-age story in guitarist/singer Ellie Rowsell’s lyrics by refusing to settle for a single identity at this early stage. Wolf Alice are best at capturing sensations. The chiming rush of ""Bros"" freeze-frames the heady teenage abandon of the lyrics—bad haircuts and hopping buses with a best friend you'd die for—as Rowsell's wistful vocal turn establishes her increasing distance from that time. Meanwhile ""Freazy"" is Wolf Alice's us-against-the-world mission statement: ""You can hate us all you want but it don't mean nothing at all."" There's a neat Haim-like snap to the choruses, but the dreamy verses clash with Mike Crossey's intense production sheen, evoking a time when Tin Tin Out were pop's go-to remixers. When Wolf Alice rage, they usually do it with stealth. It takes 90 seconds for ""You're a Germ"" to turn from grave whispers about a bad boy in cheap leather to an indictment of the ""dodgy fucker."" Rowsell's a limber vocalist: ""Lisbon"" starts with Azure Ray sweetness as she clings to an ex's stolen cigarettes and threadbare t-shirt, but by the end it sounds as if she's rounded up the rest of the band to smash in every window of his house. Forgoing restraint in favor of hard-edged, exhilarating swagger, ""Giant Peach"" and ""Fluffy"" confront the suffocating element of remaining in the place where you grew up. ""What the hell keeps me here/ In a dark old town that I've adored?"" Rowsell snarls on ""Giant Peach"". ""The rules don't seem so clear/ And change, it feels like fear/ It's all you know."" That sense of vulnerability also informs some of Rowsell's bleaker lyrics, which unpick the social implications of mental health issues while conveying their claustrophobia. ""Silk"" mutates from spare coldwave to a dark nursery rhyme that rejects the idea of depression as an interesting character trait. On ""Soapy Water"", a distant-sounding Rowsell hides inside a mesmerizing disco swirl to conceal the effects of anxiety from her parents. It's crushing but strangely comforting, like repeated viewings of The Virgin Suicides. Concealed at the end of My Love Is Cool is the secret title track, a bedroom demo of Rowsell and her electric guitar. ""Teach me, teach me/ Teach me rock and roll,"" she sings softly. But the confident diversity of My Love Is Cool indicates a band who have their own thing all figured out, who shouldn't veer from their own strange path to live up to outdated narratives that dictate what a young British band should be.","Wolf Alice have gained attention for their powerful live show and four EPs.

Moonbuilding 2703 AD,The Orb,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aee7b1335d7bf1699e6a/1:1/w_160/e5db5189.jpg,2015-06-30 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20709-moonbuilding-2703-ad/,Kompakt,"Through most of the 1990s, Dr. Alex Paterson and the Orb had an air of slackness that belied their industriousness. Patterson and a rotating cast of cohorts—including members of the KLF, Public Image Ltd., and Killing Joke—made their name and reputation on diaphanous ambient house tracks that stretched on for up to 40 minutes. The project brought to mind weed smoke and chewed mushrooms, but the Orb also cranked out a ton of music. Even as a head for most of their '90s output, I was oblivious to their post-Orblivion output. Rather than drift off into irrelevance in the 21st century, the Orb have become sturdy and workmanlike. And no small credit is due to Paterson's longtime collaborator, Thomas Fehlmann, whose solo discography spans three decades. It's almost startling to write that Moonbuilding is the Orb's 10th album in the new century (not including entries in Kompakt's Pop Ambient series and a slew of rarities comps). The records they've released in that span may not be particularly memorable, but they have realized collaborations with their most obvious sonic forbearers: Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry. Moonbuilding 2703 AD scans as a concept album, and each of the album's four tracks is more than 10 minutes long. For those that came of age to the likes of ""Blue Room"" and Orb Live 93, it's the kind of length and depth worth getting lost in. The 15-minute ""God's Mirrorball"" adheres to the classic structure of the project. ""First, God does not exist,"" goes the opening sample. ""But don't worry, what does exist is good."" It's a standard Orb trope, a sample that first scans as philosophical query, this one on the nature of good and evil. But then comes the punchline: ""If you believe in evil, then you probably need a whack on the back of the neck with a big fucking stick."" Subliminal rhythmic patterns rise and fall, with the track's true beat only dropping almost five minutes in. It's ambient house perfection as only the Orb can do it. The highest highs come on ""Moon Scapes 2703 BC"", moving from satellite beeps to a tough shuffling thump, softened ever so slightly by Patterson's echo and delay. By turns spongy and pounding, head-spreading and heart-quickening, the track moves effortlessly between peaks and chilled-out valleys. When Moonbuilding sounds best is when it strikes a balance between the spaciness of Dr. LX's golden years and the type of craftsmanship and restraint that typifies Fehlmann's 21st century solo output, such as Visions of Blah and Honigpumpe. But as is their wont, the Orb lose steam and focus on the record's second half. ""Lunar Caves"" is middling and indistinct, its ambient washes leading into a number of beats that are soon sloughed off. The 13-minute title track boasts the crispest beat on the album, but it's one ill-suited for the group, situated midway between jazzy nu-soul and boutique hotel downtempo. While both subgenres arose during the Orb's heyday, they sound wholly out of date here. Some moments on Moonbuilding show the Orb, if not regaining their form, then offering up decent ambient music. But elsewhere they revert back to a formlessness that's devoid of their quirky stoner persona.","Rather than drift off into irrelevance in the 21st century, the Orb have become sturdy and workmanlike. Moonbuilding is, incredibly, the Orb's 10th album in the new century, and it occasionally reminds you of what once made them great.

The Monsanto Years,Neil Young,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae9013d197565213a11a/1:1/w_160/8177d2bd.jpg,2015-06-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20643-the-monsanto-years/,Reprise,"When Neil Young gets angry, he gets impulsive. Mere days after the May 1970 massacre at Kent State, he had branded Richard Nixon a mass murderer; nearly 20 years later, he was redrafting George Bush Sr.'s inaugural address into a state-of-the-union screed dripping with so much bitter sarcasm, some conservatives still mistake it for an ad hoc national anthem. Those songs remain FM-radio staples to this day because their raging invectives still sting like a ripped-off bandage, decades removed from the moments that incited them. But the topical material that Neil has rush-released in recent years has turned both more lyrically obvious and musically frivolous; whether dramatizing 9/11 valor in a goofy bar-band grind or calling for Dubya's head with a cheery choral sing-along and chirpy cavalry-charge trumpets, these songs' shelf lives can be measured in weeks rather than years. As much as his legacy is tied to the politically charged tumult of the late '60s and early '70s, Neil has always been more compelling when playing the rugged, inscrutable individualist rather than the man-of-the-people populist—the urgency to get his message out tends to override the sublime lyricism and unnerving ambiguities that have yielded his most resonant, timeless work. On his new album, Neil revisits an old pet cause: the plight of the American farmer. But 30 years after he co-founded Farm Aid to save cash-strapped field workers from foreclosure, the terms of war have changed. The Monsanto Years fixes its crosshairs on the GMO-pimping agribusiness behemoth that has a stranglehold on the world's seed (and, by extension, food) supply, forcing farmers to comply their strict terms or be litigated into destitution. And, here, the buckshot splatter extends to other entities contributing to the suppression of the average American: Wal-Mart, Chevron, Citizens United, and even Starbucks (though in the latter case, the company insists it's just an innocent bystander). But despite the dawn-summoning optimism of the opening eco anthem ""A New Day for Love"", The Monsanto Years is ultimately less a call to topple an evil empire than an expression of helplessness in trying to fight it. As the album trudges through its treatises on corporate bullying, compromised democracy, and environmental degradation, Neil's not so much standing up for the embattled farmer as embodying the withered voice of one. Perhaps not coincidentally, the sound of the album hearkens back to Neil's immediate post-Harvest period, a time when the narrative concision and electric-guitar savagery of his early work was giving way to a certain fuck-it-all sloppiness and sundazed cynicism. His amped-up backing band for this set, the Promise of the Real (fronted by Willie Nelson's sons Lukas and, when performing live, Micah), never approaches the trance-inducing psychedelia of Crazy Horse, but they make for a solid Stray Gators substitute, encouraging the sort of rough'n'tumble rave-ups and slack-rock jams that defined early '70s detours like Time Fades Away. The appealing looseness of their performances proves to be the saving grace of an album too often hamstrung by heartfelt but hackneyed messaging. While the loping, whistle-hooked ""A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop"" and cowpunk stomp ""Workin' Man"" playfully highlight the absurdity of Monsanto's strong-arm tactics,  extendo-rants like ""Big Box"" forsake the rich characterization of Neil's most incisive social commentaries for worn-out catchphrases (""too big to fail""), broadstroked scenery (""Main Street's boarded up"") and the blunt simplicity of a Change.org pitch (""people working part-time at Wal-Mart/ never get the benefits""). The album's preference for critique over craft is epitomized by the awkward ubiquity of the very word ""Monsanto,"" which is wedged into several songs even when Neil can't be bothered to find anything to rhyme with it. (On the otherwise poignant seven-minute title track, a breezy ""Mambo Sun"" groove is tripped up by each utterance of the company name, delivered with all the grave weightiness of a movie villain appearing to the sound of dun-dun-dun.) With much of the songwriting on The Monsanto Years taking the form of hastily scribbled screeds, the most revelatory moments come when Neil grapples with the paradox of making complex politics more pop-song palatable. The album's most immediately engaging track—the raggedly glorious ""People Want to Hear About Love""— isn't a protest song but a song about protest songs. Sure, its call-and-response structure provides Neil with another opportunity to check off all of his key talking points: the fragility of the environment, political corruption, the link between pesticides and autism, and so on. At the same time, it shrewdly addresses those concerns within the context of a more existential dilemma: that is, in a cultural landscape craving feel-good entertainment, The Monsanto Years' brand of straight-shootin' rock'n'roll activism is going to be a tougher sell than a Pono.","When Neil Young gets angry, he gets impulsive. The Monsanto Years, his latest album, is a screed against big agribusiness and the corporations that support it, but it is ultimately less a call to topple an evil empire than an expression of helplessness in trying to fight it.

Bleeder,Mutoid Man,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae66ea9e61561daa6285/1:1/w_160/12cfa34d.jpg,2015-06-29 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20608-bleeder/,Sargent House,"Stephen Brodsky has never gotten his full due as the driving force behind 1998’s Until Your Heart Stops and 2000’s Jupiter—two entirely disparate masterpieces by his best-known band, Cave In. By turns technically punishing and spaciously anthemic, that pair of records still casts a shadow over his latest project, Mutoid Man. With Brodsky on vocals and guitar—along with Converge drummer Ben Koller (who in the '00s also briefly played with Cave In) and bassist Nick Cageao—Mutoid Man released a debut EP in 2013 titled Helium Head that combined every element on Brodsky’s periodic table: hooks, mathy precision, metallic hardcore fury, and a lust for classic-rock extravagance. That hasn’t changed on Bleeder, Mutoid Man’s first full-length. If anything those elements have become more pronounced, fighting each other in a war for supremacy that ends in a clench-jawed détente. The tension on tracks like ""Sweet Ivy"" and ""Deadlock"" is delicious; Brodsky’s needling riffs and liquid runs pit themselves against his alternately melodic and murderous vocals. Brodsky is his generation’s unheralded master of clean/scream singing, and that Cave In dynamic of old rears its head on ""1000 Mile Stare"" and ""Dread Dreams"", both of which recapture the magic of a dynamic that’s become a cliché since Brodsky helped pioneer it in the '90s: drawing you in with sugary, sensitive tunefulness before baring fangs and ripping out throats. Bleeder’s greatest strength, though, is in its wholehearted embrace of both numbskull hard rock and cerebral progressive metal, at a time when the two approaches have become almost mutually exclusive in heavy music. The album’s title track—which, at six minutes, is twice as long as any other song on the filler-free disc—simmers, lunges, and edges toward the dissonantly psychedelic, even as it throws off a chunky post-hardcore vibe. Like Red-era King Crimson after botched brain surgery, or the Mars Volta after the miraculous intervention of an impeccable editor, Mutoid Man merges highbrow fretboard architecture with immediacy, punch, and a merciless severity. So what is Brodsky singing about on Bleeder? A bunch of random cool-sounding stuff, apparently, without much concern for anything beyond how the syllables sound when pushed, pulled, or dragged past his tonsils. For someone who once labored manically over every note, blip, lick, texture, and phoneme—Cave In’s 14-minute prog-core magnum opus ""Controlled Mayhem Then Erupts"" being a prime example—Brodsky is cutting loose and letting it all hang out on Bleeder. At least as much as he might be able to allow himself to do that, considering his virtuosity as both an instrumentalist and a songsmith. Mutoid Man may not be the resurrection of Cave In’s on-again-off-again majesty, but it savagely boils down Brodsky’s brainy ambition to a primal scream.","Mutoid Man is the project of Cave In's Stephen Brodsky, along with Converge drummer Ben Koller, and bassist Nick Cageao.

"One Earth, One People, One Love: Kronos Plays Terry Riley",Kronos Quartet,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aefcc0084474cd0c19c4/1:1/w_160/11cc225f.jpg,2015-06-29 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20723-one-earth-one-people-one-love-kronos-plays-terry-riley/,Nonesuch,"After the radical minimalism of his 1964 composition ""In C"", Terry Riley’s place in music history was secure. The 53 melodic phrases in that one-page piece—available to be played as many times as members of an ensemble cared to repeat them—still inspire a range of artists today. (Composer Nico Muhly was among those contributing to In C Remixed, in 2009, while the musicians of Africa Express gave us their spin with this year’s In C Mali). Even if Riley had never fixed another note to paper, the Who would have name-checked him in the title of ""Baba O’Riley"" on the strength of his keyboard improvisations. Similarly, you can imagine contemporary connoisseurs like Big Boi taking time to pose for a picture with the composer on godfather status alone. It almost happened just like that anyway. In the 1970s, as Riley was diving ever deeper into his study of North Indian classical music with the singer Pandit Pran Nath, a legacy based on ""In C"" and hypnotic live performances seemed probable. But then, in 1979, violinist and Kronos Quartet founder David Harrington intervened. After a year of persuasion, Riley was prevailed upon to write music on paper again. And the lobbying went both ways. Riley changed the way Harrington’s group worked: encouraging the members to improvise and to ditch the romantic vibrato common to mainstream string-quartet sonics. The result was a working relationship that has now lasted for 36 years, resulting in dozens of commissions and four full-length studio albums. With Riley turning 80 this year, it’s an obvious move for Nonesuch to bring out all of their Kronos-Riley recordings in a box set, along with a half-hour of previously unheard music. The core of the set is a straight-up porting over of Riley-composed Kronos releases that haven’t ever been hard to find: the 1989 tour de force double-album Salome Dances for Peace, 2001’s Requiem for Adam, and 2008’s The Cusp of Magic (which guest-stars Chinese pipa player Wu Man). But taken cumulatively, the result feels less like an anniversary cash-grab than an attempt to help us see a major aspect of Riley’s art on its own terms. Riley’s string quartet music reveals the interpretive limitation of the ""minimalist"" tag—the two-hour Salome Dances for Peace is nothing if not maximal music. In his writing for Kronos, Riley variously employs raga patterns, jazz harmonies, and chromatic dissonance. You may need the liner notes to help understand Riley’s mashup of Native American spirituality and New Testament narrative—it involves King Herod’s daughter being brought back to life, in order to inspire compassion instead of violence—but the diversity of the music and its emotional range are anything but compact in scale. Likewise, the surprising synthesized brass section that pops up in Requiem for Adam’s second movement highlights a daring compositional mind at work (one notably unafraid to try out new textures in the service of mourning). While I’d previously paid scant attention to The Cusp of Magic, thinking it a lesser entry in Riley’s catalog, this box set helps prepare the listener for Riley’s increasingly hybrid aesthetic over time. Those who already own and appreciate these albums may wonder if the half-hour of previously unreleased material justifies purchase of the entire box. But Nonesuch has been generous here (especially in the box-set economy), by making the fifth disc of the set available individually, under the title Sunrise of the Planetary Dream Collector. And yes: it’s a necessary addition to the catalog—though perhaps not for the reason the composer’s fans will expect. Crate-digging may compel Riley-heads to lunge straight for ""Lacrymosa - Remembering Kevin"" or ""One Earth, One People, One Love"", since we haven’t heard those items recorded before. But the highlight of the disc featuring new material winds up being a recent Kronos recording of ""Sunrise of the Planetary Dream Collector"". At one level, that’s surprising, since ""Sunrise"" is the first piece Riley wrote for Kronos, back in 1980, and it’s been a staple of the group’s repertoire for some time. Employing both a 14-beat structure borrowed from raga and a series of melodic modes (based on A), Riley has said that he originally conceived of the piece as a ""jazz head arrangement"" that could allow for improvisation and juxtaposition of themes. But Kronos’ 1985 recording doesn’t have that kind of flow at all. It sounds stiff and brittle—as if the players are paying too much attention to the 14-beat pattern. By comparison, the new recording on this box set is a marvel. Instead of leaping right into the work’s hottest rhythmic passage, this version kicks off with a meditative drone section (in which each member of the quartet progressively doles out notes from one of Riley’s scales). Heard against the vibrato-less drone strings, sliding pitches from one violin simultaneously refer to Riley’s North Indian classical studies, as well as his feel for folk-song Americana. And when Kronos does finally launch into the memorable main theme, ""Sunrise"" has a new wind at its back—perhaps the kind that can only be captured after 36 years of collaborative effort.","This box set gathers the Nonesuch albums featuring the Kronos Quartet playing the music of minimalist composer Terry Riley, and adds another disc of unheard material. Taken all togtether, the set confirms just how fruitful this 35-year partnership has been.

O∆,London O’Connor,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af0ac0084474cd0c19d4/1:1/w_160/8cd98a42.jpg,2015-06-29 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20733-london-oconnor-o/,self-released,"London O’Connor is 24 years old, but outside of that basic fact, seems very much a teenager. He’s successfully avoided accumulating even the basic trappings of adulthood—the only things he seems to own are a skateboard, a backpack full of clothes, and some portable gear, and he exists in sort of a perpetual cruise around New York City, crashing on the couches of friends in between peregrinations. His Tumblr posts and interviews so far have had a slumber-partyish confessional quality, and he’s quick to bring up the fact that he didn’t lose his virginity until just before his 21st birthday. He’s got a babyface, an unguarded smile, and the struggle dirt stache of someone who hopes the guy at the door thinks his fake I.D.’s legit. Despite spending the past six years carving out an enviable home for himself on the fashionable end of the New York creative scene (including a stint in photographer Ryan McGinley’s crew of ethereally young and beautiful models), on his debut album O∆, O’Connor returns to his frustratingly hemmed-in experience growing up in the sedate San Diego suburb of San Marcos, California. The lyrics follow him through an archetypal day as he wanders around feeling alienated, ponders the effect of the Internet on his IRL friendships, records voice memo ""Captain’s logs,"" feels weird about a girl, and steals a garden gnome off someone’s lawn. The subject matter’s typical high school shit that should be achingly familiar to anyone who’s ever been on the scary, confusing brink of adulthood and trapped in a nowhere town, but he imbues them with the immediacy and world-encompassing gravity of someone living through it for the first time. It’s easy to feel like you’re right there with him. On top of his strings-free living situation and fixation on his high school days, O’Connor’s got a teenager’s complicated mix of childlike and adult natures, and the interplay between innocence and sophistication is the axis that O∆ revolves around, and the friction that generates its boundless energy. At first glance it might seem like an almost amateurishly simple album, with chintzy synth sounds, drum beats straight off an old Casio, and major-key melodies that project an aura of Daniel Johnston-like naivete. O’Connor’s no outsider musician, though—he originally moved to New York to attend NYU’s heavily industry-connected Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, and one of the couches he crashes on belongs to Nick Sansano, who produced Daydream Nation and engineered Fear of a Black Planet—and behind the candy-like facade, O∆ is a technically masterful record. O’Connor packs his songs with melodies and countermelodies that whirl past each other in neatly choreographed movements spiked with acrobatic leaps and twists. The production might suggest thrift store keyboards, but the tones are actually clean and rich, and deftly arranged to fill in a comfortable amount of audio spectrum without any extra clutter. It’s as expertly constructed a pop album as anything that will be released this year, and the most impressive thing about it is that O’Connor makes it all look so effortless that you can actually believe he just stumbled into making it by accident. O’Connor’s a true eccentric, but O∆ has a universal appeal. The hooks are so intensely hooky that you can find yourself singing along to them without even knowing it. It’s infectiously joyous, and even when the songs turn sentimental and sweetly sad there’s still the uplifting energetic charge of witnessing an artist figuring out the extent of their powers. The infinitely catchy refrain on his single ""GUTS""—""I hate your gu-uuu-uuu-uuu-uuuts""—makes it a cathartic sing-along jam on par with Beck’s ""Loser"" and Cee-Lo’s ""Fuck You"". As odd as the album is, it could very conceivably turn him into a pop star. I’ve been daydreaming about what that would look and sound like, which might be unfair to an artist who’s just getting started, and if O∆ weren't so good at dominating my attention the idea might be a distraction. But just think about it—if he made something this good out of the most boring parts of his past, what’s going to happen when he sets his sights on the future?","At first glance, London O’Connor's debut may seem like an almost amateurishly simple album, with chintzy synth sounds, drum beats straight off an old Casio, and major-key melodies that project an aura of Daniel Johnston-like naivete.

In Another Life,Bilal,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae959d034d5c69bf4587/1:1/w_160/7241c87c.jpg,2015-06-29 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20647-in-another-life/,eOne MusicPurpose,"There’s no telling which Bilal you’ll get from one moment to the next—will it be the thoughtful singer who craves breakfast in bed or the bizarre performer who screams his way through Led Zeppelin and Radiohead covers? In the years following his debut, 2001’s 1st Born Second, Bilal has done everything to shed the neo-soul label with which he’s been associated. ""I’m a jazz musician. That’s what I went to school for,"" he recently told Complex. ""I want to make music that is going to confuse the computer."" In hindsight, that explains the iconoclastic nature of 2010’s Airtight’s Revenge and 2013’s A Love Surreal, two albums that largely eschewed Bilal’s earlier throwback aesthetic for a denser electronic sound. Through it all, Bilal is at his best when he's disciplined: his version of ""Can’t Hide Love"" rivals the Earth, Wind & Fire original, and his feature work on Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly bolstered the rapper’s coming-of-age narrative. Too often, though, Bilal’s solo music has been scattered and unfocused, making it tough to fully embrace. In Another Life is produced by Adrian Younge, whose live instrumentation matches the singer’s raw energy. Younge has composed for rapper Ghostface Killah and Delfonics’ vocalist William Hart and is known for his modern interpretations of Shaft-era R&B. Where A Love Surreal dabbled in electronic soul, Life feels like a one-take jam session: Younge’s soundtrack evokes Sly Stone’s improvised funk and buffers Bilal’s ruminating ballads, and the LP falters when it strays from that sound: The bouncy, Big K.R.I.T.-assisted ""Pleasure Toy"" is out of step with Life’s organic vibe, and ""Lunatic"" is a shrill alt-rock number that Bilal screeches his way through. Elsewhere, the backing music acts as scenery for the singer’s best feature—the timbre of his voice. If Surreal was the Prince album Bilal always wanted to make, In Another Life seems influenced by To Pimp a Butterfly (Kendrick spits rapid-fire verses here on ""Money Over Love"") and D’Angelo’s Black Messiah, multifaceted works that celebrate blackness without conforming to what black art is perceived to be. Life has an inquisitive spirit; as it plays, Bilal sounds like the ardent storyteller trying to figure things out along the way. He withdraws from Earth on ""Satellites"", assessing civic decay from an aerial perch: ""Watching the world watch people as they do what they do to people/ So what did we do? And what can we do? And how did this happen?"" On ""Open Up the Door"", Younge wields a '70s Stevie-like groove, and Bilal, like the Motown icon, uses seasonal imagery to convey human perseverance. ""It’s a long, cold winter,"" he sings, ""but when it rains, we grow."" Younge and Bilal’s synergy takes shape toward the album’s back end, on ""Holding It Back"", ""Spiraling"", and ""Bury Me Next to You"", all three using similar rhythms to form a seamless suite. In Another Life is one of Bilal's better records; after many years and five albums (including the impressive and unreleased Love for Sale), perhaps he has finally found his niche. Who knows how long he’ll stay there.","In Another Life is produced by Adrian Younge, whose '70s-R&B-inspired live arrangements match the singer’s raw energy. Younge finds just the right mix of soul for the singer's ruminating ballads. Guests include Kendrick Lamar, Big K.R.I.T., and Kimbra.

Summertime '06,Vince Staples,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef7c0084474cd0c19be/1:1/w_160/97efc203.jpg,2015-06-29 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20719-summertime-06/,Def Jam,"Summertime '06 crams 20 songs inside an hour and when it ends Vince Staples is somehow still mid-sentence. The heavy-lidded, preternaturally calm Long Beach rapper has always seemed to have a remarkable amount on his mind, with more to say than he has room for: The last line on ""Taxi"", the final track of his first full mixtape, 2011’s Shyne Coldchain Vol. 1, ended in a similar fashion, with a freezing bucket of water—""Tried praying for forgiveness, but God told me to shut up""—before the music simply stopped. In those days, Staples seemed studiously laconic, like his friend Earl Sweatshirt, whom he is still often mentioned alongside. What’s been remarkable to watch is the way Staples has leaned forward—bigger songs, bigger statements, greater urgency–as Earl bled into the cracks in the walls of his mind. Earl doesn’t know or care if you are in the room, which is part of his appeal; Vince Staples’ eyes are boring right into you. Staples has become an increasingly powerful communicator, and on Summertime '06, his lines are sharp enough that every word digs into meat: ""I hate when you lie; I hate the truth, too."" (""Jump Off the Roof""), ""In the Planned Parenthood playing God with your mom's check/ You ain’t even been to prom yet"" (""Surf""). Like Chance the Rapper drained of hope, Staples expresses complex ideas in plain, hard sentences, ones that can be handed to you like a pamphlet: ""No matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past,"" he states simply on ""Like It Is"". His rapping is conversational, but these are the conversations you have when all optimism has been burned away. The album is split into two sides, making it technically a double album. But double albums are usually unwieldy, and Summertime '06 is breathtakingly focused, a marathon that feels like a sprint. The production bangs and clanks throughout with a septic, rusted, retooled-buggy persistence, which Staples matches. On ""Lift Me Up"", he chants the song’s title over and over again, but his voice is thin and tired, and the music heavy and slow. It’s the sound of someone working for uplift who knows in their bones just how much misery lays along the road. Summertime '06 was overseen by Dion ""No I.D."" Wilson, one-time mentor to Kanye and the force behind all of Def Jam’s best projects for years now. No I.D. seems to grasp the essence of every track he works on; music that has borne his attention almost always emerges with its worldview clarified. On Summertime '06, he turns an album produced largely by himself, DJ Dahi, and Clams Casino into one tense, seething organism, making it difficult to isolate which songs these wildly different musicians worked on. The sound is cold and brittle, full of little blurts of percussion that resemble nervous fidgets. The basslines are often played by a groaning distorted electric guitar, and songs like ""Dopeman"" have the crackling alkaline energy of a Neptunes production. There are forlorn melodies, played on keys, that sometimes sneak in behind songs like ""3230"" or ""Might Be Wrong"", and they provide the undercurrent of what all this hard-nosed realism might cost you. By now, it’s clear that Summertime is not ""fun,"" and at no point do you suspect you’ve been invited to a party. But the sound submerges you in the itch of Staples' mind. He is a devotee of realism, in its simplest definition. Keeping it real, for him, means clearly documenting everything he sees, removed from the clouds of hope or pain or pity. He marvels at the loneliness of his job as a rapper, translating his life to those who don’t live it: ""All these white folks chanting when I ask them ‘Where my niggas at?’/ Going crazy, got me going crazy, I can’t get with that/ Wonder if they know I know they won’t go where we kick it at?"" he raps on ""Lift Me Up"". The voices you hear on the album that don’t belong to Staples—the voicemail on ""Might Be Wrong"", hooks whispered by art-rapper Kilo Kish—feel like echoes or ghosts. He raps often about crimes he’s committed, but the songs don't have the cinema of street rap. His attention to detail purposefully drains the adrenaline out of the scenario and leaves a quotidian focus on the smallest facts of the situation—""Four deep, five seats, three guns,"" he observes on ""Get Paid"", and this is almost all you get. ""The sheets and crosses turned to suits and ties/ In Black America, can you survive?… No hopes and dreams, just leave us be, we leaning on the Bible,"" he laments on ""C.N.B."", an expression not so much of defiance as a simple plea for peace. Sometimes, nothing feels as real as simple weariness, or wariness. There is one true moment of tenderness on the album. ""Summertime"" has some oddly voiced guitar chords, which Clams Casino surrounds with his trademark soothing hum of synths, like a buzzing air conditioner behind yellowed drapes. Staples half-sings in an exhausted monotone. ""Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom,"" he offers. ""My teachers told us we were slaves/ My momma told me we was kings/ I don’t know who to listen to/ I guess we somewhere in between/ My feelings told me love is real/ But feelings here can get you killed."" It’s a love song, or the closest thing to that Vince Staples allows himself to make—an allowance that love might exist. There’s nothing in the song’s deadpan knock, its arrangement, or in Staples' voice, that gives away the warmth. It is just there, like the sun the song’s characters stare at to know their freedom.","Vince Staples' first full-length for Def Jam is brilliant. The Long Beach rapper expresses complex ideas in plain, hard sentences, ones that can be handed to you like a pamphlet. His rapping is conversational, but these are the conversations you have when all optimism has been burned away.

Get to Heaven,Everything Everything,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad94ea9e61561daa6133/1:1/w_160/d941fede.jpg,2015-06-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20443-get-to-heaven/,RCA,"It's apt, if dismal, that Get to Heaven arrives the same week as scientists say earth is entering a sixth ""mass extinction"". We've no one to blame but ourselves, they report; meanwhile the third album by maximalist art-poppers Everything Everything feels like the final part of a trilogy about mankind's desperate self-destruction. In its appealingly hyperactive way, the Manchester-based four-piece's 2010 debut, Man Alive, confronted the human effects of media manipulation around war, body image, and the environment. 2013's Arc took a morbid turn, casting depression and the shame of social inaction as a hopeless apocalyptic landscape. ""I'm lawful, I kept my head down/ I turned a blind eye, I played my cards right,"" frontman Jonathan Higgs sang on ""Undrowned"". And yet: ""I'm in debt, man!"" In an age of ISIS, mass shootings, and the rise of the UK right, there's no need for fictional catastrophes on their third record. Get to Heaven pivots on the violent last resorts of the disenfranchised, and the false prophets who claim to save them. Perhaps it's rich of four middle-class white guys to think they have anything to say about being marginalized, but Higgs tries to empathize with what drives people to drastic measures—the subtext being that he's lingered on that emotional cusp. The booming ""Regret"" glimpses a vanishing act on the TV news—perhaps of young people joining ISIS, or volunteers signing up to help aid efforts. ""Maybe you're the coldest if you never felt it,"" sings Higgs of that desperation to do something, as the rest of the band chant the song's title like monks, over a '60s girl-group beat. ""Maybe you're the luckiest if you never did it."" The intense, raging narratives on Get to Heaven are frequently rooted in character studies: The terrorist attempting to kill the queen, the convert to right-wing ideologies, the Good Man who admits that he too would be corrupted by power. The driving vantage point, though, is still his frantic mind. Where the forlorn Arc could feel like a study in learned helplessness, Everything Everything sound more enervated than ever on Get to Heaven. They push their maximalist tendencies to extremes, stretching every second with sound as a way of staving off the death that looms everywhere: ""I don't want to get older,"" as Higgs sings on ""Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread"". And on ""Zero Pharaoh"": ""They tell me there's a way to cheat death."" Lead single ""Distant Past"" is the standout track, in which Higgs pleads for escape from the present day only to realize that certain backwards ideologies want to revive mentalities from a darker age. Underpinning it is a massive, strafing chorus that stokes the escapist fantasy with its hints to Edenic rave culture. Elsewhere, though, he gawks head on at horror. ""To the Blade"" is a yowling opening salvo about prejudice that splutters into a paranoid guitar solo borrowed from Hail to the Thief. Over ""Fortune 500""'s grave, burbling synths, Higgs sings sadly of a ""trail of destruction—but at least it's a trail,"" as he envisages being at the center of a plot to murder the queen. Heavy kick drums and more chanted vocals kick in at the chorus, ramping the tension somewhere nervy and disquieting. They don't really let up on the lyrical desperation, but thankfully there are lighter shades on Get to Heaven, like the title track's jaunty Afrobeat guitar and nonchalant whistle, or the chorus of ""The Wheel (Is Turning Now)"", which erupts in warm euphoria that wouldn't shame Coldplay. The last two songs also offer welcome respite. On ""No Reptiles"", Higgs dismisses theories that world leaders are evil reptilian shapeshifters by pointing out that they're just ""soft-boiled eggs in shirts and ties"". And ""Warm Healer"" abandons the record's scheme altogether—it's a slow, sparkling song about losing the ability to love. There's doubt and desperation in everyone, they seem to suggest, and a little more empathy might go some way to preventing the destruction we wreak on the planet, and on each other. While Get to Heaven's ceaseless terror and heavy arrangements can be overwhelming, more power to Everything Everything for attempting to offer a nuanced understanding of a broken world at a time when a lot of their significantly less imaginative British indie rock peers say worse than nothing.","The third album by maximalist art-poppers Everything Everything feels like the final part of a trilogy about mankind's desperate self-destruction.

Hanging Out the Birds EP,Blawan,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af13c0084474cd0c19e7/1:1/w_160/20e888e4.jpg,2015-06-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20741-hanging-out-the-birds-ep/,TERNESC,"Blawan has always come across as kind of a bruiser. Consider the tattoos on the UK producer's knuckles—""KICK"" on the right, ""DRUM"" on the left—or the fact that his chosen alias reads like an onomatopoeic transcription of comic-book violence. His name feels vaguely like mouthing an explosion, and his music has followed suit. Full of jackhammering kicks, splintered wooden percussion, and short-fuse breakdowns, it's typically as volatile as a coffee-tin full of gunpowder. Granted, Blawan's music has never been hard simply for the sake of being hard: Just see ""Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage"", in which he flips a Fugees sample into what sounds like the unhinged ranting of a serial killer and then piles screams and clangs and abattoir-grade reverb on top. That campy-scary tune, released in 2012, turned into an unexpected breakout hit: It's racked up close to a million plays on YouTube, Skrillex was playing it in his sets for a while, and the Irish quartet Girl Band even covered the song, returning it to the slash-and-burn punk rock that obviously inspired it. But Blawan's latest releases display a much subtler approach. The change is right there in the title of the recent inaugural EP on his TERNESC label: Warm Tonal Touch. He's been making music with an all-hardware setup for a while now, but the first two records on his new label represent a new set of limitations, having been made entirely with modular synthesizers. You wouldn't necessarily know that from listening to them; where many modular users slip down rabbit-holes of complex evolving sequences or get tangled up in cat's cradles of blips and blurps, Blawan uses his machines more for color and shading—darkly lustrous streaks, silvery scribbles, crushed chalk smeared against a backdrop of woven Kevlar. It's not self-consciously ""synthesizer music"" in the way that a lot of modular creations are; it's still techno to the core. The drums still come first, and they, too, are sourced from his modular setup. Why does this matter? It might not to the dancers, but for anyone interested in the myriad decisions that happen between turning on a power strip and turning out a finished track, it's notable that he's opted to go without the standard-issue kicks and snares that animate 99.99% of dance records; instead, he's carved his sounds from scratch, sculpting white noise into scratchy patterns that approximate techno's boom-tick template without simply replicating it. In ""Hanging Out the Birds"" and ""Mine Oh Mine"", the beats move in rippling patterns untethered to anything as obvious as a bass drum; instead of pumping in time to techno's conventional throb, they seem to slide across the surface, like water striders. ""Hanging Out the Birds"" is strangely relaxed and fleshed out with diffuse, almost beatific tones; ""Mine Oh Mine"", with its rapid-fire pitter-pat and chromatic churn, is a nail-biter made even more nerve-wracking by its refusal to reach anything like a climax. Only a soothing spoken-word bit offers the occasional respite from the roil. With its heavier pulse and whip-cracking backbeats, ""Weakening Force"" is more like Blawan's previous records, but it sounds like it's been sanded down and worn away; it is to his more full-bodied work as a grave rubbing is to the granite slab. The heaviest (and best) of the bunch is ""Diatonic Valves"", which charges forward like a lawnmower chewing up gravel and yet still manages to be graceful, even lyrical, even though the sole melodic element is a banshee's wail that snakes dolefully through the upper register. For being so stripped down and so rough around the edges, it packs an incredible amount of tone, and emotion, into its swollen midrange, bringing to mind the ragged-yet-ethereal sound of Basic Channel at their most relentless. It's a tantalizing glimpse of where Blawan might go next—sheathing the tats in velvet gloves without sacrificing an ounce of force.","To speak the UK producer Blawan's name feels vaguely like mouthing an explosion, and his music, full of jackhammering kicks, splintered wooden percussion, and short-fuse breakdowns, has followed suit.

808s and Dark Grapes III,Main Attrakionz,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aecf9d034d5c69bf45f0/1:1/w_160/204b9ebb.jpg,2015-06-26 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20690-808s-and-dark-grapes-iii/,,"It may have been the fakest year ever, but 2011 was the big break for Main Attrakionz, the duo of MondreM.A.N. (Damondre Grice) and Squadda B (Charles Glover). That year saw some of the Oakland natives’ best work: both installments of their 808s & Dark Grapes series, especially the cult-favorite second volume, as well as Squadda’s solo opus, I Smoke Because I Don’t Care About Death. The duo had guested on A$AP Rocky’s debut tape and were collaborating regularly with man-of-the-moment Danny Brown. This was the year of Clams Casino’s first Instrumental Mixtape and G-Side’s iSLAND; in short, it was the year of cloud rap, a vague-on-purpose label for these lo-fi, bass-heavy, Imogen Heap-sampling rappers and producers who named their mixtapes stuff like Raindrop Music. This scene lived mostly on the Internet and favored big ideas over lofty language; ""I undersell myself when I say shit,"" Squadda once proclaimed. That term ""cloud rap"" is now embarrassingly quaint to say aloud, having aged about as well as ""witch house,"" but the sound it represents is very much still alive. It’s just become harder to isolate, as mainstream and ""alternative"" rap have grown increasingly entangled in recent years and Lil B’s influence has become impossible to ignore. Mondre and Squadda came up breathing the same rarified East Bay air as the Based God, their scene’s unofficial patron saint. Cloud rap was based like a square is a rectangle—inseparable but distinct entities. Their lyrics weren’t as bizarre or funny as Lil B’s could be, but they were honest, emotional, and often very poignant—self-taught sociologists trying to understand the world and themselves. 808s & Dark Grapes III comes almost four years after its predecessor, and though Squadda still drops tapes semi-regularly, Main Attrakionz haven’t released a project since 2013. That wouldn’t be an especially long hiatus for some artists, but these guys used to hemorrhage music. Their streak from 2009-2012 was Gucci-level prolific; they made 100 tracks in June of '09, the summer both graduated high school. There’s so much music that falls through the cracks from that period, a snapshot of this ultra-specific slice of the rap Internet. The DatPiff description of 2010’s Best Duo Ever: The Greentape reads like a eulogy to turn-of-the-aughts rap Tumblr greats, the kind of network that doesn’t really have a current analog. But after 2012, as their peers became bonafide stars (Rocky, Clams, Danny, Harry Fraud), Main Attrakionz faded into the background. Their lyrics had always prioritized inner peace over profit, and it seemed like they had some things to figure out before they got back to the game. Those who would scoff at the dated micro-genre descriptor should take note: 808s III doesn’t sound particularly ""cloudy"" at all. The album is bombastic and baroque, certainly not lo-fi; if anything, it evokes sunlight streaming through parting clouds, a sudden moment of clarity. Much of this is thanks to production duo Friendzone (or fellow Oakland natives James Laurence and Dylan Reznick), whose evocative compositions draw from J-pop, Dipset Trance Party, video game scores and The-Dream. They made the beat for one of the all-time great MAz tracks, ""Perfect Skies"", a song that grasped for optimism in an exhausting world. That mindset is the lifeblood of 808s III, an album about perseverance, patience, getting your mind right. Mostly, it seems, it’s about redemption. Lead single ""Ain’t No Other Way"", with its Kreayshawn-directed video, is exactly the song you come to Main Attrakionz for: blunted and casually gorgeous, advocating grounded positivity in spite of it all, getting by with a little help from their friends. ""In this cold world, you get lost,"" sings Squadda—it’s really more of a based R&B song than a rap song—in what might be an abbreviated explanation for their hiatus. The often cruel unpredictability of life has been a central theme throughout the duo’s catalog, as it is here on ""Shoot the Dice"". This used to give their work a nihilistic bent, running counter to the chin-up basedness, which could manifest as righteous political fury or escapist hedonism. Squadda and Mondre seem calmer now, more willing to live in the world as it is. And there are moments of pure elation, too, expanding beyond cloud rap’s woozy insularity and aiming higher. They giddily proclaim themselves ""spectacular and debonair"" on the shimmering ""G.O. Style"". The triumphant horns of ""What Else to Do"" evoke a hyperactive video game version of Drake’s ""Trophies"". And though MAz were staunchly ""I don’t like shit, I don’t go outside"" before it was cool, ""Dip"" is their closest thing to a club song, channeling a haunted-castle version of ""Tipsy"" for 2015 (Squadda even shouts out JKwon’s Hood Hop in ""Shoot the Dice"", so this may be intentional). Easy standout ""Summa Time"" builds into an immense and poignant climax, exploding into fireworks as the duo set aside existential paranoia to celebrate the moment: ""Fuck it, let’s keep it going till the sun come up!"" The emotional crux is saved for closing track ""Two Man Horror Film"". Shady Blaze, always the most technically gifted rapper within Main Attrakionz's Green Ova crew, delivers a quietly gut-wrenching verse that speaks of channeling unspeakable grief—the loss of his newborn son in 2013—into songwriting. ""For the most part, I’m good,"" he concludes, in a moment of awe-inspiring grace. That gets right at the essence of Main Attrakionz, who are sharper and more consistent than ever here, even if the high points don’t quite match those of 808s II: life is incredibly hard, but there are moments of beauty that make it worthwhile, often found through the people you love. ""Two Man Horror Film"" fades into a scavenged sound clip, a practice MAz have been fond of for years. It’s a selection of a speech from the 1998 movie Bulworth, a satire about a suicidal senator who burns out and, completely disillusioned, discovers rap and uses it as his own means of brutally honest political expression. ""You got to be a spirit—you can't be no ghost,"" it goes, a final reminder from cloud rap’s prodigal sons that life goes on, if you want it to.","808s & Dark Grapes III comes almost four years after its predecessor, and though rapper Squadda B still drops tapes semi-regularly, Main Attrakionz haven’t released a project since 2013.

The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam,Thundercat,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af29c0084474cd0c1a13/1:1/w_160/fa076f40.jpg,2015-06-26 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20760-the-beyond-where-the-giants-roam/,Brainfeeder,"The EP format isn't where artists tend to make big statements, with the possible asterisk-style exception of Robyn (whose Body Talk series eventually resulted in a proper, long-playing release anyway). Instead, a short-form release suggests anxious label-heads putting pressure on an artist to release something, anything, as soon as possible. But that's not at all the aura projected by this spellbinding, 16-minute, six-track sequence from Thundercat—an artist who has been in the public eye plenty this year already, thanks to prominent spots on albums by Kendrick Lamar and Kamasi Washington. While riding that wave, it's hard to imagine members of Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder imprint saying ""We need something from you right this second,"" which leaves us with an alternative explanation: namely, that the brief duration of The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam (he's calling it a ""mini-album,"" which is the euphemism du jour for EPs) is exactly the statement the bassist-singer-composer wanted to make at this moment. The songs here are airy, and often provisional-feeling, while Thundercat's lyrics reliably invoke death, mourning, and vulnerability. The mini-album opens with an ethereal, vocal-led invocation entitled ""Hard Times"", and follows this up with a track called ""Song for the Dead"", which labors under some muffled-sounding percussion for most of its running time before stumbling into a clearer sonic field, near its conclusion. Every composition seems relentlessly aware of its own mortality. The greatest comfort on offer tends to be the nimble power of Thundercat's virtuoso technique on his main axe. That instantly recognizable, feather-touch electric bass sound of his is potent, but also gossamer-delicate in a way that reinforces the mini-album's themes of impermanence. Even when Thundercat comes up with with a monster, single-worthy groove, as on ""Them Changes""—the interlocking bass parts of which recall the supple funk Thundercat has contributed to Erykah Badu's New Amerykah series—he does not allow himself a rousing chorus, instead reverting to the wordless vowel-mewling of the mini-album's initial, more downtrodden tracks. He even fades the track into silence just as Washington starts a saxophone solo. One images that there's an extended ""Them Changes"" sitting in a folder on Thundercat's computer—though if so, it's obvious how giving listeners an epic version of this song might have thoroughly disrupted the equilibrium of a release as reflective as this one. Likewise, Herbie Hancock's keyboard cameo—which comes during ""Lone Wolf and Cub""—isn't the place for guest-star grandstanding. (Though he sounds good.) In a series of Twitter messages posted shortly after this mini-album's release, Thundercat explained that he is continuing to come to terms with the ""insanely brutal"" deaths of some close friends, while also attempting to process the larger-scale racist injustices that still occur with disheartening regularity. In the final, almost-sunny-sounding track (over some atypically bright keyboard tones), the narrator encounters a strange but comforting entity. It sounds
like Thundercat finds the figure's presence to be a welcome one—though tellingly, still has to ask ""can you tell me who you are?"" For those of us also muddling through various grim realities, it's tempting to think of this mysterious and unassuming release—which appeared with little advance notice—along similar terms. As it doesn't behave like many other recordings out in the world, you're at first blush tempted to ask what it's up to, and what it wants. But then the figure puts its arms around you, and you start to feel a bit better, even without a full explanation of what's going on. That's more than plenty of full-length records achieve.","The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam is a spellbinding, 16-minute, six-track sequence from Thundercat—an artist who has been in the public eye plenty this year already, thanks to prominent spots on albums by Kendrick Lamar and Kamasi Washington.

High Risk,Dave Douglas,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae9c5e6ef95969321c93/1:1/w_160/ca6d31b9.jpg,2015-06-25 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20652-high-risk/,Greenleaf,"Dave Douglas is a well-established jazz player who has been an active performer since the mid-'80s and who has recorded with a number of influential ensembles, including John Zorn's Masada Quartet and his own Balkan music group, Tiny Bell Trio. Zach Saginaw—who records under his middle name, Shigeto—composes lightly psychedelic instrumental hip-hop and has released a number of records via the label Ghostly International. The pair first met last year, via a Red Bull Music Academy event that paired musicians—Nels Cline, Wadada Leo Smith, Petra Haden, among others—in a series of solo and duet improvisations. And while they aren't necessarily obvious collaborators, the two hit it off. Not a traditionalist by any stretch, Douglas has recorded with electronic musicians throughout his career, most recently with his group, Keystone, but also as far back as the 1997 live album Sanctuary. High Risk's self-titled debut album has a distinct character that sets it apart from those releastes, though. In the past, Douglas's work with electronics has often involved DJs and performers—DJ Olive, Ikue Mori, Jamie Saft, to name a few—that used samplers, record players, and electronic percussion to manipulate recorded sounds. Nestled into ensembles that were driven by more traditional instrumentation, these musicians created elastic textures that augmented the chaotic and improvisatory nature of the music. High Risk is much more serene and meditative. The quartet—which also includes drummer Mark Guiliana and bassist Jonathan Maron—blends rhythm, melody, and atmosphere in equal measure. The musicians drift seamlessly between implied and solid grooves, with Saginaw adding drones, percussive loops, and live effect processing. There are no chording instruments like piano or guitar. Instead, it's Saginaw who provides the music's harmonic grounding via a series of static keyboard loops and sampled textures. His contributions are often reverb drenched and ethereal—think the dreamiest moments of '80s ECM records re-interpreted via Ableton Live and digital sound processing. Over the course of the album's seven compositions, the quartet hit on a number of fusion jazz touchstones—*On the Corner-*era Miles Davis (""Household Item""), the Headhunters (""Etiquette""), John Hassel's Fourth World music (""High Risk""), and even the mellow minimalism of Chicago post-rock ensemble, Tortoise. But even though the music shifts style and perspective, the mood is uniform and singular. High Risk is not so much an album of jazz augmented by electronic instrumentation, but an album performed by players that are very conscious of and interested in electronic music. It's not just Saginaw dithering with a laptop, but also Guiliana mimicking delay trails on his kit or emulating the oddball swing of chopped and spliced rhythms. Over top, Douglas' playing is generally very mellow—reinforcing the ambient and meditative aspects of the music. It's a special challenge to perform jazz—or perform among jazz musicians—while using electronics. Unlike a saxophone or piano, there's no defined role for a laptop, synthesizer, or sampler. Your presence is always experimental. More importantly, if you're a musician coming from a dance music background, you're typically arriving from a very exacting and non-group oriented form of composition. So, it's a credit to Saginaw that he can hang in there with musicians who have spent the majority of their careers as free improvisers. High Risk's music values stasis over sudden shifts, but by slotting in a loop or processing the playing of his bandmates, Saginaw often manages to steer the mood of compositions and also create a sense of dialog with his bandmates. It's slo-mo, but spontaneous.","Dave Douglas is a well-established jazz player, and Zach Saginaw—who records under his middle name, Shigeto—composes lightly psychedelic instrumental hip-hop. As part of the quartet High Risk, they make serene and meditative electric jazz with a focus on ambient sounds.

"How Far Will You Go?: The S&M Recordings, 1973-81",Smokey,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aea69d034d5c69bf45a3/1:1/w_160/71e2eea5.jpg,2015-06-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20660-how-far-will-you-go-the-sm-recordings-1973-81/,Chapter,"John ""Smokey"" Condon's biography has all the makings of a gay rock legend. He grew up in a Baltimore enmeshed in the counterculture of the 1960s, living above a nightclub as a teen and partying in John Waters’ eclectic circle. He sang in local groups and became involved in activism, protesting the Vietnam War, marching with United Farm Workers civil rights leader Cesar Chavez, and fighting for gay rights at the Stonewall riots in New York City. Crucially, he connected with the Doors’ road manager, Vince Treanor, and accompanied that group to the Isle of Wight festival, where he was exposed to the Who, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and other bands that molded Smokey into the music-obsessive social butterfly he would become when he moved into Treanor's house in the Hollywood Hills shortly thereafter. It was there that Smokey was introduced to EJ Emmons, a little-known record producer whose biggest credit was co-producing with sunshine pop mastermind Curt Boettcher (Beach Boys, the Association). Smokey and Emmons, who quickly became a couple, decided to start recording together based on an easy rationale that would define much of their collaborative decisions in the decade to come: ""Well why not?"" Their first single, and the opening track on How Far Will You Go? The S&M Recordings, 1973-81, the first-ever collection of Smokey's music released via Melbourne-based Chapter Music, was 1974’s ""Leather"". A punchy BDSM anthem inspired by Smokey’s first encounter with the newly liberated sex scenes thriving in places like New York’s premier leather bar The Eagle, the song found the duo firing on all cylinders: Smokey’s vampy vocals about being tied up come together with Emmons’ jaunty pianos and drums, making for an inimitable introduction that eventually became their best-selling single, most notably joining the rotation at integral glam rock nightclub Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco. The B-side, ""Miss Ray"", also included on How Far Will You Go?, further pushed their representation of gay culture to the fore in the shape of a strutting ode to a drag queen Smokey lived with in Baltimore. But despite the catchiness of those first singles, Smokey’s brazenly gay lyrics were a hard sell to the record labels that could have ushered the group into the mainstream. He and Emmons, who at the time had industry connections to boot, were laughed out of meetings with heavyweights MGM and Mercury. It became clear that despite the gay rights movement now at work across the nation, there was no room for queer artists to be themselves and become nationwide music sensations, a fact that the openly gay, similarly forward-thinking Elektra signee Jobriath would later disappointingly prove. But there was a silver lining for Smokey: It was from these consecutive rejections that S&M Recordings was born, essentially serving as a hearty fuck you to the music industry that didn’t want to provide a platform for them, right down to the label’s shamelessly homo emblem: a burly, muscled arm with leather cuffs, S and M tattooed on the bicep. Transferred and restored from S&M Recordings’ original LPs and tapes by Emmons himself, How Far Will You Go*?*'s 16 tracks are threaded together by deft production details and a forthright sense of humor that posits the duo as unsung heroes of those glam, pre-punk years, which, in essence, they were. There's Emmons' chugging disco production spliced with funny bits of spoken-word on ""DTNA"", which flows easily into the sultry cascade of multi-tracked vocals that intone behind Smokey's sighing performance on ""Topaz"". You can hear expertly executed elements from various '70s-era music scenes, whether in the Bowie-inflected synth work of ""I’ll Always Love You"", the pianos on ""Topanga"" that evoke Elton John (who was rumored to have Smokey 7’’s in his personal jukebox), or the whistling rocket noises and whirring synth lines of nine-minute disco standout ""Piss Slave"". And, like Jobriath, Smokey always reveled in pushing the envelope, whether that meant inserting ""Piss Slave""’s confrontational mid-chorus onto dancefloors (""I wanna, I wanna, I wanna be your toilet!"") or casting truck stop tricks in a humanizing and compassionate light on the funk-indebted ""Million Dollar Babies"". They were fearless in a time when doing so had a high, sometimes fatal price, and by 1980, Smokey had put out their final single on S&M, ""Fire"", with previously-released B-side ""Strong Love"". The latter served as the title track to Chapter's excellent 2012 compilation Strong Love - Songs of Gay Liberation 1972-81, and reappears here as well. Though nowhere near as overt as something like ""Piss Slave"", ""Strong Love"" is just as nervy and compelling, an anthem for gay love carried by Smokey's sneering, louche vocals. It's a song that serves as the quintessence of Smokey's appeal and ability, one you could see being released today and still shifting the paradigm, at least a little bit. Luckily for us, the duo agreed in a recent interview that there was a possibility for new music from Smokey in the future, now that How Far Will You Go? is out; let's just hope it doesn't take another 35 years before that's unearthed, too.","Baltimore's John ""Smokey"" Condon and partner EJ Emmons created seldom-heard pop inspired by the rapidly shifting gay liberation movement and queer culture. How Far Will You Go*?*'s 16 tracks are threaded together by deft production details and a forthright sense of humor that posits the duo as unsung heroes of the glam years.

PeteStrumentals 2,Pete Rock,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae419d034d5c69bf44e8/1:1/w_160/e49a1077.jpg,2015-06-25 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20574-petestrumentals-2/,Mello Music Group,"Hip-hop producers rarely come greater than Pete Rock, whose reputation as one of the titans of the '90s golden age hasn't and shouldn't be diminished by the increasing marginalization of his profile in the mainstream. Just because he's doing latter-day mixtapes with Camp Lo and scoring extended Smoke DZA monologues doesn't mean he can't bring the same insight and motivation that he brought to ""The World Is Yours"" or ""Be Easy"" or ""The Joy"". The man knows his craft and doesn't skimp on it, so it hardly matters whether an MC on one of his tracks is a household name or a hardcores-only attraction, so long as the beat's done justice. The question remains, then, how good a beat can be before it can work without an MC at all. Great instrumental hip-hop records from great producers sound like inner voyages with their collected influences, filtered through their newest observations and wrangled into something unpredictable and evocative. Not-so-great instrumental records from great producers? Well, they kind of sound like demo reels. To be fair, the first PeteStrumentals, released way back in 2001, was a hell of a demo reel, as is its long-belated sequel PeteStrumentals 2: in both cases, the beat hooks you in the first few bars before you start fiending for somebody putting in an actual verse by the midpoint. Still, it's at least worth delving into what shifts in style and technique both connect and separate PeteStrumentals 2 from the sounds he was working with 14 years ago (or 24 years ago, for that matter). Those characteristic blasts of seamless horn loops and burbling keyboards—piano, Rhodes, or otherwise—still jump out as backbone elements, pieces that introduce themselves like flourishes and eventually work their way down into the marrow to become as integral as the drums. But it's those drums that still hit on (or around) The One that remain Pete's core means of expression even when he's rewriting his signature. The lead-in to opener ""Heaven & Earth"" hints at choppy, juddering excursions that threaten to mess with basslines in micro-fractured doses, a tease at an acknowledgement of more contemporary and weirder ways to toy with samples. But its psychedelic dub descent eventually lands on a solid boom-clap foundation that rides on the deep juxtaposition of soulful expressions—elegance on the piano, oomph on the drums—that's made him one of the best at merging melodic grace and percussive power. Where he's been taking his sound since his first flush of renown has put him in the position of being an elder statesman who still seems open to learning and mutating. That someone who was veteran enough to influence Dilla wound up having that influence reciprocated is worth highlighting. Maybe it's not that big of a surprise considering the two-way torch-passing meant he oversaw and arranged the postmortem Jay Stay Paid, but it turns out he can still stake a claim to his own turf even when paying tribute (""Dilla Bounce (R.I.P.)""), whether he keeps his drums quantized or not, whether he pushes for familiar soul-jazz cool (""Air Smoove""), heated funk (""Accelerate""; ""PR 4 Prez""), and wistful R&B (""I Wish""), or dives into something like ""Cosmic Slop"", which latches onto disembodied synth chords and builds up a track that runs on hypnotic ambience—albeit with a goldbrick-heavy bassline. The atmosphere, meanwhile, trades on tweaks of nostalgic familiarity—sample-spotters will hear old standbys like David Axelrod and Isaac Hayes and Black Heat woven into the texture —but PeteStrumentals 2 is too aware of the post-Ummah, Stones Throw-adjacent culture of contemporary beatmaking to coast on his golden-age pedigree. There are Madlib-esque moments of abrupt soundbite drop-ins, narrative or otherwise, some of which—like the 34-second anti-police-brutality interlude ""Justice (Brotherhood & Understanding)""—provide a deeper emotional core that the beats themselves only allude to. It's just disappointing that there aren't more of these little touches, or a more quick-moving barrage of ideas condensed into a more concentrated dose—the beats are all quality, but without voices there's not much they can do in three-and-a-half minutes that they don't have the strength and presence to do in two.","Pete Rock is one of hip-hop’s greatest producers. He released his first instrumental outing PeteStrumentals in 2001 and this long-belated sequel is both connected to and separated from that earlier material.

Feels Like,Bully,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adcbc0084474cd0c17ae/1:1/w_160/b713e292.jpg,2015-06-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20484-bully-feels-like/,ColumbiaStarTime,"Alicia Bognanno's coarse Cobain head-scream is its own resuscitating jolt of protest. It liberates Bully's songwriter, singer, and guitarist from the oppressive weight she carries on the Nashville band’s debut album, Feels Like: Worn down by lying jackasses, locked in the ""invisible handcuffs"" of patriarchal expectation, eroded by the male gaze, her feelings discarded like garbage. Compounding all the external fuckery is a black hole of self-doubt and self-deceit that she’s trying to break through. ""My lies settle thicker than my milkshake/ But they both make my stomach ache/ And they’re both slowly weighing me down,"" she sings on ""Brainfreeze"", one of her few moments of pristine indie pop sweetness across these 11 songs. In a startling shift from Bully’s easygoing 2014 debut EP, Bognanno spends much of Feels Like tearing down the house with her howl. She and the band—Clayton Parker on guitar, Reece Lazarus on bass, and Stewart Copeland (no relation) on drums—leave behind that EP’s warm and shaggy take on '90s guitar pop for a tougher, more pointed assault that initially sounds austere. Not that anything has been lost in translation between Bognanno’s mind and her microphone. With assistance from staff engineer Jon San Paolo, she recorded the whole thing herself at Chicago’s Electrical Audio, where she interned a few years ago; in the house style, she refers to herself as the engineer of these songs rather than the producer. But over time Feels Like’s essential power becomes evident. ""I’m just looking for clarity to help me through,"" Bognanno sings on ""Trying"", and the relatively spare production allows the emotion of every guitar part to smack harder: On that song, it’s a yearning whine as she sings about her recurring worry that she’s ""growing so far from myself."" The chorus of ""Trash"" sounds as if she’s leaping up and down on a broken mattress, pretending it’s the head of the liar who treats her worried-over feelings as something disposable, while the killer ""I Remember"" races as fast as her memories of a complex, enduring love. Bognanno is fond of making her choruses into stumbling blocks that stall the pace for a moment, but the joyous ""Milkman"" has a loopy waterslide rush that disguises the deceptively sour lyrics: Already trying to outrun her speeding mind, she also realizes that the more she loves a boy, the more he’ll lie to her. The '90s nostalgia of Feels Like is undeniable, but the hooks are catchy and Bully are most reminiscent of an under-appreciated band—the Blake Babies circa 1989’s Earwig and 1990 follow-up Sunburn. Melodically, Bully are operating on the same level as Juliana Hatfield and co. after they had taken a massive step up from their shambling 1987 debut, Nicely Nicely, and both bands makeover their beleaguered cries as exhilarating, fun pop-punk. Hatfield could be incredibly self-flagellating; Bognanno is never quite so brutal, but in spite of the shit she shoulders throughout Feels Like, she’s much harder on herself than any of the perpetrators. She’s an anxious introvert with a knack for slipping in sad details as mysterious asides. ""I’m not that social anyway,"" she sings on homebody anthem ""Reason"", where she admits that one of her favorite hobbies is watching her dog stare at the shed—though she’s happiest hiding out ""by the lake, at my dad’s house/ I can take that old bike that my mom left behind a very long, long time ago."" Once she’s shut out the whole world, however, the noise in her head starts to take over. Nineteen years on, she can’t forgive herself for breaking her sister’s arm, she sings on ""Six"", even though as a kid she slept on her own broken arm for a night to try and make up for it. Time disappears on the moody ""Picture"", where she balks at having her photo taken—at being fixed in time at the point in her 25-year-old life where she’s trying to figure out how far she is from who she used to be, and which parts of herself she wants to make permanent. Within this explosive, rollicking music, Bognanno is as intimate a songwriter as Courtney Barnett or Waxahatchee's Katie Crutchfield, her attempts at being honest with herself contrasted by the liars who want to sink her with them as they renege responsibility for their own lives. Feels Like doesn’t reference any specific dates or weather, but it feels like a summer coming-of-age album. Sure, there are the mentions of milkshakes and scabbed knees, along with the way Bully’s untamed punk should soundtrack windows-down freedom in rattling first cars. But there’s also that sense of lonely intimacy with oneself within what can feel like a vast void of time; six weeks where you tempt yourself with the promise of reinvention that you’ll probably never commit to, lay uncomfortably with your regrets, and fret that the future isn’t making itself clear. These are anthems for ""all of us and our unpaid dues,"" as Bognanno sings on ""Brainfreeze""; people who, per the album title, are slowly learning to trust their intuition and the weight of an emotion. On ""Picture"", one finally weighs too heavy on her, but in a good way: ""Break before I start to bend,"" she sings, finding herself in the act of resistance.","The coarse Cobain head-scream of Bully singer, songwriter, and guitarist Alicia Bognanno is its own resuscitating jolt of protest. In a startling shift from the band's easygoing 2014 debut EP, she spends much of Feels Like tearing down the house with her howl.

Freedom,Refused,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af019d034d5c69bf4641/1:1/w_160/11fed964.jpg,2015-06-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20726-freedom/,Epitaph,"When Refused's immortal genre-busting barn-burner The Shape of Punk to Come was released in 1998, it felt like an alien craft crash-landing on Earth. The Swedish quartet's opus was profoundly ahead of its time, arriving in the midst of sun-soaked ska (Less Than Jake, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones) and bratty, fratty buzz-bin bands like Eve 6. The album's lean towards the skronky, sulky, and socialistic put it at odds with the vibe of the time: it was too serious, too forlorn, too pretentious. As the years passed, its reputation grew, and it was eventually canonized and revered by everyone from Steve Albini to Hayley Williams of Paramore. Eighteen years have passed since then, nearly two decades of silence kickstarted by the well-documented inter-band conflict explored in the documentary Refused Are Fucking Dead. A whole new generation of border-jumpers has risen from the wake of The Shape of Punk to Come, with bands like the Dillinger Escape Plan and the Bled venturing down the paths opened up by Refused's wrecking ball. And then, to everyone's surprise, they clawed their way out of the dirt in 2015 to announce a new album, Freedom. It didn't take a miracle to bring Refused back from the fucking dead—just a brief reunion tour in 2012. After years of not speaking to each other, Refused found themselves locked into a groove. ""Things happen, other things fall into place, and then all of a sudden you're in L.A. recording a Refused record,"" frontman Dennis Lyxzén told Rolling Stone recently, sounding incredulous at the band's return. On the surface, Freedom is unlike its predecessor in almost every way. It's a conscious shift precipitated by the firing of guitarist Jon Brännström, whose mathy riffs contributed heavily to the band's power. With their profusion of melodic verses and crunchy guitar hooks, the album could easily find a home on modern rock stations alongside bands like Rage Against the Machine and Muse. Stomping funk-slab ""Françafrique"" is more or less a lesson in colonialism taught by the Red Hot Chili Peppers (complete with a chorus of children à la ""Aeroplane""), while the slinky late-album cut ""Servants of Death"" recalls Queens of the Stone Age's similarly skeezy hit ""Smooth Sailing"". ""Elektra"" and ""366"", the album's pair of contributions from pop producer supreme Shellback, are the source of the album's biggest controversy. Some fans may blanch at the thought of a Billboard mainstay producing Refused songs, but given this band's interpretive talents, anything's possible. If they can channel the spirit of Ornette Coleman through hardcore punk, who's to say they can't channel the sounds of Top 40? But Shellback's work here brings to mind the kind of hulking, high-definition mixes one would expect from Will Yip and Mutt Lange, and the tracks don't stand out from what surrounds them. Listening to the album from start to finish, the songs are indistinguishable—an ironic flaw, considering how the producer is a huge fan of the band who learned to play drums by hearing The Shape of Punk to Come (perhaps this reverence kept him from seeking out Britney for a guest feature). As with The Shape of Punk to Come, Freedom's lyrics focus on what the band perceives as the hypocrisy and complacency inherent in European identity, and how such complacency leads to death, rot, and ruin. Lyxzén plays the role of sociopolitical loudmouth with relish, flinging heretical imagery left and right. ""Elektra"" opens with the grisly image of a towering monument of corpses; ""Old Friends/ New War"" frames Lyxzén's existence within ""centuries of fire."" And of course, there's his frothing, ham-fisted stadium chant of  ""Murder Murder Murder Murder Murder Murder/ Kill Kill Kill!"" on ""Françafrique"", a nine-word crowdpleaser worthy of a middle-school notebook. The profusion of bloody births and spilled guts is jarring at first, but by the end of the album you become numb to it. You could argue that the repetition is an exercise in desensitizing the listener to the music's inherent violence, but that feels like a stretch. From the whole ""Go back to sleep"" bit on ""Useless Europeans"" to the calls to ""Kill the Man"" to rote atheistic exclamations (""Praise the Lord/God Is Dead!""), Freedom's lyrics read like the adolescent poetry of Tool had they favored Chomsky over Bill Hicks. The infamously awkward opening line of The Shape of Punk to Come—""I've got a bone to pick with capitalism and a few to BREAAAAAKK""—seems like Pulitzer material by comparison. The biggest problem here doesn't lie with the Man, but rather with listeners like you and me, waiting with bated breath for an album to match The Shape of Punk to Come. Refused call this the ""nostalgia circuit"" and they can't stand it, because it's what they've been railing against ever since they started. ""Working with somebody like Shellback is a great way of saying, 'We control what we do with this band'"" (""fuck you"", in other words). Fair enough: Refused have never been ones to kowtow to public opinion, only to pervert it, and in its hostile paradigm shift, Freedom reveals some of The Shape of Punk to Come's rebellious DNA. But even under the pretense of ironic ear candy, the band's hijacking of commonplace modern rock proves ultimately to be neither subversive nor satisfying. No, Refused are not fucking dead, but it's unclear from this album what they came back to accomplish.","Almost two decades have passed since the Swedish punk band Refused released their genre-busting album The Shape of Punk to Come. After years of not speaking to each other, they found themselves in a brief reunion tour in 2012, and have now issued Freedom, a collection that's  unlike its predecessor in every way.

Hardy & the Hardknocks: Drownin on a Mountaintop,T. Hardy Morris,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef1b1335d7bf1699e74/1:1/w_160/4abf7b3e.jpg,2015-06-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20715-hardy-the-hardknocks-drownin-on-a-mountaintop/,Dangerbird,"Though grunge will always be linked to Seattle, the genre’s image never squared with the suave skyscrapers and cosmopolitan mindset of one of the country’s most cash-flushed cities. Instead, it owed more to the flannelled, blue-collar sensibilities of the small factory towns outside of the city, like Kurt Cobain’s native Aberdeen, which helps account for why it resonated not only with tastemakers but also ordinary, meat-and-potato rock fans. T. Hardy Morris has long been fascinated by grunge's backwoods roots. ""It was rural music,"" the singer/guitarist contended in a recent profile, likening it to the sounds he grew up with in Georgia. ""It’s kind of like Southern rock."" For the last decade, Morris has explored the parallels between grunge and Southern rock with his band Dead Confederate, though both styles sometimes took a backseat to that group’s stoner-rock tendencies. Recently, Morris has also been dabbling in side projects a good deal less gloomy than his primary band, recording a couple of LPs with Deer Tick’s Robbie Crowell and Black Lips’ Ian Saint Pé as Diamond Rugs, in addition to a pair of solo albums that play like mirror images of each other. Where Morris’s inaugural solo effort, 2013’s Audition Tapes, was a relatively sedated singer-songwriter affair, seeped in the weeping pedal steels and confessional spirit of so many Nashville records, Drownin on a Mountaintop is its temperamental opposite—wild, prickly, and unsentimental. The twang remains, but this time grunge and punk are the driving impulses. As Morris tells it, fatherhood inspired Mountaintop’s rowdier sound. He rushed to finish the record before the birth of his first daughter, and it beats with the urgency of a man trying to purge some final youthful bad decisions from his system before it’s wholly irresponsible to do so. On song after song, Morris casts himself as a fuck up at best and a menace at worst—a trope he borrows from outlaw country, though unlike a true rebel, Morris can’t stop his thoughts from cycling back to the toll of his actions and the example he’s setting. He presents the album’s booziest, blusteriest song ""Likes of Me"" as a cautionary tale for his imagined children. ""Maybe I can scare you silly not to do the things I’ve done,"" he seethes maniacally, matching the song’s In Utero-sized stop/start riff with Cobain’s curdled yowl. On Dead Confederate’s first records, Morris was sometimes overeager to play up the echoes of Cobain in his voice, but over time his has developed its own character. Where Cobain’s croak was deliberate and authoritative, Morris’s is rangy and conniving. Even when he’s being earnest, he sounds like a grifter making a hard sell. Unimpeded by the austere, psychedelic stretches that weigh down Dead Confederate’s albums, Mountaintop gives Morris’s voice ample space to roam, and it’s a thrill to hear him cut loose. That unbridled spirit comes at a cost, though, since Mountaintop’s loosest songs are so lackadaisically written they fall apart. With Audition Tapes, Morris penned considered tributes to the childhood friends he’d left behind, but there’s little of that depth here. Too many lyrics read like they were scribbled during between-take cigarette breaks. On ""Starting Gun"", he sets up the album’s shittiest pun: ""See that clock up on the wall? I wound it up, and it ticked me off."" A couple tracks later on ""Littleworth"" he grabs at the nearest adage, musing ""It may sound lazy but the truth hurts,"" and, as cautioned, it does sound lazy. The thrashing title track offers an even blunter commentary on how thinly written it is. ""What the hell is going on,"" Morris marvels after the chorus, ""How can you call this a song?"" There are two types of clumsy lyrics: Ones that pass with limited damage, and ones so invasive they bring entire songs to a halt. It’s those latter ones that Morris steers into again and again, which is unfortunate, since otherwise his crash fusion of grunge and country has never sounded better than it does on Mountaintop. He’s got the attitude down pat, but he doesn’t always have the songs to back it up.","For the last decade, T.

Pale Horses,mewithoutYou,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aecc13d197565213a18d/1:1/w_160/ec3d30a1.jpg,2015-06-24 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20688-pale-horses/,Run for Cover,"For an explicitly Christian record label, Tooth & Nail was home to several ambiguously religious post-hardcore bands. Underoath and Anberlin often framed their devotionals in the more general language of emotional or physical apocalypse. Philadelphia five-piece mewithoutYou were signed to Tooth & Nail in the mid-2000s, but their spiritual qualities are introspective and intersectional; lyricist Aaron Weiss draws together Christian, Jewish, and Muslim traditions, forming an intricate, collagist cosmology through which he relates to God. Weiss' lyrics on Pale Horses, mewithoutYou's first album for punk label Run for Cover, detail his struggles with the densities of language and the inward mutations of faith, which writer John Jeremiah Sullivan once characterized as ""a logical door which locks behind you."" ""I've just been thinking and reading more about language and words and how hard their meanings are to pin down—even simple words, let alone complex, lofty ones that I've long since been fascinated with,"" Weiss said in an interview with Myspace posted a few weeks ago. ""So I sort of questioned my ability to communicate anything worthwhile. If I'm not sure that I'm going to say something that's going to help anybody or say anything that's true, then I might as well make it sound pretty."" The imagery on Pale Horses offers generous doses of apocalypse, drawing largely from Revelation 6, in which seven seals are broken and generate the end of the world; in one verse, Death materializes on a pale horse. In the song ""Red Cow"", ""green figs fall from the Nebraska sky""; in the Book of Revelation, this is an analogy for stars unscrewing from the depths of space. Pale Horses also absorbs several modernist texts; in the same Myspace interview Weiss mentions the influence of James Joyce, which contributes a kind of unconscious and shattering rhythm to his writing. ""Here again the chords clash,"" Weiss sings at the start of ""Watermelon Ascot"", reshaping a line in Ezra Pound's ""Sestina: Altaforte"", and through the rest of the verse (""Again the half-past/ Carrie Nation cut glass/ Prohibition children of the have caste"") his internal and associative rhyming begins to simulate the inversions and precise orbits of Pound's poetry. On previous albums Weiss tended to communicate through analogy and parable; on Pale Horses his words and references collapse on each other like glass in a mosaic, only obtaining sense and meaning after they've fallen together. Musically, Pale Horses functions as a kind of career summary, compressing their musical digressions into a coherent whole. It's also their first album recorded by Will Yip, who this year recorded dreamier, gauzier records by otherwise formally punk bands Title Fight and Turnover. To Pale Horses he mainly contributes a concussive drum sound reminiscent of the snares on Nirvana's In Utero, where individual hits resemble the burst of a paper bag. The songs are motivated more by groove than any individual riff or melody, anchored by bass and drums around which guitars pulse in uneasy constellations. Under these conditions, songs tend to expand and change shape, often ending in places more aggressive and primal from which they began. The final track on Pale Horses, ""Rainbow Signs"", begins gently and glacially, Weiss barely whispering over soft bruises of guitar. It ends with a guitar riff that metaphorically and physically peels away the earth, lifting out of the track like a cathedral through a desert floor. ""The sky, I'd been told/ Will roll up like a scroll,"" Weiss screams, and you could almost mistake his voice for a bloom of static. ""The sun will turn black as a dead raven's back/ But there's nowhere to hide from the judge's face."" But after the world recedes in a dense cloud of scripture, Weiss ends the record in a very personal and opaque place, with a dream of him and his deceased father, consciously merged and inwardly telling an intimate, unexplained joke about the Bible. It's one of the few completely successful and uncompromised methods of communication between people: An inside joke.","The Philadelphia post-hardcore band mewithoutYou's lyricist Aaron Weiss draws together Christian, Jewish, and Muslim traditions, forming an intricate, collagist cosmology.

Still,Richard Thompson,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aec413d197565213a17a/1:1/w_160/ed2925bf.jpg,2015-06-24 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20682-still/,Fantasy,"Decades into his career, Richard Thompson remains a perennial critical favorite, favorite of other musicians, and cult hero; his guitar work (hybrid picking, bizarre tuning, and soloing that never feels too self-indulgent) is unparalleled and his songwriting taut, brainy, dry and dark. Still is no departure for Thompson—it's a solid, stark record, expanding on and refining themes that wend their way through his significant oeuvre. But it brings a further depth and resonance to territory that will be familiar to longtime fans, and it's vivid enough to serve as an entry point for those new to his work. For a veteran like Thompson, it's hard to ask for more than that. Recorded with Wilco's Jeff Tweedy at his Loft Studio in Chicago—Tweedy also contributes backing guitar and vocals on some tracks—Still feels extremely present and immediate. There's no studio frosting; it's like listening to Thompson and his band perform directly in front of you with no other noise or distractions. (Considering the many overwrought production missteps of the Mitchell Froom years of his career, roughly 1986-1996, Thompson has no doubt learned that spare production allows the unique beauty of his guitar work, solos that thread through the songs like copper wire, and the quality of his songwriting to shine.) The folk backbone that Thompson has carried from his initial background with Fairport Convention is still strong and evident on tracks like ""She Never Could Resist a Winding Road"", and he plays musically with the historical connections between British folk, Appalachian folk, and the blues on ""Patty Don't You Put Me Down"". The characters in Thompson's songwriting are always struggling, never satisfied. They squabble, they leave, they ache, they are hollow, they frustrate one another, and they are unbelievably cruel to one another. This makes the occasional moment of tenderness and empathy, when written with honesty, seem less maudlin or manipulative than genuine. ""No Peace, No End"" is ferocious, all teeth and claws. Much in the tradition of ""Al Bowlly's in Heaven"" and ""Gethsemane"", two personal-political classics from Thompson's oeuvre, it's about the scars of war on both the soldier and the world around him. ""Broken Doll"" uses the incredibly heavy-handed imagery of a doll that can't be mended to describe a woman who has endured unnamed and unspeakable trauma, but as Thompson's male protagonist struggles to love a woman who hurts immensely because she deserves it and does not ask any reward for himself for doing so—material that in less deft hands would cause immediate and permanent eyerolling—he finds a bloody sincerity that makes the song stark, real, and kind. The gender dynamics of Thompson's songs can arch toward the uncomfortable territory of Troubled Women Toying With Men, or Troubled Women As Romantic And Uncomplicated Objects, but his male protagonists are always presented as just as flawed as his females, and there's always an air of deep self-deprecation. In ""All Buttoned Up"", a woman refuses to fuck her male partner for reasons unknown, and he's incredibly pissed off about it, but he stays with her —because she's really great otherwise, and he cares about her. The biggest weak spot on Still is his throwaway goofball song—in the tradition of ""Two Left Feet"", ""My Daddy Is a Mummy"", and other such live crowd-pleasers, it's a song about a pirate with the misfortune to actually be named ""Long John Silver"". ""Beatnik Walking"", in which Thompson pokes gentle fun at himself and his loyal fanbase (grown-up original hippies and jazz fanatics), is much lighter and more enjoyable, as is ""Guitar Heroes"", an ode to the artists who shaped Thompson's style and to the love of the instrument itself. One clunker on an album full of gems doesn't drag everything else down, though, and Thompson deserves all our respect—he's been through the major-label wringer, found his place where he can be celebrated as he deserves among his independent fans, and is still making complicated, thoughtful, intricate, resonant music on his own terms many decades deep into his career.","Jeff Tweedy's minimal production lets Richard Thompson's strengths shine on the intimate, thoughtful, complex, and rewarding Still.

Pageant Material,Kacey Musgraves,by: Jessica Hopper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aec0c0084474cd0c195b/1:1/w_160/06da20a9.jpg,2015-06-24 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20679-pageant-material/,Mercury Nashville,"From its opening notes, Kacey Musgraves' Pageant Material sounds like a sigh of relief. Musgraves' voice is largely unadorned, her sound analog and organic—she is backed by a small band, sweetened by pedal steel and the occasional string section. The songs are not overworked: the choruses do not explode, they merely unfurl. Her near-perfect major-label debut, 2013's Same Trailer Different Park, positioned her as something akin to the country Kendrick Lamar—the hyperbole was that she could save country music from itself. Musgraves stands in comically stark relief to some of her CMA-hoisting peers, and her ascendance does certainly feel corrective at a time when bro-country's red cup runneth over with EDM's structural dynamics, NRA talking points, and ""rapping."" She's hailed as a new model, one seemingly reverse-engineered from Nashville's Top 40: a perpetually stoned real girl, fixating on fine '70s countrypolitan flourishes and focusing on self-acceptance. Musgraves grew up rural and working class in East Texas and firmly orients herself as someone not-that-far removed from a small town fate. Country, historically, espouses nothin'-fancy humility, but in 2015, these qualities are often illustrated by naming things—cheap beer, old trucks—that signify one's down-homeness. Mainstream country is currently a few years deep into a circa-2004 hip-hop problem, where recitation of the familiar nouns of late-stage capitalism stand as totems, or replace narrative altogether (instead of ""I slang in my white tee,"" it's ""White picket fence house on this dirt."") The exactitude of purchasing power and status is being GPS'd at all times. The lone examples of this behavior on Pageant Material are a citation of Willie Nelson (who duets on his own lovely ""Are You Sure""), the invocation of a room shared with Gram Parsons' ghost on ""Dime Store Cowgirl"", and the title track double-entendre of ""the only Crown is in my glass."" When Musgraves sings ""Just 'cause it don't cost a lot/ Don't mean it's cheap,"" on ""Dime Store Cowgirl"" it's as much a personal thesis about simple values as a repudiation of the economy around her. Musgraves' ""not""-ness is the pivot point of her artistic identity. Her songs exude a relaxed resonance because they have a lot less to prove. They feel personal, and you can locate Musgraves the artist in them (""And if I end up goin' down in flames/ Well, at least I know I did it my own way""). Mainstream country often poses an Us vs. Them chasm meant to alienate those who cannot identify with the lifestyle or values represented; for Musgraves, openness and acceptance are the paradigm. She rejects the mandates of Top 40, but maintains the hallmarks of country tradition, which makes liking her work easy and exacting critique tricky. A lot of country is about singing about what you aren't (or rather ""ain't"")—which she does often here, and most potently on the title track. One of the remarkable things about Musgraves is not how much she has deviated from country norms, but the way she expands them. The most obvious way, and the one that press and the public have latched onto, is the feminist-at-her-liberty narratives with songs (most of which are co-written by her producers, Luke Laird and Shane McAnally, who were also behind the boards on Same Trailer). While this is worth noting and celebrating, in Musgraves' case it's overstated simplification, one that continually pits her as a straw(wo)man against the easy villainy of bro country™, instead of within a canon that spans from Kitty Wells' ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"" to Loretta Lynn's ""Fist City"" to Miranda Lambert's ""Kerosene"". With Pageant Material there is less good-for-the-gander agenda than anticipated. Musgraves is confident and self-contained, but she's not measuring herself against anyone's standards but her own (the Big Machine-subtweeting ""Good 'Ol Boys Club"", and its chaser, ""Cup of Tea""), an idea that she references on most every song on the album. But under the microscope it's more than confidence, it's more than self-help self-love maxims. It's a disregard of the system; it's shrugging off the mantle of Southern Girlhood (""I'd rather lose for what I am/ Than win for what I ain't"" she sings on the title track). And unlike many in her cohort, Musgraves doesn't hoist herself up as a bad girl. Not because she isn't one, but because in her world that dichotomy doesn't exist. Instead she spends much of the record refusing the obligation to a good reputation (""Biscuits"", ""Late to the Party"", or boasting ""I'm always higher than my hair"" on ""Pageant Material""). She celebrates an authentic self expression above all—Musgraves' tendentious realness is what lends the album its quiet politics. Tussling with her persona is fun and engaging work, but it's Musgraves' songcraft that provides the whoa moments. She has the ability to shift a phrase—like ""family is family"" or ""you can take me out of the country, but you can't take the country out of me""—out of cliche and into poignancy, or hell, even into something deep. She can pin 10 of these plainspoken lines back-to-back, without ever straining the song or its narrative or appearing to do any hard work at all. Her ability to pair song to sentiment is fairly flawless. Pageant Material is a bit smoother than Same Trailer and musically there is less to grab on to. The album's maudlin center—the triptych of ""Somebody to Love"", ""Miserable"", and ""Die Fun""—gives it some gravitas. Her voice on these world-weary bits, especially the impeccably crafted ""Miserable"", give the album some of the heft it could use a little more of. It's an easy listen that clocks its 14 tracks swiftly, and can feel a little lightweight on repeated listens. The binary of ""good"" country vs. ""bad"" is one we'd be wise to retire, and is the wrong narrative to frame a songwriter of Musgraves' caliber. She remixes all that we might call corny and shopworn in other, less deft hands. She's making gold records in service to small-town DGAF burner girls who managed to half get their shit together. Which is a truly strange universe for a pop star to be working in—nestling in with the ex-Swiftie fuck-up fringe, young women imagining beyond the dead ends and expectations set before them. While much of women's work in mainstream pop is hung up on pleasure (still important!) and what disposable income nets them (ditto), Musgraves is musing in a more quotidian slog of struggle and acceptance—the work of the self. It's a strange and forgiving album, less toothsome than the ones that preceded it, but Musgraves' resistance makes this album important, even when it's imperfect.","From its opening notes, Kacey Musgraves' Pageant Material sounds like a sigh of relief.

Coming Home,Leon Bridges,by: Ernest Wilkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeffea9e61561daa638a/1:1/w_160/54bdf139.jpg,2015-06-24 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20725-coming-home/,Columbia,"Leon Bridges, a 25-year-old Fort Worth native with a golden voice, is wholly comfortable living in the past. His Columbia debut Coming Home deftly recalls all the well-bronzed giants of soul—your Aretha, your Otis, and especially, in Bridges' case, Sam Cooke. This kind of soul revival, brought over the last decade by places like Daptone Records and artists like the Alabama Shakes, the late Amy Winehouse and others, has been almost universally embraced by (mostly older, white) music fans. (Bridges commented on this phenomenon recently in The Guardian, saying ""I have a song called ""Brown Skinned Girl"", and I ask 'Where my brown-skinned girls at?' And there's maybe one or two in the crowd. It's a little awkward sometimes."") Regardless of skin tone, fans of classic R&B will dig this album as it wholly echoes the tropes we associate with the genre: Tons of reverb, backing female singers, organ, complementary horn arrangements, doo-wops, ballads, songs of love, loss and pretty girls who can shake that thing across several municipalities. In other hands, this could be the eHow entry for ""How to make a retro soul record"". But Bridges has the talent and respect for the genre not to ham it up. Thanks to a backing band featuring Josh Block and Austin Jenkins of Austin-based utility players White Denim (whose 2013 album Corsicana Lemonade deserves your attention), the tunes sound equally timeless and consistent. Bridges can sing magnificently, and has the obvious Sunday choir-honed chops. There is an appealing gentleness to his voice, and to his record, that sets him somewhat apart. There are some annoyances, however. Nostalgia is one thing, but true artists find a way to interject themselves into their music even if they're paying homage to a classic genre (Bridges would do well to revisit the work of labelmate Raphael Saadiq, who did classic soul with his own unique spin). While he obviously has good intentions, at times, Bridges can't help but come off as an imitator. There's rarely any urgency in this album, even when he's promising a lost love that he would literally swim the Mississippi River to get her back (""Better Man""). Therein lies the main issue with Coming Home. Unlike the legends who inspired Bridges by squeezing every last drop of feeling out of their voices—Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, or even gospel heavyweights like the late Rev. James Cleveland—the emotion on the album never fully heats up past ""Yeah, I'm pretty keen about my record being sold in this Starbucks, thanks for asking!"" Speaking of Cooke, he said it best: ""As a singer grows older, his conception grows a little deeper, because he lives life and he understands what he is trying to say a little more."" Bridges is just starting out and there are enough signs on Coming Home that he's only going to get better. Songs like ""Lisa Sawyer"" (a deeply specific ballad dedicated to his mother), display why he's already getting looks from the likes of Jools Holland and why his recent Chicago gig at the legendary Green Mill had potential ticket-buyers in a frenzy once the event sold out. On the title track, Bridges sets out on his own path, using the spirits—the ones celebrated on Sunday morning at church, as well as the ones consumed on Saturday night in the juke joints—as his guide. While it's a little early in that journey, he has enough sheer talent that you want to stick around to see it all finally come together.","Leon Bridges is a 25-year-old Fort Worth native with a golden voice, and his Columbia debut deftly recalls all the well-bronzed giants of soul—your Aretha, your Otis, and especially, in Bridges' case, Sam Cooke.

Amanecer,Bomba Estéreo,by: Minna Zhou,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aea95e6ef95969321ca8/1:1/w_160/4d7c4e3f.jpg,2015-06-23 06:00:05,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20662-amanecer/,Sony,"Where their sophomore release Estalla (Blow Up) established Bomba Estéreo as high-voltage electro-cumbia heavyweights, their third album Elegancia Tropical (2012) looked inward. It was in many ways the period of spiritual incubation that’s allowed for the sort of freer pop expressions of Amanecer. Recorded between LA and Bogotá, Amanecer marks the first time Bomba Estéreo have worked with outside producers; chiefly Ricky Reed, who produced Jason Derulo’s “Talk Dirty” and worked on Pitbull’s Globalization. In various interviews, Bomba’s core duo—vocalist Liliana Saumet and keyboardist/bassist Simón Mejía—have talked about creating an album with more “global” appeal. “Global,” in this case, seems to have meant a combination of glossier production; heftier, in-your-face poppiness; and moments that can justifiably be labeled EDM. This time, the Caribbean and Afro-Colombian elements of Bomba’s musical identity serve more often as accents than anchors. You can still hear the band’s particular brand of tropical bass though, which they call “tropical elegance”; it lives in the tambor alegre rhythms, the occasional champeta-style guitar, the bass, of course. But ultimately, what propels the album is a new, more open sense of love. It’s a celebration, really. It feels a lot like a beachside party that begins late and goes early, moving from night to day, from clubbier dance tracks to poppier love songs. In that respect, Amanecer, meaning “dawn,” plays out like its title suggests. There’s a lot of variation within that transition as well. “Somos Dos”, a few tracks in, is essentially a sped-up kizomba number with a deep house vibe—kizomba being the slow, sensual Angolan popular music made for dancing really close. On “Fiesta”, by contrast, a Carnaval de Baranquilla parade comes crashing through. Carnival drums alternate with dubstep interludes, in a way that’s reminiscent of Dutch-Curaçaoan tropical rave band Kuenta i Tambú (K i T), though with less steam-rolling energy and more breathing room. There is a sort of breeziness that buoys this album. The lyrics on “Voy”, like on much of the album, are simple but reflective, centering on love and partying, but also self-growth and positivity. And Saumet makes it a point to shout out her hometown of Santa Marta and surrounding cities like Barranquilla. They’re Caribbean coastal centers that maintain strong ties to the Black Atlantic and African Diaspora, which the band actually seem to explore more on Amanecer than on past records. Sounds like Colombian gaita flutes and shangaan electro-esque kalimbas flicker in and out of the more mainstream musical framework. That wider musical palette strips down about halfway through, on the meditative and aptly titled “Algo Está Cambiando”—“Something is Changing.” Pop songs like “To’ My Love” and “Mar (Lo Que Siento)” daydream about possible futures with a lover. At times, the sweetness can verge on cloying, cheesy even (i.e. blippy lazer gun sounds, rote EDM drops). But Saumet’s sincerity makes up for it. In fact, Saumet’s conviction does a lot of the emotional work on Amanecer, all the way through to the last moments: in a downtempo track reminiscent of Andean folktronica, Saumet expresses a return to the earth. “Soy hija de la tierra,” she sings. I’m the daughter of the earth. “Tengo adentro lo que quiero.” I have what I want within me. Maybe it’s a foreshadowing of what’s to come for Bomba Estéreo, a return to their roots from their go at bigger pop.","Recorded between LA and Bogotá, Amanecer marks the first time electro-cumbia heavyweights Bomba Estéreo have brought in outside producers: chiefly Ricky Reed, who produced Jason Derulo’s “Talk Dirty” and worked on Pitbull’s Globalization.

"Joy, Departed",Sorority Noise,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aee913d197565213a1bd/1:1/w_160/576d5412.jpg,2015-06-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20711-joy-departed/,Topshelf,"For those who identified with emo during its artistic (if not commercial) peak in the '90s, the most demoralizing development over the past decade is the term becoming synonymous with a performative, juvenile sadness that commodifies depression, often treats women as props, and is expressed in a voice that sounds like the worst version of your 8th grade inner monologue. And so it's understandable to be skeptical of an all-male band named Sorority Noise, often tagged as emo, making a song called “Art School Wannabe”. In it, Cameron Boucher sings in a nasal tone, pinpointing that post-pubescent sour spot where snark becomes an all-purpose defense mechanism against emotional disturbance. It bops along to a chipper shuffle that brings to mind, depending on your age and generosity, the Front Bottoms, mid-period Weezer, or Ben Folds Five. But it also contains the lyric upon which the entirety of Joy, Departed hinges—“Maybe I’m just scared to admit that I might not be as dark as I think/ Maybe I’m not the person that I never wanted to be.” On their 2014 debut Forgettable, Sorority Noise's pop-punk was so steeped in self-pity that the title felt like more of an epitaph than a punchline (“Nobody likes me/ That’s what I tell myself...I spent a lot of last year learning I don’t like me too”). As indicated by ""Art School Wannabe"", Joy, Departed is motivated, above all, by a drive to get over your own bullshit, and this has become an emergent and necessary theme for other bands in its realm. A similar mindset serves as the basis for the near entirety of Annabel’s recently released Having it All and was touched upon on by Modern Baseball's “Two Good Things” and You Blew It!’s “Better to Best”, both of whom contribute guest vocals on Joy, Departed. The Connecticut band also strains with ambition, and the most exciting thing about Sorority Noise and their ilk is that they’re courting a larger audience, reaching for something that seems to be out of their grasp. Both of these aspects can occasionally make Joy, Departed an uncomfortable listen, but they’re also the reason why it’s such a consistently engaging record. Over the last year, Sorority Noise have learned to channel their energy towards their arrangements, which have become more sophisticated, confident, well-produced and also more vertiginous in all aspects. Boucher’s bedheaded vocals are contrasted against gorgeous, sighing strings on “Blissth” and “Fluorescent Black” and both build to soaring peaks that cruelly cut out, as if Sorority Noise temporarily forgot they were still an upstart emo band and were snapped back into reality out of their arena-rock dreams. “Your Soft Blood” has the gripping bombast of Bright Eyes or Cursive or Say Anything from 2002-2004, projects where an untrained, verbose speaker is pulled between caustic punk and ornate chamber pop, fighting against the perception that they haven’t earned such grandiosity. They haven't completely overlooked what worked on Forgettable. The clean twee-punk center at the outset of “Corrigan” bravely holds as blaring fuzz guitars encroach in the chorus. During the verses of “Nolsey”, Boucher slumps around aimlessly like a teenage dirtbag, before a surprising barbershop harmony leads into a glorious explosion of symphonic guitar. The guitars tend to speak more directly than Boucher himself. Whereas Modern Baseball will just flat out admit to staying at home on Friday night, “wishing you were still my girlfriend,”Boucher strives to find more convoluted, pungent ways to make the same point—he wants to be “the heroin that keeps you warm enough,” “the smoke too clear to see,” “in bloom for you.” Instead, he’s “the autumn wind that blows your hair and the hand that’s out of reach,” “a boathouse, alone on a lake,” and “the reason your leaves are withering.” It’s hard not to wince for a split second, but once the initial sting wears off, the underlying emotions are relatable. Much of Joy, Departed occupies an awkward space of figuring whether “love” means being of service or being validated, of wondering whether poetry enhances honesty or obscures it. And yet it’s the fairly standard palm-mute/pedal-stomp dynamics of “Using” where Sorority Noise’s mania is most convincingly expressed. At the outset, Boucher gives into any number of things: pills, drugs, cigarettes, the like. It’s an inventory of self-negation until a group yell of, “I stopped wishing I was dead!""—the excitement of living again (or for once) expressed with redlining distortion, a surge of joy that’s so overwhelming and unfamiliar it still feels like rage. That lyric pops up a second time, during an ankle-breaking pivot to a new key. Boucher claims it’s the first song that he wrote while trying to take ownership of the his battles with addiction and mental illness and turning it into something positive. After a friend recently committed suicide, he told Alternative Press, “Depression is not a trend...Stop glorifying sorrow and start lending a helping hand to those that need it the most.” You can tell it wasn’t the first song he wrote for Joy, Departed and that his revelation didn’t come easily: after “Using”, Joy, Departed concludes on its two most despairing tracks. It results in a perhaps unintentional but honest point about the fleeting nature of all emotions and that when the instinct for self-preservation kicks in, it should be grasped upon like a matter of life and death, because it may be exactly that.","The upstart Connecticut band Sorority Noise’s second LP is motivated by a drive to get over your own bullshit. Their 2014 debut bristled with pop-punk steeped in self-pity, but they've learned to channel their energy in their arrangements, which have become more sophisticated, confident, and well-produced.

Grand Romantic,Nate Ruess,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef45e6ef95969321d19/1:1/w_160/67e7726f.png,2015-06-23 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20717-grand-romantic/,Fueled by Ramen,"Nathaniel Joseph Ruess, age 33, is what we call a rock star in 2015. He has a bleeding heart, a big voice right out of musical theatre, and a pair of #1 singles under his belt. His band, fun., is one of those subversion-free mainstream rock bands—think Imagine Dragons or Mumford and Sons—to become chart staples during Obama’s presidency, which must undoubtedly perturb Kid Rock types prone to caterwauling about how rock stars used to kick ass. (If it helps, Ruess wrote “We Are Young” after getting kicked out of a cab for being too drunk.) Now, after a decade of performing with bands like fun. and the Format, Ruess has recorded a solo album that presents him as both soulful troubadour and arena hero—equal parts Van Morrison and Bruce Springsteen—with mixed returns. Grand Romantic comes with less fanfare than the debut album from fun. guitarist Jack Antonoff, who benefited from generous pre-release hype perhaps owing to his status as one-half of a power couple with “Girls” creator Lena Dunham. Antonoff’s album, recorded as Bleachers, was musically capable, but his voice wouldn’t stick out at a cocktail party. Ruess’s voice is milk and honey, on the other hand, but his song selection is comparably generic. Grand Romantic’s default mode is pro forma stadium rock: booming drums, moments of piano-driven clarity before some string-driven hurrah, perfunctory “la la”s and “na na” harmonies, a key change on a chorus or bridge that lets us know he’s really going for it. The marriage of Ruess’ vocal theatrics to Antonoff’s ear for layered songwriting brings otherwise-mundane sentiments (being young is great; so is going out at night) within reach of transcendence. Apart, they lack definition. Ruess calls himself a grand romantic, but he’s weathered enough heartbreak to be reasonable about what the world holds. “I think that the album is very romantic, but not in some sort of overt buying-flowers-for-someone type of way,” he told MTV. That’s a funny thing to say about an album whose lead single is “Nothing Without Love”—opening line: “I am nothing without love”—but contrary to his stadium rock instincts, Ruess is more convincing with the lights dimmed. The balladry of “Take It Back” is wrapped around a tortured guitar solo played by Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, while Beck pops in for an adult contemporary duet on the country-tinged “What This World Is Coming To”. “Moment” offers a particularly tender vocal performance, with Ruess sounding so dejected about a failed entanglement you want to reach through the speakers and pat him on the head. Much of the album was co-written with Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie, veteran songwriters who’ve won awards working with stars like Kanye West, Lana Del Rey, Beyonce, and Taylor Swift. Ruess doesn’t have such an idiosyncratic personality, either as a pop star or a lyricist. (“Probably my biggest thing is that I just have a tough time sitting down and really committing to writing lyrics,” he tells Rolling Stone.) What he has is unflinching earnestness. He quotes E.E. Cummings like some beret-adorned fop on “AhHa”, and on “Brightside”, is completely unafraid to tell someone, ”I can see the Louvre shining in your eyes.” There’s no ponderous pose or hint of darkness like you’d get from Brandon Flowers or Julian Casablancas. His perspective is unapologetically, blissfully unspecific, a GIF wall of the 28 Reasons Life Is Going To Be Okay. That doesn’t make those lines about the Louvre go down any easier, but it helps you think of him as less a self-styled Great Man, and more a man who thinks the world can be great. “You Light My Fire” is a gloriously schmaltzy pop song replete with percussive xylophone plinks and hand claps—you can see Ruess mugging and snapping his fingers for “The Today Show” crowd. The title obviously recalls the Doors classic, but amusingly enough, Ruess wasn’t familiar with it. (To Rolling Stone: “People have lit a fire before. I'm sure it's not big deal."") Where Jim Morrison moaned about having extremely mysterious sex, Ruess goes complete cornball, bopping to and fro about this girl who revs him up. It’s a little goofy, and absolutely over-the-top, but he sounds natural—a welcoming moment where his antics coalesce around an identifiable personality. It shows how Ruess might succeed on his own as a good-hearted Midwestern boy—not quite a star, but someone capable of appreciating their light.","After a decade of performing with bands like fun. and the Format, Nate Ruess recorded a solo album that presents him as both soulful troubadour and arena hero. He calls himself a grand romantic, but he’s weathered enough heartbreak to be reasonable about what the world holds.

Bones,Son Lux,by: Joel Oliphint,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aecac0084474cd0c1969/1:1/w_160/14ff1a0c.jpg,2015-06-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20687-bones/,Glassnote,"It’s almost misleading to say that Bones is the first full-band Son Lux album. Ryan Lott—the film- and dance-score composer, former ad-music man, and mastermind of Son Lux since the 2008 release of At War with Walls & Mazes—has never been one to go it alone. He’s a constant collaborator, whether it be with Lorde, Boots, Shara Worden of My Brighest Diamond, or teaming up with Sufjan Stevens and rapper Serengeti for Sisyphus. To tour the material from Son Lux’s previous full-length, Lanterns, Lott put together a three-piece band that included guitarist Rafiq Bhatia and drummer Ian Chang, and the trio parlayed their onstage chemistry into recording sessions for Bones. Becoming a real-deal band hasn’t radically changed Son Lux. Lott’s vocals are still unmistakeable in their brittle breathiness, and the songs still come across like the multi-layered electronic manifestations of a classically trained pianist who studied composition in college but can’t suppress his inner beatmaker. But the collaboration with Bhatia and Chang—not to mention vocal contributions from Moses Sumney, DM Stith, Hanna Benn, Holychild’s Liz Nistico, Daughter’s Elena Tonra and others—perceptibly aerates the Son Lux sound. Lott has a tendency to pile his influences in a way that can sometimes feel suffocating, like confetti crammed into a party popper, and on Bones, his bandmates pulled the string while also adding their own crinkled strips of color to the explosion. It’s not unlike the way Dirty Projectors are unmistakably Dave Longstreth’s project, but his talented bandmates are crucial to presenting his vision. It tends to be the words that trip up Lott. He rarely writes traditionally structured songs, and he tends to go the mantra route with the words, to varying degrees of success. On Bones, though, the questions he poses have never been more pertinent. “Are we now what we’ll be? Are we fixed or free?” he asks on “Flight.” Bones is obsessed with exploring whether we can change our station and how or when to sound the alarm. There’s an undercurrent of class warfare and oppression, but Bones is not a protest album. These aren’t Occupy anthems or the soundtrack to protests in Ferguson or Charleston. Lott isn’t railing against a specific tragedy. It’s more general, and it can apply to your issue of choice. Lott merely realizes that it’s time to start railing. Bones soundtracks those moments or days or months or years when it feels like something isn’t right, and it becomes increasingly difficult to keep it all at arm’s length. Even for someone whom Lott calls “the most fortunate one,” it’s hard to stare at injustice, abuse, oppression, or just plain-old apathy and not be stirred to action—or, rather, stirred to thinking about action. Because that’s the emotion this album captures—that moment in between ignorance and action, when you know you should do something, and you just might. “Am I the only one? Where are the others?” Lott sings, then concludes “I am the others.” It feels like things are about to get real. “We have the lungs and we have the air to shout,” he says, “...but we don’t.” It’s a downer, and it gets worse on “White Lies”, which starts soft and pretty despite ominous lyrics (“They take hold of our young/ They cut out our tongue”), then turns into a dark, industrial rave for the last minute. Given Lott’s film-scoring background, it’s easy to imagine the song’s coda soundtracking a scene set in a stroboscopic club from some tyrannical, dystopian future. And yet Son Lux hasn’t given up. “Your Day Will Come” lyrically reprises the opening track: “Close your eyes/ Swallow the sun/ You have only just begun.” Darkness may cover the outside world, but inside, hope is brewing. Son Lux’s avant-pop has always leaned more heavily on avant than pop, and Bones is probably too skittery for a breakout commercial hit (though “Change is Everything” could be a dark horse). Given the album’s staccato beats, bronchitis vocals, strings that may not be strings, flutes that probably aren’t flutes, unexpected blasts of horn-like sounds that couldn’t possibly be horns, it’s not an album you can sing along to from front to back, and given the subject matter, it probably shouldn’t be. Sometimes knowing that you’re about to sing is enough.","To tour Son Lux’s previous full-length, Lanterns, Ryan Lott put together a three-piece band that included guitarist Rafiq Bhatia and drummer Ian Chang. The avant-pop trio parlayed their onstage chemistry into Bones, which also features vocal contributions from Moses Sumney, and others. But becoming a real-deal group hasn’t radically changed the project.

A Lot of Sorrow,The National,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aded9d034d5c69bf4451/1:1/w_160/e0351e3d.jpg,2015-06-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20511-a-lot-of-sorrow/,4AD,"That the National were going to spend six hours repeatedly performing the same song in an art gallery was one thing. A collaboration with Icelandic performance artist Ragnar Kjartansson, A Lot of Sorrow wasn’t intended as a physical endurance test, but a study in the evolving emotional tenor of a work stretched to its limits: National frontman Matt Berninger described its aim as “reaching a different sort of euphoric, mantra-like state.” Releasing the entire performance in a box set composed of nine clear LPs, however, strips away the sad communion of the original Sunday afternoon show, leaving just the listener and approximately 105 iterations of “Sorrow”, spanning six hours, five minutes. “Sorrow” is the second track on the National’s fifth album, 2010’s High Violet, and one of the few moments of joy on that fraught, scared record. “[It’s] about a person’s love affair with his own sadness,” Berninger has said. “Sadness is not always the worst feeling. Sometimes it’s a really pleasurable thing to be overwhelmed with sadness.” It works beautifully: High Violet marked the point when Berninger started reaching for livelier vocal harmonies, but his helpless, heavy monotone on “Sorrow” is the perfect forlorn center, caught between resisting sanctuary while craving its embrace. The band anchor him there: Bryan Devendorf’s drums are a subtle hiss with a ‘60s girl group dimple, while guitarists Aaron and Bryce Dessner, and bassist Scott Devendorf modulate between three richly thrumming chords. The luxurious purgatory that Berninger sings about in “Sorrow” is a crucial part of the National’s appeal, which A Lot of Sorrow tests. Every fan wants to believe that they have a special relationship with their favorite band—that they can access something within their work that others could never see—so choosing to engage fully with this kind of project is predicated on the hope that it would induce some kind of transcendent state. (Or, masochism.) But it is a lot—even for a card-carrying National devotee who’s seen them play 25 times in six years, who can’t make it through Alligator without listening to “Baby, We’ll Be Fine” a dozen times straight, or High Violet without lingering on “Lemonworld” for half an hour. I enjoyed an hour of it through headphones on the way home to the suburbs, half-drunk after a Sharon Van Etten show (a very National way to listen to the National), and did the remaining five hours in one go, partially while laying prone on the floor, and soon felt in need of a cold shower. But A Lot of Sorrow clearly isn’t intended as a consumer item to be placed on your turntable in solemn, linear fashion, which justifies asking what it is for, divorced from its live, physical origins. This release exemplifies pretty much everything that the National’s detractors hate about them, which is rarely just their indulgently sad music. The Ohio-born five-piece are the best dressed straw men in the business, making people bristle at the idea of identifying with the ascendant, middle-class Brooklynite angst of their records. At any rate, it’s a social strata you’d probably have to occupy to afford a copy: sets cost $198 + a hefty postage charge (with all profits benefitting Partners In Health). A week prior to release, the 1500-edition run hadn't sold out yet. There’s nothing quite as serious as a dead-weight of clear vinyl, yet the existence of A Lot Of Sorrow feels like a cosmic joke, both at the expense of the band’s self-seriousness (an image they’ve been trying to shed with their recent videos and the Mistaken For Strangers documentary), and of those who would accuse them of having made an entire career out of playing the same song over and over. If it weren’t for A Lot Of Sorrow's artistic origins, you could almost interpret it as elegantly weaponized monotony, like Mark Kozelek’s prolific prosaicness, and Aphex Twin apparently dumping his entire hard drive on Soundcloud after releasing his first album in 13 years. You want blood? We got it. But much as it’s exhausting and unrealistic to absorb in one go, as much a millstone as a symbolic objet d’art, A Lot of Sorrow rewards patience in the most literal fashion. (Another inadvertent joke at the perception that everything the National make is “a grower”…) “I don’t wanna get over you”, Berninger sings in a faint plea every time, an Old Testament pop trope that works as an act of self-preservation and insurance against the responsibility of being the one who has to change. It’s a voluntary slow-death sentence, which he bears stoically throughout the six hours: joking, singing with a mouth full of sandwich halfway through Side O (Kjartansson brought them food and drinks throughout), and saying they’ll have to start over after he coughs during a chorus. It’s only at the end of Side Q, around the 95th take, that Berninger breaks down. He gasps halfway through “sorrow’s a girl inside my cake” before missing a line and crying, having lost his nerve because he couldn’t see his wife and daughter in the crowd. His live performances are frequently marked by a frightening volatility, and he often openly declares that he needs someone in song, but he’s rarely vulnerable like this. Guitarists Aaron and Bryce Dessner and the band's backing musicians take the lead on vocals (and the crowd joins in), and Bryan Devendorf intuits that he should sit this one out. Throughout, the unspoken conversation between the band is mesmeric: early on they play more muted versions, like steady long-distance runners. They never break between songs—there’s always that hissing drumbeat or a steady guitar line to guide the transition—and the Dessners constantly experiment with different textures. Sometimes the guitar parts swing like slack machinery; later they tremble with the seismic presence of a Richard Serra sculpture, shriek like birds, and swell drunkenly. I didn’t see the original performance, and had wondered if it might mirror William Basinski’s Disintegration Loops, fading as energy and morale grew dim, but the ceaseless invention here keeps the song alive. We’re often curious about how a band—and particularly the singer—can remain engaged with the circumstances that originally informed their music night after night. Not that it’s the most apt reference, but perhaps it’s worth remembering the part of Katy Perry’s Part of Me documentary where she emerges beaming on stage seconds after crying over the breakdown of her marriage. After over 100 renditions of “Sorrow”, the National still sound close to its emotional heart, rather than inured to it. No naysayer will be converted by this completely absurd artifact, but it’s a moving manifestation of the relationship that fans have with any band that means anything to them, playing their songs over and over to tempt the point where the magic fades away. A Lot of Sorrow is a strange achievement and vindication. Stay down, champions, stay down.","A Lot of Sorrow, the National's collaboration with the Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson, found the band playing their song ""Sorrow"" repeatedly for six hours at MoMA PS1. They've now released the entire performance as a box set composed of nine clear LPs featuring approximately 105 iterations of the song.

asdfasdf,Katie Dey,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aec8b1335d7bf1699e30/1:1/w_160/fa9ef4da.jpg,2015-06-22 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20685-katie-dey-asdfasdf/,Orchid Tapes,"Like regions, genres have accents. There are pop-punk yelps, post-punk groans, dream-pop whispers, and the clean, enunciated croons of mainstream stars. Katie Dey's first album asdfasdf positions her as an alien to vocal geography. The Melbourne-based artist is a singer as well as a songwriter, but in each of her songs, she completely corrodes her voice. While many home recordings paint the image of the artist singing real words into a real microphone attached to a real tape recorder, asdfasdf refuses to ground itself. It is hard to imagine these seven songs coming from a physical space; chaotic and gritty, they prioritize energy and motion, making audio fidelity feel like an obsolete concern. Of Dey's peers on the Orchid Tapes label, she finds the closest kinship with Alex G, another purveyor of demented indie pop who makes resourceful use of pitch-shifting and bizarre instrumental choices. But women's voices in music are especially policed for annoyingness, and Dey pushes that quality to an extreme edge. The first you hear of her on ""don't be scared"" is a high-pitched croak processed beyond recognition among clean acoustic guitar riffs and unsteady drum beats. She later programs a synthesizer to mimic her vocal tone; aside from the vague definition around her words, the line between human and machine feels smeared and unstable, as if Dey were as present in all of her instruments as she is in her own voice. asdfasdf's most defined and energetic song comes in the form of ""unkillable"", a minute and 20 seconds of buoyant melodies that constantly threaten to veer off course. Dey's lyrics shine through clearest here, with phrases like ""teen poetry"" and ""sucks the blood from my feet"" flashing through in strange, disembodied glimpses. The song is catchy, which makes it all the stranger. Most hooks go down smooth by design, but Dey's nightmare pop forces you to swallow something decomposing and sharp. The name of the song suggests its own inversion—not ""unlikable"", as it may read on first glance, but immortal, unstoppable, powerful. Dey is hardly the first songwriter to use broken rules as weapons, but she takes palpable pleasure in the conventions she upends. Voices, especially women's, are expected to be pretty and easy to grasp, especially in quieter, gentler music. Dey amplifies her rough edges, splitting the space inside her tape machine and chasing herself down its fragments. asdfasdf sustains a level of textural complexity that most musicians won't attempt, and its clever melodic core supports the layers of abrasions. A warm playfulness radiates from deep inside Dey's music. Its inscrutability makes it all the more rewarding to wade through over and over again.","Of Katie Dey's peers on the Orchid Tapes label, she finds the closest kinship with Alex G, another purveyor of demented indie pop who makes resourceful use of pitch-shifting and bizarre instrumental choices.

Tomorrow Will Be Beautiful,Flo Morrissey,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aebfc0084474cd0c1956/1:1/w_160/5a104e65.jpg,2015-06-22 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20678-tomorrow-will-be-beautiful/,Glassnote,"If you're after a quick way to feel ancient, just think about how 20-year-old Londoner Flo Morrissey discovered the likes of Joanna Newsom, CocoRosie, and Devendra Banhart in her dad's car when she was nine or 10 years old. Recently reissued documentary The Family Jams chronicles the innocent days of freak folk, the painfully amateur footage mirroring a shambolic summer tour spent rejoicing in the hands. A decade on, a pristine redux of the collective's influence manifests in Morrissey's debut, aided by the production of scene original Noah Georgeson. Complementing Morrissey's piercing melismatics are softly thumbed acoustic guitars, very familiar harp motifs, and cosmic accents, along with a plush string section and period wardrobe. Although Morrissey reaches back a decade and way beyond, to the likes of Karen Dalton, Nick Drake, and Vashti Bunyan, Tomorrow Will Be Beautiful feels like an accurate representation of right now. She's part of a raft of privileged British musicians who can afford to be earnest and wide-eyed about the world, but it's something she does better than most of them. It's strange to see a generation wholeheartedly embrace their parents' tastes during a period of socio-political turmoil, and there's no grit in Morrissey's Vaseline lens. Her voice is incredibly pure and agile: she's a drowsy Kate Bush, or Jessica Pratt's choirgirl little sister. But every song drowns in over-arrangements, perhaps in an attempt to mask a fairly persistent lack of melody. The exceptions are lovely. The verse of ""Pages of Gold"" floats on clouds of warped electric guitar, before a robust, skyward chorus that would have amply fit First Aid Kit's last record. Similarly weightless is ""If You Can't Love This All Goes Away"", which features Morrissey's most understated and affecting vocal performance. Morrissey's lyrics avoid hippie affect for plainspoken admission, telling a timeless coming-of-age story across 10 songs. The glinting ""Show Me"", written when she was 15, crystallizes the moment where childhood starts receding into the past. (""I've begun to see my life/ It's so different once it's been shone in its new light."") She forgives and gently warns a friend who's now seeing her manipulative ex on ""Sleeplessly Dreaming"", which has a little French chanson in its gait. By the end of Tomorrow Will Be Beautiful, she's reveling in the budding promise of pleasure in self-knowledge. ""This joy I'm now feeling is much more real/ I'll begin again as a seedling, running far to the fields"", she sings on the flinching ""Wildflower"" amid starry harp. Morrissey has often talked about exaggerating her feelings in song to make up for her youthful lack of experience, but within the lavish Tomorrow Will Be Beautiful is a songwriter whose knack for subtle self-assertion needs bringing to the fore, not dressing up in quirk.","Flo Morrissey's earnest, pastoral debut channels the freak folk of Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom, and CocoRosie.

Hunch Music,Hunee,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae9413d197565213a121/1:1/w_160/60489f9a.jpg,2015-06-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20646-hunch-music/,Rush Hour,"Hunee, aka Hun Choi, has been working his way towards his debut LP for a while now. He kicked off his recording career in 2009 with the Tour de Force EP for Willie Burns' W.T. Records, and a slim handful of releases and compilation tracks on labels like Prins Thomas' Internasjonal, the Berghain-related Ostgut Ton, and Amsterdam's Rush Hour followed. But long before Choi began recording, he was laying the groundwork for a life in music, honing his skills as a DJ and working behind the counter at a Berlin record store specializing in funk and soul. In the past few years, Choi has developed a reputation as an exceptionally talented DJ with uncommonly deep crates, open ears, and nimble fingers; he's the rare DJ not only willing to venture from disco to house to techno and back again, all in a single set, but with the skills to do so convincingly. Until now, Choi's productions have largely reflected his fondness for vintage house and techno, but his debut album goes much further. While it draws from dance music, it's not defined by its norms. It's not a flashily or self-consciously experimental record, but the vision it showcases is unique. In its own, understated way, it represents an attempt to make music that doesn't so much conform to formal templates as it does reinforce dance music's implicit promise of freedom. A sense of mysticism permeates the album. The opening ""Woods"" plays out like a kind of creation myth: Out of a misty swirl of synths and rainforest percussion, a reed-like melody materializes, and a pitch-bent synthesizer solo hides the suggestion of a human voice in its folds. The handclaps are less a matter of timekeeping than of ritual. It feels like a kind of invocation, and he returns to that idea throughout the record. The tempestuous, broken-beat miniature ""Burning Flower"" pairs smeared-on synths with an extended strip of opera—not synchronized or even harmonized, just threaded through the background, as though a neighbor had thrown on Aida and left the window open. Meanwhile, ""The World"" drapes a beaded curtain of percussion over an extended Sun Ra sample, yielding a heady variation on cosmic jazz. Hunee's dancefloor cuts are no less transcendent. ""Error of the Average"" is dark, roiled techno-jazz in the vein of Carl Craig or Levon Vincent, and the more laid-back ""Silent Sensations"" is a Janus-faced late-night jam, half toe-scuffing drums and bass, half aquamarine chords. ""Hiding the Moon"" begins as though under the influence of Berghain, just kick drum and clatter; gradually, though, tinny bell tones take us into gamelan-via-Terry-Riley territory. But Hunee doesn't do minimalism, and soon he adds Rhodes chords, wildly processed trumpets, and a bassline that sounds like a succession of slamming doors. Sampled birdsong serves as the cherry on the 11-layer cake. For precedents, you could look to the aforementioned Carl Craig and Levon Vincent as well as producers like Pépé Bradock, DJ Koze, and Sherard Ingram's Urban Tribe. Like Bradock and Koze, Choi is both sentimental and a little squirrelly; like Ingram, he's a master of sounds that are gruff and tender in equal measure. ""Rare Happiness"", the album's breeziest cut, recalls both Blaze's ""Lovelee Dae"" and Recloose's sweetly soulful productions. But by the end of the expertly paced album, he steps away from the dancefloor entirely. The beatless ""Bruises"" pairs mournful string loops with pitched-down vocal samples, and ""Amo (Admiration)"" creates a hypnotic miniature out of trumpets and delay. The cello in ""Bruises"" faintly suggests the influence of Arthur Russell, but ultimately, neither track sounds like anyone else at all. From his individual sounds and rhythms all the way up to his daring, freewheeling arrangements, Hunee's vision of techno feels unusually alive—not just enchanting but actually enchanted. It's as though that initial act of invocation had summoned real spirits; the air vibrates with their presence.","Hunee has developed a reputation as an exceptionally talented DJ with uncommonly deep crates, open ears, and nimble fingers; he's the rare DJ not only willing to venture from disco to house to techno and back again, all in a single set, but with the skills to do so convincingly.

Gazebo Effect,"S. Araw ""Trio"" XI",by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af1bea9e61561daa63be/1:1/w_160/e8d15370.jpg,2015-06-22 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20748-gazebo-effect/,Drag City,"Sometimes listening to S. Araw's Gazebo Effect feels like a beetle has crawled in your ear canal. Other times, it feels like you have water in there you can’t shake loose. Most times, it seems to render the ground beneath your feet a little less reliable. If you have spent time listening to records by the experimental psych outfit Sun Araw, the longtime creative project of Cameron Stallones, then these sensations will be comfortingly familiar. Stallones has chewed a termite’s path through the world, depositing a series of albums that, taken together, make a compelling argument for the virtue of prolonged disorientation. In the past several years, Stallones has sought company to round out his music, which has resulted in projects like the FRKWYS collaboration with M. Geddes Gengras and the Congos' Icon Give Thank, as well as projects he’s given other names to, like Duppy Gun and Celebrate Music Synthesizer Group to set them apart. On Belomancie, he waved away collaborators like so much smoke from his eyes, bearing down on the most primordial elements of his often-already-pretty-primordial music. Gazebo Effect, like its predecessor Belomancie, is an album of experimental psych that unfolds in increments, like you’re listening to the very first cell divisions of something that will eventually emerge into a coherent piece of music. It was recorded collaboratively, and live, by a new configuration of the Sun Araw Band, this time given the slightly tweaked name S. Araw ""Trio"" XI. The other players are Alex Gray (who is credited with ""Computer Synthesis"" and ""Bamboo Saxophone"") and Mitchell Brown (who handles ""1/4"" Magnetic Tape, Yamaha CP35, Roland System 100 Synthesizer). The energy they generate is not too far from Belomancie, in that it feels like a place for your ear to wander without a real purpose in mind. This is unclean, septic-feeling music, and you can feel the hands and oils that have covered it and worked it into its current shape. ""Upper Lawns"" fills the space in your headphones with a synth tone that buckles out of pitch so wildly it’s cartoonish. In ""Processional"", a thin high whine flits around some glowing, jazz-inflected synthesizer chords, like a bug orbiting a flickering light. Nothing feels like it moves forward, exactly, more like you’re watching a few elements move in hard-to-predict, lazy circles. The long piece ""Trellis"" has several sections like this, all in its later portions, where a guitar line will ping so uncontrollably that it will zigzag over the one of two clear visible lines you thought your mind’s eye had established in it. There is something funny about the fact that two tracks here are titled ""Thesis"" and ""Rebuttal"". For one, the piece called ""Thesis"" is 21 bleary minutes, while the ""Rebuttal"" is two minutes of relatively sharp-edged keyboards. It’s impossible to guess at either the thesis being proposed, or the nature of its rebuttal. But it’s clear from observing Stallones’ output over the years that he works with a target on the horizon. It might seem deceptively serene from the outside, but his music has expanded to vista and then shrunk to pinprick, from album to album, while remaining as steady as lamp glow. We are the ones staring, hypnotized, at the magic he conjures.","Gazebo Effect, like its predecessor Belomancie, is an album of experimental psych that unfolds in increments, like you’re listening to the very first cell divisions of something that will eventually emerge into a coherent piece of music.

Payola,Desaparecidos,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aef813d197565213a1d5/1:1/w_160/56b9ba23.jpg,2015-06-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20720-payola/,Epitaph,"It's been 13 years since Desaparecidos' previous album and in the time since, Conor Oberst's political conscience has seemed to age in reverse. Payola simplifies colossal, complex systemic issues into an ""us vs. them"" cage match and the Royal We are up against mostly strawmen and supervillains. This would be an issue if Oberst was using lines like, ""Now we're taking it back for the greater good/ Goddamn Robin Hoods"" and ""Freedom is not free/ Neither is apathy"" as a means of convincing listeners to vote in a primary election, draft a persuasive letter to their local representative, or go to law school. But Payola advocates chaining yourself to an ATM, taking a baseball bat to a limousine, and shouting every word at the nearest authority figure. And this makes Conor Oberst a writer of awesome punk rock lyrics. It would appear that Payola is where Oberst's been storing the splenetic rage that fueled his most compelling work and has mostly gone missing since I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning. But while Payola is his most urgent and angry work in a decade, it's by far his most fun record. Because really, it's his only fun record. This is the result of an important shift in a classic punk rock binary. On Read Music/Speak Spanish, Desaparecidos saw themselves in the lineage of the Clash—a fair accusation as Oberst was months away from dropping his Omaha Calling magnum opus Lifted and Desaparecidos would later cover ""Spanish Bombs"". Their songs were topical, idealistic and had no sense of humor whatsoever. Often singing in the same whole-body quaver as he did in Bright Eyes, Oberst led you to believe these songs saw themselves as the actual solution to the suffocating, transactional nature of marriage, a spiritually broken American military, and the overabundance of Starbucks in Omaha. Payola is a discovery of their inner Sex Pistols: more cynical, more in character, taking advantage of no-win, no-future situations to create potent, punk rock theater. Up against institutions too big to fail but also too big to defend themselves, Desaparecidos provide heavy ammo for cathartic finger-pointing and maximum collateral damage. Though Oberst is largely responsible for Desaparecidos' profile, this is not his side project—this is a full-on band and one that has grown increasingly tight and versatile despite only intermittently existing in the 21st century. Infamously recorded in a week of chaotic sessions, Read Music/Speak Spanish played out like a demolition derby, riffs, corroded shouts, and clamorous drums careening into each other. Payola is fast and furious, but carefully engineered for maximum, straight-ahead velocity. Despite the professed influence of the Cro-Mags and T.S.O.L., Desaparecidos are not a convincing hardcore act. Most of their arsenal draws from pop music, New Wave or even metal—Oberst's major-key, happily resolving melodies would've fit into his folk songs while Denver Dalley gilds the edges with tapping solos and ingratiating call-and-response riffs with keyboardist Ian McElroy. Regardless of its throwback sonic inspiration, Payola sounds far more contemporary than Read Music. So So Glos appear on ""Slacktivist"" and provide context for the harmonized guitars and beer-muscled pop-punk. Meanwhile, Against Me! has always balanced their most affecting, crucial work with potent sloganeering, so Laura Jane Grace is a perfect accomplice to piss on the Wall Street frat houses during ""Golden Parachutes"". It's hard to say whether Desaparecidos have truly influenced similarly minded, popular punk acts who have emerged in their absence or vice versa, but it lends Payola a current vibrancy that Read Music avoided—Patrick Stickles has been saddled with Bright Eyes comparisons from the get-go, and now that he's making compact rages against the machine like ""Dimed Out"", he's a real-time competitor with Conor Oberst's band. Meanwhile, ""Te Amo Camila Vallejo"" imagines if Joe Strummer had the foresight to write a Japandroids song, a pound-the-steering wheel anthem about going to the ends of the Earth for a charismatic, beautiful woman. In this case, it just so happens to be the ""World's Most Glamorous Revolutionary"", a Communist leader of Chile's 2011 student uprisings and now an elected member of congress. But as with Strummer or any political writer who tries to give voice to people outside of his own demographic, Oberst could be accused of being out of his depth (not to mention the question of whether their name brings light to a terrible situation overseas or is being utilized for its cachet). It would take a very willful misreading to accuse Desaparecidos of misappropriation—""Radicalized"" split screens a potential Islamic extremist and an American mourning his fallen brother in a double wide trailer, and it's not attempting the depth of Steve Earle's ""John Walker's Blues""or even the bite of Desaparecidos' own ""The Happiest Place on Earth"". This juxtaposition is built upon by the thematically linked ""10 Steps Behind"", presumably inspired by a religious tradition of requiring wives to trail their husbands. The imagery in ""10 Steps Behind"" remains intentionally vague—is the subject from the Middle East or Middle America? Do both cultures see women as property in their own way? As with ""Radicalized"", the seething anger underlying ""10 Steps Behind"" is better conveyed through the blistering music and Oberst knows when to get out of the way. And mostly, chucking any pretense of nuance works in Payola's favor. When discussing the policies of celebrity racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio, or the beneficiaries of the Wall Street bailout, or a cancer patient whose life is going to be determined by paperwork, these songs seem to ask, do you really need to hear both sides? Whether or not Payola was ""worth the wait"" is a moot point—not much about Read Music/Speak Spanish suggested a follow-up was ever going to happen at all, so who was waiting really? But Payola's weaker points are entirely due to its latency period: by the time ""City on the Hill"" had debuted, exactly half of this record had been publicly available. Every song here is effective and memorable, just some less so than others, and most of them are packed towards the end, repeating earlier ideas (""Von Maur Massacre"", ""Anonymous""). And a topical record that's been cobbled together over the span of five years is going to sound dated in a 24-hour news cycle. It's not just the references to Occupy or the NSA's Fairview surveillance system or flashmobs, though those tend to jut out like 2012 RT's on your timeline. There's an Auto-Tune joke buried in ""Backsell"", but also a warning from former big league washout Britt Daniel, whose A&R-ripping ""The Agony of Laffitte"" single made him and Oberst short-lived labelmates on Saddle Creek. Since the release of ""Backsell"" in 2012, however, Spoon has signed to a major label started by a former Warner Bros. executive. Then again, Read Music/Speak Spanish was written and recorded shortly after 9/11 and while it captured the spirit of its time, it actually proved to be prophetic—though criticized for its maladroit lyrics at the time, it (however clumsily) pledged feminist allegiance, fretted over the overinflated housing bubble and a war with no end in sight. The outlier was ""Mañana"", a desperate rallying cry where Oberst hoped against hope that humanity could create a new future rather than an increasingly shittier version of the past. They played it at their first reunion show in 2010, a benefit to oppose a Fremont, Neb. renter's ordinance that blatantly targeted the influx of Latinos into the town by requiring an oath of legal citizenry. The U.S Supreme Court declined intervention and a headline detailing its current status perfectly sums up Payola's reason for existence: ""furor persists.""","On Read Music/Speak Spanish, Desaparecidos saw themselves in the lineage of the Clash. 13 years later on Payola, they find their inner Sex Pistols: more cynical, more in character, taking advantage of no-win, no-future situations to create potent, punk rock theater. It is by far Conor Oberst's most fun record. Because really, it's his only fun record.

Don't Weigh Down the Light,Meg Baird,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae825e6ef95969321c6a/1:1/w_160/b44baf91.jpg,2015-06-19 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20632-dont-weigh-down-the-light/,Drag CityWichita,"Meg Baird's career has seldom lacked for action or variety; she co-founded the highly esteemed Philly psych-folk group Espers, has performed with her sister Laura as the Baird Sisters, played drums with noisy punk combo Watery Love, and sung alongside the likes of Kurt Vile, Will Oldham, and Sharon Van Etten. If she so chose, she surely has the skills and connections to make an expansive, cross-genre album studded with guest appearances, but she hasn't seemed interested in that. She has always kept her solo albums streamlined and direct, focusing her songs almost exclusively on her finger-picked guitar and radiant voice. Likewise, her thematic approach has never been panoramic; instead her albums tend to feel like private journals, wherein a particular mood is set and then sustained and refined. The same holds true, with a few subtle but important variations, for Baird's third solo album, Don't Weigh Down the Light. Her past albums have featured several interpretations of traditional folk standards and well-wrought covers of such obscurities as House of Love's ""Beatles and the Stones"". In fact her style is so steeped in British and Appalachian folk forms that at times even her original songs have sounded as if they had been written in a previous century. On Don't Weigh Down the Light, however, all of the tracks are Baird originals, and are less reliant on traditional folk idioms. Where her previous album, 2011's Seasons on Earth, was ornamented with pedal steel and other subtle country touches, Baird is here joined throughout by Charlie Saufley, formerly of SF acid rock heavyweights the Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound. On several tracks here the duo of Baird and Saufley masquerade as a full band, with each playing multiple instruments and filling the songs' ample open spaces with gentle ripples of organ, 12-string guitar, and percussion. As a result Don't Weigh Down the Light is the closest Baird has come in her solo work to reclaiming the cosmic turf once occupied by Espers. In the time since the release of Seasons on Earth, Baird moved from her longtime base of Philadelphia to San Francisco, and it doesn't feel too outlandish to suggest that Baird's move has had a substantial influence on Don't Weigh Down the Light. There is a general feel of transition and displacement permeating such tracks as ""Past Houses"" or ""Even the Walls Don't Want You to Go"". Midway through the album is a short track simply entitled ""Leaving Song"", featuring nothing but Baird's multi-tracked vocals, wordlessly cascading down in a manner that can sound alternately melancholic or prayer-like, depending on the listener's current frame of mind. Brief though the track is, its placement seems noteworthy, almost as though it is the hinge upon which the rest of the album is meant to pivot. Curiously, the vocal melody of ""Leaving Song"" returns a few songs later as a background track on ""Even the Walls Don't Want You to Go"". This echoing, especially when coupled with the following reprise of the song ""Past Houses"", gives the album a circular feel, as though Baird's songs are doubling back upon themselves in a continuous loop of departures and arrivals. Baird's voice sounds as potent and icy-clear as ever. As evidenced by her work with Espers and the Baird Sisters, her voice is well-suited to close-harmony singing, and here she makes frequent use of vocal multi-tracking, adding whispery harmonies at what sounds like the upper limits of her register. In combination with the casual jammy vibe on some of the instrumental passages, these airy harmonies recall some of the folkier aspects of Popol Vuh. In recent months Baird and Saufley have joined forces with Comets on Fire's Ethan Miller to form the West Coast psych outfit Heron Oblivion, and if their work together on Don't Weigh Down the Light is any indication, that might herald even further fruitful departures.","Meg Baird's third album is the closest she has come in her solo work to reclaiming the cosmic turf once occupied by her former group, Espers. Charlie Saufley, formerly of San Francisco acid rock heavyweights the Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound, joins her throughout.

Victoria OST,Nils Frahm,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeb79d034d5c69bf45c7/1:1/w_160/67a2570a.jpg,2015-06-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20671-victoria-ost/,Erased Tapes,"Victoria is a German movie, filmed in one long shot. It observes the night of a young couple who meet, flirt, and stumble their way improbably into a violent heist. In the film's charged, uncertain atmosphere, the glow of anticipation from meeting someone new and the tingle of dread right before something awful happens both occur along one unbroken continuum: When life gets better, it is also one hair’s breadth away from getting worse. The German producer Nils Frahm composed the film's score, and if you listened to it and tried to imagine the film he was working on, you'd probably arrive at a very different movie—something sweet-toned and modest, slightly grave, and above all, muted. Maybe a family drama where none of the members can quite muster the strength to say exactly what they're feeling. It is a mood that will feel familiar to anyone who has spent time with Frahm's solo piano albums, the most recent of which (Solo) he released for free just in April. The Victoria OST marshals more instruments than his solo piano works, but not many more—each new sound, whether it's a husky-throated cello on ""Our Own Roof"" or the subcutaneous hum of organ keys on ""The Bank"", tiptoes in carefully and gingerly. Frahm’s score works along Brian Eno's fabled ignorable/interesting divide: You can soak in the long, receding tones like you would sit in the sun beneath a big window, or you can fixate on surgically tiny details, like the way you can nearly hear the felt of the piano hammers being brushed into individual fibers on ""A Stolen Car"", or the rustle of whatever foreign objects he’s placed on the strings to make them generate extra noises. Frahm strikes little ""off"" notes in the interstices of that piece's simple major chords, so that when they ring, they don’t ring ""clean""—there is a tendril of sour air in them, seemingly acknowledging the turmoil that plays out on the screen. Moments like this in Frahm’s score are furtive and quiet: There is a foreboding drone piece called ""In the Parking Garage"", full of room tone and tiny, human-sounding scrapes, that hits your ear the way a parking garage's sodium lighting assaults your eye. And the album opens with a DJ Koze edit called ""Burn With Me"", in which a dry techno thump meets a dull knock and some nauseated synths. Frahm’s aesthetic shares something in common with Koze, whose touch suggests someone who would prefer to cover all exposed hard edges with blankets so no one gets hurt. Frahm's awareness seems repeatedly drawn to glowing spaces where notes ring out after they've been struck. These spaces mimic the way a memorable event lingers in our minds, acquiring new shades of meaning and slowly receding into the morass of our lived experience. In echo-rich, contemplative music like this, the event itself doesn’t matter nearly as much as its aftereffects, the way it changes over time and the way it changes you.","The busy German producer Nils Frahm returns with a film score. Though he uses additional instruments and sound effects, the album conjures a mood that will feel familiar to anyone who has spent time with Frahm's solo piano albums.

Sticky Fingers,The Rolling Stones,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adcab1335d7bf1699c75/1:1/w_160/1ed0b3bd.jpg,2015-06-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20483-sticky-fingers/,Rolling StonesRolling Stones,"The story of the Baby Boomers, and their movement from adolescence to adulthood, has been documented and re-told endlessly. And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in jackets and ties and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway. That post-Altamont moment was the setting for their 1971 album Sticky Fingers, an album reissued many times that was recently released in its most extensive re-packaging yet. From 1968's Beggars Banquet and the following year's Let It Bleed on through this album and 1972's Exile on Main St., the Rolling Stones had one of the great four-album runs in pop music history. This was a time when—on record, at least—they could do no wrong, and Sticky Fingers could reasonably be called their peak. Beggars and Let It Bleed might have had higher highs, but both also had their share of tossed-off tracks; Exile's tossed-off tracks, on the other hand, were pretty much the whole point—it's the underground music's fan's favorite, but it never had the broader cultural impact of its predecessor. Sticky Fingers is where the myth met the songwriting; Keith Richards' riffs and melodies were in full flower, Mick Jagger never sang better, their new guitarist, Mick Taylor, was upping the ante musically, and the whole thing was wrapped up in a brilliant packaging concept by Andy Warhol. ""Brown Sugar"" launches the record with its quintessential blues-rock riff and lyrics that get more questionable the closer you listen (Jagger has since said it was a bit of a wind-up, ""all the nasty subjects in one go""). But words were secondary for the band at this point—Sticky Fingers is about melody, and playing, and style. The Stones were always fascinated with American music, but after the death of Brian Jones in 1969 and their move away from psychedelia, their connection to blues, R&B, and country music grew even more intense. From the loping country-folk of ""Wild Horses"" and the tongue-in-cheek honky tonk of ""Dead Flowers"" to a Mississippi Fred McDowell cover (""You Gotta Move"") to the swelling Otis Redding-style R&B of ""I Got the Blues"" to the crunchy boogie of ""Bitch"" to the Latin-flavored Santana jams of ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"", Sticky Fingers is a love letter to these forms, the culmination of obsessions these musicians had had since childhood. But where they once sounded like English boys doing their version of the blues, now their songs felt as lived-in as their inspirations. By this point, the Stones were so convincing playing rootsy American music it made little sense to compare them to their British peers. Musically at least, the Rolling Stones of 1971 had more in common with the Allman Brothers than they did the Who. Along with the barrelhouse piano, pedal steel, and Stax-like horns, Sticky Fingers was also only the second album to feature the guitar work of Mick Taylor, and his clean, fluid, and highly melodic leads bear a strong resemblance to Duane Allman's playing from this period. But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way Exile is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art. Jagger's voice never sounded richer or fuller than it does here (Exile mostly buried it, to artful effect), but he's doing strange things with it, mimicking and exaggerating accents, mostly from the American South, with an almost religious fervor. When the Stones were coming up, the line on British singers is that they sounded American because they grew up listening to those records; on Sticky Fingers, Jagger pushes that kind of mimicry to places that run just short of absurd. His twang on ""Dead Flowers"" is obviously played for laughs, but ""You Gotta Move"" is harder to get a bead on, partway between homage and parody and delivered with abandon. ""I Got the Blues"" is utterly sincere, with Jagger flinging every ounce of his skinny frame into it. Wherever he stands in relation to the material, Jagger is selling it, hard, and by extension selling himself as a new kind of vocalist. ""Sister Morphine"" and ""Moonlight Mile"" are the two songs that stray furthest from American music reverence, and they are highlights, showing how well the Stones could convey weariness and a weird kind of blown-out and wasted beauty. With reissue culture in overdrive, we're seeing which classic bands kept the most in their vaults. The Stones, like Zeppelin, didn't keep much. The 2010 version of Exile on Main St. pretty much cleaned out the vault as far as music from this era, so what we have here are alternate mixes, an inferior but still interesting different take of ""Brown Sugar"" with Eric Clapton, the one true rarity that has long circulated but never been officially issued. There's also, depending on which version you get, a good deal of vintage live Stones, which is the main thing to get their fans excited. Selections from two 1971 gigs, both recorded well, capture the band in a peak year. To my ears the Stones' live prowess has never quite translated to recordings. The best live records are about more: more heaviness, more jamming, more crowd noise, more energy. And their music didn't necessarily benefit from increasing any one of those things. Their songs were about a certain amount of balance between all of the elements, which is why their recordings sound so platonically perfect. With their live records, you can focus on the grooves and the riffs and the collective playing, but it's easier to notice moments of sloppiness and mistakes. Still, as far as live Stones on record, the material here is about as good as you will get. The Stones entered the '70s still young and beautiful, but they'd have their share of problems just like everyone else; they got into disco and then in the '80s they dressed like they were on ""Miami Vice"" and then finally they fully understood what nostalgia for them was really worth and they discovered the power of corporate synergy. Given the weight of history behind it and its centrality to the story of both the Rolling Stones and rock music as a whole, it can be difficult to put on Sticky Fingers and try and hear it for what it was: the highly anticipated new album from one of the biggest bands in the world, a group that at the time hadn't released a new one in two years (in 1971, that was an eternity). They were called the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band for entirely too long, but if that designation ever applied it was here.","Sticky Fingers came at a time when—on record, at least—the Rolling Stones could do no wrong.

Meridian,Evan Caminiti,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aed813d197565213a1a2/1:1/w_160/a6f3aa7d.jpg,2015-06-18 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20698-meridian/,Thrill Jockey,"For years, Evan Caminiti has made guitar drone in the duo Barn Owl with Jon Porras; as they've gone along, they've folded more electronics into their heavy soundscapes. He also performs alone: on his last solo ventures—2012's Dreamless Sleep and Night Dust—he used guitars, but ones that were so heavily processed and reconfigured that it wasn't obvious what they were on first or subsequent listens. In a recent interview with Fact he commented on this increased tweaking of the instrument: ""I got to a point where I was running it through so many effects pedals that it was basically not even a guitar anymore."" Which leads us to Caminiti's fifth solo album, Meridian, which he composed and performed on modular synthesizer, working in subtle beats, bass tones, hushed noise, and blackened field recordings (you'll have a hard time picking out the field recordings, though, unless we're to assume they were all recorded in a cave in Hell). It's a tight 41 minutes, each of the nine songs featuring a one-word title that evokes the shape or overall texture of a piece (""Arc"", ""Steam""), the dark eeriness of the album as a whole (""Overtaken"", ""Curtains""), or the song's ostensible emotional state (""Collapse""). Caminiti has said this material emerged from performing—which he does with live electronics, not a laptop—and that the album's meant to be played loud, so the pulses course through your body. (The title ""Meridian"" ostensibly references the idea of energy's movement through the body on paths called meridians.) It does work in this regard, but you can also listen closely with headphones; this way, the compositions feel endlessly deep. Many—foggy and droning, always sparkling and elegant—evoke horror films, but not at the moment of attack; it's more the calm seconds after the worst has finally happened and you, as the viewer, feel a sense of relief alongside your quickened pulse. And not all of it's spooky. On his Bandcamp, Caminiti tags the music ""devotional,"" ""ambient,"" ""electronic,"" ""experimental,"" and ""noise,"" and the word that makes the most sense to me from that list is ""devotional."" The tracks here are stately and patient. They drift and never feel rushed, and it's easy to lose yourself in them and leave your surroundings a bit while listening. That said, some of it, like the swaggering mid-section of ""Collapse"", could almost inspire dancing. The noisier ""Excelsior"" threatens to wake up the neighbors. At times, the tracks are lullabies for dreaming about plastic sheep and at others, they are Tangerine Nightmares. Many of the songs on Meridian get louder as they go along, but none lose their ghostly, not-all-there vibe. (The song ""Steam"" really does sound like steam.) Some of the songs may even leave you thinking they could use another element, but in the end, it's nice that they remain as spare as they do, the edges left soft and fuzzy, the way you see things in the dark.","Evan Caminiti has made guitar drone with the duo Barn Owl for years.

Covered,Robert Glasper Trio,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae409d034d5c69bf44e4/1:1/w_160/466bd9ad.jpg,2015-06-18 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20573-covered/,Blue Note,"For years, Robert Glasper has been hip-hop's go-to jazzman. Along with saxophonists Kamasi Washington and Terrace Martin, and bassist Thundercat, Glasper was featured prominently on Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly, which gives the pianist greater name recognition with hip-hop fans. On songs with rapper Black Milk and multi-instrumentalist Taylor McFerrin, Glasper played the background, yet you could easily distinguish him from the other sonic elements. As frontman of the Robert Glasper Experiment—his eclectic side band—Glasper takes on an aggressive, rock-infused edge, and his Black Radio albums for Blue Note won Grammy awards. He, bassist Derrick Hodge, drummer Mark Colenburg, and vocalist Casey Benjamin put compelling spins on the likes of J Dilla, Nirvana, and Radiohead (the Experiment's 13-minute rendition of ""Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box"" is essential listening, for sure.) However, if you're looking for the Experiment's raw electric outbursts, you won't find them on Covered. For this release, Glasper reverts to the jazz trio with which he recorded his first two Blue Note albums—2005's Canvas and 2007's In My Element. With bassist Vicente Archer and drummer Damion Reid, Glasper recreates instrumentals from Black Radio and Black Radio 2, remixing tracks from occasional collaborators Musiq Soulchild (""So Beautiful"") and Bilal (""Levels""). Much like his work with the Experiment, Glasper tackles all genres, though on Covered, the results are more straightforward than anything with his other band. The B**lack Radio albums were decidedly soulful, even if they drifted occasionally across genre lines. For Covered, ""I wanted to do a nice happy medium, and do songs that I like, basically from my iPod,"" Glasper says on the LP's introduction. Recorded live before an audience at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, Covered is driven entirely by piano, percussion, and bass. It's a no-frills record that recedes into the background without much fuss, which works for and against the album's overall impact. While Covered is technically jazz, the trio drifts into R&B while keeping a deliberate pace. This is light fare and, at times, it's easy to forget Covered is playing, which feels strange for a Glasper project. Aside from the playful ""In Case You Forgot"", in which Glasper interpolates a moment of Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" before letting it crash into a heap to audience chuckles, there isn't a lot of energy here. Some of these arrangements are hampered by the overly meditative vibe, and the album feels tedious in certain spots. The trio covers Radiohead's ""Reckoner"" and John Legend's ""Good Morning"", but the versions feel flat without the original vocals and hew too closely to the studio recordings. In a way, Covered suffers because of the music that came before it: On both Black Radio editions, Glasper blended the roots of jazz with a sultry R&B ethos, effectively speaking to the Blue Note audience while reaching out to other demographics. Covered is a decent recording, but unless you attended its live taping and saw the band's interplay in person, it's tough to get invigorated by this. Perhaps that's the point: Covered seems driven by the need for calm amidst societal chaos. The final song of Glasper's Black Radio 2 was a remake of Stevie Wonder's ""Jesus Children of America"", dedicated to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn. Glasper makes similar reflections with Covered—on ""Got Over"", a brief interlude in which actor/activist Harry Belafonte ponders his journey as a black man in the United States, and on the album's final track, a remix of Kendrick Lamar's ""I'm Dying of Thirst"", which doubles as an extended roll call of minorities killed by police. It's a sobering end to a reflective record, and a conclusion that properly advocates for the importance of black life. As current events spiral out of control, even Glasper had to slow down for a moment.","For his new album, Covered, pianist Robert Glasper moves away from the unifying crossover aspirations of his Black Radio albums with a serene collection of jazz-influenced tracks.

Untitled,False,by: Jonathan K. Dick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aedab1335d7bf1699e4d/1:1/w_160/7fb9c7cf.jpg,2015-06-18 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20699-untitled/,Gilead Media,"The Minnesota sextet False have gained an impressive amount of attention from a deceptively sparse catalog. They only have two prior releases, an EP from 2012 and a 2013 split with Gilead Media labelmates Barghest, but they've impressed extreme music fans and critics alike, meaning their full-length debut Untitled arrives to uncommon anticipation. That full-length resembles other bands that fall into the category of ""USBM""—there is a sense of magnitude to False's music, which is enriched with atmospheric orchestration. But they don't fall into a ""more is less"" problem, bogging down and overextending their tracks with unmemorable passages. With Untitled, False expand on their sound without diluting it, proving they are worthy of their promise and making good on the tantalizing glimpses of their earlier works. The secret to the album's power is in large part to their understated approach to melody. Juxtaposing harmony and dissonance is old hat in extreme music, and especially so with the more recent successes of bands like Deafheaven or Alcest, but False presents that same contrast as a kind of musical photo negative, where melody and harmony lead naturally into entropy. Opener ""Saturnalia"" builds with a slow burning ferocity before exploding into a storm of discordant wails and growls, while both ""The Deluge"" and closer ""Hedgecraft"" venture close to what would undoubtedly be an easily accessible melodic hook, if they followed the impulse all the way. As it turns out, that subdued and suggestive approach to a payoff gives the record another one of its most formidable strengths. For all the winding orchestration of Untitled (remember: there are six members in this band), moments of needless filler are rare-to-nonexistent. Considering the fact that only one of the album's five tracks falls shy of the 10-minute mark, that is a remarkable achievement. Black metal, as a subgenre, is both steeped in musical complexity and devoted to the simplicity of its form. That is, regardless of how far the music itself may spiral outside the self-imposed bounds of black metal, its fulcrum remains the straightforward blast-beat, the tremolo-driven guitars, and the interpretation of its thrash and death metal forbearers. With Untitled, False have not reinvented any forms or introduced some unchartered territory for black metal. There is plenty of wanton ugliness here, both in the scrape of the vocals and the murk of the production. But the songs also find intriguing divergent paths before returning every track to its chaotic source. One of extreme music's most divisive and yet at once magnetic subgenres, black metal is as musically steeped in complexity as it is in the simplicity of its form. False reckon brilliantly with both halves of this equation. They have simply offered a new perspective on the shadow and light, the ugliness and beauty, that define their genre. For that reason, every outstanding minute of Untitled shines with brilliant darkness.","The Minnesota black metal sextet False have generated an uncommon amount of excitement from a very sparse catalog.

It's It's Remix Time Time EP,Todd Terje,by: Abigail Garnett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aed3c0084474cd0c1976/1:1/w_160/ec2109a7.jpg,2015-06-18 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20694-its-its-remix-time-time-ep/,Olsen,"It takes a special kind of confidence to tackle a remix of Todd Terje's ""Inspector Norse"", arguably one of the most beloved electronic anthems of the past five years, undoubtedly one of mastermind Terje Olsen's defining moments as a producer and storyteller, and the source of a particularly convincing addition to his stable of offbeat subjects and side characters. There's already at least one remix of the track in existence that came with the producer's stamp of approval: an expansive but faithful edit from Justin Van Der Volgen of !!!. The title of Olsen's new remix EP, It's It's Remix Time Time, hints at the redundancy of it all, but I prefer to think of it as an echo effect slapped on with a wink and a grin. The EP is a collection of remixes that echoes Olsen's history as a remixer and beloved producer of edits that polished up everything from yacht rock and worldbeat to forgotten Latin-flavored disco. It's a back catalog that now reads like a primer on the influences that made It's Album Time a beacon of un-trendy cultural omnivorism, and comprises a legacy that Olsen likes to hint at on newer releases (earlier this year, he resurrected Tangoterje, a goofy alias from his edits days, for a credit on the Alfonso Muskedender Remixed EP). Luckily, on this EP the ""Inspector Norse"" baton isn't passed off to just anyone—the biggest showcase here is for French house legend Pépé Bradock, whose two contributions elevate the whole release above any sense of end-of-the-album-cycle obligation. Like Olsen, Bradock is a veteran remixer with a talent for spinning chintzy soundbites into something beyond the sum of its parts. Like the best remixes do, his version of ""Inspector Norse"" remakes the track in his own image, turning it into a sizzling deep house track with chunky percussion and, most startlingly, a sexy, acid-fried saxophone line in place of the original's blippy melody. Likewise, Bradock's remix of ""Swing Star"", culled from a pair of album cuts that originally appeared on the It's the Arps EP, boldly flips the original's tone. By far the darkest and most dissonant thing on the EP, Bradock's version grates Olsen's cosmic flourishes into a nasty stew of burping percussion and queasy drones that somehow coalesce into something euphoric. It's as if Bradock visited the same resort shindig as Olsen on a day when the air conditioning was broken. Such is Bradock's finesse as a mixer that faintly recognizable details from ""Swing Star"" sound as natural in this setting as they did in the more cheerful version on It's Album Time. If life's a beach, then this is the inevitable heat rash. If there's a more unlikely candidate for a satisfying remix than ""Inspector Norse"", it might be ""Strandbar"". Olsen already released his own alternate genre-fied versions of the track months before the shortened version appeared on It's Album Time, and with three examples of meticulous mixing and subtle variations on the books, it's hard to imagine needing yet another angle on the track. Maybe for that reason, the two producers tackling it here, French pop voyager Joakim Bouaziz and Eric Duncan of hard-partying duo Rub N Tug, mostly play it straight, altering the mood of the song by playing up what's already there. Both Duncan and Bouaziz's reworkings sound surprisingly dry after the EP's first half, dialing up the aggression of the percussion and downplaying the original's starry-eyed romanticism. In the case of his right-hand-animator Bendik Kaltenborn, Olsen's collaborative tendencies have undoubtedly strengthened his oddball persona and made it more thematically rich. It's It's Remix Time Time is ultimately a fun way for Olsen to give a generous nod to his peers, and while not everything on it is essential, it's still reasonable to assume Todd Terje won't ever leave you totally high and dry.","Todd Terje's latest remix EP features work by the French house legend Pepe Bradock as well as French pop voyager Joakim Bouaziz and Eric Duncan of the hard partying duo Rub N Tug.

Déjà Vu,Giorgio Moroder,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aedfb1335d7bf1699e5a/1:1/w_160/cf82af42.jpg,2015-06-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20703-deja-vu/,SonyGiorgio Moroder,"In May 2013, almost a year to the day after Donna Summer succumbed to lung cancer, Giorgio Moroder made his live DJ debut at Williamsburg club Output. It was a tender moment for disco fans, and there was something healing in having her voice brought to life once more by the legendary producer. As critic Barry Walters recently put it, Summer and Moroder shared an ""uncommon symbiosis…[that] crossed gender, color, national and cultural boundaries as disco's ultimate emissaries of universal love."" Who else would the packed crowd at Output rather hear play ""Love to Love You Baby"" or ""I Feel Love"" than Giorgio himself? Earlier that same week, Giorgio could be heard recounting the beatific click of the Moog synthesizer on a newly released LP that would become one of the biggest albums of the year, Daft Punk's Random Access Memories. The man hadn't produced much music of his own since the pomp of the 1990 FIFA World Cup theme, but the Giorgio Renaissance was nigh. Naturally, news of a new album soon followed. Names like Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears were mentioned as his post-Summer muses, and the septuagenarian name-dropped EDM grandchildren like Avicii and Calvin Harris in interviews. The Eurodisco/Europop/proto-Eurotrance he set in motion in the 1970s was evident from the album's cheesy first single, ""74 Is the New 24"", which didn't bode well for his return. But going back to late '60s—see the album That's Bubble Gum - That's Giorgio—questionable taste has almost always been part of his story. During his '70s disco heyday, Giorgio had the Midas Touch, and he carried that energy into the new decade and new wave, be it the symphonic synth soundtracks for spermatozoa on Sparks' ""Tryouts for the Human Race"", the razor guitars of Blondie's ""Call Me"", or the billowing synthetic curtain balladry of Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"". But for all his platinum hits, Moroder was also a Frank Stallone and Sammy Hagar collaborator. For the most part, Déjà Vu is rickety and wholly unnecessary, and Moroder's return feels like Rick Barry coming out of retirement to suit up for the Golden State Warriors. Some traces of Giorgio's champion-caliber game remain, from the slightly menacing Moog arpeggios that open ""74 Is the New 24"" to the vocodered growl accompanying Kylie on ""Right Here, Right Now"", but his skills are otherwise in such precipitous decline it's almost agonizing to witness. Moroder is one of the most distinctive producers of 20th century pop and dance music, but on Déjà Vu, his sound is devoid of distinguishing features. The dinky synth melody of ""4 U With Love"" that opens the album evokes the kind of mid-'70s froth Moroder's visionary electronic productions blew off the dancefloor. Even worse, it's coupled with the kind of cookie-cutter beat and filter sweeps that most initiate trance producers have long deleted from their hard drives. In hindsight, it was telling that Daft Punk deployed Moroder as interview subject rather than as musical contributor. But their influence hangs over this album to a degree. As if hoping to replicate the success of RAM or else pay homage to the robots for resuscitating his career, almost every track here deploys some variation of ""Get Lucky""'s silvery guitar riff. It's on the hook of the Sia-sung title track, amid the disco touches of ""Wildstar"", and on the subpar-Nick Jonas of the Matthew Korma cut ""Tempted"". Throughout, the songs sound both overly dramatic and oddly ordinary (see Mikky Ekko's ""Don't Let Go""); in a blind test, there might be no way to distinguish between these Moroder productions and a 100% Eurotrance compilation. Which is a disservice to the singers who queued up to work with Moroder. Perhaps some of them are seeking to reclaim some of Summer's magic, but Moroder doesn't offer much assistance. Britney was perhaps best equipped to grapple with the producer's Svedka fembot beat with her previous Auto-Tuned dalliances, but their already limp cover of Suzanne Vega's ""Tom's Diner"" derails thanks to Giorgio's own vocodered interlude. Kelis, whose husky, near-androgynous voice best approximates Summer, almost carries off ""Back and Forth"", if only the song didn't grind to a halt at the chorus. Kylie, whose early-aughts pop pinnacle owed a great deal to the synergy of Summer-Moroder, feels weighed down by Giorgio's electropop, yet she still makes ""Right Here, Right Now"" work for her. Through sheer force of will, Charli XCX entwines her posh pout with Giorgio's ""Pocket Calculator"" vocal hook, transcending the Dance Dance Revolution production of ""Diamonds"" to claim the song as her own. From Britney and Kelis to Kylie and Sia, Déjà Vu boasts a pantheon of pop goddesses, but Moroder only gives them bland boutique hotel electronic music to work with. The album oddly posits a parallel world where these singers are out of work, forgotten pop stars lending their voices to generic EDM tracks just to keep the lights on. If not for their presence on Déjà Vu, Moroder's once-unmistakable music would be all but anonymous.","On his first new album under his own name in 30 years, legendary producer Giorgio Moroder teams with Britney Spears, Charli XCX, Sia, Kelis, Kylie Minogue, and more. It's not an easy ride.

1983,Kölsch,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aebdc0084474cd0c1953/1:1/w_160/4e38d62d.jpg,2015-06-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20676-1983/,Kompakt,"As heard on his debut album, 1977, Rune Reilly Kölsch's style of house and techno—melodic, colorful, emotive—closely adheres to the values the Kompakt label holds dear. It was an important record for the producer, bringing the kind of credibility he never found making more commercial house as Rune RK. He titled the album after his birth year, and it was also a means of working through complicated childhood memories. Born to a German mother and an Irish father, Kölsch's upbringing was split between Copenhagen's anarchic Christiana district, a hippie commune, and his grandparents' upscale digs in Germany. He frequently felt like a fish out of water, and he responded by creating an imaginary world; 1977, he says, was based on ""these weird ideas and concepts I had on my mind at the time."" From its title, we can guess that 1983 also mines childhood for inspiration. Like Kölsch's previous album, this one is primarily instrumental, but there are clues to incidents in his past. The lyrics to ""Bloodline"", a bittersweet anthem sung by WhoMadeWho's Tomas Hoeffding, sketch the outlines of an unspoken trauma. In ""Papageno 30 Years Later"", vocalist Waa Industry channels Antony's fluttering falsetto as he admits, ""It feels right to be falling apart""—a nod, Kölsch has said, to an incident in his youth when he was made acutely aware that he didn't fit into polite society. And then there's ""Die Anderen"", a wistful fusion of gliding tech-house with classical piano whose title translates as ""The Other"". Kompakt co-founder Michael Mayer is fond of saying that the label is ""pro-sadness on the dancefloor,"" so Kölsch is clearly right at home. But despite its melancholy undercurrents, 1983 looks to dance for catharsis. To achieve these ends, Kölsch has a specific formula down pat, and his songs tend to feel like variations upon a single structure: stately eight-bar chord progressions fleshed out with cycling arpeggios and yearning, contrapuntal melodies. He's fond of fat, meaty keyboard sounds, rich with harmonics—supersaw leads, organs, pianos—and he's got a way of stacking his sounds so that they colonize the entire spectrum, from the rumbling bass in your gut to the shimmering stars in your eyes. While they're unabashedly emotional, the tracks are also marked by restraint. A typical Kölsch song comprises no more than a handful of moving parts, and there are no choruses or bridges, just hypnotic phrases that gently rise and fall. Unusually for main-room dance music, he goes light on the drums, letting his synths do most of the heavy lifting. A sense of déjà vu permeates much of the album. The driving string melody of ""Talbot""—it's one of a handful of songs featuring Gregor Schwellenbach, a classical musician who has re-recorded a number of Kompakt classics for chamber instruments—echoes Rhythim Is Rhythim's iconic ""Strings of Life"". The ascending synthesizer line in ""Paces"" is reminiscent of the rising-and-falling melody of Octave One's ""Black Water"". And the pumping pianos of ""Cassiopeia"" could be an homage to Westbam and Nena's ""Oldschool, Baby (Piano Mix)"", a feel-good piano-house anthem that Michael Mayer included on his Fabric mix CD in 2003. But that sense of déjà vu also extends to Kölsch's own catalog. Like his last record, 1983 features a couple of sensitive vocal numbers, one resonant piano-house hook, and scads of buzzing major chords, and by the end, the songs begin to blur together. On an album of 13 tracks, it would have been nice to have a few that don't follow the same template. Still, there's no doubting Kölsch's mastery of his chosen style, and a few of the album's cuts—like the Steve Reich-influenced ""The Road"", or the Border Community-inspired ""Two Birds""—are as compelling as anything in Kompakt's recent catalog. For fans of sadness on the dancefloor, 1983 is a fine reason to keep the hanky handy.","Rune Reilly Kölsch's style of house and techno—melodic, colorful, emotive—closely adheres to the values the Kompakt label holds dear.

City of Quartz,Nick Diamonds,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae765e6ef95969321c5b/1:1/w_160/7b95da93.jpg,2015-06-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20623-city-of-quartz/,Manqué,"For the better part of the past decade, Nick ""Diamonds"" Thorburn has been carrying around the term ""ex-Unicorn"" like a carcass from a game-hunting expedition—a proud achievement, but at the same time, a burden that's cast a shadow on everything he's done since. And that's as much to do with the fact that the Unicorns' first and only widely released album was a zeitgeist-defining masterwork as the fact that its unwieldy art-pop presented a yarn ball's worth of ideas—prog fantasias, pop harmonies, garage rock, synth-freaked funk, horror-movie soundtracks—that each of Thorburn's subsequent projects have untangled and laid out in an orderly, linear fashion. While the scenery behind him has routinely changed, Thorburn's voice has retained its childlike sense of wonder and mischief, establishing a through line that connects his present-day pursuits to his former flagship band. And that ""former"" tag apparently still applies—while the Unicorns got back together to play select dates in 2014, the reunion has yet to yield any concrete plans for new recordings. (The fact that Thorburn and songwriting foil Alden Penner seem to now be sharing custody of Michael Cera suggests the lines of communication between the two remain open.) As ever, Thorburn quickly moved onto the next thing, and then the thing after that: coming off his gig soundtracking last fall's most-talked-about podcast, he's swiftly re-emerged with his second solo album. But City of Quartz feels less like a continuation of 2011's intimate I Am an Attic than the aftershock of a summer spent relearning how to play ""Tuff Ghost"" and ""Ghost Mountain"". Quite simply, this is the closest Thorburn's post-Unicorns work has come to recreating that band's self-contained, fantastical sound world—the raucous live-band energy of old may be displaced by a hermetic one-man studio operation, but that uncanny balance of quirky and creepy remains. As an album title, City of Quartz makes for a great video game name, and the synthesizer symphony comprising its title track serves as the record's welcome-screen song, suggesting entry into some imaginary dimension. The vibe of City of Quartz is low-lit and obsessive, the sound of Thorburn tinkering with pawn-shop machines in the dead of night beneath a flickering bulb. This is pop music made with synthesizers, but it's not what you'd call normally synth-pop—even when Diamonds builds his minimalist beats into proper grooves, the songs are tense and twitchy. But within City of Quartz's claustrophobic confines, Thorburn is dreaming of life outside his cellar door. He spends much of the album chasing the sun, pondering the mysteries of the moon, and celebrating a love the size of an ocean: ""Like a wave, I crash into you all day,"" he professes on the winsome tropical pop of ""Bohemian Groove"", conjuring both the uncontrollable rush of romance and its often messy aftermath. Meanwhile, the kaleidoscopic highlight ""Witch Window"" paints nostalgic scenes of kids sneaking off through bedroom windows as a metaphor for escape from our adult-life dramas and traumas: ""these wounds do not betray my suffering today/ they are a triumph over death and decay,"" Thorburn sings, over a soothing organ drone. They're the sort of affirming moments that makes you wish Thorburn would let the light in more often. The album suffers from pacing problems: The biggest bangers—the frisky, Hot Chip funk of ""Love Is Stranger"" and the Charlie Manson-sampling instrumental jam ""I'm Nobody""—are positioned near the beginning and end, while the space in between is given over to simmered-down set pieces that drag down the album's momentum. But the closing ""God Internet"" provides a perfect composite of what City of Quartz does so well, offsetting digitally rendered grandiosity with interior-monologue musings. ""Open a windowpane/ I don't feel nothing anymore,"" Thorburn offers by way of farewell, ""just calm, calm, calm, calm, calm, calm, calm, calm..."" But, true to form, even this seeming moment of bliss is laced with unease—because you're not quite sure if he's talking about escaping from his room or into his browser.","City of Quartz is the closest that any of Nick Thorburn's post-Unicorns work has come to recreating that band's self-contained, fantastical sound world.

"Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats: A New Music City",Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aed613d197565213a19e/1:1/w_160/f26496e5.jpg,2015-06-17 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20696-dylan-cash-and-the-nashville-cats-a-new-music-city/,LegacyCMF,"Everybody knows who Dylan and Cash are, but who the hell are the Nashville Cats?  The name doesn't refer to a band, but a loose collective of ace session musicians in the 615 area code during the 1960s and 1970s, when Nashville studios had a full-to-bursting Rolodex of some of the best pickers, fiddlers, drummers, bassists, dobro players, and pedal steel guitarists in the country. You might not know who Norbert Putnam is, or Pig Robbins, or Kenny Buttrey, or Buddy Spicher, but odds are you’ve heard them on records by the Byrds, Neil Young, Joan Baez, Steve Miller, three of the four solo Beatles, J.J. Cale, and Simon & Garfunkel, among others. ""The Nashville Cats"" was a name applied retroactively to this scene by the Country Music Hall of Fame to lend shape and specificity to the moment. The new compilation Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats: A New Music City is a 36-track companion piece to the Hall of Fame's exhibit of the same name, and while the release is a little confusing to unpack, it doesn't diminish the power of the music contained in it. These songs are credited to well-known stars, but in this setting their names are less important than the ones behind them. Casually blurring the lines between country and rock, these session players helped to redefine pop music away from its coastal loci and re-settle it just north of the Deep South. Blonde on Blonde was the scene’s big bang: In 1966, Dylan decamped to Nashville to record at the CBS studios, hiring mostly local musicians to flesh out songs for what would become one of his best records. This was unusual at the time, as the only people making albums in the country music capital of the world were country musicians. Still, few could argue with the results, then or now. Representing that breakthrough album here is ""Absolutely Sweet Marie"", which sounds newly punchy in this context, with that crackling organ groove acting as a sly parody perhaps of the entire L.A. scene. In Dylan’s wake, more and more artists flew into Nashville for sessions, some with only a tenuous connection to ""country."" They might have sounded like mere tourists in Music City were it not for the so-called Cats who sound alternately funky and stately, majestic and gutterbound, lowdown and high lonesome. Many of these tracks are familiar to anyone with even a passing knowledge of rock history, but even the most popular tunes sound fresh in this context, as the session players push new sounds to the forefront. The ambient jaw harp on Leonard Cohen’s ""Bird on the Wire"" pops and crackles with a new vibrancy, lending the song an off-kilter edge. The song quietly malfunctions even as Cohen sings it. Dylan and Cash exert a heavy influence, with six tracks between them—including the duet ""Girl from the North Country"", and Cash emerges as a genially paternal figure, encouraging a new generation to push the boundaries of both country and rock.  It’s hard to imagine a man better suited to act as an ambassador. Many artists went to Nashville specifically to cover Dylan, and the well-chosen covers here show how his impressionistic lyrics gave session players license to invent new flourishes. The folk duo Ian & Sylvia brighten up his composition ""This Wheel’s on Fire"" even as the musicians instill the arrangement with subtle foreboding, as though they’ve spotted some ruination on the horizon. And the Byrds’ cover of ""You Ain’t Going Nowhere"" sounds both regal and randy, thanks to the way Lloyd Green’s spry pedal steel trips lustily around the song. Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats makes a fine primer on country rock, although fans steeped in the genre may find some of it redundant. While the compilers might have hunted for lesser-known or unreleased tracks (the only exclusive is an alternate take on Dylan’s ""If Not For You""), the bigger shortcoming is the lack of info on the individual session musicians in the liner notes. There’s very little about Buttrey, Spicher, Putnam, and their fellow Cats in the packaging, not even a listing of who plays on which songs. It doesn’t detract from the music, but such an oversight is odd considering how thoroughly the exhibit itself documents them individually. Like any good catalog, however, this album is an extension of the exhibit, not a substitute. Perhaps the best way to hear it is on your way to or from the Hall of Fame, where the exhibit is up through the end of 2016.","The Nashville Cats were not a band, but a group of ace session musicians who helped define country rock with the help of ambassadors like Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan. This 36-track compilation, a companion piece to an exhibition currently running at the Country Music Hall of Fame, includes songs by Cash, Dylan, and many other stars, but the focus is on the players behind them.

Year of the Hare EP,Fucked Up,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae655e6ef95969321c3b/1:1/w_160/33ba54c3.png,2015-06-17 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20607-year-of-the-hare-ep/,Deathwish,"The thing about Fucked Up is that on their proper albums, their music has never been all that fucked up. At this point, the Toronto band is basically a heavy guitar pop group fronted by the unmistakable hardcore bark of Damian ""Pink Eyes"" Abraham. They're hardcore in spirit and attitude and Wikipedia entry only: 2014's Glass Boys was more digital-age the Who than Minor Threat (and the same goes for 2011’s hour-plus rock opera David Comes to Life, really). As far as living up to their name, it's in their ongoing Zodiac series where they let the freak flag fly. Since 2006's Year of the Dog, they've released an EP (sometimes only ""EP"" in name) once every 12 months or so featuring music inspired by different years of the Chinese calendar. These songs are often long and more experimental. The seventh in the series*, Year of the Hare*, includes a 21-minute title track that was written and recorded in 2013 and a eight-minute B-side recorded in 2014. The cover art was designed by Converge frontman Jake Bannon, who's released Year of the Hare on his Deathwish imprint, but this music isn't especially heavy. Instead, it sounds like the kind of outsider psychedelia that may have popped up on a weirdo imprint like Siltbreeze at some point in the '90s alongside the Strapping Fieldhands, the Dead C, and Harry Pussy. The B-side, ""California Cold"", actually made me think of psyched-out noise-freaks Temple of Bon Matin and Comets on Fire for the first time in awhile. The vocals are hazy and occasionally buried, the guitars reminiscent of a blown-out ""Free Bird"". There are shakers, saxophone, and flute. It's a lusciously murky offering, one that works as an anthem before folding in on itself and breaking apart in interesting ways, and overall is the stronger of the songs here. The title track finds them experimenting with the process of recording itself. ""Year of the Hare"" starts in silence for two minutes before an acoustic guitar strums and the song slowly picks up pace. But throughout these 21 minutes, tape is spliced and edits are intentionally obvious: you get the sound of a cable unplugging (and the connection being reestablished), an empty studio layered over and over, a plaintive piano starting and stopping and warping, music skidding out into a dead-end and then negotiating a new climax. ""Year of the Hare"" feels, at times, very much like their version of a modern-classical experiment: John Cage collaborating with Youth of Today. It's not until about the six-minute mark when they allow themselves to go full bore into the song, and here it becomes an enjoyable Fucked Up anthem. Though, after repeat listens, it remains unclear if you really needed to go through the rest to experience that rush. Abraham and guest vocalist Isla Craig sing—at different times, it's more like Act I and Act II than a duet—about various rabbits, from the popular culture of Alice of Wonderland (""There's only one way to stop a mad watch"") to the kind you find in your backyard. There are ""hare/hair/heir"" puns and references to endless fucking and endless proliferating. These lyrics were written by guitarist and producer Mike Haliechuk, who has said that the song ""focuses on time, and becoming lost in it. The modern way of life, getting stuck in time-sucking gadgets and trends, stress and scheduling."" The song itself is circular, finishing how it began; it feels very much like an endless loop, Abraham howling somewhere in the middle: ""Mad as a march hare, two days late/ They stole all my time and ate all my space/ A thousand rabbits with a million heirs/ It's always tea time in the year of the hare."" The track was accompanied by an unsolvable interactive video that features an office worker being haunted by rabbits on the subway, in his office, and at home. I couldn't get the video to work properly, so just kept refreshing my browser, until I started to wonder if that's actually what they wanted me to do. All of this is admirable enough, even if, at this point, the commentary is a bit obvious. But hey, Fucked Up have continued to stretch and find new ways to carry on, and for a hardcore group that formed in 2001, this is worthy of respect. Doubling down on all of this, the band is about to go out on a Zodiac-themed tour, performing Zodiac songs (some never before performed live) as a nine-piece featuring all the members of the group, Doomsquad. You have to wonder, though, if it isn't time to scale back a little, and to find complexities in a more compact approach. You can add layers and length endlessly, but that often dilutes (Chinese Democracy vs. Appetite for Destruction, if you will). Sometimes a power trio is more than enough. Because while ""Year of the Hare"" offers nice sounds and concepts, it essentially works best as background music. All said, I'm not sure if background music's what I want from a band who, on more than one occasion, literally caused the hair on my neck to stand up.","Since 2006's Year of the Dog, Fucked Up have released an EP once every 12 months or so featuring music inspired by different years of the Chinese calendar. The seventh in the series*, Year of the Hare*, shows them indulging their weirder sides, embracing outsider psych and sound experiments.

_genic,Namie Amuro,by: Patrick St. Michel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929af06b1335d7bf1699e9f/1:1/w_160/91b69be6.jpg,2015-06-17 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/namie-amuro-genic/,Dimension Point,"J-pop performer Namie Amuro is one of the best-selling artists in Japanese music history. She helped inspired fashion trends, paved the way for similar solo singers, and—most impressively—outlasted all of her competition, adapting to new styles that helped her stay fresh to the often-fickle Japanese casual music consumer. Beginning her career in the highly goofy group Super Monkey's, she went solo after label higher-ups singled her out, and she rose to prominence through a mix of dance numbers and ballads. Since, she's glided from R&B to poppy hip-hop.  She's an unknown entity Stateside—well, at least to those who didn't watch Toonami daily—but huge in Asia. In Japan, at least, she really has nothing left to prove. This January, Japanese publication Business Journal reported that Amuro bought a house in Los Angeles and is preparing to take a shot at the American market. Her 13th album, _genic, is not quite that bid for American domination: It hasn't been backed by a media blitz or hyped-up collaborations. It isn't even available in the States yet, though the rest of her discography hitting iTunes hints that it eventually will be. Yet the album still implies a shift in approach. Amuro sings mostly in English, and teamed up with a couple well-known Western producers, including David Guetta. In recent years, she has tacked towards EDM, but where recent attempts have felt like cheap replicas,  _genic sounds more inspired and confident. ""Time Has Come"" sells the drama of wanting to escape ""this sleeping town"" via sudden tempo changes, while ""Stranger"" delivers a stuttering hook, adding an element of welcome unease. (At one point, EDM wonderkid Zedd, who provided a song for Amuro's last album, was rumored to be the producer behind the song ""Stranger"", but his name is nowhere to be found in the notes.) Amuro stumbles at various points, such as on ""Every Woman"", a well-intentioned but awkward empowerment anthem, and the love-as-schoolyard whistler ""It"". The album's big Guetta collaboration, relegated to the bonus track ""What I Did for Love"", is its most formulaic number. The other big tripping point is Amuro's decision to primarily sing in English, a choice she made three albums ago. Her English-speaking fans tend to mock her relentlessly for this, and at times she slips over pronunciation. Yet her lyrics have never been a high point even in Japanese, and on _genic she delivers her words directly and with a confidence that smooths over any small mistakes. Then there is ""B Who I Want 2 Be"", one of the weirder songs to grace a major-label pop album in 2015. Many would glance at the credits and assume it stands out because of PC Music-affiliated producer Sophie. The song boasts his signature artificial fizz, but it's his decision to leave plenty of space for the singers that ends up his best move. That's because ""2 B"" finds Amuro dueting with singing-synthesizer avatar Hatsune Miku, though the way Vocaloid artist Mitchie M tunes her results in a song where the two singers blur into one digi-voice. There's a definite Uncanny Valley vibe, but everything clicks together just right to create a disorientingly catchy number. Still, _genic's best moment is its most straightforward. ""Golden Touch"" breakbeats forward, every few seconds leading to synths that burst like fireworks over the song. It all builds to one of the most joyful choruses of Amuro's career, the sort of hook begging to be blasted by passing cars. It's song-of-the-summer material thanks to its directness, mirrored by an equally lighthearted and effective video. It's great pop because no one involved sounds like they're worrying about how to tailor her music to new audiences. If Amuro ever takes advantage of her new digs and tries to debut properly in the U.S., she should try to hold onto the simplicity of this feeling.","J-pop performer Namie Amuro is one of the best-selling artists in Japanese music history.

The Great Cybernetic Depression,Princess Chelsea,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aedb13d197565213a1a8/1:1/w_160/3202b3e9.jpg,2015-06-16 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20700-the-great-cybernetic-depression/,Flying NunLil' Chief,"Constant connectivity brings constant alienation, a paradox that's worried everyone from Parkay Quarts to Unknown Mortal Orchestra in the past year. Princess Chelsea, the songwriting project of Auckland-based singer Chelsea Nikkel, enters the fray with her second album, The Great Cybernetic Depression. Singing in a light deadpan against wild, bright production, Chelsea doesn't decry the Internet outright, nor does she revel in its potential utopianism. She skirts both easy roads to present an album whose lyrical content cuts hard lines against its pastel hues. The Great Cybernetic Depression allegedly takes place 10 years in the future, when human relationships are even shallower and more atomized than they are now. The feeling of scrolling through a potential love interest's Instagram for half an hour hangs thick over the album's atmosphere; Chelsea packs anxiety flat and slick into her disaffected delivery. There is longing here, and it comes through in lyrics like ""I will love you from far away/ Just not quite enough."" But it never breaks her careful, polished facade. Formerly Chelsea's partner on the runaway YouTube hit ""The Cigarette Duet"", Jonathan Bree returns for a few more numbers, but instead of lending depth to the album's world, he simply emphasizes its flatness. Bree and Chelsea both sing in easy, back-and-forth melodies, like they're performing a lullaby or the jingle to an instructional video. Even the lyrics tend to stick to monosyllables. The duet ""Is It All OK?"" indulges in some degree of world-building, hinting at an apocalyptic event that decimated the whole planet a decade ago. Crystalline arpeggios roll in waves behind both singers, and the beats branch out, but Chelsea and Bree's voices march on, affectless. Instead of retreating to guitar and piano as emblems of a pre-computerized past, Chelsea melts both instruments into a synth-heavy mix. She even pushes them to their most comical extremes; ""When the World Turns Grey"" and ""We Were Meant 2 B"" both ripple with hot, sweet guitar solos like something yanked from the Guns N' Roses songbook and performed by a Guitar Center hopeful. They come out of nowhere, erupting from sugarplum synth decor just in time for you to realize that the songs have been power ballads all along. The space between accelerationist pop music and '80s hair metal has never looked so small. The album's lead single and clear standout, ""Too Many People"" teeters on the fine edge that the rest of The Great Cybernetic Depression slips around. Chelsea sings of a city packed to the brim with miserable souls as keyboard lines sparkle beneath her, like ""Eleanor Rigby"" recast in Swarovski. Her lyrics are simple and her melodies even simpler, but the song hits like a fable marking an essential truth of her isolated post-urban condition. The Beatles' lonely Liverpool became our own lonely laptop screens: a million windows glowing, and none of them unlocked. Princess Chelsea presses something deep and sad between two narrow panes of glass: Everyone is closer to everyone else, but everyone is more scattered by the glut.","Princess Chelsea is the project of Chelsea Nikkel. On her second album, The Great Cybernetic Depression, the Auckland-based songwriter sings about the isolated post-urban condition in a light deadpan against wild, bright production.

Settler,Vattnet Viskar,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae5c9d034d5c69bf451d/1:1/w_160/8d6e0fc7.jpg,2015-06-16 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20601-settler/,Century Media,"Vattnet Viskar's sophomore LP Settler takes its inspiration from a photo taken in 1985 by the New York Times' Keith Meyers. It depicts the late astronaut Christa McAuliffe floating in a zero gravity chamber—a notorious form of training that fellow astronauts have coined ""the vomit comet""—not too long before the 1986 Challenger Disaster which took her life. What's so remarkable about the photo is that McAuliffe doesn't look the least bit sick or discomforted as she coasts, her grin visible under the harsh rays of the sun. ""It's one of the most conflicted things I've ever seen,"" co-founder and guitarist Chris Alfieri said of Meyers' photo (a recreation of which serves as the cover to Settler) in a recent press release, ""to be so happy, at the peak of life, only to have it all gone right after."" Alfieri's statement may scan pessimistic, but it's actually one rooted in joy and amazement. One could argue that a similar philosophy—a vibrant, violent celebration of life in the face of death and destruction—informs the New Hampshire band's output, particularly their 2013 debut full-length Sky Swallower, a transcendental epic that sought to translate nature's fury into devastating pastorals. On that record, the quartet's palette mostly consisted of Norwegian black metal interwoven with sludge and shoegaze; Settler, its successor, is more atmospheric and strident, operating with mathematical precision and a playwright's eye for tragedy. The central conflict driving Settler concerns the tenuous relationship between the individual and the infinite, and how to reconcile the stubbornness of life with a harsh, largely indifferent universe. In Alfieri's eyes, the forces of nature are as brilliant and complex as a rocket scientist's thesis, and deserve to be treated as so: hence, we have ""Colony"", a celebratory ode to ants that he penned after reading that the insects' communication networks are likely more complex than Google algorithms. The band kicks the dust off an anthill to reveal a kicking, screaming utopia of insects, the hive-mind as a supercomputer; the distorted, robotic chants of ""zero"" and ""one"" that overtake the bridge aren't the working of some supercomputer bent on world domination, but rather ""We"" in binary code. This helps ground the album in human experience, and it's a humanity that is further intensified on ""Glory"" as its mournful solo succumbs to a panic attack of dissonant, anxious chords—the aural equivalent, perhaps, of an oxygen shortage. On ""Impact"", barreling drums and stratospheric riffs challenge guitarist/vocalist Nicholas Thornbury's decree of earthly independence—""I stand upon the ground""—by pitching the whole mix into the heavens. Settler's life-affirming themes, black metal inflections, and space-age atmospherics (not to mention its decidedly non-brutal cover art) might remind some of Deafheaven's Sunbather, but Settler is sludgier, the melodies more obfuscated, and the vocals grittier and less processed. In fact, the mix proves to be one of the only sticking points for the album. Lo-fi recording methods are perfect for hardcore-leaning bands like Dodsferd and Converge, but Settler's compressed vocals and often-muddied drums put up a significant roadblock to attaining the heights the songs reach for. And yet, despite minor stumbles, Settler manages to find its way back into orbit, coasting along at the perfect pace for the duration of the 40-minute, eight-track runtime. Vattnet Viskar may have huge imaginations, but they temper this drive far better than most of their peers, and, in a sense, accomplish the impossible with a galactic epic that doesn’t have to travel light years to make its point.","The New Hampshire metal band Vattnet Viskar's music is a vibrant, violent celebration of life in the face of death and destruction. On their second LP, they examine the tenuous relationship between the individual and the infinite in a way that might remind some of Deafheaven's Sunbather.

More Faithful,No Joy,by: Maud Deitch,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeb9c0084474cd0c194e/1:1/w_160/390dab25.jpg,2015-06-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20673-more-faithful/,Mexican Summer,"On their third full-length, More Faithful, Montreal shoegazers No Joy make it clear that they're not afraid to shift their sights towards the sky once in awhile. Although their songs still possess the signature qualities of the genre—fuzzy guitars and repetitive, mantra-like refrains—there are hints that the band is trying to expand within it, breaking through the sometimes-monotonous din with moments of light. It's a hard album to pin down, at moments bright and tender, at times as dark and scuzzy, and the contrast helps mitigate the sameness that sometimes plagued their previous efforts. Beginning with their second LP Wait to Pleasure and continuing through the 2013 EP Pastel and Pass Out, you could hear the band seeking ways to deepen their sound. More Faithful was recorded with Ariel Pink producer Jorge Elbrecht in Brooklyn and Costa Rica, and there's a little bit of the city and moments of the sea present on nearly every track. ""Moon in My Mouth"", a psyched-out, dreamy track with a swaying, beach-punk riff, showcases singer Jazamine White-Gluz's bright vocals and lulls the listener. It's punk rock taken poolside, city mice taking a break from the harsh squall. The sound is both massive and soft around its edges, layering elements of surf-rock and psychedelia into the harsh din of Laura Lloyd's guitars. Light and dark are constantly at play across the album's surface, like shadows from moving clouds. Album opener ""Remember Nothing"" is a dissonant, clanging contrast to the mellow vibes of ""Moon"", opening with a fast, hi-hat-reliant drum beat and a muddy riff that wouldn't sound out of place on a Sonic Youth record. Then the vocals enter, and leaven the murk with a hint of tenderness. ""Burial in Twos"" starts out spacious and gorgeous, with a wide-open ringing riff and pinging synth hits, before some gristly electric guitars enter and grind their teeth. There's a feeling that nothing on the album is accidental. The squealing, careening ""Chalk Snake"", which is so Jesus and Mary Chain-esque it veers into the realm of pastiche, ends by juxtaposing a high-pitched note of guitar squall with a piano line that almost sounds like Joni Mitchell. It's these subversive little moments that help No Joy avoid the diminishing returns that often plagues shoegazers. And although they're still obviously committed to noise, still praying at the fuzzy altar of My Bloody Valentine, they're a band that's still evolving, and letting a little bit of light in through the cracks has served them well.","On their third full-length, More Faithful, Montreal shoegazers No Joy find subtle ways to deepen their sound.

Luminiferous,High on Fire,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae9ab1335d7bf1699ddc/1:1/w_160/d8add87f.jpg,2015-06-16 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20651-luminiferous/,eOne Music,"Matt Pike has become a punchline again. In the weeks leading up to the release of High on Fire’s masterful seventh album, Luminiferous, listeners began to notice that the singer’s long-latent suspicions and esoteric interests had morphed at last into legitimate conspiracy theories. During ""The Black Plot"", the album’s exuberant opener and first tease, Pike grunts about the need to hide your mind because of nearby aliens and relents to the damage an evil global scheme has already caused. During subsequent browbeater ""The Sunless Years"", Pike growls about dropping acid, spotting satellites, and huffing chemtrails. ""Someone please tell them,"" he shouts mid-verse, ""this is our fucking lives."" When Rolling Stone asked Pike about those ideas, he reinforced them rather than recant: a book by noted snake oil salesman David Icke had opened his eyes. 9/11 was an inside job. And the aliens built both the ziggurats and pyramids. “Dude, I say a lot of fucked-up shit!” Pike admitted. As it does, the metal Internet laughed online. But if that’s the stuff that drives Pike and his increasingly volatile and complex rhythm section to play with the gumption and zeal of Luminiferous, so be it. These nine tracks are among the most enthusiastic and bracing of High on Fire’s career, with mammoth riffs and hooks spurred on by a momentous band. Luminiferous feels like a classic compendium of High on Fire’s successes. There are mid-tempo marches, like the arching wallop of ""The Falconist"", and breathless moments that push the accelerator on doom metal until the pedal seems to stick, like the clawing ""The Dark Side of the Compass"" and the irrepressible ""The Black Plot"". The parts themselves have never sounded better. Pike, who supplies a solo for every song, is an audacious, unapologetic leader. Drummer Des Kensel has become an exceptional drummer, able to shoehorn blast beats inside weighted sludge riffs and actually swing through the most straightforward moments. Bassist Jeff Matz is an expert at interlocking with both sides, sharing the load of the riffs and the rhythms until they’re all too big to resist. Now approaching their second decade as a consistent trio, High on Fire’s interplay has become a marvel. To wit, Pike’s set of brief solos during ""The Falconist""—and the way Kensel and Matz subtract and add time around it—warrants jazz-level scholarship. Still, Luminiferous is at its best when High on Fire seem to be preaching about these zany ideas, as if Pike has some great revelation that must be shared with his disciples. ""Slave the Hive"", for instance, ricochets between hardcore built by a doom metal toolkit and shout-out-loud classic rock played by madmen on speed. ""They got us wired to the reptile brain,"" the band howls during the hook. ""Your life is not the same. This world is insane."" It’s the kind of silly, serious rallying cry that’s meant to be yelled back at the band onstage, even if you don’t buy it. That infectious feeling applies to the relentless title track, too, a pick-sliding monster that reaches back to the days of punk-and-metal crossover to lecture on theories of Hertz-based mind control and the deeds of white-wigged barristers. Pike unleashes soul-scraping yells between the verses and over the coda. It is a quasi-religious paroxysm; he’s hollering about despising government overlords the way a gospel shouter might scream about loving the Lord. Every number on Luminiferous—and for the most part, in High on Fire’s entire collection—begins with some jolt, be it a heavy drum roll from Kensel or a big swipe at the guitar from Pike. But late into this album, High on Fire take one of their most unlikely detours ever, opening ""The Cave"" with a pensive bass solo and colorful clouds of textural abstraction. Acoustic guitar trots along to a steady beat, and Pike legitimately croons lines about putting life, the road, and even conspiracy theories on hold long enough to fall in love. They seesaw between distorted, supercharged choruses and muted verses, arriving somewhere between a power ballad and a post-grunge acoustic anthem. It suggests broader possibilities for High on Fire than the established strum-churn-and-solo modus operandi and provides a welcome break to this parade of heavy hitters. What’s more, ""The Cave"" indicates that Pike’s time in the reunited Sleep has served him well, causing him to slow down and be more than some shirtless 43-year-old dude with tough-guy lyrics. Al Cisneros, ""The Cave"" suggests, is not Sleep’s only surviving master of mood. Speaking of Sleep, two decades ago, the hard-living Pike couldn’t help keep that band together long enough to release its third album, an epic poem about a mecca made of marijuana. Few might have predicted that, countless narcotic trips later, the now-sober Pike would be one of metal’s most trustworthy bandleaders, fronting a trio so consistent that Luminiferous feels only like the next point in a long line of remarkable records. Yes, High on Fire add a few new tricks here, especially through an enhanced ability to push and pull tempos at will. But for the most part, they remain a powerful trio with perfect chemistry, capable of embedding great hooks and marvels of rhythm section athleticism within riff-worshipping hits. ""Before, I’d be all like, ‘How do we top the last one?’"" Pike told Rolling Stone of Luminiferous in the same interview that turned him back into a minor metal meme. ""It’s not better—it’s just a different version of myself that I’ve been trying to express all along."" That’s not crazy talk. That’s fact.","The nine tracks on High on Fire’s masterful seventh album, Luminiferous, are among the most enthusiastic and bracing of the Oakland metal band's career. Featuring mammoth riffs and hooks, it feels like a classic compendium of High on Fire’s successes.

DJ-Kicks,DJ Koze,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aebe13d197565213a171/1:1/w_160/ac3198f8.jpg,2015-06-16 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20677-dj-kicks/,!K7,"The music of Hamburg-based producer DJ Koze offers an unusual collision of the blissful and precise. In his singles, albums, and remixes, the immersive sensation of shoegaze and psychedelia meets the pointillist precision of minimal techno. So while his affinity for beautiful surface textures conjures feelings of drifting ecstasy, his crisp percussion and fondness for 4/4 propulsion concentrates those airy feelings into diamond-hard bursts. His music can get disorienting and even a bit creepy, but the darker effects feel more like the inevitable result of wandering, like a child taking a wrong turn in one of Grimm's fairy tales. At heart, Koze's music is warm and joyous, designed to make you feel good. There's a strange kind of alchemy at work on the best DJ mixes, where the sensibility of the music and the connections between the tracks have so much integrity that it's if the person mixing made the music on their own. Koze's entry in the long-running DJ-Kicks series is remarkable not just because it's structured so well and flows so seamlessly as an album, but also because it offers insight into its mixer's mind, and feels a bit like an autobiography in sound. As it moves from a front half heavy on blunted hip-hop (as a kid in the '80s, Koze was a competitive hip-hop DJ) into deliciously weird singer-songwriter turns and finally ends with gorgeous selections of gentle house and techno, you begin to hear Koze's music emerge out of the music of others. Along the way, he tinkers subtly with the tracks, transforming them via remixes and edits to make the whole feel like one long suite. In the record's early stretch, Koze draws heavily from the Stones Throw catalog. On the evidence here, he favors producers that can isolate samples from the '60s and '70s—a guitar pattern, a swoop of strings—and warp them into a hypnotic loop that offers a kind of commentary on sound and memory. Madlib is one master of this approach, and Koze includes the former's collaboration with Freddie Gibbs, ""Shame"", along with his beat on Strong Arm Steady's ""Best of Times"". But work from Mndsgn and Swiss producer Dimlite mine a similar vein, a woozy post-Dilla environment heavy on groove with a deep interest in sonic detail. The first half also shows Koze's fondness for expressive, unusual voices. On the Boards of Canada remix of cLOUDDEAD's ""Dead Dogs Two"", verses sit uneasily between nerd-rap and twee, while Homeboy Sandman's vocals on ""Holiday"" sound more like one half of a slurred conversation than a declaration. The slapback echo of Trish Keenan's vocals on Broadcast's ""Tears in the Typing Pool"" dislodge the song from time, making it resemble a '60s-era Disney animated feature rather than a 2005 album on Warp. And the mash-up of Hot Chip side project the 2 Bears with an instrumental from Cincinnati producer Hi-Tek, putting the bedroom soul vocals front and center, offers the perfect transition from the album's beat-head opening to the dreamier electronics that come later. The set builds and becomes more interesting as it goes, and Koze takes a firmer hand, tweaking house tracks by Session Victim, Frank & Tony, and Marcel Fengler to bring out their inner Koze-ness. The moment late in Fengler's ""Jaz"", when the sleek techno opens into a clearing and the wistful piano of Portable's 2014 masterpiece ""Surrender"" enters, is one of the most breathtaking mix segues in recent memory. And the fact that Koze can make a William Shatner song produced by Ben Folds (""It Hasn't Happened Yet"", from Shatner's 2004 album Has Been) sound logical in this context is a testament to his magical ear. Marker Starling's ""In Stride"", another odd highlight, like the Broadcast cut, sounds like it could come from one of four different decades, but it actually came out in 2010 on Tin Angel. It's easy to assume that lovely songs like this, first released on a small indie label during a time of vast musical abundance, are easily lost forever, banished to the forgotten tip of the long tail. But Koze finds home for these misfit songs, and by doing so gets you thinking about possibilities, what else that might be out there waiting to be rediscovered.","At heart, the music of Hamburg-based producer DJ Koze is warm and joyous, designed to make you feel good.

Olympic Mess,Helm,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae8eea9e61561daa62cc/1:1/w_160/7d9b5f95.jpg,2015-06-15 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20642-olympic-mess/,Pan,"A sense of unease characterizes Luke Younger's music as Helm—sonically and also, perhaps, conceptually. His music fits loosely into categories like ambient, drone, noise, and industrial, yet in interviews, he takes pains to stress that it's not reducible to any of those descriptors. His music is frequently darkly foreboding, but he insists that it isn't ""intentionally dark,"" as he told The Wire, and he is careful to keep the usual industrial clichés at arm's length: ""I've never played with suggestive or dark imagery. You'll never see a graveyard on the cover of one of my records."" And while his music depends heavily upon field recordings and acoustic sources, it warily maintains its distance from the physical world. Olympic Mess is Helm's fourth release for Bill Kouligas' PAN label, following the 2012 album Impossible Symmetry and subsequent Silencer and The Hollow Organs EPs. The new album stems from a period in which Younger says that he immersed himself in ""loop-based industrial music, dub techno, and Balearic disco,"" but take that backstory with a grain of salt. If his music isn't ""intentionally dark,"" it definitely isn't intentionally any of those things, either. Olympic Mess turns out to be much more interesting, precisely because it remains so hard to pin down. It might be slipperier, even, than his previous work, despite the fact that Olympic Mess is his most structured record yet. Beneath the hazy, abstracted shapes, there's a sense of flow and a sense of purpose. As in the best abstract art, nothing feels haphazard or merely random; every burble, blip, clang, ping, chirp, and whoosh is a voice in a vast symphony. There's no doubting that there is a kind of logic at play. While murky rumbles remain a primary reference point, the album is shot through with light and color. Virtually all of the album's tracks thrive upon the tension between shadows and shimmer, and the latter wins out again and again. The 12-minute ""Outerzone 2015"", the album's centerpiece, moves gradually from rain-barrel clang to scrapes and whines, creating accidental harmonies as it throws off sparks. The title track, running watery loops against a high-pitched buzz, is also surprisingly dulcet, and almost delicate; you wouldn't think that there was a way of linking Kompakt's Pop Ambient series with Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, but here we are. Olympic Mess is full of elliptical loops that give the music its shape. Sometimes they churn along unaccompanied; elsewhere, they throb in concert with other loops but out of sync with them, creating a wild, oceanic push-and-pull. But the music is never defined by its rhythms, and none of its tracks feature a steady pulse from beginning to end. Instead, tiny micro-currents bubble up from the depths, play out for a spell, and are eventually subsumed. At its best, and when heard in the right headspace, Olympic Mess gives you the feeling of listening differently. Only one track seems out of place: ""Strawberry Chapstick"", a four-minute spoken-word sketch read—not, it seems, by Younger—in an almost inaudible whisper, the mic crackling and popping like a campfire. It appears to be a long scrap of found footage, and its mundanity (""I'm 22 years old […] I am 5'8"", my whole family is pretty tall […] I'm a musician—I don't make a living playing music but I do play a couple instruments"") jerks you out of Younger's finely wrought illusions and zaps you back to the real world. Olympic Mess speaks volumes without utilizing language or conventional musical tropes; it's an experience so captivating that language only breaks the spell.","Luke Younger's music as Helm fits loosely into categories like ambient, drone, noise, and industrial, but is not reducible to any of them.

Red Kite,Sarah Cracknell,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae9113d197565213a11d/1:1/w_160/56e09bc3.jpg,2015-06-15 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20644-red-kite/,Cherry Red,"Any band that sticks around long enough, and garners enough acclaim, will eventually find their history clotted with misconceptions. For Saint Etienne, these mostly involve the role of vocalist Sarah Cracknell, who was dismissed routinely as lightweight, a figurehead in a feather boa. To be fair, Cracknell was originally one among many guest vocalists; the door simply stopped revolving after she walked in. And as has been noted, a band comprised of one female vocalist/lyricist and a couple male producer/pop geeks (in the case of music journalist Bob Stanley, professional pop geeks) leads to certain assumptions about who's contributing what. But for someone supposedly replaceable, the dozens of sophisto-dance vocalists who've emulated Cracknell make poor auditions. And consider her one-and-a-half solo albums: 1997's Lipslide and 2000's EP Kelly's Locker, released and re-released in various permutations through the years, most recently as part of 2012's Casino Classics. Lipslide is stylistically all over the place, and nothing about it should cohere—but the voice is decidedly Cracknell's, and the flourishes both instrumental (string palpitations, synth glissandos, a pervasive lacelike delicacy) and lyrical (dance songs dropped into casually dystopian settings, characters sketched to the tossed-off but telling detail) are clearly of one mind. And then there's Cracknell's literal voice: an instrument tissue-sheer and expensive as silk, which can sound arch, wistful, lived-in and glamorous at once. Even Cracknell's nastier patrician tracks end up sounding cozy. ""Cozy"" is how Cracknell describes Red Kite, her first major solo project in 15 years. Recorded in a barn by her house and inspired by the surrounding countryside, Red Kite at times evokes the wispy folk of Tiger Bay and its B-sides, or the quieter moments on Lipslide. Like Saint Etienne, it's quite conscious of its antecedents, from the pastel '60s pop Saint Etienne's perennially besotted with, to the decidedly English folk of Sandy Denny and Nick Drake. In Cracknell's discography, though, the album stands apart, pastoral where Lipslide was glossy, homespun where Saint Etienne were sophisticated. Produced by Carwyn Ellis, the album sounds comfortably lived-in upon first listen—the lilting first few notes of ""On the Swings"", the gentle ""In the Dark"". Cracknell's voice, more than a decade on, has lost none of its luster, save a world-weary undertone that's developed, most notably on ""The Mutineer"". Cracknell writes characters, not autobiography; for every track that seems to deliberately play on her public image, like the mysterious, unattainable woman swooned after on ""On the Swings"", there are five more about people so scripted or surveilled or artfully moody they could only exist in another, slightly more cinematic world than ours. Where Red Kite differs from Cracknell and Saint Etienne's more typical work is scope. ""I Close My Eyes"" follows a woman on the underground and slips, 253-style, into her private reveries. As reveries go, they're low-drama, mostly about being ambivalently single, and the lyrics would be banal on paper: ""never wanted to commit, but you never know."" The drama's in what goes unvoiced; in the way the steady plod of the train commingles with the violins and descants conjured up around it, evoking a haunting, romantic interiority. Muted Red Kite may be, but it is not dour. ""Hearts Are for Breaking"" is a sparkling, cruel indi pop song—a love triangle, sleek as the instrument and pointed as the shape—that a hundred acts, starting with Camera Obscura, could covet. In this same vein is ""Nothing Left to Talk About"", which takes a decidedly unromantic premise—the lovelorn narrator of ""4 Months, 2 Weeks"" trying to charm and swoon her way past her ex-lover's exasperated rejection (played by Manic Street Preachers' Nicky Wire)—and makes it sound as knowing as an old friendship. If Red Kite falters, it's where it deviates from the pastoral coziness—specifically ""I Am Not Your Enemy"", which evokes psychedelic rock in sound but not quite in menace. Far more successful are the plainspoken likes of ""Take the Silver"", featuring folk-rockers the Rails and evoking Dusty Springfield, or the marimba lullaby of ""Favourite Chair"", which like much of Red Kite is the musical equivalent of sinking into one. One-note? Perhaps, but the note is hypnotic. There is much to be said for an album that is simply exceedingly nice, like a hug or a blanket*.* Saint Etienne earned its cult following in part for infusing dance music with high-style escapism; Cracknell proves here—if she hadn't already—that she's as adept at the escapism that comes of imagining settling down.","Red Kite, the first solo project in 15 years from former Saint Etienne vocalist Sarah Cracknell, is a cozy record, one that sounds comfortably lived-in upon first listen.

You're Going to Make It EP,Mates of State,by: Stephen M.

During that span of time, the scattered scene they once represented has only receded even further into the past, leaving them unmoored—out of time at best, irrelevant at worst. A decade ago Jason Hammel and Kori Gardner were one of so many co-ed power-pop duos competing for that cold ""O.C."" cash: Georgie James out of D.C., the Rosebuds out of North Carolina, the Like Young from Chicago, Viva Voce from way out in Portland. Most of them were romantically entangled; all of them got by more on energy than on actual hooks. Few were quite so early to the scene as Mates of State, who hooked up in 1997 and started a band shortly after. At first, they were drums (Hammel) and organ (Gardner), but soon they expanded into synths and programmed beats, even the occasional guitar—all without losing their default setting of aggressively cute. That adaptability might have been their saving grace, as Mates soldiered on while others stumbled. On one hand, they were on the fringe of a postmillennial movement loosely known as ""joycore,"" which tried to make pop exuberance sound radical, if not quite radicalized. But Mates of State made Architecture in Helsinki and the Go! Team sound like the Fall and Wire by comparison, perhaps because their primary subject wasn’t the world around them but the world they made together. Listeners were either charmed or chagrined by the moony eyes they made at each other onstage. Even if they never enjoyed much mainstream success beyond the occasional television soundtrack placement, you can hear their influence in the DIY pop of Karmin and the Ting Tings, which is not the most enviable legacy. The tone of this review might sound like an obituary, but Mates of State are far from dead. ""Staring Contest"", the first track on their comeback EP You’re Going to Make It, almost makes a case for this type of precocious blisspop, with its cheeky burbles of synths, its roughhousing-with-the-kids drums, and the intimate interplay between Hammel and Gardner’s vocals. ""I used to be wild!"" they exclaim to each other. ""I’m wild about you!"" The best thing about the song is that they don’t sound like they’re lamenting their mutual domestication, but celebrating it. They’d rather be tamed. On the very next song, however, they sound too tame—old and curmudgeonly even. ""Beautiful Kids"" is one of those songs that rails against the youngs and their selfie sticks and social medias while bemoaning the death of magazines and stuff. ""You’re always staring into cracked scenes,"" they accuse. ""You should stare into my eyes more."" They build a bridge out of dial tones and cash registers: ""you go click click click…"" It’s one of the most embarrassing musical passages of the year. By comparison, ""I Want to Run"" and ""Gonna Get It"" both play it safe, risking little by relying on that pop ebullience that comes suspiciously easy to them. Domesticity is one of the great undersung subjects in pop music. The immensity and excitement of new love has inspired countless tunes since forever, and the devastation and misery of dead love has inspired even more. But there are far fewer songs about love that endure and flourish from one comfortable day to the next, through anniversaries and birthdays, through kids and mortgages, through all the hard work that makes a marriage work. You’re Going to Make It makes life sound like one big bouncy castle of fun, and that unquestioned contentment renders Mates of State musically anonymous. By the time Gardner bares her soul on closer ""Sides of Boxes"", the gravity of the situation—her realization that her daughters will grow up and eventually leave—sounds incongruous and disjointed. ""It’s like a cannonball went through our home, you are almost fully grown,"" she sings as the song fades poignantly. It sounds like the start of a compelling album, not the end of an inert EP.","It’s been four years since the pop duo Mates of State released their sixth and most recent album, Mountaintops, though it feels like much longer. Their new EP, You’re Going to Make It, makes life sound like one big bouncy castle of fun.

Success,KEN mode,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae2ac0084474cd0c1853/1:1/w_160/04ca7638.jpg,2015-06-15 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20552-success/,Season of Mist,"Jesse Matthewson hopes you buy into his disgust and anger. During the nine tracks of his trio KEN mode’s sixth album, Success, the acerbic singer lashes out at rules of order, lambasts illusions of intimacy, and lampoons lives of day jobs and cubicle labor. During the slow, seething closer ""Dead Actors"", he asks when you last did something that mattered. But before you even have time to contemplate an answer, he cynically deadpans, ""Does any of it hold any weight?"" Actually, it doesn’t: For the first time, the once-great KEN mode sounds petulant and petty, a band whose irascible aesthetic has corroded into annoyance. On Success, they become the inverse of a futile party band telling an unresponsive crowd to move closer, to dance and have a little fun. Despite all of Matthewson’s rage, and despite some of the most memorable hooks of KEN mode’s career, his ire only ostracizes. Vitriol has been a consistent component of KEN mode’s discography for a dozen years, as one might expect for a band that took Henry Rollins’ ""Kill Everyone Now"" mantra as a name. During 2011’s Venerable, which earned a Juno Award, Matthewson dubbed religion a marketing scheme and blamed human frailty on social expectation. And on 2013’s Entrench, which netted both Juno and Polaris nominations, he scorned sentimentality, domestic dreams, and the ways online distractions forestall personal responsibility. In the past, however, Matthewson’s grievances worked as fuel for an explosive and dynamic group, capable of shifting between many manners of belligerence—hardcore and noise rock, death metal and post-punk, doom and drone—in an instant. All that movement shrouded Matthewson’s misanthropy, so the music suggested vague attitudes more than specific ideals. Those records were big, mad messes. But on Success, recorded in Winnipeg by fellow sourpuss Steve Albini, KEN mode drops most of that variety in favor of the kind of minimal, misanthropic noise rock for which the producer and his peers have long been known. Albini’s clarity as an engineer does them few favors. He pulls back the layers until Matthewson mostly delivers his harangues over a throbbing, blown-out rhythm section, sometimes adding astringent guitar when the chorus comes. The move leaves the listener to focus largely on the frontman’s spoken or screamed lyrics, consisting of not-so-nuanced thoughts on environmental apathy and lifelong depression. The yelled refrain of ""These Tight Jeans""—""Pointless negativity on demand""—becomes an ironic indictment of KEN mode itself. Unveiled and ineffectual, Matthewson’s gripes get boring quickly. The sense that you’ve heard these songs before—or at least their frameworks and tricks—doesn’t help. The speak-sing rise of ""Dead Actors"" suggests that Albini mailed KEN mode copies of 1000 Hurts and Spiderland and told them to connect the dots. With its jarring power-trio plod and hurled existential quandaries, ""A Catalog of Small Disappointments"" seems like a game of ""Show and Tell with Mr. Steve"", where the new pupils prove just how much they’ve paid attention. Matthewson’s back-and-forth volleys with Jill Clapham during ""These Tight Jeans"" are electrifying, but they seem as scripted and self-aware as the song’s high-wire guitar solo. They’re surefire ways to interrupt the surly, stomping bro-ness of the album at large. While ""The Owl"" gets tough on grunge, the brief, chomping ""I Just Liked Fire"" finds Matthewson doing his best David Yow yowl. (It is also, lo and behold, a song about fucking.) KEN mode’s best moments have been thrilling because they plucked the most invigorating pieces from many different sources and repurposed them with devilish glee. But Success sounds like they’ve spent a year or so stuck in the van, listening to little but a BitTorrent culled from the catalogues of SST, AmRep, Sub Pop, and Touch & Go. This old-school move feels, well, old and ornery. Over time, the constant needling and kvetching of a band like KEN mode creates a trap: Keep creating the same agitated, aggressive rock that’s already won awards, and run the risk of becoming the kind of bloated parody you’ve spent your career blasting. Or pivot to something new and potentially stumble in the process. On Success, KEN mode’s altered musical approach is the only thing more tiring than Matthewson’s broadsides. They’re ensnared by a decade of talking shit they’re no longer equipped to handle.","Vitriol has been a consistent component of KEN mode’s discography for a dozen years. On Success, recorded by Steve Albini, the Winnipeg trio drops most of the variety and award-winning ambition of their more recent outings in favor of minimal, misanthropic noise rock.

Lantern,Hudson Mohawke,by: Craig Jenkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aebcea9e61561daa6318/1:1/w_160/df819e95.jpg,2015-06-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20675-lantern/,Warp,"Over the last three years, Glaswegian producer Hudson Mohawke (born Ross Birchard) has made major headway infusing rap with new electronic textures both as one half of TNGHT with Canadian DJ Lunice and as a beatmaker in Kanye West’s G.O.O.D Music stable. But he doesn’t seem to want to be defined by his hip-hop dabbling anymore. Mohawke said as much in conversation with Pitchfork this spring, where he was reticent to even utter the word ""rap."" And so the guiding principle for Mohawke's sophomore album, Lantern, is to showcase his versatility. He’s been pecking away at the record since he got swept up into the Yeezus machine, and it feels like a conscious subversion of everything people might expect to hear from a guy with credits on Nothing Was the Same, My Name Is My Name, and I Am Not a Human Being II. For one, there aren’t any rappers on Lantern. It isn’t your typical producer's showcase, and our maestro doesn’t hide behind a parade of cleverly curated guest features. Only five of the album’s 14 songs bother with vocals at all, and the performers slide neatly into Hud Mo's vehicles, commanding attention as necessary but often hanging back in the mix, another paintbrush by the artist’s easel. Antony tiptoes around a napping lover on ""Indian Steps"", while Jhené Aiko mourns a doomed romance on ""Resistance"". Neither voice raises above a whisper as they bob gently over sparse, swirling arrangements. Lantern’s quieter tracks are broken up with moments of bedlam—Irfane’s helium-voiced lead on ""Very First Breath"" is the calming focal point in a disorienting array of bleating video game keys—and when it gets loud, the album's guest vocalists are terra firma underneath a pulverizing armada of synths. The album’s more ambitiously orchestrated sections are a rewarding new look for the producer. The widescreen majesty of ""Kettles"" and ""Scud Books"" fully realize a sound Mohawke hinted at years ago with cuts like ""Shower Melody"", off his 2009 Warp Records debut Butter. ""Kettles"" abandons the idea that Mohawke needs to make electronic music at all, opting for heart-swelling neoclassical instead, before ""Scud Books"" takes everything he tried on the previous song and crams it back into a trap cut. ""Lil Djembe"" picks up Eastern instruments and drops a conventional approach to melody for a two-and-a-half minute excursion that presents one of the few times here Mohawke’s ideas come off better on paper than in execution. Lantern’s risk-taking is daring and giddy, but its favored mode, and Hudson Mohawke’s best, is hooky, crowded, rap-conscious electropop. Lead single ""Ryderz"" employs an old trick from Mohawke’s benefactor Mr. West—overlaying a sped-up soul sample with syrupy embellishments —to heart-busting success. ""Shadows"" assembles an army of 8-bit synths, then runs them through a quick, showy drop for a cheap but mercenary thrill. The album’s closing stretch plays sneaky games with pace. ""Portrait of Luci""’s much-needed breather quickly proves to be a fake-out; ""System"" follows, combining manic keys and a pulsating, insistent kick drum for the album’s most conventionally clubby indulgence before ""Brand New World"" closes things out at half the speed, loud, ratty guitar in tow like an homage to the overdriven brat pop of Sleigh Bells. Hudson Mohawke became an EDM circuit sensation sort of by accident three years ago with the success of TNGHT, and he spent the year after that with his hand in a number of 2013’s biggest rap releases. But Lantern finds him wisely darting outside both scenes before anyone gets a chance to pigeonhole him. Scores of great producers settle quickly into an identifiable sound after a big break and proceed to churn out variations on the same song until the calls stop coming. But Mohawke’s puckish eagerness to try new things when the most eyes are trained on him suggests he’s thinking past his next move to the one after that. A less talented hand might’ve faltered juggling six different genres as Mohawke does throughout Lantern, but his knowledge of what gets a crowd moving, coupled with his good cheer in both playing directly to it and coyly holding back as he pleases help keep the album’s experiments a minimum of fun and danceable, but more often shocking and delightful.","Glaswegian producer Hudson Mohawke has made major headway infusing rap with new electronic textures both as one half of TNGHT and as a beatmaker in Kanye West’s G.O.O.D Music stable.

The Fool,Ryn Weaver,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae8d5e6ef95969321c81/1:1/w_160/9ec88368.png,2015-06-12 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20641-the-fool/,InterscopeMad Love,"In 2014 it felt like a major shift in the pop zeitgeist was finally taking hold. The barrier between Top 40 radio and the avant-garde was crumbling. Superstars like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé aggressively asserted their autonomy as artists and a new crop of pop stars, like FKA twigs, launched sorties on the pop charts from small clubs and social media platforms. It seemed reasonable to believe we were coming into a new age where pop stars (especially female ones) could be taken seriously, rather than considered witless dupes of corporate machines. It was a great time for Ryn Weaver to release her first single, ""OctaHate"", which has racked up millions of plays and even crossed over onto some of Billboard’s edgier charts since she posted it to SoundCloud just over a year ago. Though social-media endorsements by new-wave pop stars Jessie Ware, Hayley Williams, and Charli XCX (who co-wrote it) gave the song a boost, as did the name-brand production from Benny Blanco, Cashmere Cat, and Passion Pit’s Michael Angelakos, its success rests on Weaver’s ability to deliver a convincingly growly performance on the Beyoncé-esque verses and give soaring wings to the surprisingly headbangable EDM-metal chorus. But it turns out that the new kind of pop artist has some of the same problems as the old kind when it comes to figuring out how to follow up on a breakout first single. In fact, there’s nothing on Weaver’s debut album, The Fool, that comes close to matching the intense pop rush of ""OctaHate"". That’s not a terminal problem in and of itself. Plenty of great pop stars—Lorde and Rihanna being two notable examples—have dropped stunning first singles followed months later by albums full of songs that aren’t as good, then gone on to successful and even critically-acclaimed careers. The difference is that Lorde and Rihanna’s records took what listeners responded to in the singles—the persona of the precociously world-weary Kanye fan, the party girl with the slightly aggressive wild streak—and filled them out into a complete identity, while The Fool doesn’t seem to know what to do with ""OctaHate""’s momentum. The single introduced us to an artist who could confidently weave between glitchy bubblegum and pounding EDM thrash while delivering a gutsy, emotive performance that deftly plucked at the heartstrings. On the album, Weaver can’t seem to figure out who she is. For half of it, she aims for Lorde-ish post-rap electronic minimalism, on the other for stomping Mumford-style folk-pop. These are disparate, well-trampled sounds that don’t generate any fresh sparks when brought together. Spreading out that way could have been intended as a way to show off Weaver’s range, but it feels more like waffling, like neither she nor Blanco and Angelakos (who produced and co-wrote the album) could figure out whether to position her as a slightly angsty postmodern pop queen or a touchably warm and organic contemporary folkster, and instead decided to pursue both incompatible styles at once, fingers crossed that one of them panned out. Even Weaver’s vocal performance is hesitant throughout, adding to an overall feeling of unsureness that clashes with ""OctaHate""’s bracing, glitched-up confidence. Unfortunately, the few points where the album actually comes together, like the disco-dusted ""Sail On"" and the California country ballad ""Here Is Home"", aren’t enough to make it stand out in an increasingly crowded field. Weaver’s benefitted greatly from the rising tide of artists who are challenging pop’s sonic and structural rules, but on The Fool she sounds like she’s lost at sea.","Ryn Weaver's first single, ""OctaHate"", which she co-wrote with Charli XCX, has racked up millions of plays since she posted it to SoundCloud just over a year ago.

Basictonalvocabulary / Balance / Force + Form,Surgeon,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae79ea9e61561daa62a9/1:1/w_160/662c3c20.jpg,2015-06-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20625-basictonalvocabulary-balance-force-form/,TresorTresor,"In the annals of underground musicians rubbing shoulders with the mainstream, Surgeon's opening sets for Lady Gaga late last year stand out. They do so less for what they portend—""I don’t think it’s the beginning of any connection between pop and techno,"" Surgeon (UK producer Anthony Child) said in an interview about the dates—than for how they highlight the enduring allure of Child's aggressive, peculiar mix of techno, industrial, and noise music. The gigs, which saw Child—bookish, dutiful—fiddling with his modular synthesizer in packed arenas, were the result of Gaga collaborator/opening act Lady Starlight praising him during a gig in Birmingham, near his hometown. His presence on two subsequent ArtRave tour stops proves there are very different methods of honoring that concatenation. Then again, Child's profile has always seemed somewhat outsized for a noisy techno artist from a Midlands town. He's probably been labelled ""techno don"" or ""techno kingpin"" more than any other artist: There's something authoritative and presidential about his work, which seems to appease both the jocks (hedonistic party children) and the nerds (noiseniks and gadget fiddlers). His three best albums, as well as a spate of early singles, are seeing re-release at a time when his influence has once again become apparent. Over the last three or so years Child has helped usher in a new generation of clamorous British techno, serving as an inspiration to labels like Perc Trax and Avian, and to artists like Untold, Truss, and Blawan (with whom Child collaborates as Trade). Child released his early work on the venerable Birmingham label Downwards, the archetype for all grimy, industrial-leaning British dance music. His music—and that of peers like Female and label boss Regis—steered itself far from rave's chirpy maximalism. Nor did it feature jungle's dizzying fusion: this was music from the hinterlands, far removed from London's electric unions. Child's music took inspiration from nuanced, brave sources—noisy innovators like Throbbing Gristle, electronic body music extremists like Skinny Puppy—and channeled them into hammer-on-nail immediacy. While the music of Child and Downwards couldn't have existed without Detroit pioneers Jeff Mills and Robert Hood, it also represents a philosophical break from them. The Detroit producers, with their lofty artistic rhetoric and sci-fi imagery, sought escape; what Child et al. offered was simple, punishing release, most likely from boredom. Detroit trusted that the music would take them higher; Birmingham didn't trust shit. But the music—pounding, abrasive, gritty—sounded great in dingy little clubs, and, when Europe turned those clubs into giant concrete halls, it sounded great there, too. Legendary Berlin label Tresor snatched up Child, and it's for them that he released his three best albums: Basictonalvocabulary, Balance, and Force + Form. Child excelled at the full-length album the way few of his peers did, using them to stretch his compositional legs while injecting weird little interludes and noise passages; it's on these records that his reverence for artists like Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle really shows. Berlin is where the Detroit techno sound calcified, and it's only in the light of the unadorned, brutalist music the city embraced that an album like 1997's Basictonalvocabulary can sound so festooned and enthusiastic. On first listen, Basictonalvocabulary is so hurried that it's almost stressful to listen to. Songs open with quick little riffs like they've been released out of the starting gate. Several of them, such as the influence-betraying ""Krautrock"", sound like Robert Hood's carnivalesque ""Unix"" run through an un-synced delay pedal, with the sounds doubling back and crashing into one another. Only after a few listens do you get comfortable with all the interlocking pieces of a song like ""9 Hours into the Future"", or ""Rotunda""'s breach of the four-on-the-floor cage. Balance, from 1998 and somewhat ironically, is the album where Child can't quite resolve all his interests. It doesn't push quite as hard, or as playfully, as Basictonalvocabulary, sounding muddied as it loses itself in too-long, formless sketches like ""Dialogue"". On 1999's Force + Form—two concepts close to Child's heart—his craft caught up with his vision. Comprising four long, evolving tracks (the shortest is nearly nine minutes), Force + Form flutters and jabs before throwing its punches, earning its noisy, formless codas only after extended bouts of aggression. The final track, ""At the Heart of It All"", is probably the most euphoric piece Child has ever put to tape, and the effect is a great gasp of air after a long period below surface. It's as immersive and structurally thrilling as longform techno gets. Child has been continuously active (a singles overview is long overdue) since Force + Form, his last album for Tresor, but he's mostly backed away from the LP format. As he primes for what seems like a period of renewed creativity it's instructive to revisit these albums, especially as a new generation of British misfits discover techno can be a fertile ground for exploring disparate styles (dubstep, drum & bass, ambient, noise). Child is an unlikely shepherd, but then the strength of his music has been thrusting him to unexpected places for more than two decades.","As Surgeon, UK producer Anthony Child composes an aggressive, peculiar mix of techno, industrial music, and noise. His three best albums, 1997's Basictonalvocabulary, 1998's Balance, and 1999's Force + Form, are seeing re-release at a time when his influence has become apparent in a new generation of misfits.

Touch Down 2 Cause Hell,Boosie Badazz,by: Ernest Wilkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeb6b1335d7bf1699e0b/1:1/w_160/ddf6e7b8.png,2015-06-12 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20670-touch-down-2-cause-hell/,AtlanticTrill Entertainment,"Torrence ""Boosie Badazz"" Hatch is a Southern rap legend. Everyone seeking to understand the current rap landscape should know this. After his cousin Young Bleed (yup, the ""How Ya Do Dat"" Young Bleed of No Limit Records fame) helped him sign with the late Pimp C's Trill Entertainment in 2001, Boosie released a series of mixtapes and albums that set his career on fire. Through the combination of his unique voice (imagine a frog on helium getting bear-hugged by a bodybuilder), his gargantuan output, his so-raw-it's-kinda-uncomfortable level of honesty, and his never-ending traditional chitlin' circuit tour of small town clubs and hood spots, he amassed the (some would say blasphemous) moniker of the ""Tupac of the South."" His legacy is heard in everyone from Meek Mill to Starlito to fellow Baton Rouge resident Kevin Gates, despite being only 32 years of age. This is the man who helped popularize the term ""ratchet"", for God's sake. (Seahawks fans, take note: He's also responsible for making ""Beast Mode"" a thing, a fact that Marshawn Lynch readily admits.) Boosie went to jail in 2010 facing first-degree murder and conspiracy charges, and after a brief fear that he might be sentenced to death, he finished up his sentence early last year. He returned to a new world, where mundane things like iPhone tech seemed foreign and new. After his Life After Deathrow mixtape in October, he's back with his sixth studio album, a new deal with Atlantic Records, and a renewed vigor. A rapper with that pedigree could have phoned in this record, content to rest on his reputation. Instead, Touch Down 2 Cause Hell is unremittingly intense from the cover image to the sharpened guest appearances. The established stars who appear on this record—T.I., Jeezy, and Rick Ross—manage to sound better than they have in years (""Spoil You"", ""Mercy on My Soul"" and ""Drop Top Music"", respectively), all flawlessly executing that whole effortlessly charismatic ""I'm happy, sex is pretty nice, and money is great"" thing that they do. Boosie also scores appearances from younger voices like J. Cole, Young Thug, and Rich Homie Quan (aka The Artists Formerly Known as Rich Gang) who all appear, with middling results. Not surprisingly, longtime collaborator and former Trill Ent. labelmate Webbie appears, and listeners new to Boosie can get a taste of their raunchy chemistry, which powered projects like 2003's classic album Ghetto Stories and street hits like ""On That Level"". In a way, the album plays out like a classic gangster-movie script. A man serves some time, comes home, and proceeds to restore his world to the way things were before he went away. Boosie jumps in with vigor, opening the album with a brief ""Minor setback for a major comeback"" line before absolutely rapping his ass off on the Black Metaphor-produced ""Intro - Get 'Em Boosie"". After the reintroduction, he lays waste to the pretenders who have popped up while he was in jail (on ""No Juice"" and ""Hip Hop Hooray""), laments those who are no longer here (on the Keyshia Cole-assisted ""Black Heaven""), opines on love (""She Don't Love Me""), and even manages to have some fun. For the most part, though, it's all business. The record isn't the home run Boosie probably needs. It could stand to be trimmed a bit and while the producers—a mostly solid lineup of London on Da Track, Kane Beatz, J Reid and fellow Louisianans Kenoe (Nicki's ""Beez in the Trap"") and Mouse on tha Track (the longtime Boosie/Webbie collaborator who made ""Wipe Me Down"")—all put in decent work, nothing leaps out or creates any urgency, which is troubling since the last thing Boosie—a man who managed to avoid the popular-sound ambulance chase that comes with a long-term major rap career— wants to do after so many years away is waste any time.","The Baton Rouge-based rapper Boosie returns from a jail sentence he began in 2010 with a new deal with Atlantic and his sixth studio album.

Parlay EP,Galcher Lustwerk,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae99b1335d7bf1699dd7/1:1/w_160/f1139ba5.jpg,2015-06-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20650-parlay-ep/,Lustwerk Music,"Perhaps more than any other quality, a sense of restraint characterizes the music of Galcher Lustwerk. His dusky deep house withholds more than it reveals; it's given to minor keys and downy textures overlaid with his own sparse, impressionistic rapping—if ""rapping"" is even the right word for a style of vocalization that could almost be mistaken for talking in his sleep. Above all, the music never complicates itself unnecessarily. Why use two elements where one would do? For that matter, why use one where none would do? Forget less-is-more; his approach seems more like less-is-just-enough. The same goes for the Cleveland-born, Brooklyn-based producer's release strategy. Ever since he emerged, in 2013, with 100% Galcher, a free, downloadable mixtape of original productions for the Blowing Up the Workshop series, he's courted a fair amount of attention from fans of underground house music, certainly more than you might expect for a virtually unknown artist and a mixtape with zero promotion behind it. Many musicians in his position, it's safe to say, would have been happy to be courted by labels, happier still to sign on the dotted line. Lustwerk didn't, though. He put out an EP on Tsuba Records and self-released a downloadable mini-LP under the alias Road Hog, and he played some gigs, but aside from those trial balloons, he kept a low profile. Now, more than two years after 100% Galcher blew up Blowing Up the Workshop's servers, he's finally returned to releasing music, and he's doing it, once again, 100% Galcher. As he recently explained to Juno Plus, he met with labels about putting out the material featured on the mixtape, but ""things weren't clear enough for me. I had a lot of unanswered questions. I decided that I would get the most personal experience (and also the most money) by releasing them myself."" The Parlay EP's three tracks (the fourth is an instrumental mix of the title track) were all featured in the mixtape, but they sound ever so slightly better here: shinier, crisper, more enveloping. That might be explained, in part, by the fact that he was forced to remake them when his computer crashed shortly after he uploaded the mix. For all their outward similarities—the scratchy, unadorned drum-machine patterns, softly glowing chords, and gruffly muttered vocals—it's striking how much variety Lustwerk gets out of such a tightly focused style. ""Parlay"", with its steady groove and references to rocking the drop-top, is all about the pleasures of the open road. Not a lot happens, besides a few sparkling notes in the upper register; a single chord flickers, unchanging, like a highway mirage. But nothing has to happen; it's hypnotic enough as it is. More variation is built into ""Dockside"", in which a handful of chords vamp around a two-note figure that threads the track from end to end. For the chorus, if you can call it that, Lustwerk's voice slips into a sing-speaking cadence with the faintest suggestion of dancehall reggae, and it's exciting to hear him testing the possibilities within the narrow limits of his preferred style. ""Kaint"" is the most harmonically rich of the three—two chords in the right hand flutter against a three-note bassline—but it's also the most vaporous. The synths are the color and consistency of a Campari and soda, and the only percussion is a lone lawn-sprinkler hi-hat flicking back and forth. There is no kick drum. It falls to the bassline to serve as an anchor—and to Lustwerk's own baritone, which occasionally murmurs, ""Remember?"" as though he had just been stirred from a daydream. The song's oddest feature is a wordless grunt, looped in time with the music and buried almost inaudibly deep in the mix. In ""Parlay"", there's a similar sense of disturbance beneath the surface, in the form of a noisy, metallic filigree that curls around the beat. Even Lustwerk's restraint doesn't stop him from indulging a fondness for odd details, and it's in the tension between those two urges that his music really shines.","Galcher Lustwerk's deep house is given to minor keys and downy textures overlaid with his own sparse, impressionistic rapping.

FFS,FFS,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeac13d197565213a14f/1:1/w_160/4c67ff5b.jpg,2015-06-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20665-ffs/,Domino,"Franz Ferdinand and Sparks initially floated the idea of working together in 2004, following the release of the former band's first album, which went platinum, and the latter band's 19th, which didn't chart. Sparks' Ron Mael responded by sending Franz Ferdinand a demo for a song called ""Piss Off"". But Sparks are nothing if not ironists, and both bands are long-haulers, and at some point they finally got it together to make an album together, under a name you wouldn't guess would naturally occur to the sixty-something Mael brothers. Appropriately, the first public sign of their collaboration came when Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos joined Sparks for the latter's ""When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'"" on stage a few months ago. As much as FFS' members have been going on about how everyone made concessions to the partnership, in practice this is effectively a Sparks record with a particularly sharp, focused backing band. That's something they've needed for a long time, despite how much fun the Maels' unaccompanied ""Two Hands, One Mouth"" tour was. The central lyrical topic is Ron Mael's favorite subject, the gross stupidity of masculinity; the musical hooks are mostly Sparksian rather than Franzian. Every song is also, to one extent or another, a vocal duet between Russell Mael and Kapranos. The former's demi-operatic falsetto and pinpoint enunciation are the focal point of his band's arrangements, and the latter's crisp baritone has generally blended in with his group's sound, so their dynamic's not too even either. ""Even"" isn't what's called for here, though, and they know it: the longest and most elaborate track is a suite called ""Collaborations Don't Work"". ""Warhol didn't need to ask De Kooning 'bout art/ Frank Lloyd Wright always ate à la carte,"" Kapranos growls, before Russell Mael joins him with an ionospheric harmony: ""Wish I'd been that smart"". Indeed, FFS doesn't always work—the album's middle section keeps falling into the latter-day Sparks snare of hitting on some clever phrase (""the man without a tan,"" ""the power couple's coming around"") and repeating it until it's certain that everyone's gotten the point. And the chemistry between the two bands isn't so perfect that a second collaborative album would be preferable to whatever either of them has up its sleeve next. When FFS does click, though, it's a little delight. That initial song Ron Mael contributed, ""Piss Off"", instantly earns its place on the next Sparks greatest-hits collection: it's a jaunty, lyrically withering rocker of the sort they used to crank out in the '70s. The airy, buzzing funk of ""Call Girl"" (hook: ""why don't you call, girl"") is the kind of thing Franz Ferdinand do exceptionally well, although lyrics like ""I gave up blow and Adderall for you/ So I'd have dough and spend it all on you"" have Sparks' fingerprints all over them. This is not a meeting of equals, and it doesn't have to be. It's a marquee-name band throwing their weight behind a cult act that clearly inspired them—and the cult act showing who's really in charge.","Franz Ferdinand and cult band Sparks have toyed with making a collaborative album for years.

Glass Piano,Bruce Brubaker,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeb8b1335d7bf1699e0f/1:1/w_160/5b629bd3.jpg,2015-06-11 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20672-glass-piano/,Infiné,"Bruce Brubaker is one of the most exciting pianists in the contemporary American classical scene. Beyond his formidable chops, which speak for themselves, he excels as a curator, a role that classical soloists are increasingly expected to fill. Along with Ursula Oppens, Brubaker executed that role fabulously on the 2014 ECM album Piano Songs, which contained two-piano arrangements of pieces by the great New York composer Meredith Monk (whose work is usually heard sung, often with accompaniment on one piano). Those performances were faithful to the source material, but also visionary—a new way ""in"" to music written by an icon whose work was a key part of the 1970s New York scene. In that light, it's easy to skim the release details of Glass Piano, Brubaker’s new album of piano pieces by another New York icon, Philip Glass, and think it's a little too obvious. Glass Piano mostly repeats the program of the composer’s own Solo Piano album, from 1989. On account of that recording’s major-label distribution (and its decades of popularity), its contents—including ""Mad Rush"", the five-part ""Metamorphosis"", and ""Wichita Vortex Sutra""—amount to some of the most famous Glass compositions. These are often the only pieces a casual listener will know from Glass’s large body of work (which is more diverse than is often understood). So far this year, I count two other major releases covering almost all these same items. Plus, Brubaker has already recorded a version of ""Wichita"" on a previous album, Hope Street Tunnel Blues. Novelty isn’t everything—but that’s a lot of competition to invite (including against oneself). Even when stacked against these odds, two of his latest readings distinguish themselves brilliantly. Instead of turning ""Mad Rush"" into the 16-minute barnstorm of arpeggios that its title suggests, Brubaker inserts pregnant pauses throughout, and pushes the soft-then-loud dynamics to extremes. (His performance is also noticeably longer than Glass’s, on Solo Piano.) At the three-minute mark, when the pianist reaches a pivot point in the score where each hand diverges from the middle of the keyboard, the transition feels grander and more consequential than in other recordings. Instead of a slight turn on a steady highway, the moment feels like tipping over a waterfall’s ledge. Even better is Brubaker’s new version of ""Wichita Vortex Sutra"", which closes Glass Piano. The title of Glass’s piece comes from a poem by his late friend Allen Ginsberg. On their collaborative album Hydrogen Jukebox, Ginsberg recited a portion of what has been described as ""the last antiwar poem"" over Glass’s playing. For that expanded context alone, the Glass-Ginsberg duo rendition will always be a milestone. But Brubaker's version here feels exuberant and visionary, in line with the mystic rapture of Ginsberg’s loftiest stanzas in the poem. The way Glass’s quieter motifs motor along here seems like an acknowledgement of the modernity-blues that Ginsberg’s poem also evokes (""the honkytonk tinkle/ of a city piano/ to calm the nerves of taxpaying housewives of a Sunday morn""). Inevitably, Brubaker’s accomplishments at the beginning and end of the album draw attention to the lesser moments in between them. The pianist’s version of the lengthy ""Metamorphosis"" is fine, even crisp, but it doesn’t contain all that much in the way of insight or surprise. Likewise, a reading of a ""Knee Play"" from the opera Einstein on the Beach makes for a fun interlude, though it’s not essential. Still, while Glass’s hardcore fans might find themselves more enticed by fresh recordings of rarer pieces (such as Gidon Kremer’s new CD dominated by Glass’s Violin Concerto No. 2), they shouldn’t dismiss Glass Piano just because they think they know what they're getting.","On Glass Piano, pianist Bruce Brubaker takes on some of the most well-known compositions by the iconic minimalist composer Philip Glass. While the pieces chosen are obvious, Brubaker finds surprsing new life in some of them, turning them into revelatory listens even for Glass fanatics.

Wild Nights,PINS,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae45b1335d7bf1699d45/1:1/w_160/984d71be.jpg,2015-06-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20577-wild-nights/,Bella Union,"""What will we do, what will we do, what will we do when our dreams come true?"" asks Faith Holgate in the middle of ""Young Girls"", from PINS' second album. The garage foursome hails from Manchester, a city whose post-industrial malaise is as famous for feeding its native bands' romanticized melancholy as it is for the textile industry that built it. While railing against your environment is stultifying, Holgate suggests (""Sick for days watching the rain/ Everybody looks the same""), that frustration is useful for the way it stokes rebellion and keeps imaginations hungry. It's punk 101, though not a lesson that Wild Nights heeds: its 11 songs betray little trace of insurrection or fantasy, nor PINS' bold presence in the UK indie scene. PINS went out to Joshua Tree's Rancho de la Luna to record the follow-up to 2013's Girls Like Us with Eagles of Death Metal's Dave Catching. Despite being over 5000 miles from home, their attempt at making desert rock still sounds ferociously pedestrian. In almost every song, Lois McDonald's guitar lumbers over droning organ, and their collective dead-eyed girl-gang vocals hew rigidly to bassist Anna Donigan and drummer Sophie Galpin's unadventurous rhythm section, stripping away their debut's accented identity and self-produced scrappiness. ""Young Girls"" and ""Dazed By You"" have a little more surf-pop pep—the latter spiraling somewhere appealingly chaotic in its final minutes—but the lyrics are devoid of action or joy. ""The best comes to those who wait/ I'm waiting, yes I'll wait,"" Holgate sings on ""Dazed"", which appears to be about being bored on a plane. Wild Nights' drab sound might have been saved if the lyrics had some life to them. As it stands, the rhyme schemes sound indebted to Manchester's most famous son (""Glittered eyes like butterflies/ Yesterday so far away/ Sunday morning it's all distorting,"" goes opener ""Baby Bhangs"") and the total passivity is maddening. No-good boys are tolerated, girls look best when they're sad/bad, and indecision begets numbness and solitude. There's finally a little action on the rushing ""Oh Lord"", about a tryst with a stranger, but somehow they manage to completely smother any sense of danger or high-stakes: ""He didn't know who I was/ I was a girl looking for love"" feels like characterization that wouldn't even pass muster in the fanfic community. When PINS released the video for lead single ""Too Little Too Late"", they said that the lyrics ""spewed out like hot lava from an angry volcano."" The cool result (remember the Duke Spirit?) doesn't match their pitch—it's a tale of infatuation gone sour that climaxes in a painfully weak ultimatum: ""Yeah, you said you said you're sorry but I've heard it all before/ Yeah, you said you're sorry, but are you sure?"" In a post-""Girls""/Cat Marnell age where messy female expression is such a marketable commodity—confession as currency, struggle as legitimacy—perhaps there's something faintly rebellious about PINS withholding emotional depth (while calling the record Wild Nights!). That's probably a stretch, though: their writing comes off as hesitant rather than any particular aesthetic choice. However, Wild Nights' standout song makes a virtue of that hesitation, and in doing so, reveals a trace of inner life. Curdled '60s hand-clapper ""If Only"" is the only number that doesn't feature a ""you"", only ""I"", and Holgate conveys her isolation and awkwardness in the simplest terms: ""Most of the time I feel wrong/ Like I am no one/ I get so lost/ I want it all to stop."" It's the briefest glimpse of promise. PINS has become a halfway-notable British indie band (in domestic terms) because of their industriousness: they run their own label, HAUS OF PINS, and gig relentlessly, whether on their own small tours, or as the opening act for Sleater-Kinney, Babes in Toyland, and Drenge. If they've more like ""If Only"" in them, they might stand a chance of becoming more than perpetual supporting players.","The UK foursome Pins run their own label, book their own small tours, and have opened for Sleater-Kinney, Babes in Toyland, and others. But on their pedestrian and hesitant second album, they fail to match their industriousness with music that reflects their standing.

Sounding Lines,Moritz Von Oswald Trio,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeba5e6ef95969321cbf/1:1/w_160/e3e621dd.jpeg,2015-06-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20674-sounding-lines/,Honest Jon's,"Moritz Von Oswald has an acute ear for rhythm and an oblique way of expressing it. A percussionist by training, he’s been subverting techno’s omnipresent thump since the early '90s, when he was one half of the Berlin duo Basic Channel and the four-on-the-floor beat’s primacy still remained largely unchallenged. Over the years his beats have grown even subtler as he’s figured out ways to maintain techno’s propulsive needs without falling back on its tropes, and connected it to styles like dub in an attempt to create some sort of abstract, weightlessly chill sonic space. One of Von Oswald’s favorite tricks is to take the heavy workload that in techno tracks usually falls on the kick drum and redistribute it across the few other instruments in his typically high-minimalist compositions. An inspired sonic engineer, he often enlists keyboard licks or delay effects to carry more rhythmic weight than usual, and as a result his compositions are urgent and danceable but rarely revolve around a 4/4 kick. Von Oswald’s found an ideal partner in master drummer Tony Allen, who’s been creating trance-inducing works that duck and dive around the beat since his days as Fela’s chief rhythmic architect. Allen’s recently joined Von Oswald and modular synth guru Max Loderbauer in Von Oswald’s namesake trio, taking over for Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti (aka Vladislav Delay) on drums, and their first album together shows that the group’s quickly cohered into something interesting. The addition of a superstar collaborator, along with S**ounding Lines’ open-ended arrangements and tracks that are numbered instead of named, all suggest the kind of high-powered jam session that usually sounds better on paper than on record, but Allen, Von Oswald, and Loderbauer work well together. Their playing has a loose, improvisatory feel but a strong sense of purpose. Even when they stretch a groove out toward the 10-minute mark they maintain the cohesiveness of a good jazz combo. Jazz has become one of the Trio’s touchstones, or at least it’s made itself more present on Sounding Lines than on earlier recordings. Clearly a lot of that influence comes from Allen, whose expressive style has its roots in Art Blakey and Max Roach’s frenetic but focused performances. The album opener ""1"" starts out centered around a happily burbling synth bass line, but Allen’s hi-hat takes the lead for a sizable chunk of the track’s 10 minutes, and his bop-inspired playing is so expressive and so casually virtuosic–and Loderbauer and Von Oswald’s backup is so judiciously minimal–that he easily pulls it off. Elsewhere the group brings some of its other influences to the front, to varying effect. On ""4"" they fully indulge their dub sides, and the resulting track works better when you let yourself get caught up in its gently wafting mood than if you focus in on what it’s actually doing. ""7"", on the other hand, dives headfirst into '70s jazz funk with a cheeky clavinet riff and greasy hi-hats, and manages to strip away the decades of kitsch that those signifiers have accumulated, rediscovering an unexpected vibrancy lurking underneath. At its best moments, Sounding Lines drifts in an intriguingly ambiguous space where each member invokes the genres they’re best known for playing while bending generously to accommodate their partners—Von Oswald bringing out his underutilized funky side, Allen using his inimitable Afrobeat style to sculpt a techno beat in negative space, and Loderbauer washing the whole thing in warm ambience. The three showcase a strong and singular shared vision, and in the moments where the music pulls you in deep enough to share it with them, it’s a beautiful thing.","A percussionist by training, Moritz Von Oswald has been subverting techno’s omnipresent thump since the early 1990s.

Restless Ones,Heartless Bastards,by: Tess Duncan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aec5b1335d7bf1699e27/1:1/w_160/3ad61d82.jpg,2015-06-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20683-restless-ones/,PartisanDine Alone,"When it comes to live shows, Heartless Bastards bassist Jesse Ebaugh has said he wants nothing less than what he calls ""rock'n'roll communion."" With their fifth studio album, it's safe to bet that the quartet will have little trouble eliciting an energy of '70s-era Thin Lizzy proportions. Erika Wennerstrom has always possessed the kind of powerhouse vocals that electrify a crowd, and the atmosphere of Restless Ones lives up to that intensity. Heartless Bastards' previous releases tackled classic country themes—lonesomeness, wanderlust—and their new record is no different. ""Eastern Wind"" is the prime road trip anthem, though, and maybe the most well-constructed track. It's a twangy rock'n'roll song that dips into psych rock when thunderous solos and percussion attacks feel that they might take over. But Heartless Bastards know when to rein it in, and the song's structure stays intact. This is more than can be said for ""Journey"", which is burdened by unwieldy layers of clashing guitars. The latter also contains some of the album's weakest lyrics (""Oh now it's suddenly clear/ The journey is the destination""). Wennerstrom's voice is just as exquisitely engaging in its world-weary twang as always. There are a few lines that err on the cheesy side, but hearing her moan lines like ""I'm an open wound"" among twinkling strings on ""The Fool"" makes it easier to forgive them. Her most rewarding songwriting is found on honky-tonk ballad ""Pocket Full of Thirst"", when she wistfully croons, ""I set myself on fire/ And I jumped into the lake/ Disguised myself as someone else/ So you could not break me."" Wennerstrom is a blues singer through and through, soaking up as much heartache as she can bear, and the track is a refreshing break from the jumble of competing guitars on the rest of the album. Restless Ones establishes Heartless Bastards as a straightforward arena-rock band, one that's grown more refined with time. The production value shows, which works for and against them simultaneously. Fans of their original lo-fi, garage-rock approach will be disappointed to find that even the grittier guitars sound pristine and polished. But this is a band that was born to be heard via massive, blaring speakers, using their colossal sound to fill every corner of a cavernous stadium. In that respect, it's hard to begrudge them for fulfilling their destiny.","Restless Ones establishes Heartless Bastards as a straightforward arena-rock band, one that's grown more refined with time.

I Don't Want to Let You Down EP,Sharon Van Etten,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae44c0084474cd0c1886/1:1/w_160/c83bf781.jpg,2015-06-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20576-sharon-van-etten-i-dont-want-to-let-you-down-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"Once you’ve told someone, ""I don’t want to let you down,"" there’s really no going back, is there? You know that you have or that you soon will, that something irrevocable has already come to pass. When Sharon Van Etten released 2014’s Are We There, she talked about the imperiled 10-year relationship it documented in the present tense—though lines like ""burn my skin so I can’t feel you"" didn’t offer much hope for its recovery. In a recent NPR discussion about her new EP, the 34-year-old songwriter said of its subject, ""It’s someone I still care about but don’t speak with any more."" I Don’t Want to Let You Down comes from the Are We There sessions, but contains few of that record’s naked declarations: I love you but I’m lost. Your love is killing me. Nothing will change. Whether by design or just the nature of album off-cuts, these four songs (plus a live rendition of ""Tell Me"", from the Tramp era) are messier things that fit the unclean nature of long-term severance. For Van Etten to tell NPR, ""I’m not very good at communicating my emotions,"" might seem like a huge joke: few singer-songwriters have cut to the quick as brutally as she has over her four studio albums. But processing feelings on paper is different than knowing what to say to someone’s face. ""I Don’t Want to Let You Down"" zooms into that moment of pause before you hurt someone with hasty words: ""Decompress and calm your head/ Teach you not to rush/ Turn them out, to see your words/ Trust me, stay and stay."" Despite all her best intentions, the accusations of abandonment and betrayal come fast on ""Just Like Blood"". At the start, her verses about drowning and reaching are blurred and hard to pick out, but over trembling church organ and warm strings, she reaches a defiant, unequivocal peak. Van Etten has never been shy about letting listeners hear her works-in-progress—the bonus reissue of Tramp came with the entire album in demo form, and there’s no end of rarities and alternate versions of her songs around for those who care to look. This EP was released to herald her inaugural South American tour, and contains songs that didn't make Are We There. Obviously, it’s not her strongest work. The title track is a bit of a thrumming plodder, and the choruses often repeat a single phrase. Her knack for expressive, muscular phrasing pushes them into interesting, sometimes challenging places, but they feel a little unrefined. However, ""I Always Fall Apart"" is a gorgeous piano ballad that was likely left off Are We There in place of the equally Leonard Cohen-like ""I Love You But I’m Lost"", but which works as a proud coda to its counterpart’s anxious panic. ""It’s not my fault,"" she sings of the way she falls to pieces. ""It’s just my flaw/ It’s who I am."" I Don’t Want to Let You Down may be a stopgap release, but there’s a crucial moment in Van Etten’s songwriting nestled towards the end. ""Pay My Debts"" is one of her classic slow-burns, but with an unusually grave synthetic palette. On Tramp, she repeatedly begged that someone take her seriously, trying to convince them—and probably herself in turn—of the self-assured woman behind her words. Van Etten has been frank about the fact that she ultimately chose her career over her relationship, and on ""Pay My Debts"", in a calm moment amidst the turmoil, she claims the only thing worth keeping from the aftermath: ""I know myself better than you do.""","The I Don’t Want to Let You Down EP was released to herald Sharon Van Etten's inaugural South American tour, and contains four songs that didn't make her Are We There LP. They contain few of that record's naked declarations, instead focusing on smaller, messier moments of a long-term breakup.

Weird Prayer,Sweet John Bloom,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acbc5e6ef9596932197d/1:1/w_160/b2bd8371.jpg,2015-06-10 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20291-weird-prayer/,Tiny Engines,"Massachusetts is one of the few geographic signifiers that still holds real significance when describing what an indie rock band sounds like in 2015. And that's because the Bay State breakout acts of late sound like, well, actual indie rock. There are instantly identifiable '90s precedents for Speedy Ortiz's acerbic pop quizzes, the Hotelier's strident anarcho-punk, the confrontation of Pile and Krill, the downer fuzz of California X. But even though they're all from collegiate environs and feature guitar-heavy setups, don't call them ""college rock""—the politics of each strongly suggest they don't long for the days when that economically and racially loaded term was used. All of which makes the lack of information regarding Sweet John Bloom actually helpful. They let you know right up front that they're a Massachusetts indie rock band comprised of members from a few other Massachusetts indie rock bands, and little else. But that's all you really need to know going in. Their second LP Weird Prayer takes one of those ""What '90s Group Are You?"" quizzes and somehow gets ""all of the above."" Well, ""all of the above"" over the span of about 35 minutes, not at the same time. ""I think I'm breaking, maybe breaking out/ Slightly cracking, inside there's someone else,"" yelps Sweet John Bloom's namesake on the opening ""Shapeshifter""—I'd call the title a little too on-the-nose if there was any indication that Sweet John Bloom considered themselves to be clever or meta. Each of Weird Prayer's 15 tracks finds the quartet to be anxious, yearning, and establishing their identity as one that's liable to shift within the span of a few minutes. At any given point, they'll have the Budweiser-soaked rock star visions of Guided By Voices (""Blood Moon""), amble with the superficially effortless sprawl of Pavement (""Nothing Is Natural""), pledge allegiance to high-strung Midwestern emo (""Weird Prayer"") or the hoarse lo-fi whispers of Sparklehorse (""Bury Ruby""). Weird Prayer has diversity, but relative to 2015, not a lot of range. It's a winner's history of indie rock that doesn't contain a lot of footnotes or room for contrarianism. And all of the aforementioned had really mixed emotions about the concept of ""winning""—their anthems seemed accidental, success laden upon them by critics and idealist fans rather than embraced as a birthright of a rock band. At the very least, they represented something current and were superlative among their peers in real time. Sweet John Bloom, on the other hand, write good songs. There are at least 10 of them on Weird Prayer. Some of them generate their staying power from melodic sticking points, others from a lyric that hits straight on in between so many that work the angles. But unlike their current peers in Massachusetts, it's tough to figure out where Sweet John Bloom's record collection ends and they begin. From the moment Bloom's agitated, adenoidal yelp is laid over a rhythm section that rollicks just enough to push them off the grid, Sweet John Bloom beg comparisons to the current pacesetter for comprehensive indie rock, Parquet Courts. While lacking Andrew Savage's arch, referential lyricism, sifting through Bloom's words at least suggests he's a cerebral dude about his bummer attitude—""Pieces of your youth that you grew up clinging to/ Come later to find in life that none of it was true."" But Parquet Courts without their arch, referential lyricism is basically Tapes 'n Tapes—they can write songs, catchy ones too, but they'll always have to be talked about as nostalgists by their frame of reference. In fact, Weird Prayer is at its best when Sweet John Bloom embrace the possibility that they're a power-pop band rather than an indie rock one. ""Blood Moon"" ekes further towards the Buzz Bin than ""120 Minutes"", with a chorus and bridge that leap rather than fall forward. Clear highlight ""Tell Me"" channels the enduring, simplistic appeal of teen angst into adult situations—doesn't matter if it's a boss, a spouse, a landlord, whatever, when Bloom hollers, ""I know what you want to say/ I know what you're trying to tell me right now/ But I ain't gonna hear it,"" you might as well be confronting your high school gym teacher. Similar to Posse's ""Shut Up"", a particularly excellent piece of '90s indie fan-fic from last year, ""Tell Me"" is a bold song about doing nothing, being passive as a form of aggression. In lieu of having a firm lyrical or philosophical platform, Sweet John Bloom somehow stand out most when they take a seat.","The Massachusetts indie rock band Sweet John Bloom might remind you of stalwarts like Guided By Voices and Pavement, or more recent acts like Parquet Courts. But the strongest moments on their Weird Prayer LP come when they embrace the possibility that they're a power-pop band rather than an indie rock one.

Everything Is 4,Jason Derulo,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeb45e6ef95969321cb9/1:1/w_160/32d7f009.jpg,2015-06-10 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20669-everything-is-4/,Warner Bros.Beluga Heights,"There's a vague poetry to Jason Derulo's latest album title, Everything is 4, and it's one he tried, even more vaguely, to summarize in a recent TIME interview: ""The number four is a sense of completion, almost."" It's easy to see what the 25-year-old singer might be getting at—the number suggests balance, structure, and rhythm, with plenty of musical and metaphysical significance—but Derulo seems more attracted to the general idea than the specifics. Clichés persist for a reason, after all: they can be incredibly effective. ""We want to go see a great movie because we want to be moved,"" he said later in the same interview. ""We want to laugh, we want to cry, we want to feel something."" Sure enough, Derulo has always aimed directly towards the hot-blooded center of a situation, be it lust, love, or heartbreak. It's not about nuance or distinction: it's about impact, drawing the most inclusive and thereby, most powerful, emotion out of three minutes and change. Such is the secret to Derulo's success, particularly as of last year's Talk Dirty (a savvy, U.S.-exclusive repackaging of his third full-length, Tattoos). His best songs are so vast and all-embracing in scope that, paradoxically, they become ultra-specific to their moment in time; as with pop-crossover monoliths like Usher's ""Yeah!"" or Flo Rida's ""Get Low,"" his hits have a tendency to bloom into zeitgeist mile-markers despite not being ""about"" much of anything at all. And though critics persistently peg him as unmemorable, Derulo's presence on the charts is by now intractable. He was the most-played male artist on all of radio in 2014—this from the guy whose most recognizable calling card was once his insistence on singing his own name, and is now his insistence on not singing his own name. He's a quiet trendsetter, though even his influence is hilariously faceless: ""Talk Dirty"" instigated the sudden rise of what Derulo himself called the ""instrumental hook,"" its dominant recorder solo, of all things, directly inspiring hits from Ariana Grande, Fifth Harmony, and Flo Rida. On Everything is 4, Derulo continues Talk Dirty's shift from indiscreet R&B huckster to audacious pop juggernaut. He's always been able to slip between genres with relative ease: he's collaborated with Florida Georgia Line, done acoustic Imogen Heap interpolations, evoked the puppy-dog hookiness of early-00's pop punk. But on Talk Dirty, Derulo honed in on more explicitly club-friendly sounds, positioning himself as one of R&B's few capable EDM fusionists, along with the likes of Ne-Yo and Chris Brown. The album was far from cohesive, but he seemed to have a clearer idea of his strengths: fewer simpering campfire ballads, more brazen grabs at the Top 40 jugular. Everything is 4 doesn't stray far from this formula, though it veers further towards 80's pop, funk, and overt Michael Jackson worship than his previous work—and while the results are varied (defiantly so, even), the highs are higher than ever. ""Want to Want Me"" is Derulo's best song, a crisp, feel-good blast of infatuated power-pop that feels warmer and more lived-in than any of his previous singles. ""Try Me"" goes breezy and Balearic, with production from Norwegian newcomer Matoma and an inspired-sounding guest verse from Jennifer Lopez. Album closer ""X2CU"" coats post-breakup stunting in Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis gloss before trailing off into a sweeping, Terius Nash-esque outro. But for every hit here, there is an egregiously stupid counterpoint: ""Get Ugly"" is a brutal attempt to reprise the ubiquitous ""Wiggle,"" though the result is more like ""Sexyback"" re-imagined under the influence of a half dozen Jaeger bombs. ""Broke"" is the ultimate low point: a bluesy clunker that unites (at long last!) Keith Urban and Stevie fucking Wonder, who is forced to interpolate ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" over hokey harmonica breakdowns. It's not pretty. But for all its blatantly ill-conceived moments, there's something charming about the sheer audacity of Derulo's often bizarre choices. Even when it falls flat, there is character here: real risks, and hints at a point of view, mixed in with the usual grab bag of assorted lust/love platitudes. And though the criticisms regarding his lack of a strong and identifiable persona, a ""Thing"" to call his own, are certainly well-founded, Everything is 4 makes a case for Derulo's shape-shifting vagueness as compelling, especially in the age of the celebrity overshare. The more we are able to learn about our musical heroes via social media, the more complicated our relationships with them become. In that sense, it's weirdly refreshing that Derulo has bypassed the almighty cult of personality in favor of proud unknowability.","Jason Derulo has become a quiet trendsetter, though even his presence is faceless: Despite having not much of a visible personality, he was the most-played male artist on the radio in 2014. On Everything Is 4, he continues *Talk Dirty'*s shift from indiscreet R&B huckster to audacious pop juggernaut.

Catharsis,Institute,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae5a9d034d5c69bf451b/1:1/w_160/4ee8a4f8.jpg,2015-06-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20599-catharsis/,Sacred Bones,"Aristotle first conceptualized ""catharsis"" by comparing the emotional toll of tragic plays to defecation-accelerants once known as ""cathartics."" He was referring to an audience's experience, but Catharsis, the debut album by Austin post-punk outfit Institute, is a vessel for the, uh, cathartic process of vocalist Moses Brown. (One of the songs here is called ""Admit I'm Shit"", after all.) Brown is singularly fixated on enumerating personal miseries and cultivating a sickly delivery atop the band's forbidding punk. That makes the record's appeal somewhat perverse, but gawking at Brown's unrestrained auto-evisceration turns out to be a rewarding purge for us, too. For the opening minute and a half of ""I Am Living Death"", Brown does little more than wail. He capitulates in the first line: ""Nothing can make life worthwhile."" On ""Admit I'm Shit"", he grotesquely stretches the titular refrain across a downcast, spare guitar lead. On ""Cheerlessness"", he lingers woozily on the long ""o"" in the couplet, ""Abhorred it/ Abhorred it,"" and then snaps, ""But I digress/ Excuse me!,"" as if offended at the interruption of someone trying to help relieve his suffering. Elsewhere, Brown sputters, ""I've got no love, I've got no passion"" and refers to ""constantly needing to say I'm sorry."" A maimed dog and references to puberty pop up, but Catharsis specifies little besides the depth of Brown's woes. At that, it's very forthcoming. There's a sardonic sense of purpose to all of this wretchedness, and it's part of what makes Catharsis intriguing. The vocal delivery of artists affiliated with, say, New York's so-called Ground Zero Hardcore set or the ascendant Northwest Indiana punk scene skew similarly infirm and enervated. Punk's tendency has been to measure strength in terms of perceived ""brutality,"" but there is new interest, and new value, in purposefully playing the cretin. The band plays rigid counterpoint to Brown's wallowing, opting for a stiff eighth-note gait at all times. The instrumental tones are chilled, with the high and low frequencies sucked out in favor of all mid-range. It's willfully numbed, and more deserving of the line ""I've got no passion"" than Brown's vocals. Except for the budget blues wank lodged in the riff on opener ""Perpetual Ebb"" (which was an exciting single but plays like an outlier in context), the band is unflaggingly austere. The word ""catharsis"" tends to be overused, grasped at by bookish young people to describe any art-induced mood swing. Catharsis is a self-absorbed record, even juvenile. It leans on the clichéd overstatements of teenagers who might claim to be ""dead inside."" You might reach for ""banal,"" a word plastered on the lyric sheet for no apparent reason. Still, the band's anguished exhibitionism also feels refreshing. Brown never signals recovery or completion of the purge, but catharsis at least occurs in the way Aristotle meant it: for the audience. By the end, we feel both vacated and spent.","The Austin band Institute pairs numbing and rigid post-punk with the unrestrained wailing of their lead vocalist Moses Brown, and the pairing turns out to be perversely appealing.

The Real Thing / Angel Dust,Faith No More,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae62b1335d7bf1699d7c/1:1/w_160/b5cd626f.jpg,2015-06-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20606-faith-no-more-the-real-thing-angel-dust/,RhinoRhino,"Judging from crowd reactions at last month's Faith No More concert in Toronto, the band's signature song is no longer ""Epic"", the star-making, stagedive-launching anthem that thrust the band's 1989 album, The Real Thing, into the Billboard Top 20. No, the most apeshit response was reserved for the lead single from 1992's notorious, radio-repelling Angel Dust, ""Midlife Crisis""—which made sense, given that the majority of Faith No More's audience is now old enough to have gone through one. But if the moment confirmed the long-term triumph of Faith No More's artistic peak over its commercial one, the band weren't ones to bask in the validation. Just as ""Midlife Crisis"" was about to emerge from its brooding mid-song breakdown into its climactic final chorus, Faith No More deviously denied the crowd the opportunity for one last cathartic sing-along. Instead, they kicked into a spot-on approximation of Boz Scaggs' 1976 proto-disco perennial ""Lowdown"", over which frontman Mike Patton sang the remaining lyrics to ""Midlife Crisis"" in his most lecherous lounge-lizard warble. It was a perfect Faith No More moment, crystallizing both their contrarian impulses and this ostensible hard rock group's long-time fascination with pop music. While it's common for metal and post-hardcore bands to pummel chart hits and golden oldies into submission, Faith No More have always seemed in awe of pop music's shimmering surfaces and disarming capabilities. As that ""Lowdown"" prank in Toronto illustrated, Faith No More don't cover soft-rock songs to make fun of them, but to make light of themselves, to deflate the chest-puffing machismo endemic to metal and unravel the tinfoil of hard rock's proverbial cucumber. And as these expanded, double-disc reissues of The Real Thing and Angel Dust reaffirm, Faith No More are a flamboyant, omnivorous pop act trapped in a metal band's body; their sound is the musical equivalent of a G.I. Joe doll dressed in a Barbie bikini with its limbs torn off. But if their reputation has been defined by a penchant for maniacal mash-ups, the band's deep-seated reverence for songcraft has always been the most perverse thing about them. For younger listeners whose tastes were shaped by the genre-agnostic Internet, it may be hard to square The Real Thing with its reputation as an alt-rock trailblazer. Because, for the most part, what we largely consider alt- or indie-rock today was shaped by popular '80s UK bands—The Cure, New Order, Depeche Mode—who came of age with punk but used its principles to forge a synth-centric mode of pop music wholly liberated from rock's blues-based tradition. Their California alt-rock counterparts, while also raised on punk, were less interested in opening up a new emotional and sonic vocabulary than bastardizing their formative influences: think Jane's Addiction's goth take on Zeppelin grandeur, Primus' bizarro-world Rush revisionism, Fishbone's skewed ska, or the Red Hot Chili Peppers' mosh-pit updates of Dylan and Stevie Wonder. It speaks volumes about the conservatism of mainstream American music at the time that all a rock band needed was some slap bass and dyed dreads to get consigned to the ""120 Minutes"" set. Amid their funky-punky peers, however, Faith No More were the freaks who didn't quite fit in with the other freaks. Neither as overtly sexual as Jane's Addiction or the Chili Peppers, nor as wilfully weird as their Bay Area buds in Primus, their lineup represented a veritable Breakfast Club detention room of rock archetypes, fusing elements of metal, prog rock, hip-hop and new wave. And it's that last element that ultimately set the band apart—through the omnipresent textural gloss of keyboardist Roddy Bottum, Faith No More were the only band of their ilk to openly embrace the synth-shined sound of '80s UK pop, then considered the antithesis of underground American rock. (Even as late as 1992, Rage Against the Machine were boasting in the liner notes of their debut album that they used ""no synthesizers, keyboards or samples"" as an unassailable measure of their realness.) Faith No More's third album overall (and second to see wide release via Slash/Warner), The Real Thing is the moment where the band's seemingly incompatible aesthetics locked into seamless formation. This can largely be attributed to the arrival of Mike Patton, whose sing/scream vocal gesticulations better personified the manic contradictions in the band's sound than outgoing vocalist Chuck Mosely's bratty monotone. But the band were also more confident in the grandiosity of their sound, with bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike Bordin's heavy but dextrous rhythms deftly mediating between Bottum's synths and Jim Martin's thrash-schooled shredding. The hair-raising intro to ""From Out of Nowhere"", with the entire band hammering at full throttle, is to this album what ""Ride of the Valkyries"" was to Apocalypse Now, a full-bore battle cry blown up to widescreen scale. And while ""Epic"" was perfectly timed to satiate the then-burgeoning appetite for rap-rock, the most interesting stuff was happening outside of Patton's staccato verses: that bulldozing fanfare of an opening riff, the beaming, anthemic chorus, Martin's Brian May-inspired soloing, that mournful, fish-killing piano coda. But while The Real Thing represents an important chapter in Faith No More's history, there's a reason why the album barely registers on the setlists of the band's current tour: a lot of it is hard to extricate from its date of origin. And that's a function of both its connection to a long-past funk-metal zeitgeist and the band's own subsequent development. It's hard to imagine any band, let alone Faith No More, attempting another song like ""Epic"" today, not just because of lingering associations between rap-rock and Rapestock, but the fact that the vocabularies of hip-hop and rock—once united by a shared affinity for booming breaks and crunchy riffs—have expanded and diverged in vastly different directions. However, Patton's long-abandoned MC moves aren't the only thing that marks The Real Thing as a definite product of 1989. While the dubbed-out title track centerpiece and the explosive ""Zombie Eaters"" (a template for the sort of stentorian power ballads FNM friends Metallica embrace on The Black Album) serve powerful displays of Patton's melodic/monstrous extremes, he had yet to fully emerge as the hydra-headed vocal dynamo we know him as today, while the unnecessary note-for-note cover of ""War Pigs"" is a rare instance of Faith No More approaching an obvious influence in an obvious fashion. (At the very least, it provided Bordin with good practice for his future gig as Bill Ward's understudy.) And in spite of showcasing Bottum's crucial keyboard work, pop songs like ""Falling to Pieces"" and ""Underwater Love"" didn't do much to dissuade skeptics who had pegged Faith No More as Chili Peppers copyists. The band's next album, however, would ensure no one ever confused Patton with Anthony Kiedis ever again. Angel Dust was hardly the spiteful act of career suicide their nervous major-label minders at Warner Bros. anticipated—it actually cracked the Billboard Top 10 and went gold in the U.S., while selling loads more in Europe. But in a post-Nevermind era when the stakes were growing ever higher for alt-rock bands—particularly ones following up a platinum-seller—Angel Dust asserted Faith No More's willingness to stay in the game, but only if they could play by their own rules. And they were as eager to upset the expectations of industry execs clamoring for another MTV-ready hit as the metalheads in their base who were just showing up for the megaton riffage. What makes Angel Dust an eminently fascinating record is not the fact that a band on the cusp of greater success would deign to release an album with songs called ""Crack Hitler"" and ""Jizzlobber"" that were just as ugly and filthy as their titles suggest. It's that Faith No More's most wantonly subversive album is also their most gorgeously rendered. Unlike other alt-rock opuses of its vintage, Angel Dust didn't feel like a mere Lollapalooza-era update of '70s classic-rock gatefold epics; this was a new, fiercely modernist form of heavy rock music, painstakingly constructed from emerging strains of electronica and sample-based production, international influences and the depths of underground metal. (At the time, the aesthetic shift was extreme enough to drive resident hesher Martin out of the band.) Though retaining the heft of The Real Thing's weightiest tracks, the riffs and rhythms were slowed down and contorted into mostly unmoshable forms, while Bottum's synth arias—which imply the presence of an orchestra with a single keystroke—project nauseated grandeur. Patton's always been cagey about explaining his lyrics, but the overwhelming feeling of Angel Dust is one of America rotting at the core, numbed by TV and overindulgence, overrun with bigoted deadbeat dads, wracked with domestic unrest and psychological turmoil. ""Does life seem worthwhile to you?"" Patton asks on the opening ""Land of Sunshine"", amid a nightmarish flurry of creepy carnivalesque laughter and hammy infomercial pitches—and the bleak landscape catalogued on Angel Dust doesn't give you much reason to answer in the affirmative. But Angel Dust's unpleasant imagery is countered by Faith No More's most audacious and playful musical experiments to date. There is the chanted ""Midlife Crisis"" mid-section that sounds like it was imported from an Enigma record; the pretty pan flute-inspired melody of ""A Small Victory"" that leads to a funky Madchester organ break; ""Be Aggressive""'s appropriation of high-school cheerleader songs into a homoerotic oral-sex anthem designed to be unwittingly shouted out by the band's mostly straight fans. They're the sort of ideas that sound ridiculous on paper, but are perfectly integrated into the album's elaborate design. Likewise, ""Everything's Ruined"" should be the mess its title suggests, shifting through a bright, bass-popping groove, melancholy verses, a rap-metal bridge, soaring soft-rock chorus and David Gilmour-esque guitar solos; instead, this portrait of familial breakdown proves to be the album's emotional center, with Patton's dejected declaration of the title chorus coming just as the song finally opens up into a sweeping, piano-inflected vista. Faith No More followed up Angel Dust's conceptual complexity with their simplest gesture: a straight-up, I-can't-believe-they're-not-being-ironic cover of the Commodores' 1977 slow-dance standard ""Easy"", which was recorded during the album's sessions but held over for the Songs to Make Love To EP. (It would be absorbed into the tracklist of overseas Angel Dust issues, but really does not fit thematically with the album at all.) ""Easy"" would crack the UK Top 10, and, to date, it's Faith No More's last single to chart on the Billboard Top 100 in the U.S. However, its significance to the band's story is somewhat overemphasized by this reissue, which includes three very similar versions of the song. The current archival campaign was not initiated by the band, but rather the music's current rights holders at Warner/Rhino, who are capitalizing on renewed back-catalogue interest stemming from Faith No More's first new album in 18 years, the self-released Sol Invictus. Both The Real Thing and Angel Dust come appended with an extra disc of period-specific bonus tracks (pared down for the double-vinyl editions), however, Faith No More's high standards of quality control mean the vaults weren't exactly teeming with treasured leftovers. Aside from solid Real Thing-era outtakes ""The Cowboy Song"" and ""Sweet Emotion"" (not an Aerosmith cover, but a dry run for future Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey soundtrack entry ""The Perfect Crime""), Faith No More's castaways tended to take the form of tossed-off genre exercises, like Zeppelin III-style acoustic interlude ""The Grade"", polka parody ""Das Schutzenfest"", and an Elvisized take on the Dead Kennedys' ""Let's Lynch the Landlord"". The rest of the bonus bounty comprises alternate takes (including some amusing time-capsule examples of early alt-rock dance remixes) and live tracks that don't deviate all too much from the originals, save for Patton's tendency to ad lib House of Pain, Bay City Rollers and Rob Base lyrics into his own. But the unhinged atmosphere of Faith No More's early-'90s concerts provides a convenient yardstick for gauging just how far the band had evolved in three short years—from the metal-damaged misfits comically growling ""SATAN!"" as ""War Pigs"" enters meltdown mode, to the cinematically minded aesthetes who opted to close Angel Dust with a meditative rendition of John Barry's Midnight Cowboy theme. At the time, that choice felt like the biggest WTF gesture on an album full of them, all that crushing brutalism and shape-shifting chicanery anti-climaxing in a moment of pure, unblemished beauty. But the move feels more appropriate now than ever—after all, like John Schlesinger's film, Angel Dust was a source of outrage at the time of its release, but has since ascended to the realm of a modern classic.","As these expanded, double-disc reissues of The Real Thing and Angel Dust reaffirm, Faith No More are a flamboyant, omnivorous pop act trapped in a metal band's body; their sound is the musical equivalent of a G.I.

Universal Themes,Sun Kil Moon,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae98c0084474cd0c191a/1:1/w_160/20cb90dc.jpg,2015-06-10 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20693-universal-themes/,Caldo Verde,"A decade ago, it would have been hard to imagine Mark Kozelek's Sun Kil Moon as a project embroiled in online controversy. Since Red House Painters evolved into Sun Kil Moon in the early part of the last decade, almost everything about the latter band was low-key and under the radar. Kozelek often toured alone with his nylon-string acoustic guitar, his music was generally slow and quiet, and he released a great many records that were happily received by his cult and mostly ignored otherwise. But nothing about the band seemed keyed into the now or connected to the churn of digital culture. All that changed in the last 18 months, for two reasons. One, Kozelek noticed that the stupid things he'd been prone to saying for many years (what has been described as a ""sense of humor"") could have a life outside the concert hall, from calling concertgoers ""hillbillies"" to picking fights with other bands. And two, in the last five years Kozelek's music has become diaristic in the extreme, which allows the mundane details of his life to enter his songs, lending them a bloggy quality. At times, these two streams came together in an ugly way, as when he wrote and released a single called ""War on Drugs: Suck My Cock"" and, more recently, when he disparaged a female journalist (and Pitchfork contributing editor) from the stage in London. The end result of these developments is that it's becoming increasingly difficult to imagine Sun Kil Moon's music outside of how it, and he, are discussed on social media. And since Mark Kozelek's music is so specifically autobiographical, and because he is the central character in each of these songs, it's doubly hard for his behavior not to have some impact. Even setting all that aside, if Mark Kozelek had spent the last year and a half playing his music and—to reference a lesson he supposedly learned from his father in Benji's ""I Love My Dad""—minding his own business, Universal Themes would still be a disappointing record. The songs are longer, the hooks are fewer, and the ""then I did this, then I did that"" observations are less profound and less likely to have you reflecting on your own life. It's ultimately a spotty album from a guy who has released a lot of spotty albums. Universal Themes does have a certain amount of experimentation; some of it is almost proggy as it moves through sections and adds and removes textures while Kozelek plays with instrumental breakdowns. ""With a Sort of Grace I Walked to the Bathroom to Cry"", for example, pivots between spacious arpeggiated acoustic segments to what is more or less ""hard rock,"" even if the latter is unconvincing. ""Ali/Spinks 2"" has a middle section of Sonic Youth-like guitar screeches that sounds a little out of place considering how relaxed and minimal the rest of the arrangement is. There's plenty of time to add these wrinkles: the eight songs average almost nine minutes each, and in a few of them you feel every second as it ticks by. Even so, a few tracks, despite their length, make no impression even after many listens. ""Cry Me a River Williamsburg Sleeve Tattoo Blues"" is a funny title in search of a song, while ""This Is My First Day and I'm Indian and I Work at a Gas Station"" is an unfunny title in search of a delete key. Still, the fact is, no one else writes songs like this, and when everything clicks, Kozelek's music can still be moving. Opener ""The Possum"" uses an image of a wounded rodent as a jumping-off point for a meditation on life, death, friendship, and the beauty of the struggle through it all. ""Garden of Lavender""—which really is, in part, about a garden where Kozelek is growing lavender—has some lovely guitar arrangements and manages to convey the ineffable feeling of time passing and living inside of a moment while also watching it happen from the outside. But these are exceptions. For the record as a whole, the fact that Kozelek is droning on in so much detail is more interesting than what he's actually saying. There are many, many words, but, unlike with Benji, they add up to very little. Benji remains a one-off masterpiece because it's the place where Kozelek's rambling style cohered around a concept, the perfect meeting of content and form. The narrator of those songs seemed vulnerable, like he was risking something by putting it out there, and the stories of life and death were riveting in part because they seemed so familiar. It was a record of a particular time, place, and circumstance, and it was sonically as well as thematically coherent. It was also a record in large part about others, of Kozelek looking outward and trying to figure out what made people tick and what they cared about and what their lives meant, even if the answers weren't always clear. Here, there's nothing at stake. Universal Themes moves in the other direction, away from connection, and it pulls inward. It feels claustrophobic, a world drawing in on itself and getting smaller and smaller.","On Universal Themes, Mark Kozelek's songs are longer, the hooks are fewer, and the observations are less profound and less likely to have you reflecting on your own life. It is ultimately a spotty album from a guy who has released a lot of spotty albums.

Perfect World,Uniform,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae9e9d034d5c69bf4597/1:1/w_160/8904a841.jpg,2015-06-09 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20654-perfect-world/,12XUAlter,"Uniform, a new Brooklyn duo composed of ex-The Men bassist Ben Greenberg and ex-Drunkdriver singer Michael Berdan, don't joke around when it comes to their dreary worldview. Perfect World is not meant as an optimistic title; it suggests the will to perfection choking the humanity out of the populace. The band name furthers that notion. World's cover, a sigil of a cross and death's sickle, is imposing and cryptic. But appearances can be deceiving: The album's six songs work within the limits of hardcore and industrial to create a monolithic record that slyly undermines its central thrust. Let's get the only criticism, a fairly minor one at that, out of the way—the opener and title track is far and away the best song. Who would think that a stark industrial song, with a rhythm ready to break down and self-destruct at any moment, would be a summer jam? Over a sharp and thin Ministry-like attack, Greenberg programs a drum track suggestive of a metal drummer stuck in a blast-beat fugue state. His guitar grows increasingly paranoid as the song progresses, and Berdan's shrieks contribute to the tension, but ""World"" never loses its hook. Greenberg's pop instincts he cultivated during his tenure in The Men shine through Berdan's screeching voice and the brittle guitar. Thankfully, he's returned those talents to heavy music, not settling for bar rock. The Men were best when they simultaneously rode the lines of making clubs feel like stadiums and punk as destructive freedom, and Uniform might be, spiritually, the closest thing we'll get to their older works. On ""Buyer's Remorse"", Uniform exhume '80s hardcore. Hardcore as a genre has explored dystopia plenty, but Uniform bob and swing with an urgency as if the stage-divers, instead of flailing about in the disorganization of their own lives, are out to specifically target you. ""Indifference"" moves toward a dark dance atmosphere, where Greenberg shifts his programming from metal purgatory to militaristic bass and snare. Feedback gets corralled into moaning riffs. Occasionally the guitar reaches blissful heights, contrasting and mocking the hell below. Dance music's utopian promise of one love and its undeniable undercurrent of sleaze all mix together, like Prurient's Through the Window with guitar in the mix. World's last two songs, ""Lost Causes"", a collaboration with former Coil member Drew McDowall, and ""Learning to Forget"" are slower than the rest of the album, and would seem like Uniform's letting you coast off anesthetized. Not quite: ""Causes"" submerges the band's torment under unsettlingly pleasant drift, bringing Uniform's themes of suppression to their logical conclusion. Greenberg's guitar comes back roaring in ""Learning"", with Berdan, once the angry punk kid, rambling hushed and defeated. There's no pulse, and signs of life have been stamped out. The last two songs demonstrate how the spirit dies long before the flesh.","Uniform, a new Brooklyn duo composed of ex-The Men bassist Ben Greenberg and ex-Drunkdriver singer Michael Berdan, have an unremittingly bleak worldview.

Portal/Well,Insect Ark,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae9fea9e61561daa62ea/1:1/w_160/aa5c29c7.jpg,2015-06-09 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20655-portalwell/,Autumnsongs,"Dana Schechter has a long history with music that’s both lulling and crushing. In the early '90s, she co-founded the noise-rock band Gift Horse with Jef Whitehead (later of Wrest and Leviathan infamy). Following that, she played bass in Michael Gira’s para-Swans ensemble, Angels of Light. She also formed her own dark folk-rock outfit, Bee and Flower, which has released music on Neurosis’ label Neurot, and she’s served as a touring bassist of American Music Club. Her upcoming guest appearances include slide guitar on ""An Index of Air"" from Infinite Dissolution, the imminent full-length by the experimental metal/noise band Locrian. These projects are distinct, but together they help echolocate the lush, prickly drone of Schechter’s latest ongoing concern, Insect Ark. Portal/Well is Insect Ark’s debut album, after a pair of 7''s and a stellar 2013 EP, Long Arms. But where Long Arms seemed constricted by its three-song runtime, Portal/Well sprawls. Performed entirely by Schechter, the album is built primarily out of programmed drums, synthesizers, radically effected lap steel guitar, and ominously monumental basslines. In that sense it’s more or less a bedroom recording project—only the bedroom involved is in the locked attic of a decaying mansion that’s cocooned with cobwebs and haunted by shadowy memories. That aura of estrangement, metamorphosis, and loss is mirrored in the gauzy blur of ""Octavia"", a monstrously slow meditation that feels more like an accumulation of stray sounds over eons than any kind of conventionally arranged song. At the same time it’s Portal/Well’s most alluringly melodic track, even if that melody is telescoped into a cosmic smear of shoegaze ghostliness without anything so tidy as a resolution. ""Octavia"", though, is a stadium anthem compared to ""Low Moon"", whose minimalist incantations of static are more abstract and disorienting—a study in gray washes and grainy textures that defines the sonic envelope of Portal/Well, from the amp-hum ambience of ""Parallel Twin"" to the corroded majesty of ""Taalith"". It’s a heavy record, both in timbre and disposition, but it avoids the apocalyptic template of tension-climax-aftermath in favor of something less rigid and linear, without even the cold comfort of a causal link between destruction and remorse. As grim as it can get, Portal/Well isn’t another trite ode to annihilation. The title track oozes an eerie curiosity, with Schechter’s nomadic bass and slithering licks of guitar probing the deepest reaches of classic prog. It’s not as emotionally gripping as some of the album’s bleaker moments, but it grounds Insect Ark in a tradition—one of cerebral rock played with passion and without compromise. That approach doesn’t always work as well as it could; the aimlessly hallucinatory ""Lowlands"", for example, barely serves as a brief interlude, let alone a song of its own. But taken as a whole, the album is more about enduring than ending, a doorway into hollowness and lonesomeness that contracts and dilates with a horrific rhythm. Schechter has recently doubled the roster of Insect Ark by enlisting Ashley Spungin of the experimental doom duo Taurus on drums and electronics. Although Spungin doesn’t appear on Portal/Well, her addition to Insect Ark seems foreshadowed by the album; like Taurus, Insect Ark is informed by the unsettling, alienating '70s soundtrack work of groups like Goblin and Tangerine Dream. That eerie, cinematic scope rears its head on ""The Collector"", Portal/Well’s most evocative track. Like some vast beast tossing in its sleep, the song lurches from staccato chunks of bass to nightmarish cascades of synths, all the while maintaining a queasy, menacing dream logic. Portal/Well may not have a feature film to go with it, but with compositions as vivid and immersive as Schechter’s, it doesn’t need one.","Dana Schechter, who played in Angels of Light with Michael Gira and formed the dark-folk outfit Bee and Flower, has a long history with music that’s both lulling and crushing.

Amusers and Puzzlers,Sightings,by: Raymond Cummings,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae8113d197565213a100/1:1/w_160/c1917ee2.jpg,2015-06-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20631-amusers-and-puzzlers/,Dais Records,"Sightings’ sound was the industrial noise-rock equivalent of stumbling upon a barroom brawl, and that gnashing, mangling jumble was integral to the late NYC trio’s appeal. Spitting bile through clenched teeth, Mark Morgan conjured flanged wastelands via guitar; Jon Lockie pounded primal, desperate drums; and Richard Hoffman whipped up hypnotic, Lotto-hopper basslines. At Sightings’ most ferocious, on uncompromising slabs like 2002’s Michigan Haters and 2005’s End Times, these elements entangled so thrillingly and violently that they became impossible to separate. The band unexpectedly called it a day in the spring of 2013. Recorded during the sessions for that year’s Terribly Well LP, Amusers and Puzzlers feels less like a swan song than the inevitable next evolutionary step. Though the crude no wave of 2002’s Sightings would give way, over the years, to sharper fidelity and songcraft and the odd stylistic tangent—check 2004’s Arrived in Gold, a photo-negative spin on the band’s enervating convulsions—true change surfaced with 2011’s Future Accidents. The 19-minute long instrumental ""Public Remains"" ushered in a studied, queasy ambience that split the difference between cut-up drone, dub, and gutter blues. Indeed, this muted malevolence would carry over to the wordless cyborg whirr and stammer of Terribly Well’s ""Yellow""—even as the surrounding tunes snarled characteristically, if less caustically. Amusers and Puzzlers strikes a similar balance of short order bomb-out and wandering balm. ""Counterfeited"" segues from squirmy bass-led melodic figure to crazed percussive thump and back, as guitars seethe and squawk off in the corner. ""13"" strains, stipples, and thrums, all sandpaper tension and slurried distortion; the pulverizing ""Trials of Peter"" shoves in every direction at once. ""1982"" imagines a manic atonal triptych—short-circuiting guitar next to irrepressible bass bounce next to coiled drumkit OCD—then slowly increases the tempo as Morgan transforms into the world’s most unhinged carnival barker; it’s like listening to a punk song being fed into a clogged garbage disposal. The irradiated, 16-minute ""Syllabus of Error"" casts a long bummer of a shadow over the rest, representative of The Ghost of Sightings Future in a way that ""Public Remains"" and ""Yellow"" could only hint at. A brittle patchwork of drones thrumming at various frequencies and abrupt static smears, ""Syllabus"" feels unsettling, haunted—at once slighter and more haphazard than its predecessors. Gorgeous, aquatic guitar chords drift idly past or flame out curtly; feedback threatens to knife the variegated din. Glassine, sonar effects sound. A rattling buzz lends the tableau an additional air of menace that eventually consumes any warmth that might have been implied early on. This was clearly the direction Sightings were headed in, and had they soldiered forward, it would have been fascinating to hear where they'd eventually wind up.","A gnashing, mangling jumble of industrialized noise was integral to the late NYC trio Sightings’ appeal.

Drones,Muse,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae01c0084474cd0c180e/1:1/w_160/2035a089.jpg,2015-06-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20520-drones/,Warner Bros.,"Like their prog-pop predecessors Rush, Queensrÿche, and Pink Floyd, Muse will never be cool, but their subject matter will always be relevant—they only deal in current events that speak to timeless pathologies of the human condition. The Resistance raged against any and all machines while the environmentally conscious The 2nd Law made global warming appear to be yet another shadow government conspiracy rather than scientific fact. Likewise, Drones is not a critique of American military strategy, but rather, ""the journey of a human, from their abandonment and loss of hope, to their indoctrination by the system to be a human drone, to their eventual defection from their oppressors."" Really, what are Muse records but blockbuster action flicks centered around a cryptocratic nightmare that can be explained on a billboard? Then again, you do not listen to Muse records for nuance. Muse have to hit the stadium cheap seats and the back row in any given 8th-grade history class. This is how they end up with songs like ""Mercy"" and ""Revolt""—wherein lead singer Matt Bellamy commands tens of thousands to shout down the brainwash tactics of diabolical plutocrats while wearing Bad Boy circa-'98 shiny suits that should warrant a name change to Mu$e. And while even the big singles are supposed to hew to Drones’ concept, Bellamy never gets too specific. Lyrics like, ""Don’t leave me out to die/ I gave you everything"" led many to assume opener ""Dead Inside"" was about Bellamy’s ex-fiancée Kate Hudson, when it’s actually the protagonist’s blue-pill indoctrination into an army of murderbots. ""Defector"" probably wasn’t made with the intention of mirroring Taco Bell’s latest ad campaign, but it’s way more fun to hear, ""Yeah, I’m free/ From society/ You can’t control me/ I’m a defector!"", as Bellamy waxing ecstatic about the A.M. Crunchwrap. Even Muse seem to have thought their most recent work was getting too convoluted, so they’ve played up Drones as ""by our standards...back to basics"". At their most humble, Muse were the most histrionic of the post-OK Computer world, so Drones represents a chance to reflect on what Muse consider to be their ""basics"". For starters, Drones is ""basic"" in the sense that Hail to the Thief would be way too subtle of a pun to fit here. In both sound and its refusal to speak in anything other than the most literal, explanatory terms, Drones is somewhere between ""Iron Man"" and ""Mr. Roboto"". A ""[Drill Sergeant]"" interlude ends with its subject yelling ""ARE YOU A HUMAN DRONE?"", which leads into the chorus of ""Psycho""—""I could use someone like you/ Someone who’ll kill on my command/ And ask no questions."" ""Psycho"" itself splices Metallica’s boogie ""2x4"" and the first half of Full Metal Jacket, although think of Marilyn Manson playing the role of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Musically, they've ditched the influence of industrial and festival EDM that resulted in the most ludicrous parts of The Resistance and The 2nd Law, which were also the best parts. While ""Dead Inside"" recalls the phallic funk thrust of 2nd Law highlight ""Panic Station"", everything here is otherwise locked and loaded for Rock Band 4. On some level, it’s heartening to know this stuff can still exist in 2015—the marathon tapping solo on ""Reapers"" or the 720-hp revving of ""The Handler"" are almost thrilling in their commitment. But even Muse's down-and-dirty rock record includes a 10-minute suite, and the very next song is an a cappella chorale of a thousand Matt Bellamys. Moreover, Drones is produced by Mutt Lange and boasts cover art from Matt Mahurin, who spent the early '90s slathering Bush, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and even Lou Reed in the grunge-glam sludge. The last time Lange and Mahurin collaborated on the same record, Def Leppard was asking us to stand up and kick love into motion. Whatever pleasure can be generated from Bellamy’s admirable melodic sense and overblown hooks is negated by Muse’s insistence that they’re profound rather than fun. They’re too humorless to be camp, unwilling to explore the obvious homoerotic subtext of the plot (I mean, just read the lyrics to ""Psycho"") and unshakable in their errant belief they’re tearing down a power structure rather than solidifying it. Drones might as well be overlain with Entourage, à la Wizard of Oz/Dark Side of the Moon, for the ultimate in critical hate-consumption. Muse’s operatic vocal runs, tablature-bustin’ riffs, and CGI'd production feel unmistakably similar to the way Doug Ellin brandishes yachts, celebrity cameos, and bared breasts. If it’s luxury porn, just own up—we know it when we see it.","Muse records are largely blockbuster action flicks centered around a cryptocratic nightmare that can be explained on a billboard. Drones, their latest, proves no more capable of altering U.S. military strategy than The 2nd Law managed to singlehandedly end global warming. Mutt Lange produces.

"Apocalypse, girl",Jenny Hval,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae8a9d034d5c69bf4574/1:1/w_160/aa92fe00.jpg,2015-06-09 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20638-apocalypse-girl/,Sacred Bones,"Experimental singer/songwriter Jenny Hval's work is cryptically pleasurable, prone to breeding obsession, and full of surprises. As she mentions several times throughout Apocalypse, girl, she recorded her latest album when she was 33, and like a lot of people in their Jesus year she found herself at an existential crossroads. Apocalypse, girl has plenty of what-does-it-all-mean moments—Hval reckons with longing and self-doubt, tentatively considers ideas of domesticity and traditional standards of satisfaction, and fantasizes about spiritual (or possibly even literal) rebirth—but she seems to have come out of her crisis even more committed to following the challenging path she’s chosen for herself. Musically, Apocalypse pushes boundaries that were barely visible on her last album. For all its noisy interludes and sharply angular melodies, a lot of Innocence Is Kinky was straightforward, held down by fairly conventional arrangements of guitar, drums, and keys. Working with producer Lasse Marhaug (who met Hval when he interviewed her for his fanzine in 2014) and an ensemble of skilled improv players that includes members of Swans and Jaga Jazzist, she deconstructs her pop sensibilities while still assembling catchy and memorable compositions. There’s a dreamy kind of ambiguity to how the songs are put together: Pop melodies emerge from washes of abstract sound, and sometimes they’ll take charge of the song, but sometimes they simply fade back into the churn. Standout track ""Heaven"" starts off with vocals over the white noise sound of falling rain, then pivots into moody, Björk-like electropop, and finishes in a tonal cloud of strings and harp. Hval takes a similar approach to her lyrics, floating intriguing bits of concrete imagery in a matrix of stream-of-consciousness abstraction—Queens-bound subway cars and a scrap of John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" tumbling past enigmatic, impressionistic lines like ""I separate from feelings/ Complex harmonic notion/ Harmonic notion."" As a lyricist, Hval sometimes feels like she has less in common with traditional songwriters than with text artists like Jenny Holzer and Tracey Emin. Like them, her deployment of words lands hardest when it hits a gnomically confrontational tone. And in terms of gnomic confrontation, it’s hard to beat the phrase ""soft dick rock."" Halfway through ""Kingsize"", the album opener full of pungent abstract lines like ""I beckon the cupcake, the huge capitalist clit,"" Hval pauses the song to whisper the question, ""What is SOFT DICK ROCK?"" How you react during the silence she lets hang in the air for a beat after the question—whether you laugh out loud or frown perplexedly—will probably determine how you feel about the rest of the album. The most obvious and immediately gratifying answer to Hval’s question is that soft dick rock is simply the spirit of fragile male ego and fear of women that rock music (among other pop styles) has sustained for the better part of a century. Baby boomer guitar gods hogging stages well into their senescence are soft dick rock; so are younger and more critically well-defended artists keeping the patriarchy alive and breathing in the counterculture. But ""soft dick rock"" could also be music that runs counter to rock’s testosterone-driven nature. ""That Battle Is Over"" is Apocalypse, girl’s most straightforward pop moment, with a shuffling quasi-hip-hop beat, an unhurried organ progression, and Hval singing with an uncharacteristically bluesy inflection. The lyrics are about reckoning with the legacy of an older generation’s revolution, and the question of whether the advances they made are actually doing Hval any good. The relationship between the reference and the subject matter, potent and intriguingly ambiguous, emits a weird frisson that’s as fascinating in its own way as her voice. Like all of her best work, it finds new ways to provoke, and new parts of your brain to light up.","Experimental singer/songwriter Jenny Hval's latest album finds her reckoning with longing and self-doubt, tentatively considering domesticity, fantasizing about rebirth, and wrestling with sex and gender.

City Lights Vol. 3: Soweto,Nicolay,by: Marcus J.

They traded audio files and compiled an album—2004’s Connected—before they’d ever seen each other. The LP marked a creative shift for Phonte who, at the time, was known only as an MC with rap group Little Brother. For Nicolay, Connected was a coming out of sorts; its success brought more attention to his atmospheric blend of soul and electronica. Years before Rhye gained attention for their airy Quiet Storm-inflected R&B, Nic created the same sorts of Eurocentric grooves. Here, his 2006 LP, tinkered with hip-hop soul and featured Wiz Khalifa long before he became ""The Stoner Guy."" By 2008’s Leave It All Behind, Phonte ditched rap to mostly sing full time; Nicolay’s melodies grew bigger and brighter, an evolution that continued on 2009’s City Lights Vol. 2: Shibuya, which was inspired by his first visit to Tokyo. In turn, City Lights Vol. 3: Soweto was recorded after the Foreign Exchange’s first trip to South Africa in 2014. Where Shibuya felt like a scenic stroll through Tokyo’s nightlife, Soweto is lush and vibrant, carried by a persistent thump that picks up steam as the album progresses. This isn't an album of singles; it’s a summery mix of breezy dance tunes, sequenced without pauses for a unified listening experience. You can pluck out certain numbers, but Soweto is meant to be played in the order it's presented. At times, Nicolay sings through a Vocoder, and narrator Nomusa Nzima walks us through the nuances of South Africa's Zulu dialect. Though the LP follows Shibuya and City Lights Vol. 1.5 in Nic’s discography, it has the same radiant vibe as Love in Flying Colors, his group’s 2013 release. Phonte is somewhat of a co-star here; his tenor crops up sporadically amongst the producer’s tropical arrangements, joined occasionally by Carmen Rodgers and Tamisha Waden. Yet on the album’s two best songs—""The Brightest Star"" and ""The Secret""—the Foreign Exchange collaborators assume a more prominent role. Soweto pivots between dark and light textures. Songs like ""Aurora"" and ""The Chase"" recall Shibuya’s pastoral mood, but the energy ramps up by album midpoint ""The Brightest Star"". Nicolay's renditions of South African dance rhythms are both faithful and distinctive, and you can hear his aesthetic in many of the album's small decisions. On ""Sun Rings/Uprising"", for instance, Nic uses light keys and synthesizers to initiate the piece. By its second half, he stacks the percussion and lifts the mood. Soweto is an understated record, not meant to be a power punch. It could soundtrack your next cookout, or your next morning run, and while it's modest, it keeps a good party going.","On City Lights Vol. 3: Soweto, producer Nicolay pays homage to South African culture while remaining close to his artistic center. It was influenced by the Foreign Exchange's first trip to the country in 2014.

Home Economics,Prinzhorn Dance School,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae5b13d197565213a0bb/1:1/w_160/c65172d4.jpg,2015-06-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20600-home-economics/,DFA,"The UK duo Prinzhorn Dance School have spent years refining a sound that was almost entirely free of excess and impurity to begin with. Their self-titled 2007 debut was an austere ikebana arrangement of bass, drums, vocals, and guitar that felt like an exercise in making a post-punk record out of the fewest number of notes possible. On their next album, 2011’s Clay Class, Tobin Prinz and Suzi Horn streamlined even more by removing some of the rhythmic flourishes. Coming into their third LP it seemed like there wasn’t a superfluous gesture left for the pair to remove from their sound, but they’ve managed to find some anyhow. Home Economics is in some ways an even more spartan album than its predecessors, and on other levels it’s a far richer listen. There isn’t a note on Home Economics that doesn’t feel like it had to make it through several rounds of cuts to secure a spot on the record. In the album’s 20 or so minutes—Horn and Prinz have reached the point where six songs qualifies as an album—there’s not a superfluous millisecond. It’s a minor monument to obsessive compulsive behavior and brutal efficiency. The funny thing is that while the pair have been surgically removing elements, a very human kind of warmth has crept in. While Prinzhorn Dance School and Clay Class felt like a tightly edited version of Gang of Four, the band’s latest feels like a Zen-garden New Order. Prinz and Horn have not only adopted an expanded worldview that allows room for considering interpersonal relationships outside the context of the capitalist-imperialist system, they’ve also started to show an unexpected gift for creating pop hooks. The aggressive edge from their earlier work hasn’t gone away completely, and you can still feel it lurking just below the surface, which gives songs like the immensely catchy opening track ""Reign"" or the sweetly tender ""Clean"" the same sense of tentativeness—an almost tangible feeling of someone hesitantly letting down their guard in hopes of connecting with someone else—that give ""Temptation"" and ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" their emotional wallop. Without this newfound softness, Home Economics would have been much harder to connect with. The pair play negative space like an instrument; at several points on the record, an instrument will appear to be building up to a flourish before dropping out completely—silence as solo. But rather than feeling stark and severe, there’s an elegant grace in the simplicity. It makes a listener lean in to find an unexpectedly warm embrace.","Prinzhorn Dance School 's third LP Home Economics is an even more spartan album than its predecessors, and on some levels it’s a far richer listen.

Nite-Glo EP,Stellar OM Source,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae8cc0084474cd0c1901/1:1/w_160/f32e76fc.jpg,2015-06-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20640-nite-glo-ep/,Rvng Intl.,"Christelle Gualdi's artistic progression as Stellar OM Source has been a steady process of crystallization. A former student of electro-acoustic composition at the Conservatoire de Paris, she began, in the mid '00s, with lo-fi synthesizer music, hazy and diffuse and steeped in the Tangerine Dream tradition—full of misty Roland pads, new age sparkle, and tape hiss. And she made quite a lot of it, too, turning out at least seven albums between 2008 and 2010, many of them CDRs. Coming into the new decade, though, she became more deliberate. She put out fewer releases, but they were far more sharply defined. Joy One Mile, released in 2013 on RVNG, adopted snapping drum machines and references to techno and rave. It was full of hard surfaces and sharp edges, and while it was often woozier and more idiosyncratic than most functionalist club music, it wasn't hard to see where its allegiances lay, what kind of feelings it wanted to evoke. On Nite-Glo, Stellar OM Source's transformation is complete. From the opening notes of ""Sudden""—a rubbery TB-303 bassline perforated by needling analog hi-hats—it's clear that we're in techno terrain. All four tracks are marked by four-to-the-floor drum machines, squirrelly acid basslines, and wiry synth accents; there's not a lot to indicate whether they're from 1988 or 2018. Their stripped-down sound comes, in part, from the fact that she recorded the EP on the road, utilizing her touring setup. (In order to keep her luggage beneath the airlines' 20-kilogram limit, she keeps her kit light, just a handful of hardware machines.) And their clubby punch comes, likewise, from the fact that they were developed night after night in dark, sweaty rooms under the age-old, after-midnight rubric, ""Fuck art, let's dance."" But to say that Gualdi has fallen into techno is not to say that she has gotten complacent. Much of the pleasure here lies in the way that she takes well-worn forms and makes them fresh again. In the opening ""Sudden"", the bassline strikes a perfect balance between softness and bite, and the staccato claps and snares lend a hint of delirium, but what brings the track alive are the more unexpected elements: a breathy vocal sample that casts a thin yellow light in the midst of all that darkness, like a flashlight in a coal cellar; the improbable major chords that flare up towards the end, giddy and shivering. A similar sense of displacement animates everything here. ""Never"" begins with an acid bassline that might be an answer to Larry Heard's ""The Sun Can't Compare"", and for nearly three minutes, it all feels pretty straightforward. But then she introduces a gauzy augmented chord, and it's like a skylight above the dance floor has been thrown open. The new notes aren't discordant, necessarily, but they're not really in key, either; if you heard it in a club, you might assume that the spine-tingling frisson came from a new record being worked into the mix. And, per Gualdi's real-time techniques, the track just keeps morphing, as the bassline gives way to a sprightly funk motif, and the whole tune locks into a gritty Sheffield-bleep vibe. ""Live"" drizzles ""Mentasm"" stabs over squelchy chords and dissolves into a spray of atonal squawks, and ""Sure"" somehow manages to go from grinding acid to brightly colored, ballooning chords; at the end, it morphs once again into scowling new-wave electro. In an interview with FACT, Gualdi has said that unspecified personal losses helped give shape to the album, but it never sounds melancholic, exactly. To the contrary, a spirit of play reigns supreme.","A former student of electro-acoustic composition at the Conservatoire de Paris, Christelle Gualdi's artistic progression as Stellar OM Source has been a steady process of crystallization.

Sub-Lingual Tablet,The Fall,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae8bea9e61561daa62c5/1:1/w_160/6f604ca1.JPG,2015-06-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20639-sub-lingual-tablet/,Cherry Red,"Despite Mark E. Smith’s fearsome reputation as rock's consummate contrarian crank and irascible iconoclast, the first two decades of the Fall’s evolution could more or less be charted alongside developments in British music at large. From the primitivist punk of their late-'70s releases, to the synth-powered pop of their chart-breaching mid-'80s output, to the baggy grooves of early '90s dancefloor infiltrators like ""Telephone Thing"" and ""Free Range"", the Fall weren’t so much an antidote to popular music as a funhouse-mirror distortion of it, with Smith’s anti-social snarl having a corrupting effect on jaunty honky-tonk shuffles, soccer-stadium-worthy sing-alongs, and the great British songbook. But by the mid-'90s—not coincidentally, the time when UK rock music turned slavishly retro—the Fall’s path diverged sharply from the mainstream forevermore. Since the turn of the millennium, they’ve been firmly lodged in their post-modern phase, reformulating their well-established inspirations—rockabilly, '60s garage, Beefheart, Krautrock, avant-garde noise—into a ceaseless stream of pastiche-packed albums that occasionally cohere, but mostly confound. Technically speaking, Sub-Lingual Tablet is the Fall’s 31st album, but given their rudderless recent trajectory, it could just as easily be their 27th or 29th. That’s not so much a comment on the consistency of the current Fall lineup—which has remarkably remained in place for a record-breaking eight years now—as the fact that each new Fall album that’s surfaced over the past decade has represented a discrete, hermetically sealed unit, impervious to environmental or temporal influence. They've become a timeless band in the truest sense of the word, their records resembling both mysterious unearthed artifacts and garbled transmissions from an indeterminate future. On Sub-Lingual Tablet, even the customary pop-cultural references—always a reliable measure for carbon-dating a Fall record—feel oddly anachronistic, the album climaxing with back-to-back scuzz-punk screeds about Facebook (""Fibre Book Troll"") and smartphone addiction (""Quit iPhone"") that could’ve just as easily appeared on a Fall record back in 2008. Ironically, the Fall’s most tight-knit lineup ever—now appended with a second drummer—has proven to be the most aesthetically malleable: on Sub-Lingual Tablet, they flit from space-age bachelor pad synth doodles (""Black Roof"") to William Onyeabor-style West African hypno-groove (""Junger Cloth"") to Stooges cover-band karaoke (""Stout Man"", which is basically what ""Cock In My Pocket"" would sound like if Iggy got kicked in the nuts). But, in spite of their surprising stability, this iteration of the Fall is strangely lacking in audible camaraderie, and on Sub-Lingual Tablet, the distance between frontman and backing band feels more pronounced than ever. More often than not, the album comes off less like a product of intuitive interaction than the group churning out rehearsal-space warm-up exercises for Smith to spew over, shifting course and fading out at random. Strip away his loogie-gargling, melody-averse vocals from the lockstep dub-disco of ""Dedication Not Medication"", the squelching funk of ""Pledge!"", and the loose-limbed swing of ""Snazzy"", and the Fall effectively resemble the world’s most cantankerous jam band. The Fall are nobody's idea of a pop band, but Smith has always understood the value of a big hook, something you can grab and swing on while the ground below crumbles. And though their legend has been built upon volatility and relentless non-conformism, the band produce their most vital work when they adhere to rock-song schematics while scribbling between the lines. Sub-Lingual Tablet opens with a corker in ""Venice With the Girls"" (yet another fine addition to the lineage of derisive Fall songs about leisure-class travellers), but, in typically perverse logic, the album’s most tightly wound song is also its most sprawling. Clocking in at 10 exhilarating minutes, ""Auto Chip 2014-2016"" not only boasts Sub-Lingual Tablet’s most quintessentially Fall-like chant, it finds the band, for once, casting out with a clear destination in sight, gradually applying pedal pressure on a sun-bound motorik rhythm until it achieves lift-off. ""Sufferin’!"" goes the song’s one-word earworm of a chorus—ironically, it’s the rare moment on Sub-Lingual Tablet when we’re not.","Technically speaking, Sub-Lingual Tablet is the Fall’s 31st album, but given their rudderless recent trajectory, it could just as easily be their 27th or 29th.

Corn,Arthur Russell,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae3a13d197565213a07c/1:1/w_160/ebf083d0.jpg,2015-06-08 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20568-corn/,Audika,"Arthur Russell’s work remains fascinating because it can never be solved. His music mixed disco, modern classical, singer-songwriter folk, new wave, and dub; sometimes all that would come together in one place, and more often, one or two elements would be focused on for a track or an album-length project. Beyond the slippery nature of the music, there’s also the fact that whatever amount of fame he achieved happened some years after he died at age 40 in 1992, so we never got much of a chance to hear from the man himself. And then on top of all that, he almost never finished anything—even he had trouble figuring out what his music should be. Russell left behind fragments and half-completed tracks with a lot of empty spaces and unanswered questions. Those empty spaces are where we, the listeners, come in. The members of Russell’s audience, most of whom assembled long after he was gone, each individually provide the missing pieces of the puzzle, and so reactions to his music tend to be very personal. The first time I heard of Arthur Russell someone on a message board called his music ""Nick Drake in dub,"" and that descriptor always stuck with me. It captured his essential contrast, between the most close-mic'd and hushed bedroom singer-songwriter, whose music epitomizes a life alone, and the expansive, outward-looking productions designed, ultimately, as a tool for the massed activity of dance. Russell loved dance music and the collective possibility of the disco, but he also holed up by himself in rooms and created songs that sounded like one-to-one confessions. So his music speaks to an oddly paradoxical existential state that nevertheless feels very familiar: a warm and playful state of communal loneliness. In his lifetime, he released just one full-length under his own name (his strangest and also arguably his best—World of Echo). But since he recorded and tinkered constantly, we’ve been met in this century with a raft of compilations, ""lost albums,"" and coulda-been albums, all of which, save the still-brilliant The World of Arthur Russell, the Soul Jazz comp that kicked off the Russell appreciation in 2004, and 1994's Point Music-released Another Thought, have been overseen by Steve Knutson of the Audika imprint. Because the vast majority of people who have heard his music experienced it in the context of an archival release more than a decade after his death, Russell has developed an unusual cult consisting mostly of record obsessives. Arthur Russell, as we know him, is the product of contemporary reissue culture. Corn is another lost album that, unlike Love Is Overtaking Me or Calling Out of Context, was close to being released at some point in the early 1980s, according to some notes and test pressings. That’s somewhat ironic, though, because, of the major Russell reissue projects so far, the nine tracks on Corn sound the most like demos. Solid demos, to be sure, with complete arrangements and decent fidelity, but there’s something skeletal about these tracks that separates it from both the fizzy new wave of Context and the clear, full acoustic tracks on Love. A number of these tracks have also been released in other versions, in some cases with better sound quality, and a few of those are his most well-known tracks. ""See My Brother, He’s Jumping Out (Let’s Go Swimming #2)"", best known via the Walter Gibbons mix on World, is one, and the take of ""Keeping Up"" on Another Thought, with background vocals by Jennifer Warnes, still seems definitive compared to the one here. A more fleshed-out ""This Is How We Walk on the Moon"" was collected on Another Thought, but in this dry and ultra-stripped down version the smallest unit of sound is given so much weight. Despite the familiarity, Corn holds together remarkably well. These songs feel like they belong together and are meant to be heard on this record, in this sequence. And where previous Russell reissue projects tended to cluster tracks in a similar style together, this record shows the full range of what he was up to and makes it coherent. Broadly speaking, the record is mostly drum machine-driven electro-pop, without the abandon of Russell in disco mode or the intimacy of his acoustic tracks, but all of his styles are in here somewhere. ""Lucky Cloud"" is as straightforward a pop song as Russell allowed himself. The two versions of ""Corn"" and ""Hiding Your Present From You"" are more free-form jams, with Russell soloing on a cello run through a distortion pedal. And the closing ""Ocean Movie"" is an abstract instrumental, almost neo-krautrock in its heavily textured spaciness. In a sense Corn feels like a lo-fi, weirder version of The World of Arthur Russell, in the way it serves as an introduction to all his different approaches while also demonstrating so clearly the threads between them. It’s unusual to recommend so highly an album like this one, where you can realistically say that it’s the third- or fourth-best posthumous release from an obscure artist. And there is no doubt that this isn’t the place to start with Russell. But while the default reaction in cases like this are cynicism—barrel-scraping to cash in on a legacy—the Audika project has been something else. My guess is that being in the Arthur Russell business has never been a good way to make a lot of money, not while he was alive and certainly not now. Regardless, because these collections are presented with such care, put together and sequenced in order to give the listener an experience, they come over as acts of generosity.","Corn is the latest in a long series of archival reissues of difficult-to-classify songwriter Arthur Russell. These tracks, recorded in 1982 and 1983, mostly find him in electro-pop mode, but the set has range and finds him touching on a number of styles.

Time Wharp,Time Wharp,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae875e6ef95969321c73/1:1/w_160/c85dac24.jpg,2015-06-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20636-time-wharp/,Astro Nautico,"Kaye Loggins used to seem like she was in a hurry. Three of the four tracks on her second EP, 2011's GRN, were barely more than a minute long; the longest came in at 1:47. They were beautiful things—lustrous instrumental hip-hop jams full of fluttering chiptune frequencies—but they seemed to bear out Lao Tzu's (and Blade Runner's) dictum about flames that burn twice as bright. On the following year's BLK EP, the Atlanta native had no problem stretching out and developing her ideas to three- and four-minute lengths, but this time, her footwork- and skweee-inspired beats flew by so fast, it was as if a record pressed at 33 were being played back at 78. On her self-titled debut album, she returns to Earth-time. Stylistically, most of the record's eight tracks follow the jazzy, broken-beat house of artists like Floating Points and Four Tet. Loggins is fond of synthesizers with a rough shine and drum grooves that fuse scratchy machine programming with fluid playing from her collaborators Avila Santo and Michael J. Thomas III. She's got a bricoleur's sensibility, too: ""Works"" fleshes out a shuffling disco groove with grinding metallic accents and a filigree of delay that recalls Manuel Göttsching's Balearic classic, ""E2-E4""; in ""Market Solution"", the drum programming has a no-nonsense flair similar to Daphni's ""Ye Ye"", while the sine-wave bassline sounds, ever so faintly, like Vince Guaraldi covering ""Sleng Teng"". But Loggins has her own voice, and one of the indicators is how naturally the whole thing flows. The opener, ""Pneumatic for the People"", is a dramatic scene-setter—bright keys, freeform soloing, rolling drum fills with lots of splash and ride cymbal—that seamlessly segues into ""Works"". There's something almost triumphant about the latter—it's radiant, giddy, some real standing-on-top-of-a-waterfall shit, right down to the rainbow-like spray of frequencies her keys give off. ""Market Solution"" sinks into a groove that's more efficient but just as ecstatic—get a load of those sampled yelps and glistening arpeggios—and then she dials it back a notch with ""Median"", a beatific organ piece that sounds like a bedroom producer's response to Steve Reich or Terry Riley. On an album of highlights, ""Cole Dub"" is the biggest moment—a thumping, glowing, full-band house number full of jazzy Rhodes riffing, live percussion, and dubbed-out saxophone (courtesy Sonnymoon's Dane Orr) that's as sunny as tape can handle without melting from the heat. Even Loggins seems to know that it's all downhill from there: ""Rag"" is a straight-ahead dancefloor track, and the ambient ""Castle"" brings everything to a close with sunrise synths and understated grace. Well, almost. There's one more song, ""Tophat"", an eight-minute bass-and-drums jam—a coda, more than anything. But it feels deserved. The album's biggest shift from Time Wharp's previous work is the confidence she shows in letting her songs develop at a relaxed pace. After a set as effortless and joyful as this, it's natural to want one last dance.","The jazzy, broken-beat house of producer Kaye Loggins brings to mind artists like Floating Points and Four Tet. On her full-length debut, she leaves behind hyper-speed footwork beats and short and dense track fragments for a well-paced and flowing whole.

Pay Attention!,The Mothmen,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aea2c0084474cd0c192c/1:1/w_160/c887d002.jpg,2015-06-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20657-pay-attention/,On-U SoundOn-U Sound,"When we think about the creative process we normally think of people coming up with the best ideas they can and executing them to the best of their abilities. There’s another way of working that isn’t as widely discussed, but under the right conditions can produce equally good results, and that’s taking your worst, dumbest ideas and blindly smashing them together. And that’s apparently how the Mothmen made their 1981 album Pay Attention!, an interestingly strange post-punk artifact that’s being reissued by Adrian Sherwood’s On-U Sound. The band obviously had musical smarts. Three of its four members were in the original lineup of the Durutti Column, and all three quit together after Factory records founder Tony Wilson proved himself to be too meddlesome a boss. (The fourth, tellingly, came from a comedy band called Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias.) Three of them went on to have lifelong careers in the music industry that included producing records, managing artists, running labels, and, for two of them, stints in the rhythm section of Simply Red. (Guitarist David Rowbotham fell on hard times and was brutally murdered in 1991, but earned a measure of musical immortality as the subject of the Happy Mondays’ ""Cowboy Dave"".) During their time in the Mothmen, though, all four seem to have ignored those smarts, or possibly consulted them solely to do the opposite of what those smarts said. In the reissue’s lengthy liner notes, drummer Chris Joyce describes their creative process as centering around getting tremendously stoned and having unpremeditated free-form basement jam sessions that they recorded on cassette tapes in case anything worth saving emerged. Between their outre composition methods, the UK post-punk scene’s permissive attitude toward genre combinations, and the band’s high amounts of music nerdiness, Pay Attention! covers an impressive amount of stylistic ground, and produces a number of fascinatingly strange juxtapositions. Intergalactically chill dub reggae turns on a dime into anxiety-riddled Kraftwerk impressions. Syd Barrett’s naive psychedelic twee pop collides with bombastic prog rock. ""Dr. Who"" sound effects are recruited to make Moroccan-style trance music. As you should expect from such helter skelter creative means, some of the material falls short. The 20-minute-long Captain-Beefheart-meets-the-Master-Musicians-of-Joujouka jam ""Mothman"", for instance, is at least 19 minutes too long. (Although both the song itself and the band’s decision to give it its own side of the album say a lot about the quality of hash they were smoking.) But a respectable number of Pay Attention!’s songs, and the various bonus tracks included with the reissue, manage to get off the ground, even if they’re a little ungainly in flight. Even at their stoner goofiest the band had a knack for channeling a particular kind of electric discordant charge that gave their work an unpredictable but potent vibrancy—the same kind of crackle that you get from acts like Thee Oh Sees and Liars who seem to take similar delight in being counterintuitive. So while the Mothmen have always been a footnote in the history of post-punk (something this reissue’s not likely to change), it’s a footnote that adds a fascinating kink to the bigger story around it.","Three of the Mothmen's four members were in the original lineup of the Durutti Column, and two had stints in the rhythm section of Simply Red.

Black Age Blues,Goatsnake,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae589d034d5c69bf4517/1:1/w_160/76060b0a.jpg,2015-06-05 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20598-black-age-blues/,Southern Lord,"During their decade-plus long disappearance, the supergroup status of the doom band Goatsnake grew. When the quartet released their last album, 2000’s Flower of Disease, the new project of guitarist Greg Anderson, an amplifier-worship duo he called Sunn O))), had issued its debut LP only months earlier. Scream—the childhood hardcore Virginia crew and talent crucible of Goatsnake singer Pete Stahl—had yet to reunite. And neither had the Obsessed, the atavistic doom squad of drummer Greg Rogers. But in recent years, the rise or reactivation of those respective projects and a wave of young acts exploring a Goatsnake-like mix of Southern rock heroics and distortion-heavy harangues have retroactively elevated the band to a near-mythical position. In the first life, Goatsnake existed for less than five years and issued two good albums; in the afterlife and now the resurrection, they have fostered a legacy much more significant than the original output ever portended. After occasional concerts during the last five years, Goatsnake returned to the studio last summer to stage a proper comeback. The resulting nine-song set, Black Age Blues, affirms their long-standing love of metal force and classic-rock verve without pushing the mix to many new extremes. Though they swapped bassist Scott Reeder for Sourvein player Scott Renner (what are the chances?), Goatsnake staged the album as a literal continuation of Flower of Disease. That LP ended with a song called ""The River"", which closed with an eerie, extended strings-and-sirens dénouement. So this record opens with ""Another River to Cross"", which begins by sampling that old ellipsis before the band slams down with four-piece force. They sound excellent and energized, Anderson’s riff racing through switchbacks beneath Stahl’s arching, almost-gleeful reflections on mortality. The next 40 minutes wind through mid-tempo rumbles and howling harmonica solos, blustery riffs and muscular drum fills, Zeppelin references and ""C.C. Rider"" nods, songs about existential crises and songs about earthly delights. With hazy hooks powered by a mighty band, Black Age Blues is, as advertised, very much the third Goatsnake album. But Black Age Blues is strongest when it suggests that the members and their musical relationships have evolved during Goatsnake’s recess, especially when the past presents new stylistic tension. For his part, Stahl is more confident and convincing as a Southern soul-loving leader. He commands a small background choir—""Dem Preachers’ Daughters,"" they call themselves—throughout the record, sometimes letting them lift his leads and sometimes dueling with their harmonies. He stutters syllables like an unabashed Robert Plant acolyte and stretches his words skywards like a gospel singer bound for glory. These traits thrill when they clash with Anderson’s own development as an ultra-low-and-slow guitarist. ""House of the Moon"", for instance, opens with a rich tone and ominous lurch that suggest Sunn O))). Even as the choir joins Stahl to exclaim things like ""Shine on"" during the chorus, Anderson burrows deeper, his menacing variations providing a sinister foil to the ascendant soul vocals. And near the end of the great ""Coffee & Whiskey"", Anderson and Stahl wrestle on tape. The singer squeals and exhorts like he’s moonlighting with the Faces. The guitarist, meanwhile, strangles a dense theme into submission, refusing to join the joy ride. That disparity was always a key to Goatsnake, but as the interests of its members have grown, such frisson has become as vital to the sound as the songs themselves. Through little fault of Goatsnake’s own, listening to Black Age Blues can sometimes feel like watching wizened blues musicians play the music of their now-distant youth. The style is familiar enough to be comforting, but it’s also inherently trite and redundant. You’ve already heard the permutations that have followed. Since Goatsnake released Flower of Disease, there’s been a renaissance of provocative doom, particularly from bands doubly influenced by psychedelic and Southern rock. It’s impossible not to think about how Weedeater might distort and destroy the chemical surge of ""Coffee & Whiskey"" or to what new lysergic limits Kylesa could push closer ""A Killing Blues"". Goatsnake add some tricks and twists for Black Age Blues, but as if in deference to the supergroup side-project’s nature, they don’t aim to reinvent themselves or their sound. Instead, they simply have fun playing with the past and delivering at least a few new anthems in the process. At least that’s better than plenty of their reunited peers cashing in on the festival circuit even attempt, let alone accomplish.","Featuring Sunn O)))'s Greg Anderson, Scream's Pete Stahl, and Greg Rogers of the Obsessed, the doom band Goatsnake's supergroup status grew during their decade-plus long disappearance.

Before the World Was Big,Girlpool,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adb2c0084474cd0c1780/1:1/w_160/c362f631.png,2015-06-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20465-before-the-world-was-big/,Wichita,"The tiniest notes, the biggest sentiments: Girlpool make songs that feel audaciously small, like an eyedropper pointed toward the heavens. The 10 songs on Before the World Was Big not only employ a bare minimum of chords (two, pretty much always) but a minimum of notes. If you’d never held a guitar, or even seen one, you could be gently coached to play ""Ideal World"", the album’s opening track, within three minutes of being handed one. The same is true of many others. And yet, Before the World Was Big brims with a mysterious power, a charged and palpable sense of hope and awe. Focusing on the clean bones of the songs only leads you to be astonished by how full they feel. This is music with no corners, no hidden places in the arrangements, and the emotions emerge with gratifying clarity. Harmony Tividad and Cleo Tucker—who sing occasionally in harmony and occasionally in unison, but always together—seem to be singing in the center of an empty, well-lit room, staring directly at you. To listen to Before the World Was Big is to meet their gaze and feel slightly unnerved and exhilarated. It is a quiet album of uncommon intensity. Tividad and Tucker formed Girlpool when they were 17 and 18, and they told anyone who asked them at the time that they were drawn to each other for their shared sense of purpose: ""We wanted something that was honest and straightforward,"" Tucker said. ""We both wanted to be super vulnerable…Because of the stripped down nature of our music, if one of us messes up, it’s incredibly noticeable. We’re not trying to hide."" In part, it is this clarity of purpose that resounds from the empty spaces on their debut LP. Their EP was shouted, and in its hardy squall, you could hear two powerful voices honing in on some way they might make a dent in the universe. Sometimes, it felt like watching a kid run into a wall. They sound calmer and infinitely more assured here. The final song’s title, ""I Like That You Can See It"", stands as a simple manifesto. The song is about harnessing nerves and vulnerability as sources of power, and it repeats the striking image: ""Is it pouring out my body? My nervous aching?/ I like that you can see it."" The arrangement performs the same act. There are two chords, played with two fingers, and yet the song feels bigger every time you listen to it. Somewhere between their formation and now, Tividad and Tucker have divined the starry-eyed power of the purest indie-pop. It is a romanticism that thrives on potential energy, on the contemplation of things that haven't quite happened. Romanticism occurs in the distance between what might happen and what does, and listening to Before the World Was Big feels like walking through this exalted liminal space. ""I feel safest in knowing that I am true/ When I look in your eyes, the idea of you,"" they sing with clarion force on ""Ideal World"". ""I just miss how it felt standing next to you/ Wearing matching dresses before the world was big,"" they chant on the title track, a line that doubles into a round-robin singalong. Tividad and Tucker’s voices are foregrounded, always. They sing about real-life friends, by their first names. They reference each other by first name in their lyrics. ""I am still looking for sureness in the way I say my name,"" they sing on ""Chinatown"". Their twinned vocals gives the album a powerful and traceable through line—these are songs about two specific friends who have realized that the world is a less frightening place, that you feel surer and safer in it, with someone else by you.","The indie-pop duo Girlpool's debut LP, Before the World Was Big, brims with a mysterious power, a charged and palpable sense of hope and awe.

Surf,Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeabc0084474cd0c1938/1:1/w_160/04db1a45.jpg,2015-06-05 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20664-surf/,self-released,"Surf begins like the Beach Boys and ends with the loping pop melody of a lost 1970s AM radio record. These moments bookend a world and a worldview; as its title suggests, the album is a musical vacation. Instead of following a straightforward path, Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment spill outward, finding new inlets and tributaries to explore. Surf contains multitudes, contradictions: ambitious, but playfully so; lighthearted in spirit but fiercely moral; wide-ranging in its influences, mapped onto a coherent whole. It's a new sound built on lots of older ones—indie, hip-hop, funk, rock, gospel, various strains of R&B, The Lion King soundtrack—and despite bringing on a large cast and letting each person play their part, the guests all exist on the Social Experiment's terrain. The album touches on many ideas and moods, but above all, is a celebration of friendship, and a tribute to the alchemic power of collaboration. Chance the Rapper's success allowed the group the space to take such a purposefully meandering approach. In the wake of his hugely successful sophomore tape Acid Rap, Chance ignored the industry's baits and lures. Freed from its constraints and pressures, with a devoted flock waiting eagerly behind him, he's directed his time and energy to his friends. So as you may have heard, this album does not belong to Chance the Rapper, but to Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment (that's Nico Segal and Peter ""Cottontale"" Wilkins, Nate Fox, Greg ""Stix"" Landfair Jr., and Chancelor Bennett himself). The group has extraordinary range, and thanks to time on the road as Chance's touring band, the chops to execute. But whatever the name on the packaging, this project does belong to Chance the Rapper: He is still the album's main draw, and despite the number of guests and the cover art billing, its guiding spirit feels reflective of his own ideas and values—albeit in a less intensive, less personal form than on Acid Rap. Donnie Trumpet, though, is our official headliner, and as such, the album intermittently features his horn's impressionistic interludes. On ""Nothing Came to Me"" and ""Something Came to Me"", his smeared, effects-laden playing recalls Don Ellis or Jon Hassell. But Donnie Trumpet also makes his presence known throughout the record, punctuating the marching band-meets-MJ dancefloor record ""Slip Slide"", or taking a fiery solo on ""Just Wait"". The overall sonic blueprint coheres gradually, as a diverse range of records bundle up a diverse range of sounds: say, a Bone Thugs-style harmony (""Just Wait""), a Rick James-style funk groove (""Wanna Be Cool""), or an ""American Boy""-style disco record (""Go""). Despite the variety of influences and ideas, the vision coheres in the details: use of space, rhythmic variation, creative whimsy, a musicality that feels consciously shaped to convey levity, comfort, and freedom. Certain tracks feel more like frames without pictures, melted sandcastles rather than the fully functioning parapets of actual songs. In some sense, the constellation of sounds isn't far from a DJ mix. Think, maybe, of the beachfront party eclecticism of the Avalanches as produced by the Mizell Brothers and Kirk Franklin, heavily featuring the Art Ensemble of Chicago's Lester Bowie. But these pieces are linked in large part by the quirks of Chance's personality. And these quirks can sometimes be divisive. It's hard to imagine anyone could be mad at Chance: as rap stars go, he appears about as decent and well-adjusted as a person can possibly be. But he boldly and unapologetically embraces aesthetics that, historically, aren't fashionable, or are seen as uncool: the affected staginess of musical theater, the lyrical pretensions of slam poetry, a nostalgia not just for the memories of childhood, but the very feelings of childhood innocence. His debut project 10 Day stood out so starkly in its innocence, it was easy to see it as unconscious naivete; now, it seems quite purposeful, a point Chance makes explicit on ""Wanna Be Cool"", a song featuring Big Sean and KYLE with vocals from Jeremih. The record's message of self-love in the face of social pressure, and the fruitlessness of cool-chasing, aren't merely ""Hip to Be Square"" updates for 2015, but represents Chance's wider philosophical approach. Acid Rap, an easy critical favorite, dealt with ""serious"" subjects, autobiographical and sociopolitical, and implied a looming darkness: an artist who'd created a space for himself and his friends to flourish wrestled with the encroaching troubles of the outside world. Here, the anxiety is tamped down (we're on vacation, after all), and many songs indulge in the rhetoric of self-affirmation and positivity, like the gleeful release of a submerged balloon rushing to the surface. But this isn't a blind, didactic positivity: it often takes the shape of wisdom, and is actually quite practical, an argument and set of tools for living in the real world, as on the coda of ""Slip Side"": ""It ain’t so easy, but it’s not so hard/ To stand up, stand up, but it’s just too easy to sit back down."" (Alternately, the hook to ""Just Wait""—""Good things come to those that wait""—repeated in a similar mantra format, is the rare moment more suited to a coffee mug.) But just as this album suggest a coherent personal philosophy, Chance resists taking himself too seriously, most explicitly on the ambiguous ""Windows"", which he's called his favorite song on the tape: ""Don't trust a word I say."" That record itself is driven primarily by its enigmatic lyrics and unusual composition, its vocals a tonal color, with foregrounded percussion. But if we are not to listen to his words, his actions provide an equally responsible blueprint: his generosity with the guest list is democratic in the extreme. Chance and Donnie elevate friends from his hometown (rappers Saba and Joey Purp, King Louie and Noname Gypsy) to equal footing with musical legends (Erykah Badu, Busta Rhymes) and established stars (Quavo from Migos, J. Cole). In several instances, it is the locals whose parts shine brightest: poet and singer Jamila Woods' feature on ""Questions"", in addition to providing tonal balance, is the album's emotive heart, a moment of elegiac reflection. The core of Chance's principled approach might suggest a line of continuity with Kendrick Lamar, and what the writer Reggie Ugwu described as his ""radical Christianity."" And certainly, his music is rooted in gospel, and he stakes a moral position when such stances are readily dismissed in certain corners. Church is even referenced explicitly in ""Sunday Candy"". But Chance's position on religion is elusive. ""Sunday Candy"" could certainly be read as a statement of religious intent, but it's first and foremost a song about familial love, and all of the particulars of Christianity become vivid, evocative associations not with spiritual life through religion, but through love of friends and family. There's a classic disco record by Dinosaur L—a group built around the avant-garde cellist and disco producer/songwriter Arthur Russell—called ""Go Bang"", popular at the Paradise Garage, in which vocalists shout out: ""I want to see, all my friends at once!/ I'd do anything, to get the chance to go back!"" In many ways, what feels fulfilling about Surf is in the fantasy of its creation: of musicians and friends who've secured the fanbase to experiment, working together to explore their creative impulses, letting each artist's fingerprints help shape a singular product. It's that sense of collaboration that energizes this project, and as much as this feels like an accomplishment already, it points equally to future possibilities. Chance has admitted to fantasies of Michael Jackson-level pop success, and while he's taking his time here, there's an element of looking to the future even in his rapping. While written with absolute precision and poetic skill that rivals the best rappers currently working, Chance's words tumble from his mouth effortlessly, as if he's already done with the verse by the time he recites it, looking to what's next.","Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment serve as Chance the Rapper's touring band, and on Surf, he and the group tap into a wide-ranging, joyfully meandering spirit.

That’s the hand that plays the bass lines on piano, the hand used by early keys pounders like Jerry Lee Lewis, Moon Mullican, and Fats Domino to put a little bit of boogie in their blues. That left hand gave ""Great Balls of Fire"" its lusty pep and ""Blueberry Hill"" its making-time thrill. So, when the Deslondes open their self-titled debut with a walking piano line played way, way down the left side of the keyboard, they’re not just playing a rhythm that sounds distinctive in 2015 but also conveying an entire pop history that spans New Orleans rhythm and blues, early Memphis rock, Louisiana Hayride country, and every pick-up jazz band ever to busk on Royal Street. Plus, it just sounds damn good. ""Fought the Blues and Won"" lopes along on that syncopated bass line, which makes the band’s hangdog harmonies come off a bit more determined, even if they don’t sound quite triumphant. The blues will just show up again tomorrow, and they’re bracing for another fight. “It might hit you from all sides, or right between the eyes,” sings Riley Downing, one of four singers and five songwriters in the Deslondes. “Keep on going.” Using the piano as a rhythm section instrument certainly distinguishes the band from a lot of their country peers, who more often use it for melody or atmosphere. The Deslondes are highlights of an unlikely country scene based in New Orleans of all places, a city with a rich and renowned music history that includes everything but country. But a new generation of acts—including Hurray for the Riff Raff, Luke Winslow King, the Longtime Goners, and the late, lamented Sundown Songs—is marrying twang with Crescent City rhythms. The Deslondes cut their teeth in street bands busking for tourist change and in pick-up acts playing backyard barbecues, both of which can be laboratories for testing new ideas and distilling songs down to their essence. So their debut introduces a band that sounds confident and fully formed. Every song contains some new flourish or some new idea to distinguish it, whether it’s the spidery pedal steel of ""Low Down Soul"", the spiky guitar riff that comes out of nowhere on ""The Real Deal"", or even the quiet clarinet solo that illuminates closer ""Out on the Rise"" from the inside. They take nothing about country or R&B or New Orleans for granted, but consider everything anew. ""Less Honkin’ More Tonkin’"" is too fast to really honkytonk to, and that’s okay because it’s about a traffic jam. Even ""Louise"", the most traditionally brokenhearted song here, is interrupted by a shuffling two-step guitar rhythm, as though the Deslondes know that the best thing about Johnny Cash wasn’t the clothes or the myth but the men backing him. Somehow the country gospel of ""Those Were (Could’ve Been) the Days"" and the Morricone-on-the-cowboy-trail arrangement of ""Time to Believe In"" actually sound fresh in 2015. Even as these songs delve deep into the past, they never sound calculated or revivalist, which is refreshing after the parade of tweed jackets and uplifting choruses that have defined Americana for the last several years. Instead, The Deslondes sounds like something scavenged and salvaged, as though the band members found that walking bass line or that rockabilly rhythm just lying around on the street, unused and abandoned. They know it’d be a shame to let it go to waste.","The Deslondes, featuring four singers and five songwriters, are highlights of a country scene based in New Orleans, a city with a rich and renowned music history that includes everything but country.

The Clearing,Rachel Grimes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae85b1335d7bf1699db5/1:1/w_160/ab62f316.jpg,2015-06-04 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20635-the-clearing/,Temporary Residence,"After Rodan, a Louisville post-hardcore band that wracked the raw Slint template with mathy tangles, the late guitarist Jason Noble made a natural transition to the more atmospheric Rachel's. They were ahead of the curve on integrating chamber music with post-rock, and even further ahead on drawing inspiration from 20th-century minimalism rather than older classical music. With the addition of key members Christian Frederickson on viola and Rachel Grimes on piano, they were just in front of Godspeed and just behind Dirty Three, whom they resembled in their lonesome, ramshackle temperament. They put out some indelible records in the back half of the '90s and continued into the mid-'00s. Since then, Rachel Grimes has struck out on a post-classical career that jettisons the rock vestiges of the band that coincidentally took her name. She started small, with respectable post-minimal solo piano pieces, on Book of Leaves. Now, she is after a larger quarry: the contemporary chamber ensemble. But she does not quite capture it on The Clearing. With more than a dozen musicians (including electronic processing by Scott Morgan of Loscil) revolving through laborious arrangements, the record feels under-composed and overdesigned. The grace that marks the best of Rachel's and Grimes' solo piano is oppressed by ambitious but vague gestures that evoke John Cage's enigmatic piano phrasing and La Monte Young's keen long tones to unclear ends. At first, the record rigidly alternates between short interludes and long tracks, though the pattern relaxes as it goes along. The former range from the Eno-like slow-motion tumble of ""The Air"" to ""Transverse Plane Vertical"", where a string section, a bassist, a harpist, a drummer, and several winds all crowd into a kind of country-less folk dance. Oddly, these shorter pieces are some of the most thorough. On the longer ones, perfunctory harshness tries to distract from inchoate forms. Neither the glockenspiel-like embellishments nor the dissonant bleats of cello and viola have much to do with the irritating stuck piano note on the title track. Lower piano notes add to the textural and harmonic murk, though the strings contain the germ of an idea—Middle Eastern ululations as sternly imagined by Mahler, perhaps. But no melody lodges in the ear, and the piece plods. It's a very long eight minutes that never really seems to arrive. It's not the only time an idea refuses to take shape. On ""The Herald"", Jacob Duncan's saxophone brings in a nocturnal soft-jazz flavor, which is not bad except for the desultory blurts of piano. The piano part improves when the jazz subsides, but the alternation of these two modes is unsatisfying; they refuse to become compatible. Eventually, the piano begins to play melodiously with the winds and the track slips into a pocket, if not exactly a resolved structure. Grimes usually fares best with sonority. Though ""Further Foundation"" has awkward spots, particularly in its clunky pizzicato, it's relatively pretty and unencumbered, with a piano line like sheets of rain washing down a window. The music comes unclogged, tapping into some of the old post-rock sweep and space. The latter can be especially hard to find. ""In the Vapor With the Air Underneath"" is like an un-limpid Harold Budd. The piano patters tightly against its own granulated shine, and the lack of breathing room, with clumpy timbres and clotted harmonies, is characteristic of the record. We relate to instrumental music in ways beyond how it sounds—we also relate to the composer's decisions and intentions. It's on this second level that The Clearing can be confusing. ""The Air at Night"" is a long ambient outro with little to distinguish it at the compositional level. It becomes especially stark when the usual slow piano chords, played with unvarying timing, return, their tone made limp and wilted for some reason. It's a wan centerpiece for such a long table, and I have no instinct as to how to interpret the gesture, which is to say, how to feel. Grimes drops us into some deep thickets, but gives us no compass by which to find our way, and her record's titular concept proves elusive.","After Rachel's broke up in the mid-2000s, Rachel Grimes struck out on a post-classical career that jettisoned the rock vestiges of the band that took her name.

Grands Tyrans,Akitsa,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae719d034d5c69bf454b/1:1/w_160/473fce0f.jpg,2015-06-04 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20619-grands-tyrans/,Hospital Productions,"Montreal black metal group Akitsa, led by Outre-Tombe (""O.T."" henceforth), are a perplexing and fascinating entity. They are the sort of band that does more than their peers, but don't make much fuss about how they're ""different."" You hear a deep understanding of black metal's origins in their music as well as sneaky, understated radicalism. In particular, Akitsa combines the isolation of second-wave black metal, the primal punkiness of first wave, and power electronics into a defiant, affirming body of work. They also paved the way for the burgeoning Québécois black metal scene, while remaining above it all. Grands Tyrans is their fifth full-length, their first since 2010's Au crépuscule de l'espérance, and it also sees O.T. taking over Akitsa from his bandmate Néant. It's their leanest and most focused effort, while not abandoning the diversity that puts them far ahead of many of their contemporaries. ""Dévoilé"" seems like a pretty typical black metal track at first: it opens with a brief passage of dry-toned guitar before giving way to six minutes of hallowed shrieks and melodies arising from static-like guitar. If you're a black metal fan, this is the sort of thing you've heard on plenty of budget cassettes. But O.T.'s ambitions come through in the forthright grandiosity of ""Dévoilé""'s melody. ""Faucon"" is another song that elevates conventions, with O.T.'s playing creating a vicious slashing effect that's much harsher than what you would normally find in recordings this lo-fi. You can feel the purpose in his movements, as if he's actually harming the guitar itself. O.T. doesn't deny starting out with the thrash basics like many a metalhead, and ""Le feu de l'abîme"" is the closest to classic metal that Akitsa's gotten. With O.T. warbling over what could be a blackened Manilla Road passage, ""L'abîme"" resembles present-day Darkthrone had they not abandoned the cold buzz they ushered in. ""Chimères"" takes the impulses of ""L'abîme"" and pushes them into nearly surrealistic realms. O.T. becomes a grinning jester, lending an almost Oi!-like wobble to his riffs and clean vocals. The title track warps doom into Akitsa's likeness not by just simply slowing the pace, but by laying down warped dungeon synth below and O.T. transforming his clean singing into a snotty cry. For all the shit black metal gets for drowning in the tars of tradition, Akitsa are adept at breathing new life into well-worn metal forms, then conforming them into their blackened vision.","The Montreal black metal group Akitsa are adept at breathing new life into well-worn metal forms, then conforming them into their blackened vision.

Gold and Stone,Eternal Summers,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aea313d197565213a13b/1:1/w_160/34057e40.jpg,2015-06-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20658-gold-and-stone/,Kanine,"In hindsight, Eternal Summers might've reconsidered their name. The Virginia band formed in 2009, during indie rock's brief beach craze, and that sunny moniker made it mighty easy to group them with all those other acts making nostalgic, heavily reverbed pop, even though their own take on the style had more of a wiry, punk edge. That they shared bills with Best Coast and Dum Dum Girls only further typecast them. ""We came out at a time when jangly, summertime and beachy songs were a thing. And we got lumped in together,"" singer/guitarist Nicole Yun recently lamented. ""I knew in my heart of hearts that I wanted our music to sound more sonically distorted and aggressive than all that."" Most of the big names from the beach boom have fallen on hard times, either breaking up, fading away, or struggling to recapture their early spark, but Eternal Summers have proven more adaptive than many of the bands they came up with. Over the years they've added a member, bassist Jonathan Woods, who helped the duo fill some of their considerable empty space, and gradually built up their sound into something far statelier than the scrappy pop of their initial singles, adopting moves from shoegaze, C86 pop, and a wide array of '90s alternative. Gold and Stone, the band's fourth album in five years, is the latest testament to their ever-broadening range. As might be expected from an album released so soon after last year's The Drop Beneath and recorded at the same Austin, Texas studio, the record picks up where its predecessor left off, expanding on the anthemic grandeur that record introduced. The group remains loyal to their usual muses—Galaxie 500, most prominently—but they continue to reshuffle those influences into some surprising configurations. At its most vibrant, Gold and Stone recalls another recent dream-pop album with an unsettled infrastructure, A Sunny Day in Glasgow's Sea When Absent, especially in its embrace of interruption. Whenever things begin to feel too complacent—whenever the guitars shimmer too blissfully for too long—there's always a shake-up on the horizon. The moody strums of opener ""Unassigned"" give way to shots of feedback and clatter. The plucky single ""Together or Alone"" cuts its chipper groove with hysteric shouts. Though Yun usually defaults to the sweet, celestial voice of so many shoegaze singers, she's not afraid to roll in the mud, too. On ""Black Diamond"" she adopts a punk sneer to shame an over-controlling lover—""If you want I could be strung up in pearls for you,"" she sings, her voice raw with contempt—and she works herself into a huffy fit on the album's fiercest rocker, ""Play Dead"", another kiss-off. These heated moments are aberrations, little breaks from the Eternal Summers' default dreaminess, but they show so much personality that it's hard not to wish there were a few more of them. Agitation flatters this band. In interviews, Yun has explained that Eternal Summers record under self-imposed deadlines, which would explain their efficient, album-a-year clip. Those deadlines also seem to have shaped the band's compact songwriting. There are moments on Gold and Stone when it seems like these songs long to wander off, to further explore some of these textures and moods, but not a single track extends past the four-minute mark, almost as if out of fear of throwing the album off its tight schedule. Yun's grown into such a sharp guitar player that a logical next step for the band might be to toss the timeline out the window for their fifth album and record an unchecked, sprawling epic in the style of one of the more unlikely bands the group has cited as recent inspiration, …And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead. Or they could just return to the same studio for a week to cut another album as concise and efficient as this one. It speaks to Eternal Summers' versatility that either sounds like a winning proposition.","On their fourth album, Eternal Summers remain loyal to their usual muses—Galaxie 500, most prominently—but they continue to reshuffle those influences into some surprising configurations.

Chrissybaby Forever,Christopher Owens,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aeaab1335d7bf1699df2/1:1/w_160/856f15aa.jpg,2015-06-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20663-chrissybaby-forever/,Turnstile,"""I was tempted to call this Christopher Owens' Album, because for me it's really about getting back to the basics,"" Christopher Owens told Stereogum last week. He was talking about his new solo album Chrissybaby Forever, which he made available to stream on May 27, a few days before its official digital release, and the sentiment prompted a question: What does a ""back to the basics"" album look like for an artist who traffics in the basics? Owens named his breakout group, which consisted of two men, ""Girls."" His songs relied on the simplest, most dog-eared lyrics imaginable, and he reached for chord progressions that you can anticipate in your bones. His first solo album, 2013's Lysandre, was written almost entirely in the key of A. Open chords, open voicings, open arrangements—everything open. How do you reduce further down than that? Chrissybaby is the product of a fruitful, month-long recording session with engineer JJ Wiesler, with Owens playing all the instruments. (It turns out this is what he means by ""back to the basics."") The album opens with the same strummed chord that introduced ""Lust for Life""; Owens is unafraid of reminding you of other work, even songs he's already written. But Chrissybaby turns out to be more imaginative, looser, more lively, and more appealing than his music has been in a few years. There are quirks and little touches here, hiccups or fillips that he might have beveled off of previous projects for fear they added resistance to his classic pop songwriting. These songs are allowed to be weirder, and in smaller bites they're tangier and stranger than they've tasted in awhile. The best tracks on the short album are a good argument that Owens is more appealing the less grandiose he gets. He whistles pretty melodies on ""Heroine (Got Nothing on You)"" like Ram-era Paul McCartney. ""I Love You Like I Do"" consists of a few lines about loving someone for who they are with the lyric sheet instruction ""(repeat to infinity)."" It is sung by a chorale of female voices, and it feels both like a lullaby and a distillation of Owens' mission, which is to use pop music to comfort and uplift you, and to remind you that you are loved. It's hard to be as captivated by his innocence or his openness, though you can still be comforted and charmed by it. ""It's not 1+1, or ABC/ It's not a formula or a mystery/ It's not right or wrong, it's just the music of my heart"" is the chorus to ""Music of My Heart"", and typing it out feels like enumerating the chemical makeup of sugar. The point of the song is the feeling, and the feeling he creates is generous and relaxed and, again, open. The song around the lyrics moves in enough interesting directions to keep it from turning into a scented greeting card: It's a series of tiny sounds (a squelching, distorted bass, some hand percussion, isolated guitar strokes) appearing in corners of a spacious arrangement like cartoon gophers popping their heads up in an open field. There are a few flickering shadows in the lyrics here and there. ""Me Oh My"" is a weightless, silvery song about mistrust, and on ""Selfish Feelings"" he sings, bluntly, about lust and physical need. ""Inside Out"" wrestles in his plain language with despair and doubt. They are faint reminders of the darker, bigger things he can tackle when he sets his sights on them, and of his ability to set stories taken directly from his life in elemental, universal terms. When he sings ""I'm still out looking for a spiritual release/ I'm not an antichrist I just can't fake belief"" on ""Inside Out"", it resounds with both painfully specific and powerfully general meaning. Chrissybaby is 16 songs long, which might be more of this particular pleasant, low-stakes mood than you need at one uninterrupted stretch. Sometimes you might crave a sharper thought than he seems interested in formulating, or a darker sound than he wants to make. But that's all right. He's going to make another record soon, almost certainly (to hear him tell it, he wrote and recorded this one almost before he realized it was happening), and even if his moment in the zeitgeist has passed, he seems like an artist who is always going to be here, telling us what he needs us to hear in the most direct language he can find. He is going to remain open, and so should we.","Chrissybaby Forever, Christopher Owens' third post-Girls solo collection, is the product of a fruitful, month-long recording session, with Owens playing all the instruments.

Zhala,Zhala,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aea0b1335d7bf1699de3/1:1/w_160/f99ac62d.jpg,2015-06-03 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20656-zhala/,Konichiwa,"During her television debut at last year's music video-themed Grammis, Zhala Rifat turned ""Prophet"", a ""Mortal Kombat""-core techno rave-up and the Swedish singer's biggest single to date, into a visual riff on ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". Backed by the requisite jumping cheerleaders and bored-looking spectators in a set of makeshift bleachers, Rifat's set choice was unusual—nothing on her self-titled debut, a frenetic, strobe-lit dance record from start to finish, seems influenced by Nirvana whatsoever, ""Prophet"" least of all. But with her label boss Robyn beside her, the two of them leaping into a choreographed, athletic dance routine with the cheerleaders and onlookers joining in, the re-enactment seemed to make some more sense. Rifat, like her fembot mentor and Nirvana before her, finds rapture in agitating the boring status quo through music, whether by inserting a chaotic, grunge-inspired dance performance into Sweden's answer to the Grammys or go-go dancing until dawn at her former Stockholm ""gayhappening"" club Donna Scam. If Zhala is Sweden's next big pop export, she's surely one of the most idiosyncratic. That being said, it comes as something of a surprise that Rifat, as the only act signed to Konichiwa Records apart from Robyn herself, doesn't seem compelled to distance herself from the pop savant's shadow. Instead, on Zhala, Rifat pulls generously from her Scandinavian pop and electronic forebears, most distinctly in the mechanical Knife-like drum patterns, aerobic Robyn-esque melodies, and jagged Röyksopp synths that make up the building blocks for her kitchen-sink vision. Electro workouts like ""Aerobic Lambada"" and ""Lunch"" sound like deep cuts from Body Talk filtered through the howling, experimental wheelhouse of Gang Gang Dance, while latest single ""Holy Bubbles"", with its ABBA-sized synths and strangely exultant, chanted outro (""I'll be kind/ Don't be too kind""), stretches her sound into teeming disco territory. Elsewhere, the pristine ""Prince in the Jungle"" and ballad ""Right Way's Wrong"" benefit from slower, more languid tempos, offering welcome smoke breaks from the club-ready clamor. ""Prophet"", which reappears here alongside two other tracks from a previous EP, is still Rifat's best, a tense, formidable techno freak-out that seems designed for some kind of decadent/disturbing acid trip with comedowns built into it for good measure. Speaking at Robyn's Tekla conference this past April, Rifat said she taught herself Ableton through YouTube tutorials to better sustain the singular vision she had for her music. Here, assisted by lone co-producer Mathias Oldén, it's a trait that reveals itself in the more unconventional production flourishes—guitar peals that skid in and drift off like a passing motorcycle, Spaghetti Western whistles that melt into a warped acid track, roaring voices that bend and circle over pneumatic drum machines. Some lyrics, too, describe an unexpected, poignant gloominess to the high-energy club life Rifat devotes herself to (""Intuition say no more, nobody knows my sadness,"" she sings on ""Aerobic Lambada"", ""nobody but God, but I don't know him that well""). But in the scramble to unify a host of influences, sounds, and ideas, some songs inevitably start to blend together, burying Rifat's vocals in the mix. It's unfortunate, since her voice, which bounds between chanting, singing, and banshee calls, is a triumphant and emphatic instrument when not trampled under bright swathes of synths, squawking bird calls, or pummeling beats. Zhala, according to Rifat, is a conceptual, ""cosmic pop"" journey of self-discovery. Live, she often performs in front of Kurdish or Swedish flags in a purposeful attempt to blur her identity, which, being born in Stockholm to Kurdish parents, she says she was perpetually forced to negotiate as a neither blonde-haired nor blue-eyed child in mid-'90s Sweden. Her heritage comes through on songs like ""Prophet"" and opener ""I'm in Love"", which at their peaks conjure Halparke, a type of Kurdish dance that's typically set to percussive, techno-paced Middle Eastern music. The reference is Zhala's strongest, pushing the album's central dance and electronic motifs into a wider realm that sets the work apart from Robyn or any other Swedish mainstay in recent years. Zhala can be a crowded voyage, but it's Rifat's polychromed, referential creativity that still makes it one worth taking.","Zhala Rifat is the only act signed to Robyn's Konichiwa Records apart from Robyn herself.

Math Ilium Ion EP,André Bratten,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae84c0084474cd0c18f6/1:1/w_160/5b83d4eb.jpg,2015-06-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20634-math-ilium-ion-ep/,Smalltown Supersound,"André Bratten explores the same depopulated yet emotive spans of synths, drums, and bass as his Norwegian post-disco peers. But he also distinguishes himself with a sound you might peg as Teutonic before Scandinavian. While the likes of Prins Thomas and diskJokke range over earth and space, none cover precisely the furrowed, cratered landscape Bratten claims. Featuring dark hues and rough crags, it inspires visions of low, ore-spined mountains. In an Oslo-producer family portrait, you'd imagine Bratten as the lurking one, in the black ribbed turtleneck, looking on severely as porn-mustached Todd Terje makes bunny ears behind Lindstrøm's bucket cap. At six tracks, Math Ilium Ion looks like an EP, but its half-hour length and lack of filler makes it feel like an LP. Bratten consistently cultivates ominous tension, even as he instills a certain measure of stubborn optimism, pressing corroded frequenices into diamond-hard melodies. He avoids clear-cut builds and releases, laying parts with their own internal tension in rows and letting their ripple mete out catharsis. This is especially clear on ""Trommer & Bass"", where heavy basses and scissoring percussion seem to strike at a stationary target, with relentless assassin-like accuracy, for almost five minutes, until the hammering finally drops and glides. Bratten's music has a monstrous mechanical movement, but his tuned toms and chattering patterns are offset with live-feeling accents that rattle in the grid, giving the sense of someone striking a head in real space. The music feels wonderfully self-generative, as if willing itself into being. With its controlled speaker fry and choked-out melody, album highlight ""Yours Sincerely, Andre Bratten"" ingeniously un-crumbles together. Bratten's sounds don't just lurch in; they take shape before our ears. You can picture him slowly turning knobs to tame each wild tone into the groove, which is never far away, even when it decays into textured abstractions that keep alertly pushing it forward. Though many passages of Math Ilium Ion are highly kinetic, only ""Trommer & Bass"" is ready for the floor. The record's games with time are clearly built with the listener in mind. ""The Little Things, Fools and Kings"" opens with a terrific little near-catastrophe. Many tiny elements seem to accelerate in at different rates but arrive simultaneously at the same place, to be promptly drawn taut with one oozing lump of saw waves. By the time we get to the two ""Misconception"" tracks, mutated rave overtones have subsided into something more like ambient house, deep and broad and full of subtle activity. Since we are fully immersed, it's welcome. The only thing even slightly bothersome about Bratten is that sometimes he doesn’t quite nail the landings, which is strange since he takes so much care until then. The abrupt endings of several tracks are startling after all the subtle permutation we've been through, and a little unsatisfying. But that minor complaint really means that, when so much similar music is available, it's easy to stay invested in these long tracks all the way to the end. When the next groove is always one antsy keystroke away, that's saying something for Bratten.","André Bratten explores the same depopulated yet emotive spans of synths, drums, and bass as his Norwegian post-disco peers, but also distinguishes himself with an ominous atmosphere and darker hues.

Era,In Camera,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad669d034d5c69bf436c/1:1/w_160/fa3c48f2.jpg,2015-06-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20407-era/,4AD,"There is no shame in not knowing who In Camera were. Like a few zillion other bands, they formed in the summer of 1978, just as punk rock was turning into post-punk. By the time they recorded their first single, 1980's ""Die Laughing"", they'd clearly had their minds blown by a couple of their contemporaries—especially Bauhaus (for whom they were opening when 4AD's Ivo Watts-Russell first heard them), Joy Division, and Public Image Ltd. They immediately mastered the tone of that moment's music: echoing minor-key drones, a wailing singer with an unpretty voice, rhythms modified from disco to evoke faltering inhuman mechanisms rather than motion and delight, words that suggested imminent disaster. But they weren't quite there. Singer/keyboardist David Steiner didn't have the vocal charisma of a John Lydon or Ian Curtis; their songs announced their intent right up front, and then didn't offer any surprises. Listen to In Camera's ""Fragments of Fear"" on its own, and it sounds like a fine example of its time and genre, with guitarist Andrew Gray's dissonant, trebly riff settling over the recording like a clammy fog. Compare it to, say, Bauhaus's superficially similar ""Terror Couple Kill Colonel"", released on the same label a few months earlier, and you hear what's missing. Bauhaus's song offers the dry wit of its tabloid-headline title, Peter Murphy's out-of-nowhere grunting and panting, and details of intonation that refine its repetitions into hooks. In Camera's song just kind of sounds eerie for four-and-a-half minutes. ""Fragments of Fear"" appeared on In Camera's accurately titled IV Songs EP in late 1980. Around the same time, they recorded three new songs for John Peel's radio show (subsequently released as another EP, Fin), then broke up before they ever made an album. Guitarist Andrew Gray joined their 4AD labelmates the Wolfgang Press; the whole band reconvened briefly in 1991 to finish off four incomplete songs for a retrospective, 13 (Lucky for Some). Era, true to its title, doesn't include those four tracks. Instead, it augments the nine songs of In Camera's original discography with a couple of demos, some indistinct live recordings, and a five-song rehearsal tape. For enthusiasts of the goth/post-punk nexus, it absolutely has its moments: ""The Attic"" is carried by sour, hammering chords from Pete Moore's bass guitar, and ""The Fatal Day""—an 11-minute-plus doom-disco jam from their Peel session—hints at the expanses they might have explored if they stuck around a while. It also has some unintentionally funny flashes of insight into the band: the parts of ""Legion"" that aren't a slower knockoff of Gang of Four's ""Anthrax"" mostly seem to be derived from ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"". But that's fine. Every scene has its geniuses and its hangers-on; pioneers need somebody to follow them. For every band that creates something magnificent and enduring, there are five more who catch on early to their innovations, maybe come up with a couple of good songs, and end up really only being of interest to listeners who are very curious about their great contemporaries' historical context. In Camera were one of those, and there's no shame in that, either.","Era collects nine songs from the '70s post-punk band In Camera along with demos, live recordings, and a five-song rehearsal tape.

Murder for Hire EP,Kevin Gates,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aea413d197565213a13e/1:1/w_160/8a9fd009.jpg,2015-06-03 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20659-murder-for-hire-ep/,self-released,"If you pay close attention to the Baton Rouge rapper Kevin Gates’ volatile Instagram feed, you may start to note some similarities between his videos there and his music. The focal point in the IG clips is Gates’ oversized personality, up close and personal (these videos are usually 90% his face in closeup) but somehow inscrutable: You never really see exactly where he is, or what he’s doing, or fully understand the things he’s getting worked up about. In Gates’ rapping, there is the same strange dichotomy of intimacy and mysteriousness: Often, we get a window into an extremely specific and personal story without seeing its full arc. Gates refuses to hold our hand as he zigzags between talking points and styles, which is why we hang on his every word and gesture—we search for context, closure, and understanding, but it's constantly withheld. The video monologues begin and end mid-thought, suggesting a faucet being turned on and off, and his flow, too, is like a source that just has to be been tapped into, rather than started up and wound down. Increasingly, these days, Gates’ music sounds like an unfiltered representation of his id. It’s less carefully fashioned than on his unerringly catchy Luca Brasi Story or the street-rap style primer By Any Means. On his latest, mini-mixtape Murder for Hire, especially, his emotions and points of inspiration seem to rush in at once, like potential energy suddenly unleashed. Musically and structurally, there are easy comparisons to be made between this release and Atlanta rapper Future’s darkly comic 56 Nights: the scorched-earth, stream-of-consciousness flows, the paranoid atmosphere, the less immediate hooks. The street-rap-Drake-like overtones which surprised on Gates’ 2013 work are barely there; the hooks are chant-based, sometimes pallid rather than craggily soulful. But unlike Future’s album, there is the lingering impression of Murder for Hire being a follow-up EP of outtakes rather than a carefully streamlined statement (notably, ""Rican Johnny"" shares its primary melody with Luca Brasi 2’s leadoff banger ""John Gotti"", and comes across like another draft of the same song). As on Brasi 2 (released in December), there are some career highs on Murder for Hire, but it is dramatically less consistent than his previous 2013-14 work. Unlike Brasi 2, however, the lows here are more nondescript than far-flung and strange. This is a rarity for Gates, since one of his strengths has always been transforming near-stock beats and relatively unassuming trap hooks into colossal, immutable rap songs. Still, on forgettable tracks like ""Thuggin Hard in the Trap House"" and ""Her"", the lack of melody and a lynchpin of a primary line undoes him. Elsewhere, however, he’s busy doing the exact opposite—eerie Autotune d-boy anthem ""Chico"" hinges on the drawn-out cry of ""My Jamaican bring the reefer iiiiinn,"" a small gesture which elevates a potentially forgettable post-Luger anthem into a standout. The two most impressive tracks on the tape, though, are ""Khaza"" and ""Mexico"", two newfangled trap records on which nothing seems to stay consistent except for that dry, wood-shaving of a snare on beats two and four. ""Mexico"" is restrained, driven by some synth take on an eerie Celtic harp, and features Gates’ sharpest lyrics on the album (""So-and-So broke my jaw with the flash light/ All because I wouldn’t make my pockets look like bunny ears/ Killed a nigga, broke and ran, piss running down my leg/ Went and hid the gun behind the counting house""). ""Khaza"", on the other hand, is one of Gates’ fiercest songs to date, a great hookless wonder full of free-association both hilarious and frightening. A sneering Gucci Mane-like emphasis is built appealingly into his flow throughout (""Free the ‘wop, that’s Gucci, nigga,"" he cries at the end of the song) and his rapping feels more measured and expressive than anywhere else on the tape. This is by no means an essential Gates release, but still serves as an interesting document of where he is artistically. Whether future releases will move further away from the warm and inviting hooks of his earlier records (those which helped him, initially, set up a major-label partnership and become a nationally vital act) toward more freeform structure and experimentation remains to be seen. However, Murder for Hire demonstrates that the results will doubtless be unpredictable, full of flights of inspiration and, unfortunately, some moments when Gates seems to be not all there.","These days, Baton Rouge rapper Kevin Gates’ music sounds like an unfiltered representation of his id. His latest mini-mixtape features stream-of-consciousness fast flows, a paranoid atmosphere, and less immediate hooks. On it, his emotions and points of inspiration seem to rush in at once.

Peace Is the Mission,Major Lazer,by: Claire Lobenfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae00b1335d7bf1699cd9/1:1/w_160/73894181.png,2015-06-03 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20519-peace-is-the-mission/,Mad Decent,"Major Lazer's image has always been a bit slippery. Having gone through a number of member and affiliate changes since UK producer Switch—one half of the founding production team, along with Diplo—jumped ship in 2011, their ever-evolving mission has been confusing, sloppy, and not entirely easy to nail down. Their debut album Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do was a singular artifact of Diplo's fascination with global dance music, for lack of a better catchall, for which he is often called out as an appropriator. Despite the fact that he and Switch worked on the album in Kingston and recruited dancehall bona fides for every track, from icons like Vybz Kartel and Mr. Vegas to up-and-comers like Brooklyn bashment luminary Ricky Blaze, it was still sticky with an undercurrent of tourism. But with all of the pitfalls Major Lazer has faced since its inception—solo Diplo's hypeman Skerrit Bwoy's departure for religious pursuits; mismatched guests like Dirty Projectors' Amber Coffman and Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend for sophomore album Free the Universe—Peace Is the Mission finds the group finally emerging from their cocoon. What helped to pierce them out of a murky, genre-blurring funk, it turns out, was the confidence (and perhaps the notoriety and resources) to cash in and go full pop. Even though Diplo already had work with major pop stars on his CV (namely, Beyoncé's ""Pon De Floor""-sampling ""Run the World (Girls)"" and on Madonna's recent Rebel Heart), it was Major Lazer's inclusion on the Lorde-curated soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 that truly marked this sea change. Their contribution, ""All My Love"" featuring Ariana Grande, maintained their penchant for dancehall-inflected festival dubstep and worked in a winky interpolation of ""Lollipop (Candyman)"" by Aqua (yes, the ""Barbie Girl"" group), all with a much slicker sheen. The song could have been just another paycheck, a chance to go for polish on a non-album project while staying esoteric with their own work, but lead single ""Lean On"", a collaboration with Danish upstart MØ and DJ Snake of ""Turn Down for What"" fame, indicated that they were sticking to this new refinement. These tracks also illustrate what Major Lazer excel at: crafting intricate, innovative EDM for honey-voiced singers that pushes boundaries people like David Guetta and Calvin Harris seemingly refuse to touch. Album opener ""Be Together"" with Chicago sibling duo Wild Belle combines breathless yearning and skittering percussion in a way that sounds new, while the warbled soul of ""Powerful"", featuring vocals from Ellie Goulding and reggae artist Tarrus Riley, swoons in a way we don't expect from the production trio. With his performance, stripped of patois and giving every Top 40 pretty boy a run for his money, Riley offers the album's best example of Major Lazer's ability to synthesize their influences. Where the previous two full-lengths tried to mesh opposing forces, here, they are finessed into no-nonsense stadium rattlers. Riley can master an EDM power-ballad, while the menace of a rapper like Pusha T meets its match with dancehall vet Mad Cobra on ""Night Riders"". Even a refreshed ""All My Love"" benefits from additional vocals from soca singer Machel Montano. ""Lean On"" and ""Powerful"" will likely end up the big hits of Peace, but tracks like ""Too Original"" with Jovi Rockwell and Swedish singer Elliphant, ""Light It Up"" featuring a guest appearance from R&B-reggae duo Brick and Lace's Nyla, and Chronixx-featuring ""Blaze Up the Fire"" also show a group locating its footing. They accomplish the, well, mission the group has trained its sights on since its genesis—and it's because they've linked with artists who also deal in fusion. They're not forcing it. There is no doubt Peace Is the Mission will suffer some criticism from dancehall purists, those exhausted by EDM and people who hate Diplo (a hate that he has certainly worked overtime to earn), but their maturation is palpable across the album's nine tracks. In the process, they've made a great pop record through uniting some of the globe's most exciting and celebrated pop artists.","On Peace Is the Mission, Major Lazer pierce out of their genre-blurring funk by cashing in and going full pop.

Love & Fear,Amir Alexander,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae25ea9e61561daa621d/1:1/w_160/44048eea.jpg,2015-06-02 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20549-love-fear/,Anunnaki Cartel,"Amir Alexander is 42 years old, and Love & Fear is his debut album. A former Army brat who eventually settled in Chicago, Alexander has been DJing since 1993 and making music for nearly as long, but he only began releasing records around 2008. In that light, the cover image of a mountain climber scaling a snowy peak at a 45-degree angle has a slight autobiographical tinge: In electronic music, full-lengths always tend to constitute milestones, but for an artist like Alexander, who has made his name later than many, there's a palpable sense of raised stakes. Appropriate for someone with such a deep and abiding investment in a scene, Alexander uses Love & Fear to contend with the legacy of American techno. Any attempt to extend that legacy raises questions: How do you evoke a classic sound when innovation was central to that tradition? Can you pay tribute to your roots without the music withering on the vine? Making do with the same sorts of synthesizers and drum machines that have dominated dance music for the past quarter-century, his response is to worry less about novel sound design and focus on his machines'—and his own—expressive capabilities. One way he does that is to explore a far wider range of tempos than most. ""A Virtuous Woman!"" treads a strange, slow-motion path, stepping and strutting, as a scaly bassline ties itself up in writhing knots, and atonal bleeps suggest the ghost of Kraftwerk's ""Numbers"". The title track is even slower, with a stately synthesizer melody that braids itself around snapping, deliberate hi-hats and rimshots. Even sitting in your chair, you can tell that it's a track made for dancers, an invitation to move the body in different ways. ""The Blues (Never Had)"", even slower, offers the opportunity to get horizontal: smeared in jazzy chords, pitch-bent keyboard solos, and meandering vocals, it's a narcotic funk number, while ""Tranquility Base!"" dials up the tempo to footwork's high-flying range. It's woozier than most footwork, though, with tightly syncopated rimshots banging like a screen door in a storm, and hi-hats spinning like a wheel that can't get traction. ""That's how I feel inside,"" sings a doleful voice, as chilly Juno pads voice even chillier chords, buzzing and bracing as an ice-cream headache. The only tranquility here is an overarching sense of numbness. He also experiments with instrumentation—""A Child Is Born"" pairs the chimes of '90s electronica with the fat, rich tones of a church organ—and with themes not often represented in techno. In ""Nordisk Saga!"", he looks north for inspiration and overlays his moody synths and sparse drums with a dramatic reading of a Nordic saga written by Cecilia Bruun Hansen, all crisp consonants and alien-sounding vowels and rolled ""R""s, and references to Freyja and Ragnarok. He presumably got the idea from his time in Malmö, where he lives for part of the year. But given how often white European producers have appropriated African-Americans' voices—all those tracks made with Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, for instance—Alexander's Scandinavian gambit also amounts to a clever turning of the tables. But at the root of Alexander's music is a simple knack for what makes sounds come alive, both on the dance floor and off. The three relatively straight-down-the-middle techno/house cuts here are among the most immediate, attention-grabbing work he's produced yet, although none of them quite nail the spooky transcendence of 2013's ""Don't Go"". In ""Tight Situations"", carefully deployed dissonance sends chills down the spine, and he shows off his arranger's chops with counterpoints that sneakily keep evolving. ""Moist Flesh!"" is a warm bath of swelling pads and playful plucked leads. And the crowning glory of it all is ""Komm, süßer Tod, komm selge Ruh!"", which takes its title from one of Bach's 69 Sacred Songs and Arias. The bassline takes the form of a gnarled, shape-shifting throb; the background swirls with metallic chirps; and as the track patiently unfolds, it gives way to a wild, psychedelic cadenza reminiscent of one of Prince's guitar solos. ""Come sweet death, come blessed rest,"" is the translation of the title, and the song's graceful chord changes echo the sentiment, faintly. But that solo tells another story; there's too much struggle in Alexander to stop here. That peak on the album cover will be scaled, come hell or high water.","Amir Alexander has been DJing since 1993 and making music for nearly as long, but Love & Fear is his debut album.

Remember My Name,Lil Durk,by: Ernest Wilkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae3713d197565213a07a/1:1/w_160/7d0dd016.jpg,2015-06-02 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20564-remember-my-name/,Def Jam,"Deonte Hoard. Giovanni Matos. Savon Davis. Jennifer Ponton. Amari Sutton. Nicole M. Towns. Javante Linson. Terrell Campbell. Anthony Diaz. Uchenna Agina. These are a few of the 150-plus people killed by gun violence in Chicago so far in 2015. All of these names (and the ones I don’t have the space to list) are important, but for 22-year-old Durk ""Lil Durk"" Banks the last name hits incredibly close to home. Agina (better known as OTF Chino) was Durk’s manager, a confidante who was, in a cruel sense of irony, murdered after meeting with Bulls player Joakim Noah in an attempt to partner Durk with the latter’s anti-violence organization. It’s doubly frustrating given Durk’s affiliation with French Montana’s Coke Boys imprint, which recently suffered the loss of rising member Chinx Drugz. Durk’s first studio album (he’s released 5 mixtapes overall) since signing to Def Jam back during the Great Chicago Rap Gold Rush a few years back, Remember My Name, is a project that has the spectre of death looming over it at all times. A common criticism of Durk’s music revolves around his near-total dependency on Auto-Tune. He’s aware of the charge, addressing it on ""What Your Life Like"". The software is Durk’s friend when he adopts a singing delivery, like on single ""Like Me"". The tune showcases Durk (and featured crooner/fellow Chicagoan Jeremih) in his lane fully, producing a smooth entry into the pantheon of Sensitive Thug jams. Other times, like on the absolutely grating ""Tryna' Tryna'"" or when he tries to feebly hit high notes during the chorus on, uh, ""Higher"" it can be his worst enemy. Luckily, the highs outweigh the lows. It’s apparent after a few listens that Durk is only getting better, from both a rapping and writing perspective. He’s definitely grown from his earlier mixtapes (he sounds like a different person entirely than the one who once rapped ""Yo' bitch know she doin' dick, we call that ho double D."" Growth! Progression! Artist Development!). It’s apparent that Durk has a solid ear for production and a nascent ability to craft songs that get caught in your ear. The C-Sick-produced opener ""500 Homicides"" is a thunderous intro that finds Durk viciously addressing enemies, shouting out his affiliates and reminding folks that there are repercussions of your online actions. ""What’s up with this Twitter beef?/ Thought we was keeping in the streets?.../ Hell yeah, you can die over a retweet!"" Remember My Name as an album isn’t going to change lives. It is, however, a view into the psyche of those who reframe the concept of death as a way of life, a cost of doing business, or even a source of motivation to create a better life for yourself and those you care about. On the album standout ""What Your Life Like"", Durk laments, ""They say the murder started after L’s/ Now my phone got shit to tell... /Got that call, they cancelled 20 shows/ That's money down the drain/ I got kids, don't take it wrong."" The moment underlines a curious tension for Durk and the other artists in his orbit. The culture of the neighborhoods that produced Durk, his OTF (Only The Family) affiliates and the rest of the various artists who find their sounds lazily lumped together under the name ""drill music"" find themselves in a weird catch-22. You rap about the stuff you’re seeing (and participating in, for some) and you’re rewarded with money, fame and the opportunity to make your life better. At the same time, you’re branded as ""trouble"" by promoters, your profile is raised among the police and old enemies, and you’re forced to go on the defensive. The thing that might make your life better might be the same thing that ends up killing you. What in the hell are you supposed to do? On Remember My Name, Durk chooses to keep on keepin’ on.","Durk’s first studio album since signing to Def Jam has the spectre of death looming over it at all times.

Nozinja Lodge,Nozinja,by: Louis Pattison,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae18c0084474cd0c1834/1:1/w_160/2e23d14a.jpg,2015-06-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20538-nozinja-lodge/,Warp,"Shangaan Electro is the sort of genre that you’d assume cultural imperialism would have long ago rendered obsolete: a quirky, hyperlocal sound that’s nothing much like anything else around it or before it. You can attribute its singular nature to the fact it’s, in large part, the creation of one man—Richard Mthethwa, aka Nozinja. A large, avuncular businessman who formerly ran a successful mobile phone repair store in South Africa’s poor, rural Limpopo province, as the story goes, Nozinja heard the music being made by his peers and spied an opportunity. An electronic, MIDI-powered take on local Shangaan folk traditions, kwaito, and South African house, Nozinja’s productions—which have been the engine of a number of artists and groups, including Tshetsha Boys, B.B.C., and Zinja Hlungwani—sit somewhere between the naïve and the visionary: catchy constructions of synthesized flute and marimba, dotty drum machine, and soulful romantic entreaties dialed up to the speed of an agitated hummingbird. Even in South Africa, Shangaan Electro appears to have been relatively obscure, a localized sound made for communities, not clubs. But thanks to the support of the Brooklyn documentarian Wills Glasspiegel, Shangaan Electro found its way out of South Africa in 2010, with releases on the London-based Honest Jon's label, remixes from respected producers such as DJ Rashad and Ricardo Villalobos, and Nozinja helming a travelling Shangaan Electro roadshow, performing with Shangaan dancers: men in clown masks and bright orange jumpsuits, women shaking their rumps in big floaty dresses. Nozinja’s leap to a label such as Warp Records feels significant, to see how Nozinja Lodge might advance its maker’s vision. The sound is slightly more polished—although that might largely be the consequence of a good mastering job—while keyboards add a bit of body, lending a reggae skank to ""Baby Do U Feel Me"", and lacing plaintive descending melodies amongst the freeform snare eruptions of ""Xihukwani"". If Nozinja Lodge proves anything, it’s that Shangaan Electro’s sense of twitchy acceleration remains fundamental. Playing live, Nozinja gradually tweaks his music faster and faster, introducing each lift in tempo with the booming gusto of a carnival master. Much like footwork, you get the impression his music evolved to cater to the demands of athletic dancing bodies. Consequently, it makes a certain sense that attempts here to temper Shangaan Electro’s frenetic pace don’t always come off. ""Mitshetsho We Zindaba"", a 120BPM bounce, holds its own thanks to a bright palette of bendy keyboards and the hearty call-and-response of a female Shangaan choir. By contrast, album closer ""Wo Va Jaha"", plodding along at ballad tempo, feels somewhat ordinary by comparison. Broadly, Nozinja Lodge’s finest moments—the spry, insistent ""Tsekeleke"", the frenetic pointillism of ""N'wanga I Jesu""—adhere pretty closely to their maker’s celebrated original 180BPM template. That Shangaan Electro has made waves outside of South Africa feels to be a lot to do with its weird collision of signifiers: lo-fi electronic sounds that Western listeners might consider tacky or tinpot, fused to an African singing style that speaks of love, yearning, and other matters of the heart with earnest sincerity. Post-Diplo, the modern DJ set can feel like a finger smeared across borders, cultural forms dissolved into beige global mulch. But unlike, say, footwork, Nozinja’s music defies such easy assimilation. Almost devoid of low-end, and presented with a sunny spirit generally incompatible with gangsta posturing, it’s a sound that—in unremixed form, at least—amiably refuses to be absorbed. Consequently, it remains hard to determine Shangaan Electro’s significance to dance music at large. Who could copy it, without sounding absurd? Of course, in the context of Nozinja Lodge as a self-contained ""artist"" album, all that hardly matters. Instead, it serves as a reminder we should treasure these rare outliers wherever we find them.","As Nozinja, the South African producer Richard Mthethwa offers an electronic take on local folk traditions, kwaito, and South African house.

Carnation,Daughn Gibson,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae57ea9e61561daa626a/1:1/w_160/00eab0af.jpg,2015-06-02 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20597-carnation/,Sub Pop,"Josh Martin seems more stunned by the success of Daughn Gibson than most anyone else. In 2012, Martin—the former drummer of a knotty blues-metal band and a big-rig driver to boot—released All Hell, his debut LP under a name just one fancy vowel sound removed from revered country crooner Don Gibson. All Hell arrived as an uncanny wonder, with Martin’s gorgeous and mysterious baritone presiding over an ad hoc band built of soul, country, and soundtrack samples he’d snipped from thrift-store finds. Martin bellowed elliptical tales where lovers discovered the worst in one another, smooth talkers seduced damsels, and daddies cursed the kids that fate had delivered. A daring juxtaposition of disparate forms, it was issued in a tiny domestic edition of only 400 copies, marking it a curio meant for the few weirdos who might catch on. But a lot of people actually caught on—the press, a booking agent, slowly growing audiences, and the label Sub Pop, which signed Daughn Gibson just as All Hell’s dark gospel began to spread. Martin found himself fronting a band expected to tour and record. On 2013’s Me Moan and the uneasy new Carnation, he’s still trying to negotiate the sound of that unexpected future. Like Me Moan, Carnation finds Martin stepping out of isolation and away from batches of samples to write and record with other musicians in real time. In 2013, the cast included Baroness’ John Baizley, Brokeback and Eleventh Dream Day guitarist Jim Elkington, and a small clutch of horn-and-string players. Here, he skips to a different scene, working with versatile Seattle producer Randall Dunn (Sunn O))), Marissa Nadler, Akron/Family) and a cast of Dunn standbys, including string arranger Eyvind Kang and former Earth multi-instrumentalist Steve Moore. Only Elkington returns. The performances and the production at large are impeccable. The band is as assured with the slinking poses of ""It Wants Everything"" as they are the sashaying cool of ""For Every Bite"" or the string-backed slowness of ""Runaway and the Pyro"". But that variety—or, less generously, Martin’s halting stylistic indecision—plagues Carnation. For 38 minutes, he seems like an accidental bandleader who has no idea where he’s leading his band, let alone how to get them there. The rudiments of All Hell, from the country touches to the sampler obsession, survive only in the crevices—the baritone guitar echoing around the light new wave pulse of ""Shatter You Through"", the vocal loops bouncing beneath and around it. Martin loosens his grip on that once-dominant baritone, too, sometimes affecting a foppish British accent and occasionally slipping into lounge-singer softness. The indecision starts in the center and spreads, as Martin and crew work through homages to early Soft Machine and depressive Depeche Mode, coruscated Tangerine Dream and languid David Bowie. During ""I Let Him Deal"", he launches into a chorus that could be cut straight from the National’s catalog; for its chaser, ""Shine of the Night"", he nods to LCD Soundsystem and indulges a saxophone solo, even as he sings about staying alive on Iraq’s infamous Highway of Death. The first half of closer ""Back with the Family"" sounds like a Scott Walker fantasy, the second like a Tom Waitsnightmare. There are some bright spots here, especially in the grand attempts at pop, but Martin’s presiding confusion mitigates their album-length impact. Worst of all, though, is the way these shifts hamper his songwriting. All Hell built big, poignant scenes out of tiny, perfect details. And for all its transitional woes, Me Moan showed Martin to be a vivid, sharp storyteller in the making. He loaded his lyrics with references and sly turns of phrase—the romantic at ""the corner lobo solo … dreamin’ with the TV lit"" or the widower trying to find nostalgic comfort in surrounding sounds and sights. But these lyrics are thin, limpid, and loose. The writing gathers a smattering of soft-focus snapshots, twisted aphorisms, and dimensionless characters. Martin gives us the teenager who’d rather hang himself than turn into a hideous man during ""A Rope Ain’t Enough"" and a young patient who's left a mental hospital during ""Daddy I Cut My Hair"". But we learn so little about each of them, their circumstances or their motives. They seem like mere verbal stand-ins for jams by the Daughn Gibson Big Band. If every Daughn Gibson song used to prompt a mental short film, Carnation is a collage of bad watercolors and corrupted Polaroids. Gibson’s voice has always echoed another era, but his approach has seemed deliberately contemporary, too, eager to step over stylistic borders and bend the past against the present. Beyond his baritone or assorted honky-tonk accents, that quality is the essential link from All Hell to Me Moan to Carnation. But I like to imagine Daughn Gibson’s trajectory had All Hell been recorded and released in another epoch of the music industry, one where so many strange and stunning private-press records languished in obscurity until being rediscovered decades later. All Hell collected but 10 short songs, some of which seemed like sketches of a nebulous idea, with space for elaboration and edges for refinement. Without the need to meet public expectation or record label demands, what might that aesthetic have become in seclusion? Perhaps he would have enriched the language and stretched the sounds, as he did on Me Moan. But it seems unlikely that being cloistered would have yielded a record like Carnation, a set of songs that discard almost all sense of Martin’s singularity in favor of a search for anything new that might work. Martin’s uniqueness was the very element that turned him from a tall dude with a deep voice making odd records on a tiny imprint to a troubadour enlisted in an indie empire. But some slight attention has spoiled his significant idiosyncrasy. On Carnation, he tries and fails to be something other than himself.","Like 2013’s Me Moan, Carnation finds Josh Martin stepping out of isolation and away from batches of samples to write and record as Daughn Gibson with other musicians in real-time.

"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful",Florence and the Machine,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae619d034d5c69bf4528/1:1/w_160/6ee4b462.jpg,2015-06-02 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20605-how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful/,Island,"Florence Welch has built her career on the premise that she feels things more painfully and powerfully than anybody else. Accordingly, her band's third studio album How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful is one long Ophelia mad scene, a breakup record from the point of view of someone who is absolutely convinced that her breakup is the most devastating thing that has ever happened to anyone. She makes a pretty good case for that, to be fair. ""What was it that I said?/ I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed,"" she cries in ""Ship to Wreck"", which goes from sleeping pills to great white sharks in its first two lines. Welch has quoted producer Markus Dravs as telling her that she's ""not allowed to write any more songs about water,"" although she appears to have dodged that dictum at every opportunity. These aren't just songs about heartbreak; they're songs about total and utter eclipses of the heart. ""Delilah"", for instance, concerns the epic psychic carnage involved in waiting for a phone call from a boyfriend, and yes, that's Delilah as in Samson. (Several songs later, she's ""thrashing on the line,"" this time as a fish.) Over the course of the album, she also invokes (or casts herself as) Persephone, Lot's wife, the Virgin Mary, Daphne, Jonah, and St. Jude—both the saint and the European storm, alluded to in both senses in two different songs. Over ""Queen of Peace""'s stomps and choir and horns, she imagines herself ""dissolving like the setting sun/ Like a boat into oblivion/' CAUSE YOU'RE DRIVING ME AWAAAAAAY!"" (See? Aquatic lyrics again.) It takes an alarming seriousness of purpose to pull this stuff off—the campy playfulness of Florence and the Machine's 2009 debut single ""Kiss With a Fist"" wouldn't do. The obvious presence lurking near Welch's current songwriting is Adele, whose ""Rolling in the Deep"" she has to wish she'd thought of first, but the other source of inspiration floating nearby is PJ Harvey, specifically the PJ Harvey of To Bring You My Love. (As with Harvey, there's a lot of gender-flipping in Welch's lyrics: ""Mother"" would be very obviously a gospel song if it were called ""Father"".) Welch's voice trembles and groans until she hauls herself up to the parts of her songs that she can belt out with desperate, bleating vibrato. And the arrangements on How Big are this big: lush and ornate, tinkering with their details every few seconds, cresting and crashing and cresting and cresting some more. The title track's orchestral coda is worthy of Trevor Horn's wildest fantasies. What really binds How Big together, though, is Welch's exceptional sense for melody. No matter how tormented these songs get, they let her show off with grand, arching vocal lines, leaping deftly across her registers. (There are going to be a lot of disappointed karaoke singers signing up for ""What Kind of Man"" or ""Delilah"", then discovering that their range is nowhere near Welch's.) This is a huge, sturdy record, built for arenas—the band is among the headliners at this year's Bonnaroo, Roskilde, Lollapalooza and Governors Ball—and it's richly and carefully enough constructed to endure the extensive exposure Welch's heartache is going to get over the course of this summer.","The songs on Florence and the Machine's third LP aren't just about heartbreak, they're songs about total and utter eclipses of the heart.

Aria of Vernal Tombs,Obsequiae,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae235e6ef95969321bdd/1:1/w_160/39485033.jpg,2015-06-01 06:00:06,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20547-aria-of-vernal-tombs/,20 Buck Spin,"Tanner Anderson barely has time to end his guarantee of our collective mortality—or that ""the same fate comes for us all,"" as he roars halfway through ""Anlace and Heart""—before his guitar begins to exalt the proclamation. His squealing solo takes a simple riff for a short, jubilant ride, as if he’s a glam-metal headliner leaning back with his eyes closed. He pushes notes together and pulls them apart, the carousel-like movement of the melody suggesting delight in the face of death. Like most of Aria of Vernal Tombs, the captivating second album by Anderson’s metal-and-medieval-music amalgam Obsequiae, ""Anlace and Heart"" explores cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. Greek gods battle with nervous mortals. Seasons shift, so that needles drop from tired tamarack branches. People weep as once-happy homes succumb to senescence. Jumping between black metal and doom, death metal and delicate interludes played on a medieval harp, the music animates all of these ideas, turning centuries of dark thoughts into 44 bright, momentous minutes. Anderson appears to be invested in intersections, or what the lessons of the past can say about the present and what seemingly disconnected forms of music (metal and otherwise) can afford one another. He has clocked nearly two decades in the metal underground, that time split between the grim doom act Celestiial and Obsequiae precursor Autumnal Winds. Recently, he’s been playing harp and assorted acoustic instruments in Hiraeth Eschar, the eerie soundscape project of Agalloch bassist Jason William Walton. At last, Aria of Vernal Tombs aggregates and unifies all those experiences, synthesizing them into songs that fold Anderson’s passions into singular sweeping motions. Obsequiae’s previous album, Suspended in the Brume of Eos, aimed for a similar end, but it often felt self-conscious and separated, its rigid parts coexisting on a record rather than cooperating. (It’s symptomatic of that record’s try-hard approach that Anderson and the band’s former drummer took the names of prominent 12th-century musicians in the credits.) But on Aria, where most tracks interlock with their neighbors, the vivid black metal of ""Wilweorthunga"" flows perfectly from the triumphant solo that closes ""In the Absence of Light"" and into a pensive, dense instrumental meditation. That sequence captures the sprawl of Anderson’s interests in less than 10 minutes. Metal has a dirty habit of embracing bygone eras and appropriating historic symbols and stories without actually incorporating how those times might have sounded or felt into the music. It’s easy and alluring to slap a painting of a Viking feast or an ancient battle scene on a record cover or a name in a song title, more sophisticated and subtle to make those elements a dynamic and vital component of the finished product. Obsequiae plunders the past, of course. The cover of their debut featured a detail of a 15th-century fresco, where a regal woman posed among unicorns and other strange, smiling beasts. Likewise, Aria of Vernal Tombs offers a gorgeous scene of ruins at the gloaming. And a third of Aria’s tracks are atmospheric harp solos, augmented only by the glow of echo. But the real power of Aria of Vernal Tombs stems from how deliberately and diligently Obsequiae integrate these elements into the main event—that is, the metal. Anderson’s methodical grammar, antiquated vocabulary, and rich reference library offer the impression that you’re opening an ancient, sealed text. It’s no coincidence that the liner notes come printed on stained paper that appears to be centuries old. Sure, that sounds pretentious, but the same principle actually makes the music thrilling. The guitar solos, for instance, often mirror the action of the harp, and vice versa. At the opening of ""Anlace and Heart"", Anderson’s pace and polyphony suggest the interlocking melodies of Vincent la Camera Mariño’s harp interludes. The album opens with a harp piece, the notes piling into thickets and then spreading into thin strings. When a bell tolls after three minutes and the grand anthem ""Autumnal Pyre"" begins, it seems less like a new song and more like Anderson and drummer Andrew Della Cagna have simply replaced Mariño. Anderson sings through refracted black metal shrieks. The drums swing between blast beats and an unwavering march. Topped with arching, heroic guitars, however, the music is of a piece with its instrumental predecessor, a modern update of several classic obsessions. The past becomes more than a sales pitch. Despite Anderson’s longevity, he and his bands have existed in relative obscurity to date. But Aria of Vernal Tombs should help change that. Its deft reach across multiple metal aisles and resplendent, refined sense of presentation and production recall the recent successes of Agalloch and Chris Black’s assorted projects. Such gradual movement and improvement dovetail well with Anderson’s philosophy of slow, almost ecclesiastic change. Obsequiae have matured into a great band, Anderson a brilliant leader. It’s as though being very aware of an inevitable end helped him make Aria of Vernal Tombs count.","The captivating second album by Tanner Anderson's metal-and-medieval-music amalgam Obsequiae explores cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. Jumping between black metal and doom, death metal and interludes played on a medieval harp, he turns centuries of dark thoughts into 44 bright, momentous minutes.

Hysteria,Drainolith,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae365e6ef95969321bff/1:1/w_160/cc78564e.jpg,2015-06-01 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20563-hysteria/,NNA Tapes,"The music of now-defunct Canadian trio AIDS Wolf was as bold and confrontational as their name. It was a blare of frenetic energy and rhythmic bludgeoning. Beneath all the prog-punk brutality lurked actual song structures, the kind that could easily hypnotize anyone with the patience to uncover them. But no matter how long you stuck with them, AIDS Wolf always managed to incite dizziness through chaos. In his solo project Drainolith, AIDS Wolf guitarist Alexander Moskos has a similar goal, but comes at it from an opposite side. Where his former band built an in-your-face wall, Moskos’ sound is all skeleton. The moving parts and overlapping shapes that motor his songs are in clear view. He’s not afraid to get dense and noisy too, but you can always hear a Drainolith tune being built, each element working to find its place. Beats fall down and get back up; shards of guitar riffs build into loops; somnambulant moans glide by, then dive into the music’s crevices. On Hysteria, the follow-up to Drainolith’s 2012 debut Fighting!, everything emerges in semi-slow motion. It’s as if there's a faster, tighter version of these songs out there somewhere that Moskos could catch up to if he felt like it. But he’s more interested in wrestling the ghosts of those imagined tunes than inhabiting their bodies. The effect is disorienting but intoxicating—music designed to sneak up rather than overwhelm. Especially mesmerizing is the way Moskos fuses together melodies while simultaneously wrenching them apart. It feels like you should be able to hum along to these songs—and in places you can—but it's all skewed enough to dodge predictability. Moskos grafts together parts that don’t naturally fit in a way that recalls Captain Beefheart’s misshapen anti-songs, but his aura is much woozier, almost lethargic. Yet Hysteria rarely settles into grooves that allow passive listening. Moskos may sound like a stoner, but that's because he wants you to feel foggy and confused rather than comfortable. This smoky haze comes across in Moskos’ words, too. During ""Inside and Outside (Bog’s Blues)"", he sounds like he’s not even sure he’s awake: ""The structure of my sleep/ Is different this time,"" he slurs, practically drooling onto the pillow. In the drifting, beat-less ""Joy Road"", he whispers that ""Sometimes it seems like everything’s/ Moving too damn fast.../ Slow it down/ Move the ground/ Watch it shake."" Moskos’ zombified delivery recalls the sleep-walk of Excepter’s John Fell Ryan. But where that band often sounds like deconstructed disco, Drainolith is more like fractured rock—rock whose muscles have been stretched so much its bones dislodge and rattle against each other. There’s also a hint of broken blues to Hysteria that recalls the more drug-addled side of Royal Trux. That’s not surprising, since Neil Michael Hagerty produced this session, which also resulted in the excellent Dan’l Boone record featuring Hagerty, Moskos, and Wolf Eyes’ Nate Young. But such comparisons just reveal Moskos’ very particular take on rock, an approach that resolutely eschews expected patterns. The result is a kind of blissful cognitive dissonance, making Hysteria’s 25 minutes feel wonderfully longer.","Where his former band AIDS Wolf built an in-your-face wall, Alexander Moskos's smoky, hazy solo project Drainolith is all skeleton.

Before We Forgot How to Dream,SOAK,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae29b1335d7bf1699d15/1:1/w_160/941692af.jpg,2015-06-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20551-before-we-forgot-how-to-dream/,Rough Trade,"""The teenage heart is an unguided dart,"" sings the 18-year-old Irish singer-songwriter Bridie Monds-Watson in the first line of the first album she's released as SOAK. ""We're trying hard to make something of what we are."" It's both an introductory passage to Before We Forgot How to Dream and a mission statement for the work. Throughout the LP, SOAK revels in her own uncertainty, basking in the openness of her future. Sometimes her music's meandering quality gives it a wistful charm, but sometimes it just drifts. Unlike the woodsy, barebones EPs that preceded it, Dream comes padded with airy production. Behind Monds-Watson's guitar and voice, cymbals, strings, and bright spats of piano crash together. Sometimes they add an uptempo kick to songs that can't quite support the speed, like the pounding ""Garden"", whose melodies and lyrics don't move nearly as fast as its drum beats. ""I'd take you everywhere if I could/ I'd waste all my time on you,"" SOAK sings, and while the instrumentation's anxiety rakes against the words, it's not enough of an irony to drag them out of cliche. When the ornamentation falls back into the mist, the idiosyncrasies of Monds-Watson's voice emerge more clearly. One of the album's most haunted and tender moments, ""24 Windowed House"" holds off on the bombast until the last possible moment. The song cracks open, and giant cymbal crashes underscore SOAK's uneasy lyrics. ""I am afraid of sleep,"" she sings. On ""SHUVELS"", her voice doubles over itself in a queasy echo as she pleads, ""If you're not around now/ Where do I go instead?"" The song doesn't let that final question hang, though; Monds-Watson's guitar and a slate of flutes come to rest on a major chord, taking the edge off her ennui. There seem to be so many questions stirring inside SOAK, and yet Before We Forgot How to Dream douses them in so much prettiness that they lose their spark. It's a polished debut, but what's most interesting about it lurks beneath that shine. Monds-Watson writes like she's ready to fall in love and get her heart broken a hundred times over—like she's hungry to feel everything the way a lot of 18-year-olds are hungry to feel everything. ""When you're young and reckless/ You should not be stopped,"" she sings on ""Reckless Behaviour"". That recklessness lies inside Before We Forgot How to Dream, but it takes a little squinting to glimpse.","The Irish singer-songwriter Bridie Monds-Watson's first album she's released as SOAK is a polished debut, but what's most interesting about it lurks beneath that shine.

Algiers,Algiers,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad6db1335d7bf1699bd0/1:1/w_160/e5bcb308.jpg,2015-06-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20412-algiers-algiers/,Matador,"Algiers are a heavy band, though not so much in sound as in effect—they’re getting shit off their chest and piling it directly onto yours. Raised in the American South, they personify the foot-stomped physicality, call-and-response communiques, and outsized oration of the church, but their music is the anti-gospel. Rather than promote uplift, out-of-body ecstasy, and communion with the heavens, Algiers weigh you down with the burden of American history, a despair born of centuries of systemic oppression, and the soul-crushing futility of hoping for a change that never comes. Though they project the righteous indignation required of all great protest music, their music doesn’t so much represent a raised fist as a shoulder aching from the stress of trying to keep it aloft. On their website, Algiers present a crazy quilt of musical and philosophical touchstones, which include everyone from Malcolm X and Angela Davis to Alejandro Jodorowsky and Basquiat to Public Enemy and Ian Svenonius. Their music is likewise a pastiche of transgressive rock signifiers: the soul-powered activism of early '70s Motown, the proto-punk fury of the MC5, the synth primitivism of Suicide, the biblically charged drama of the Bad Seeds. But if the 11 songs on Algiers’ self-titled debut draw from familiar record-collector reference points, they’re radicalized by the context in which they’re being presented. Algiers are hardly the first biracial band to emerge from the indie-rock industrial complex, however, they are distinguished by their eagerness to make discussions of race the foundation of their ideological agenda, the gasoline-soaked fuse that sets their songs alight. For Algiers, signing to Matador isn’t just a means to reach more people; it’s an opportunity to thrust the modern African-American experience in the faces of an audience who rarely have to grapple with it. Though steeped in Southern tradition, Algiers could not exist without all mod cons: with frontman Franklin James Fisher now based in New York, and guitarist Lee Tesche and bassist Ryan Mahan situated in London, the trio pieced the album together through transatlantic file swaps, atop bed tracks built through programmed beats or their own hyperactive hands and feet. But while the band have taken the somewhat inevitable step of recruiting a proper drummer—Bloc Party’s Matt Tong—for their current North American tour, the songs on Algiers hardly feel like rough sketches begging for full-band embellishment. The brittle beats are crucial to establishing the album’s often suffocating atmosphere: on the mournful opener ""Remains"", a chain-gang stomp provides a none-too-subtle evocation of America’s slave-trading past, while Fisher’s anti-television invective highlights the modern form of captivity that’s replaced it; the we-shan’t-overcome dejection of ""Blood"" is chillingly framed by a tambourine rattle and handclap that feel like lashes from a whip. ""Four hundred years of torture, four hundred years a slave,"" Fisher seethes on the latter song, as Tesche’s spasmodic guitar squeals emit sparks. But the noise ultimately relents, and the beat goes on, all while Fisher ruefully repeats the line ""all my blood’s in vain."" Though Algiers’ debut is dropping in the midst of a flashpoint in American race relations, Fisher’s lyrics avoid ripped-from-the-headlines reportage for a more existential angst. These songs were written before Ferguson and Baltimore, but they ultimately exist to remind us that such flare-ups aren’t the shocking aberrations that news networks make them out to be, but the inevitable, recurring spillover of a frustration that’s been simmering for centuries and will continue to in perpetuity. Accordingly, the savvily sequenced Algiers ebbs and flows between moments of gritted-teeth tension and furious release, its solemn, confession-booth ruminations offset by heart-racing, steeple-toppling rave-ups—like ""And When You Fall"", ""Old Girl"", and the planet-rockin’ ""Irony. Utility. Pretext.""—that fulfill the prophecy of a power-music electric revival anticipated by some fellow Atlantans 15 years ago. While their messaging can sometimes be overshadowed by pulpit-thrashing theatrics (see: the provocatively titled but erratic ""Black Eunuch""), Algiers can also harness their jittery energy to sublime effect: the piano-powered dub strut ""But She Was Not Flying"" contrasts the album’s most relaxed, easy-going rhythm with Fisher’s most incendiary, exasperated vocal performance, representing the mid-album peak where Algiers truly find their groove. Despite their gravely serious demeanor and fierce intellect—this band doesn’t so much give interviews as present thesis defenses—Algiers ultimately value accessibility: from the participatory hand-clapped hysterics to their callback-ready refrains to their conflation of church congregations and circle pits, these songs beg for audience engagement and strength-in-numbers support. And if the album proves unrelentingly pessimistic in its worldview, Algiers do at least leave us with the faintest of silver linings. As the closing untitled instrumental takes the form of a thick, disorienting ambient fog, an early-'70s sample of Chicago pastor T.L. Barrett leading his Youth for Christ choir in an exultant chorus gradually fades into the mix and eventually overwhelms the track, as if to chase away the album’s dense, dark cloud cover with a ray of light. Algiers are never so naive as to assure us that a change is gonna come but, as that brief denouement suggests, in their hardened hearts, they haven’t completely given up on the possibility.","Algiers mix the soul-powered activism of early '70s Motown with the proto-punk fury of the MC5, the synth primitivism of Suicide, and the Biblically charged drama of the Bad Seeds. On their Matador debut, they project the righteous indignation required of all great protest music.

In Colour,Jamie xx,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ada913d1975652139f89/1:1/w_160/8f09545c.jpg,2015-06-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20458-in-colour/,Young Turks,"The sampler is a memory machine. This is true in both the literal sense—memory is one of the device’s key specs, measuring how much sonic information it can hold in its ""mind"" at once—but also as a metaphor. When you capture and play back a sound, transposing it to a new context, you are ""playing"" the memories that have attached themselves to the original piece of music as much as you are playing a particular piece of sound. The producer Jamie Smith, better known to the world as Jamie xx, is a sampling artist and a memory artist. He does things with the music he's absorbed and with the associations that are embedded within it. So when we listen to his music, we aren’t just listening to music played by people in a room. We’re listening to his listening and hearing his hearing; he senses memories in certain sounds—some of which he was there to experience the first time, some of which have been handed down to him—and transforms them into something new and personal. In Colour, Jamie xx’s full-length solo debut, has been a rumor for a few years now. In 2011, he followed his remix collaboration with Gil Scott-Heron, We’re New Here, with his debut single ""Far Nearer"". It was strikingly different from his work with the xx and hearing it, it was possible to triangulate and imagine the broader and more varied sensibility that served as an umbrella over both. The emergence of Jamie xx as a producer’s voice is part of what made the xx’s follow-up, Coexist, disappointing. It’s a decent record, but once we had a better sense of Jamie xx’s range, it was hard to square that knowledge with the narrow aesthetic parameters of his main band, lovely as their music could be. All along, this one was coming together. One of the great things about him is he works slow and gets everything just so, treating each project as the one chance to get it right. In Colour gets there: it’s the dazzling culmination of Jamie xx’s last six years of work, gathering up elements of everything he’s done—moody ballads, floor-filling bangers, expansive and off-kilter collaborations with vocalists—and packing them tightly into a glittering ball that reflects spinning fragments of feeling back at us. A key idea embedded in the notion of rave is it had something for everyone. Though rave was at one point very fashionable, it was also, early on and at its best, egalitarian. The platonic ideal of the dancefloor, which is obviously never quite fulfilled, is that the dancers meet as equals. Everyone is on their own journey and there is no judgement, and the right drugs at the right time have helped to bring this starry-eyed vision to life. Jamie xx’s music captures some of this spirit by being terribly hip and of-the-moment but also deeply emotional. It’s ""cool"" music designed to make you feel, and the mechanism is vulnerability. There are passages on In Colour where the music is huge and anthemic while being simultaneously open and intimate. Opening track ""Gosh"" is the table-setter. It builds, one loop upon the next, each new brick of groove slotting into place, until it becomes a sky-scraping edifice whose call-to-motion is impossible to resist. And then, just as the last tightly-bound fixture is put into place, there comes a squelchy, slightly awkward synthesizer solo that sounds like it was knocked off in one hurried take by someone who approaches the instrument with the excitement of a newcomer. When the keyboard falls in, which is still exciting and surprising after many dozens of plays, it’s as if our tower of sound is suddenly crowned by a massive cluster of balloons that lifts it into the sky, Up style. The view from this vantage point never flags. ""Sleep Sound"" takes a sample of the Four Freshmen’s ""It’s a Blue World"" and gently cuts it into pieces, the voice tumbling through time in a manner not unlike what the Field’s Axel Willner did to the Flamingos' ""I Only Have Eyes for You"", but the whole thing is filtered and submerged, a dream of water that’s soothing even as it hints of drowning. ""I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)"" features rapper Young Thug and dancehall vocalist Popcaan and while the combination of the three was iffy on paper, they wind up clicking. Thug is bursting with joy as he delivers profane couplets in his sing-song cadence, and Popcaan grounds the music and forms a bridge to the ragga of Jamie xx’s jungle heroes. As the album moves on, Jamie xx moves through styles and textures, everything unified by his highly attuned ear. Three tunes find Jamie xx collaborating with his bandmates, and, like ""Good Times"", they show how well he straddles the line between ""song"" and ""track."" ""Stranger in a Room"", featuring Oliver Sim, could be a (very good) xx song and is the only thing here that seems like it could have come from the band. Romy’s melody on ""SeeSaw"" is all hushed confession mixed with longing, but instead of spare guitar and drums, Jamie xx surrounds it with breakbeats and a pulsing synth that suggests the cosmos, merging the closest possible feelings with the vastness of the infinite. ""Loud Places"", making brilliant use of a sample of jazz drummer Idris Muhammad’s ""Could Heaven Ever Be Like This"", is a song of contrast in the manner of ""SeeSaw"". But the sample on ""Loud Places"" is warmer and more inclusive, and it’s followed by a brilliantly simple lyric about club-going loneliness and desire that might make Morrissey jealous: ""I go to loud places/ To search for someone/ To be quiet with."" That clash of feeling, of being overwhelmed by everything at once while also wanting to zoom in on and live inside the tiniest detail, is the animating force of In Colour. Late in the album, the rush comes to a head on ""The Rest Is Noise"", a track that functions as the flipside to ""Gosh"", the party turned inside out, as shouting abandon gives way to a huge wash of yearning. There’s even a small nod to ""Gosh""’s synth break as the album seems to return from where it started. It makes me think of a comment from Jamie xx regarding one of the record’s most modest tracks, ""Obvs"", which is is driven by a steel drum lead. Jamie xx is fascinated by the instrument and has returned to it regularly, describing its appeal like this: ""You can make it sound quite melancholy…but at the same time, it reminds me of paradise."" It’s not a bad description of how In Colour works. It’s the album as raucous party where the thrill of the moment never quite obliterates the wistful sadness that comes from knowing it will all end too soon.","In Colour, Jamie xx’s full-length solo debut, is the dazzling culmination of his last six years. On it, he gathers up elements of everything he’s done—moody ballads, floor-filling bangers, expansive and off-kilter collaborations with vocalists—and packs them tightly in a glittering ball that reflects fragments of feeling back at us.

Square EP,Kosmo Kat,by: Patrick St. Michel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae809d034d5c69bf4562/1:1/w_160/a575cd2c.jpg,2015-05-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20630-square-ep/,Faded Audio,"The music Takuji Shibata makes under the name Kosmo Kat aims for deep space, his flurry of synthesizers and programmed beats creating an appropriate soundtrack for a party in some far off nebula. It has been earthly borders, though, that have shaped his sound. Born in Japan, he eventually found his way to Los Angeles during the peak years of the city’s beat scene, when the Low End Theory party was catching attention thanks to regulars such as Flying Lotus and the Gaslamp Killer. Shibata hopped back across the Pacific Ocean last year, and he’s in Tokyo for the release of his debut EP □ (Square, to be exact). It’s a strong introduction to Kosmo Kat’s world, one where he applies the ethos of L.A.’s headier music communities to old and contemporary Japanese styles. Shibata’s approach doesn’t immediately sound like anything ""a bunch of dudes hanging out and bobbing our heads together"" would listen to, as Gaslamp Killer described the early days of Low End Theory to LA Weekly. Kosmo Kat embraces pop full on, stacking his songs up with bright electronics that play out at a speed targeting the whole body. His 2013 digital EP An Elegant Punk glistened and zipped ahead, at times resembling the more frantic moments of Cosmogramma with the jazz touches swapped out for disco. □ sonically doesn’t detour too far from his earlier days. Opener ""Aki ga Konai Kotoba"" skitters from the get-go, bursting into a dash come the chorus, as does the throbbing ""Nami"". They aren’t quite as technicolor as Shibata’s earlier recordings, but unfold at the same up-tempo pace. EP highlight ""Pterosaur"" veers into dreamier territory, thanks in large part to the hushed singing of Brooklyn-based guest vocalist Trust In Love. Yet as intimate as ""Pterosaur"" gets, the music itself keeps thumping along, never allowing the song to dissolve into pure pillow talk. Save for a few short interludes, □ doesn’t recall the actual heady sounds that came to define L.A.’s beat scene. Rather, Shibata seemingly absorbed the idea of taking something familiar to yourself and bending it in new ways. For Kosmo Kat, that’s Japanese pop. Abroad, J-Pop tends to be described as hectic, cute, and generally overwhelming, more or less the same experience of standing near a Dance Dance Revolution machine for several minutes. Yet J-Pop contains multitudes of styles, and Shibata channels several varieties, from the intricate electro-pop of producer Yasutaka Nakata (Capsule, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu) to the tightly constructed stylings of '80s idol pop. He puts his own spin on it, turning it into something all his own. Shibata’s best touch—and the one major departure from the bulk of Kosmo Kat’s past sounds—is the addition of his own voice. ""Aki ga Kinai Kotoba"" is a fine bit of heart-skipping electronic music, but his singing, which moves from reserved to nearly shouted come the chorus, adds a drama to the song that gives it extra energy. The same goes for ""Nami"", which finds Shibata’s voice nearly cracking during the final stretch. Save for Trust In Love’s feature, all the vocals are sung in Japanese, and the way Shibata delivers those words sells the emotion and urgency more than well. Good pop, whether straightforward or warped around the edges, should achieve that. □ works as a strong first introduction to Kosmo Kat, managing just the right pace over the course of its six songs (closer ""Kage no Kimi"" is a slow-burning ballad that would normally feel a bit meandering, yet is a welcome breath after the fast-paced tracks before it). Most impressively, it highlights a producer who avoids easy duplication of the sounds he’s been surrounded by during his life in favor of morphing them into a boundary-blurring form he can orbit himself.","Born in Japan, the electronic producer Takuji Shibata found his way to L.A. during the peak years of the city’s beat scene.

Noise Tape Self,Strategy,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae285e6ef95969321be9/1:1/w_160/89714cee.jpg,2015-05-29 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20550-noise-tape-self/,Further,"Dub is a way of tunneling through space-time. Like hanging two mirrors opposite one another in a small room, it opens a window upon the infinite. Dub burrows an endlessly regenerating maze through the otherwise finite confines of the mixing desk. Paul Dickow's Noise Tape Self goes one step further: it tries to wring infinity out of a single cassette tape. Dickow, who lives in Portland, Ore., has made a lot of different kinds of music over the years. His debut LP, 2003's Strut, was a homebrewed response to the blippy, squirrelly sounds then coming from UK labels like Planet Mu and Rephlex. His '00s releases for Kranky veered into dubby ambient music indebted to Pole and Arthur Russell. He's no stranger to the dance floor—disco and Afrobeat often linger at the edges of his music, beckoning—but he seems most at home in pursuit of headier ideals. On this year's Seeds of Paradise, for the Bristol bass-music label Idle Hands, and Pods of Punishment, for the experimentally inclined Entr'acte, he has ventured ever deeper into a sound of his own making, one lying at the overlap of dub, ambient, and DIY electronics. Noise Tape Self is the most focused thing he's done, and it's also the most experimental. Its six tracks date from between 2008 and 2010, and all of them were made using an arcane system of Dickow's own devising. At the risk of getting too technical, it's worth explaining his process in some detail, simply because it's so inventive—and also because it's hard to fathom how such strict limitations could yield music this enveloping. Using a technique developed by David Chandler, aka Solenoid, Dickow first created his own looping cassettes by disassembling the plastic housings of cassette tapes, extracting the tape, cutting it, and re-threading it in a loop configuration. (These images help explain the technique.) Those then became, in a sense, both his canvas and, when he recycled the contents of the tapes (many of which were often found on the street or given to him by friends), his raw material. Plugging those into a 4-track recorder, he recorded his own sounds and also utilized the existing material on the tapes, all of which he ran out, via separate outputs for each track, through a handful of effects: analog delay, high-pass filter, spring reverb, a broken loop pedal, and a tube overdrive built by Not Breathing's Dave Wright. (He diagrams his process here.) Why does any of this matter? You can listen to all six of Noise Tape Self's tracks on Bandcamp right now, so you tell me: Would you have guessed that any of these were the product of a single set of loops, all running in parallel? I doubt it. They move like water—not in circles but in long, winding streams, a muted rainbow of intermingled currents, some faster and some slower. Four parallel eight-second loops become, in effect, a series of garden stakes drowned in vines—overgrown, unruly, uncontainable. ""Awesome Piano"" is a sawtoothed raga suffused in mist, a gentle call-and-response between gravelly synthesizer and watery keys. ""Cassette Loop"" recalls both Seefeel's spectral ambient dub and Grouper's drain-circling drones; a rhythmic clacking suggests the movement of a train, while the glassy sway might be buoys far out at sea. That's as lonely as the album gets: ""Ominous Lovely Piano"" plays with whimsical, daydreamy loops—major-key, frayed around the edges—and something that sounds almost like a dog sighing in its sleep. ""Lovely Loop"", cooler and more distant, wouldn't be out of place on Kompakt's Pop Ambient series. It also has something of the aquatic to it, complete with the rustle of what might be waves and seagulls: If ""Cassette Loop"" is a fogged-in bay at night, then ""Lovely Loop"" is the same scene by the light of day, sun-baked and ringed by green pines. ""Hobgoblin"" employs the 4-track's variable-speed feature to create a spooky gliding melody, and the closing ""Rhen's Loop"" settles into nine minutes of resonant drones that glisten like a pit full of beetles. None of these tracks deals explicitly in reggae—not its bass lines, not its backbeats—but the album's commitment to dub as a process, an ethos, is total. And it shows that dub, as a technique and a tradition, transcends musical styles; it reveals dub to be a kind of magic. The filters and delay act as both sieve and telescoping rod, catching sounds and propelling them out toward the limit of our perception; they wrest time from the rails and send it flying off into space. ""The studio must be like a living thing,"" Lee ""Scratch"" Perry told David Toop, and Tape Noise Self implants dub's DNA in a whole new host. As studios go, Dickow's couldn't be more modest, but there is no doubt that it is alive.","For Noise Tape Self, the prolific Portland, Ore. producer Paul Dickow disassembled the plastic housings of cassette tapes, extracted the tape, cut it, and re-threaded it in a loop configuration.

English Graffiti,The Vaccines,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae6d5e6ef95969321c47/1:1/w_160/d38e6bf3.jpg,2015-05-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20613-english-graffiti/,Columbia,"On their third album, English Graffiti, the Vaccines have redirected their ambitions. Since they emerged from west London in 2010, the four-piece have studiously avoided trying too hard with their blunted rock and disaffected lyrics that made frontman Justin Young’s internal life sound devoid of joy or rage. Their only aims appeared to be careerist ones along the lines of getting ""indie back in the charts,"" based on the notion of the honest underdog vanquishing pop’s preening one percent. But at some point following 2012’s Come of Age, the Vaccines realized that they had fallen foul of a self-limiting attitude. Newly enlightened, Young started praising the adventurousness of hip-hop and pop, and bravely opted out of valuable patronage after decrying the Who’s forthcoming Glastonbury headline slot as ""a safe booking."" They sought out Dave Fridmann along with former Haunted Graffiti member and Julia Holter collaborator Cole M. Greif-Neill to work on their third album, on which they attempted to ""steer clear of a lot of the self-imposed rules that indie music implies,"" Icelandic bassist Árni Árnason said recently. Some of their fans were hesitant about the more tender, melancholy direction signalled on 2014’s stopgap Melody Calling EP, but to their credit, the Vaccines persevered with it (though they ditched an apparently wilder version that would have been ""commercial suicide""). The result is their best record yet. Part of its success is due to the fact that the Vaccines sound borderline-unrecognizable here, which is probably curmudgeonly praise. Where Young’s vocals used to thud like a fist through a wet paper bag, he’s now found a warm centerpoint somewhere between Chris Martin’s nice-boy croon and Damon Albarn’s rougher edges. The record’s zippy rock songs are its least inspired moments—""Dream Love"" is a shadow of Arctic Monkeys’ AM swagger, and the synthy chorus to ""Minimal Affection"" rips off the Strokes circa Comedown Machine—but for the most part, it settles somewhere unusual, if not original. (For better or worse, their aspirations to sound like Sleater-Kinney circa The Woods aren’t evident.) The run-up to English Graffiti was dogged by a quote Young gave to NME in January: ""We wanted to make something that sounds amazing next year but terrible in 10 years!"" The hyper-produced record has actually ended up somewhere in the mid-'80s, juxtaposing a surprising power-pop influence (the ripping ""Give Me a Sign"") with even more surprising shades of Arthur Russell’s curious, muted balladry (""Minimal Affection"", ""Denial""). Although the Vaccines discovered there was more to creative fulfillment than playing London’s 20,000-cap O2 Arena, in equally '80s fashion, they’ve written two yearning songs fit for stadiums anyway: the sinewy ""Want U So Bad"" and ""Maybe I Could Hold You"", which sits somewhere between Arctic Monkeys and Coldplay and feels appropriately comforting. Maybe there’s something in the water for major label British indie acts flipping the script as they approach their third records, though unlike Young’s old pals Mumford & Sons (from back in his days as troubadour Jay Jay Pistolet), the Vaccines couldn’t really be accused of selling out. As they have noted, they didn’t pay their dues in a scene (they were signed after a handful of gigs) and came up with no ethos beyond finding success. If anything, what English Graffiti does have that its predecessors sorely lacked is heart—the only measure of authenticity that really matters. In a plaintive tone buried by distortion, Young starts the record on a similarly dispirited note to Come of Age. ""With a hollow embrace, let’s go back to your place/ Uncover a lover you cannot replace,"" he belts on ""Dream Lover"", retreading the fittingly empty pound of ""Post Break Up Sex"" from 2011 debut What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?. So far, so dismal, but rather than wallow in the scorned self-pity that characterized their first two albums, Young starts searching for the root of his inability to connect. ""Hold on, I’m in denial/ I need an answer and have for a while,"" he croons on ""Denial"". Young recently talked about how his band wants to compete with the likes of Kanye West and Beyoncé to be considered one of the biggest and best acts in the world. ""We think that how they make music and how they connect with people is above and beyond anything we’ve ever experienced, but I want to be as important as what they’re saying and what they’re trying to achieve."" Who knows whether they’ll get there, but by making music that actually sounds important to them, the Vaccines have taken a small step in that direction.","The Vaccines sought out Dave Fridmann and former Haunted Graffiti member/Julia Holter collaborator Cole M. Greif-Neill to work on their third album, and it's their best yet. Part of English Graffiti's success is due to the fact that the London post punks sound borderline-unrecognizable on it.

Frankie Knuckles: House Masters,Various Artists,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae1fb1335d7bf1699d08/1:1/w_160/0a40eea0.jpg,2015-05-29 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20545-various-artists-frankie-knuckles-house-masters/,Defected,"Frankie Knuckles died last year at the age of 59; here is a retrospective which seeks to bring his art to life in the wake of his passing. Or an aspect of it: at the core of Frankie's music was his work as a DJ, and it's heartbreaking that future generations will be denied the experience of his dancefloors. Much like the genre he forged in parties at the Warehouse in the late 1970s and early 1980s, his work as a producer was an extension of the singular sensibility of a man behind turntables. Frankie Knuckles' credits as a producer will secure his legacy in his absence, even as they remain bronzed touchpoints in a grander journey. Although it's not the first compilation of Frankie's production work, House Masters is by some distance the most ambitious. Earlier summations focused on his groundbreaking material of the 1980s, when songs like ""Baby Wants to Ride"" (which also appears here) and ""It's a Cold World"" (which does not) were part of house music's big bang; when each new record contained the DNA of thousands to follow. But the Defected label's House Masters—the profits from which benefit the Frankie Knuckles Fund/Elton John AIDS Foundation—looks at the bigger picture of Knuckles' recording career, spanning from early records like ""Your Love"" (originally heard during Frankie's sets at the Power Plant in the mid-1980s) all the way to 2011's shimmering, quivering ""I'll Take You There"". Those two records, both of which feature the yearning vocals of Jamie Principle, bookend this compilation, an argument for the continuity of Knuckles' vision across four different decades—five if we consider the groundwork he laid as a DJ at the Warehouse in the late 1970s. Rather than pay lip service to his longevity while highlighting a narrow fraction of it, House Masters treats his formative years as first steps in a lifelong journey as a recording artist. House music may have de-emphasized artist-driven careers in favor of democratic dancefloors, but taking a focused look at Frankie Knuckles as an auteur with a lengthy résumé not only unearths forgotten singles deserving of more attention, but refracts back upon his earliest, most well known material, pulling new insights from well-worn releases. That is, if you purchase the CD version. Due to licensing restrictions, the version of House Masters available digitally in the United States switches out certain records in favor of others, and appends two bonus tracks. This alternate tracklist doesn't feature any bad songs, but it's a much less cohesive listen. The success of this compilation, appropriately for an artist who was a DJ first and foremost, is as much about its meta-narrative—the deliberate shape of the project as a whole, and what it says about Frankie's career. Defected has said as much in the press around the project, which suggests Frankie was responsible for ""hand-selecting"" the records that made the cut. He passed away a month after planning began, and while the label isn't specific about his contributions to its final state, whoever did sign off built the original tracklist with care. The alternate version, despite adding two additional songs, has moments of incoherence: the emotional punch of Rufus and Chaka Khan's house dub ""Ain't Nobody (Hallucinogenic Version)"" feels like a lynchpin of the original, and hearing Quentin Harris and Ultra Naté's ""Give It 2 U (Frankie Knuckles' Gagatha Christie Mix)"" in its place is disorienting. Whether you're a house novice or a dance music savant, House Masters (in its original form) inscribes a new and invigorating story about who Frankie Knuckles was, and who he will be for the future. If one quality connects the disparate sounds of his work from every era, snaking its way through the full range of his discography, it is a sensation of expressive confidence. Too often confused with the self-serious theater of masculinity, for Frankie, confidence was about muscular vulnerability, both as an m.o. and the texture of his art. Take, for example, 1983's driving edit of First Choice's 1977 disco classic ""Let No Man Put Asunder"", a stand-in here for his earliest days as a disco DJ. Although he wasn't the first to extend the 4 minute 30 second record into dancefloor-friendly shape (Walter Gibbons remixed it several years earlier), Frankie's had the more forceful groove, pointing to the direction Chicago would soon shift the country. The self-assuredness of his early work helps explain how a New York DJ who'd moved to a far-flung flyover like Chicago dramatically reoriented the sound of dance music nationally. In the city of broad shoulders, where the streets are wide and even Chicago's classical trumpet players are known for their large-bore, powerful ""Chicago sound"", Frankie Knuckles spread his wings as a DJ, and as this collection suggests, as a producer as well. As a compilation of mainly 6-8 minute house records, new listeners may initially struggle with what are essentially DJ tools—records Frankie designed for the dancefloors with which he was familiar. Many of his records, as peak time anthems for the party's emotional climax, ask for complete investment: where a pop DJ might spin records for an audience merely chasing the familiar, Knuckles' records are ornate and expansive, intended to be experienced in toto, appreciated for the flowering shape of the whole. Perhaps the best example is the grandeur of Sounds of Blackness' 1991 single ""The Pressure (Frankie Knuckles Classic Mix)"". Knuckles doesn't merely dare the audience to adjust to its slow, extended piano intro, but tests their patience, boldly indulging in theatrical sincerity, with rolling gospel pianos and an arching vocal performance from Ann Bennett-Nesby. Knuckles—or any DJ with concomitant confidence and a copy of this record—creates a compact with the dancer: not only will you be rewarded for this long delay, not only will you start to appreciate this delay as a part of the experience of dancing—but that intro becomes, retroactively, the record's real hook. It's the moment where full investment actually takes place—the moment trust is built, where the DJ leads, and the audience learns to follow. ""The Pressure"" is also a perfect example of how Knuckles' remixes could enhance and deepen the colors of a record. One of the greatest tricks in his toolbox were those familiar rounded bass tones, like bumpers on a pinball machine, which often served as powerful emotional reassurance. Their use may shift with context: on ""The Whistle Song"", the flute searches for a memory while the bass lopes forward playfully; on Adeva's ""Beautiful Love"", what could be a melancholy record becomes one of wistful acceptance. On his remix of R&B classic ""Hangin' on a String"", the bassline helps untangle Loose Ends' knot of ambiguity into joyous dancing strands, a celebration of unapologetic devotion as the height of romantic love. Unapologetic confident devotion: not just acceptance, but an embrace, as if savoring every flavor of having surrendered to the crush. Like a good DJ mix, this compilation is not wanting for variety; Knuckles' sleek refashioning of Hercules and Love Affair's ""Blind"" makes the song more intimate, a sunset breeze brushing the skin; the next record—Frankie's own ""Workout (1992 Vocal Mix)""—drips with sweat, all urgent physicality, like a clubgoer's version of the runner's high. The classic ""Let the Music (Use You)"" explores a solitary experience: as the keyboards flash like passing car lights from the back seat of a taxi cab, Frankie conjures urban nightlife as a lonely, seductive promise. Some may ponder what's missing; where is ""It's a Cold World"", a paranoiac moment from his early days? House Masters leaves stones unturned, but it's apt to encourage this ambition from new listeners, who should know there is more to explore. In context, it's tough to imagine that ""Cold World"" would fit in with the records here; in exploring his life, perhaps Frankie simply felt it wasn't the world he lived in any longer. Indeed, it's the feeling that Knuckles is so powerfully present in each of these songs, that each one is in some way intimately, generously, lovingly alive, which connects his work throughout the years. A record like ""Your Love"", familiar and canonized as it might be, isn't that close to house music's aesthetic core: it shows the influence of Italo-disco, its unconventional groove suggesting some possible future unexplored. But that sensation of warmth, the feeling of a heartbeat's proximity, makes it contiguous with his catalog. Frankie's true innovations seem invisible now; he wasn't responsible for the sonic distortions Ron Hardy explored at the druggy Music Box. Frankie's sensibility hewed closer to its gospel and disco roots. At one time, he stood at the margins, held a radical position. That we see his later work as ""conservative"" is a trick of perspective. It's not that he pulled back as he refined his craft; it's that we all moved to follow him at a new center. A true gem cruelly banished from the U.S. digital version is Lisa Stansfield's ""Change (Knuckles Mix)""—which feels as much like a message from Frankie himself, a crucial farewell before submitting to the whimsical high drama of the Pet Shop Boys' ""Left to My Own Devices (Frankie Knuckles Royal Piano Version)"". ""If I could change the way I live my life today, I wouldn't change a single thing,"" Stansfield sings—it's hard not to read messages from Frankie himself in the songs he chose here, messages from beyond. It's not an unprecedented trick, especially for a DJ. As Stansfield's vocals unfurl from whispers to a fast vibrato, she's wreathed in ribbons of strings, a delicate performance that is nonetheless totally inhabited, reaching outward, in full bloom.","Frankie Knuckles died last year at the age of 59. At the core of his music was his work as a DJ, but his credits as a producer will secure his legacy. Although House Masters is not the first compilation of Knuckles' work as a producer, it is the most ambitious.

At.Long.Last.A$AP,A$AP Rocky,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aea713d197565213a144/1:1/w_160/ce403a0f.jpg,2015-05-29 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20661-atlonglastaap/,A$AP WORLDWIDEPolo GroundsRCA,"We are in the age of the curator, from meticulously-arranged, aspirational Tumblrs to Drake’s recent stint at Sotheby’s. As it’s grown easier to translate our identities through these careful assemblages of stuff we fuck with, good taste has taken on a new leveraging power. A$AP Rocky, the baby-faced fashion killa and primary figurehead of zeitgeist-wheelie-poppin’ Harlem goon squad A$AP Mob, has always understood this better than anyone else in the rap game. As he should: his own success can be directly traced to early promo on his mentor and A$AP Worldwide co-owner A$AP Yams’ highly influential RealNiggaTumblr, one of the savviest indie-to-major reconnaissance missions this century. That triumph of personal taste has been one of the reasons Rocky’s resonated most with this generation of rap fans and beyond, but it’s also led to his most persistent critique: all vibe, no substance. In between the conceptual Instagram stunts and Harry Potter-themed sartorial wisdom, it’s hard not to wonder about the Rakim Mayers beneath the swaggy labels, and if we’d ever get a lasting impression of his point of view beyond the infinite affirmations that it is, indeed, lit. There’s been a two-plus year gap between Rocky’s sophomore studio album, At.Long.Last.ASAP, and his chart-topping major label debut, during which he dabbled in fashion design, modeled for Ferragamo, and made his acting debut in Sundance darling Dope. But the most glaring change between then and now is the absence of Yams, or Steven Rodriguez, who died this January at 26 of a drug overdose. Yams’ presence was mostly behind-the-scenes (though he’d often appear in the videos, in all his jiggy splendor), but he was the heart and soul of the A$AP Mob, and Rocky’s success is no short of unfathomable without his guidance. With A.L.L.A.—executive produced by Yams, along with art-rap auteur Danger Mouse—he presents to the world one last relic of he and his best friend’s collaborative vision, and though the album was reportedly completed before Yams’ death, it still feels like an elegy to the closest thing the millennial generation had to its own Diddy or Dame Dash. Rocky remained understandably private in the aftermath of Yams’ passing, but on A.L.L.A., he seems more open than ever: to the healing properties of hallucinogens, to be sure, but also to revealing parts of his personality that go beyond surface-level. To an extent, this may reflect his recent antipathy towards the much-hyped labels with which he once associated. But it seems more likely a result of growing up, gaining steadier footing in the industry his squad gate-crashed, and coming to terms with himself as more than just a sum of his inspirations and logos. At long last, a real sense of identity has begun to coalesce in Rocky’s work. ""Ok, let’s get past all this swag, trapping, and fashion talking,"" he exhales on back-to-basics Kanye collab ""Jukebox Joints"". Turns out, Pretty Flacko’s got real shit to say—though not without the buffer of some par-for-the-course bits of pretty-sounding fluff—and he wastes little time getting to it. Album intro ""Holy Ghost"" serves as an indictment of the Christian clergy, a grasp towards his own jaded conception of a personal Jesus, and a plea to save his admittedly corrupted soul all the same. It’s clear he’s been sharpening his rap skills on a technical level, too. On ""Pharsyde"", over a screwed-up take on Danger Mouse’s loping Spaghetti Westernisms, Rocky punctuates a sideways glance at his rapidly gentrifying Uptown kingdom with a loaded ""Harlem Shake"" reference, the kind of nuanced writing absent from much of his older work. On ""Max B"", he turns a neck-snapping homage to the incarcerated Wavie One into a commentary on remorseless cops and the prison-industrial complex with newfound lyrical command: ""Passed away from a stray from some fake-tough guy/ Now this the kinda story that should make doves cry."" A.L.L.A’s recent singles are among its least interesting moments. All that’s missing from ""L$D""'s on-the-nose dorm room psychedelia are the dryer sheets MacGyvered around the smoke detector, though the track makes more sense in album context as something of an extended interlude than it did as a standalone. And ""Everyday"", with its headline-grabbing Miguel/Rod Stewart mash-up, feels like an overt attempt at a ""FourFiveSeconds""-style genre-busting flex, though its transitions are as clunky and unresolved as PowerPoint slide changes. Not to say the album isn’t without hits: lead single ""Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LBFJ2)"" is a monster, with its hulking, siren-heavy production from drill production duo Nez & Rio, and ""Electric Body"", with old partner in crime Schoolboy Q, seems destined for club tenure this summer. Still, it’s one of this year’s growing list of major rap releases—Thug, Drake, Kendrick—seemingly unconcerned with landing anything on the radio. Even without the overt grabs for mainstream relevance à la ""Fuckin' Problems"", A.L.L.A. isn’t short on star power, and Rocky’s coaxed some impressive features from his sprawling guest roster. Lil Wayne steadily gathers momentum on ""M’$"", barrelling downhill through break-neck plug talk and landing breathlessly at a final fuck-you to Birdman (""I love my YM, ain’t no more CM""). On album highlight ""Fine Whine"", M.I.A. shakes up a syrupy half-time lurch to spit, ""Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick!"" with a mouthful of bad blood. On the same song, Future Hendrix (who’s been making it cool to be psychedelic and street for years now) delivers his realest post-Ciara guest verse yet. That ""Wavybone"" revives UGK over a Juicy J co-production—and that Yasiin Bey shows up at all on the closing track—are curatorial flexes in their own right. But A.L.L.A.’s most unexpected presence is Joe Fox, a previously unknown songwriter and guitarist who Rocky scooped off the streets of London and fashioned into his protege, and who appears on almost a third of the album. It’s a weird move, on an album full of them. Until now, Rocky’s adhered to a painstakingly calculated idea of ""cool."" On Long.Live.A$AP, you got the sense his eclectic, of-the-moment features roster were a pointed statement as to how he’d like to be perceived, an itemized breakdown of the context in which he envisioned his own artistry. But A.L.L.A. frequently wanders from overt coolness towards choices that are emphatically off-trend: Danger Mouse, Mark Ronson, Rod Stewart, a sample from a '60s Christmas ditty on ""Excuse Me"". It’s a welcome change of pace for the former Raf Simons Murderer, as the self-aware tastemaking takes a backseat to hopes, anxieties, tremors of sociopolitical unrest—a beating heart beneath the Rick Owens linens. Instead of a hyper-curated tableau of swag, Rocky’s curatorial eye adopts a more intimate gaze, rendering his collage of disparate inspirations more like a mixtape made for a friend than a sterile exhibition space. This is where his late mentor’s influence shines brightest: Yams’ point of view was so piercing and confident it effortlessly transcended the sum of his influences, proving emphatically that you are more than the shit you like. The last thing we hear, even after Yams’ ranted outro closes with a triumphant ""ASAP, bitch!,"" is what sounds like an encroaching train, or a shrieking hangover due to hit any minute now, or maybe just reality about to set in. After the party, the afterparty, and the acid-fueled marathon orgy thereafter, the most surreal part of a trip is inevitably the moment you have to rub your eyes and go be a real adult. From the sound of A.L.L.A., Rocky can handle that.","During the gap between A$AP Rocky’s sophomore album, At.Long.Last.A$AP, and his major label debut, his mentor A$AP Yams’ died. With A.L.L.A.—executive produced by Yams, along with Danger Mouse and featuring Kanye, Lil Wayne, Future, and M.I.A. among others—a real sense of identity has begun to coalesce in Rocky’s work.

Qliphoth,Cloud Rat,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae6ab1335d7bf1699d8f/1:1/w_160/446ccd72.jpg,2015-05-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20611-qliphoth/,Halo of Flies,"Two-and-a-half minutes into ""Udder Dust"", perhaps the most ambitious and grand song to date in the catalogue of Michigan quartet Cloud Rat, singer, screamer and band philosopher Madison Marshall hurls the single question that seems to underpin the entire act’s existence: ""How do I convince you I’m living?"" she screams, her violent voice slowing toward the back half of the sentence as the beat breaks in two. The 17 songs on Qliphoth, the audacious third LP from the nominally grindcore group, portray characters often trampled under society’s heaviest feet—inner-city outcasts and sexual deviants, drug addicts and civil servants, the emotionally disturbed and the physically wounded. Cops abuse inmates. Bosses victimize employees. Humans exploit animals. Each group treats the next as if they were somehow doing something less than living. But with her pointed poetry vivified and fortified by the band around her, Marshall, one of metal’s best new bandleaders, unapologetically offers those characters a megaphone. Qliphoth feels like a series of prepared rebellions, then, simply waiting to start. It’s always been easiest to talk about Cloud Rat as a grindcore band. Their self-titled 2010 LP ripped through 11 numbers in just less than 18 minutes, while 2013’s Moksha crammed its first 12 songs into about 22 minutes. But the latter’s closing title track made it clear there was more to Cloud Rat than sprinting and stammering. Throbbing bass and groaning guitar drifted around an eerie piano theme, Marshall’s wordless vocals webbing around the instruments like the ghosts of her wrath. Coupled with the album’s occasional nods to D-beat, black metal, and even classic, riff-driven rock'n'roll, the Godspeed-shaped instrumental suggested a wider trajectory for Cloud Rat than that of mere Assück, Brutal Truth, or Carcass disciples. (Their cover of ""The Needle and the Damage Done"", one DJ Lethal turntable solo away from Limp Bizkit’s ""Faith"", would have dispatched any lingering doubt.) On Qliphoth, they doggedly power around those predecessors once and for all. Aside from their respective finales, neither of Cloud Rat’s previous albums included a track that broke the three-minute mark. But a quarter of Qliphoth’s songs do, evidence of the band’s decision and ability to do more here than plow ahead with vitriol, velocity, and volume. ""Udder Distance"", for instance, climbs from an arching riff and a low tempo to a tremolo-and-blast-beat bristle, touching on death metal and post-punk along the way. ""Raccoon"" unfurls as steadily escalating doom, the drums pulling backward even as Marshall’s voice arrows ahead. Previously a trio, Cloud Rat expanded into a quartet for Qliphoth, adding Brandon Hill and his abrasive electronics to the guitar, drums, and screams. His impact is immediate, as album opener ""Seken"" begins with a static roar, a droning guitar, and Marshall’s momentarily seraphic vocals, refracted as if by a prism. On ""Thin Vein"", the first half of a two-part suite, Hill emboldens the band’s slow rise from a post-rock drift into a powerful, Neurosis-sized coda. All of these influences wind around a grindcore framework, now five years in the making for Cloud Rat. They are cold and efficient when it comes to the basics, as on the 96-second tirade ""Live Wake"" or the prurient, punctuation-free ""Bloated Goat"". Marshall is thrilling and telling on these brow beaters, as she’s able to control her voice without mitigating its barbaric effect. With the band racing behind during ""Botched"", she manages to deliver commands like ""Get on your feet, you fucking dog"" with elocution and impact. You can actually hear what she’s talking about—and feel it, too. Even within metal, grindcore is often regarded as a relatively impenetrable niche, where lots of words and riffs come crammed in very little spaces. Sometimes, the pugnacious effect of it all gets more attention than the particulars. But on Qliphoth, Cloud Rat take the time and risks necessary to make sure their points are clear, that all their rage is not for naught. ""The end goal is really just for cathartic therapy, as it’s hard to express yourself in public,"" Marshall told Kim Kelly in an interview earlier this month. ""You can’t beat up your boss, you can’t stop the clock, etc. So we need this outlet to survive at this point."" To that end, Qliphoth invokes both folk and punk rock, idioms where form and function commingle rather than compete. Cloud Rat’s misgivings with the world both power and mutate the music they make, rendering a rebellious vision of liberation and existence. During ""Rusting Belt"", the band loops a sample of Brenna Sanchez, the co-director of a documentary about Detroit’s recent seizure by fire. ""Arson is a form of self-expression in a place where you can’t express yourself,"" she says. On Qliphoth, Cloud Rat extend tempestuous expressions for troubled times—proof of life, offered with utter conviction.","The songs on Qliphoth, the third LP from ambitious Michigan grindcore band Cloud Rat, portray characters often trampled under society’s feet.

Nature,Valet,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae6d13d197565213a0de/1:1/w_160/d2ee89e6.jpg,2015-05-28 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20614-nature/,Kranky,"Initially a solo project for Portland-based musician Honey Owens, Valet explored territory that was not far afield from the singer's work in spooky, experimental-minded groups like Jackie-O Motherfucker. The project released two full-lengths on venerable zone-out institution, Kranky, and also an EP on Mexican Summer before disappearing from view in the late 2000s. Since 2010, Owens and her partner, Rafael Fauria, have focused on creating hardware-driven psychedelic house music under the name Miracles Club, releasing a number of EPs on labels like Ecstasy and Mexican Summer. However, following the birth of their first child in 2013, the pair felt compelled to temporarily step away from club sounds. Rather than release the resulting mellower guitar-driven music as Miracles Club, Owens decided to resurrect Valet, only this time as a group, featuring Fauria and multi-instrumentalist Mark Burden. The result is Nature, Valet’s first record in seven years. A lot has changed. Previous Valet albums were song-driven, but much more abstract in their execution. The music was centered on Owens’ voice, but also readily wandered into extended space-outs—abstract doodles, warped guitar leads, and repetitive psychedelic loops. The music was gentle, but the improvisational disorder conveyed a certain amount of menace and discomfort. Nature is more focused and more serene. Both the melodic content and production style suggest that Owens and Fauria have been revisiting '90s psych and space-rock staples like Slowdive, Spiritualized, and the Verve (A Storm in Heaven-era Verve, at least). Those bands relied heavily on studio time and technology to generate a distinctively gauzy vibe—leaning heavily on reverb, delay, and lots of guitar overdubs. On Nature, Valet turns to similar sounds, but on a stricter budget. Much like Kranky-era Deerhunter and Atlas Sound (Owens was a touring member of that band), the group uses readily available resources—foot pedals, computer-based recording software, digital plug-ins—to dial in otherworldly ambience. It sounds DIY, but in a way that strengthens the record’s character and allows some distance from its influences. What really separates this most recent incarnation of Valet from the shoegaze records of yesteryear, though, is the songwriting. Old-school space rock bands were very concerned with transcending or escaping one’s physical self—revisit Ride’s ""Leave Them All Behind"", the Verve’s ""Slide Away"", or just about any Spiritualized song. On Nature, Owens’ lyrics tend to involve memory and personal upheaval, rather than altered states. ""Twelve different ways to put up a fight/ Upside down police cars under fire bridges,"" she sings on the record’s title track, which alternately recalls experiences with civil unrest, 40s, and LSD. For such a trippy, reverb-drenched, and ethereal set of songs, Nature is surprisingly intimate and reflective. Nature does deliver the psych-rock goods, though. The trio’s songs impart a feeling of ascension—with murky atmosphere giving way to nodding repetition and guitar-driven uplift.

Only here, the swirl of fuzz and echo isn't an exit from terrestrial woes, just a comfortable place to take stock for a moment.","Initially a solo project for Portland musician Honey Owens, Valet explored expansive territory not far from her work in groups like Jackie O Motherfucker. Since 2010, she and her partner have focused on making hardware-driven psychedelic house music as Miracles Club, but following the birth of their first child she's resurrected Valet as a more focused trio.

Consumer Complaints,Shopping,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae3f9d034d5c69bf44e2/1:1/w_160/fcd4a741.png,2015-05-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20572-consumer-complaints/,Fat Cat,"The London trio Shopping makes tight, bright, danceable post-punk that owes much to forebears like A Certain Ratio, Mo-Dettes, and Lucrate Milk, though it never sounds particularly dated or like a carbon-copy, a testament to the group's songwriting abilities. Their debut, Consumer Complaints, was one of the best punk records of 2013 when it was released by the group's DIY label Mïlk Records in November of that year. (Here it sees a U.S. release courtesy of larger longtime UK indie label Fat Cat Records.) All three members previously played together in the underrated group Covergirl, and all three sing here, though guitarist Rachel Aggs (also of Trash Kit, Golden Grrrls, and scores of other bands) takes lead on most of Shopping’s songs. Overlapping and circling vocal patterns are played to excellent effect, so that the vocals seem less like something that sit on top of the music, and more part of an integrated whole. Aggs’ trademark guitar style leans on broken and manipulated '60s-style garage riffs—in style and tone, in this band and others, her guitar work is often reminiscent of a less straightforward Holly Golightly/Headcoatees. This is one of the elements that keeps Consumer Complaints’ songs from blurring into one another, though they rarely vary in tempo. All of the songs also have their own structures: there's no verse-chorus-verse or predictable bridge insertion; instead, songs are structured to breathe, blurring into noise where necessary (""Santa Monica Place"") or stretching out melodic themes to disco ends (""Get Going""). As a result, no track seems too short or too long; one gets the sense that the songs have been structured only to start where they need to and then were allowed to grow organically into their recorded forms through repeated practice and performance. The politics on Consumer Complaints are refreshingly more embodied than didactic, mixing blunt statements about the alienation and immediacy necessary to queer desires under capitalism without preaching or feeling heavy-handed. Drummer Andrew Milk has said that Shopping ""never discussed having a particular political message at all as a band."" This may be yet another reason why Consumer Complaints bubbles with joy without being explicitly joyful and why this collection of songs never feels artificial or forced. There is no cool plastic sheen meant to signify the post-industrial age over this record, and Shopping’s music doesn’t feel consistently grinding or harsh, though they don’t shy away from dissonance or from breaking melodic motifs. These are warm, human songs, songs that celebrate real power in making the music you want to with your friends on your own terms, songs that celebrate the multifaceted natures of people struggling to make themselves heard via relatively antiquated technology in a sped-up world where human interaction is often mediated through digital simulacra.","The London trio Shopping makes tight, bright, danceable post-punk featuring blunt statements about queer politics and alienation. Their debut, Consumer Complaints, first out on the band's own DIY label in 2013, now sees a proper U.S. release.

King Gucci,Gucci Mane,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae839d034d5c69bf456a/1:1/w_160/a536f444.jpg,2015-05-28 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20633-king-gucci/,self-released,"Gucci Mane takes the restrictions of prison sentences as a challenge. He smuggles out music like contraband. It has become less about whether or not he’ll be able to produce while incarcerated and more about just how much music he can muster. Since his conviction on felony weapons charges in 2013, he’s supplied digital albums and mixtapes at a rate that’d make Lil B blush, all while serving a sentence that won't see him released until early 2017. At times, his release schedule feels like a personal affront to the penal system, a boast that his now historically prolific output cannot be stifled, not even by a cell. In an effort to keep up this charade, though, the quality of his mush-mouthed oeuvre has been erratic at best and numbing at worst. It seems during this current stint, his longest bid behind bars as a rapper and maybe the first where his relevance has been threatened, Gucci is releasing music more aimlessly than ever. Projects are compiled of old throwaways from long-forgotten hard drives. Mixtapes arrive one after the next or in packs with no consideration for consumer consumption. There is often little to no method to his madness. He releases new projects en masse simply for the sake of it. These days, it’s less about the music itself and more about how he rolls it out. But he’s been playing a game of diminishing returns: the more music a mercurial Gucci releases, the less people seem to check for it. When they do, it’s because of the stunt itself. February produced an EP entitled Views From Zone 6, an obvious play on the title of Drake’s forthcoming album, which featured eyebrow-raising features from Andy Milonakis and the Based God. In March, he released Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert, three albums and an EP which all did little to whet the appetite, but still received a sizable amount of coverage simply because of the grandness (and absurdity) of the gesture. On his last mixtape, Trap House 5 (The Final Chapter), he squandered nearly a dozen beats from Zaytoven only a few months removed from producing Future’s scintillating Beast Mode tape. In an effort to preserve his image as a mixtape workhorse, Gucci is slowly becoming a caricature. The general consensus surrounding Gucci Mane has always been that he’s limited by his inconsistency, a sentiment that resonates even louder now. On the title track from his newest mixtape, King Gucci, he hears those murmurs echoing: ""Some people say Guwop ain’t Gucci/ They say Bricksquad ain’t So Icy…/ What?!"" It’s a shot at any suggestion that he’s self-saturated to the point of being washed up or that he’s become a parody of his former self. There’s more disbelief in his voice than menace, as if to render the notion unthinkable. To that end, King Gucci feels like an attempt to reaffirm Gucci’s identity and re-establish his place in trap’s mixtape hierarchy with a measured dose of what he built his trap house on: a wild mixture of slurry phonetic gaffes, lumbering wordplay, and sly wit over production from the subgenre’s marquee names. When Gucci Mane is at his muddled best, his words mash together and his phrases bury ledes in favor of ancillary details so colorful they pique one’s interest. He doesn’t reach Peak Gucci on King Gucci, but there are flashes of it everywhere (""Cash smell like cocaina/ Got Febreze for all my cheese"" on ""Still Selling Dope""; the combo of ""My pops wasn’t ‘round but least he gave me good looks"" and ""Tattoos on my face card ‘cause I don’t want no job"" on ""I’m Too Much""). You still have to parse through his sometimes clumsy phrasing and garbled speech, but the flows are trickier here and the wordplay niftier than on a lot of his other recent releases. The woozy Tarentino production on the title track allows Gucci enough space to stretch and mash vowel sounds like putty. On ""Real Dope Boy"" he again implies a return to form: ""I’m back making old school trap boy music."" The tape’s highlight is the Chief Keef-produced ""Smart Mouth"", which pairs the GBE rapper/producer’s abstract synth work with some of Gucci’s more technical rapping. One underrated truth about Gucci is that he is an even better A&R than he is an artist, and while Gucci the Great Rapper can go dormant without warning, Gucci the A&R is one of the only constants in Atlanta’s ever-changing, burgeoning underground. King Gucci’s strongest argument for his staying power, maybe unknowingly, are the names lining its credits: those he helped nurture or nudge or promote throughout his illustrious run. DJs Scream and Drama, PeeWee Longway, Migos, Zaytoven, Metro Boomin, Tarentino, and TM88 have all built respectable careers with Gucci’s help and their presence here feels like another boast. King Gucci is a valiant but limited attempt to re-establish Gucci Mane’s foothold on trap from behind bars with old tropes and familiar faces.","Gucci Mane takes the restrictions of prison sentences as a challenge, smuggling out music like contraband.

Filth,Swans,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae78b1335d7bf1699da1/1:1/w_160/f0a2c502.jpg,2015-05-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20624-filth/,Young GodYoung God,"Michael Gira’s triumphant resurrection of Swans over the past few years has been more than a reboot. The gravelly visionary has recast himself as a dark evangelist, a man on a mission to pull thunder from the heavens and violent lust out of the repressed corners of the collective psyche. He was a different person 35 years ago, and Swans was a different band—but on Filth, Swans’ 1983 debut album, the unholy trinity of thunder, violence, and lust had already been well and powerfully established. On the new, 3xCD reissue of Filth, Gira’s protean potency is a harsh, unstable thing. The album was born in the wake of New York’s no wave movement, and Gira has professed to being antipathetic toward that scene—although Filth couldn’t have been made without its influence. The angularity, dissonance, and conspicuous illogic of no wave is ported over to tracks such as ""Stay Here"" and ""Right Wrong"", studies in disjointed animosity and bone-crushing, industrialized hip-thrusts that makes the funkiness of the era’s post-punk sound plastic. Punishment plays a large part in Filth, to the point where sadomasochism is framed as less of an aberrant perversion than a grueling continuum of normalcy—and at times, a state of ecstatic release. ""Weakling"" doesn’t denigrate the submissive; this isn’t fascist music, as its unforgiving textures might indicate, but a profound inversion of power: ""You know everything/ I forgot how to breathe/ You’re touching my chest/ When I’m touched, I bleed,"" Gira bellows through clenched jaws. He’s not accusing; he’s mocking, defiant, reverent, and adversarial, all at once, as if in a contest to beat his tormenter at his own game. It makes sense that Swans and My Bloody Valentine have each taken turns as being touted as the loudest band on Earth; there’s a direct line that can be drawn between Filth’s senses-obliterating, wall-of-agony blur and the thornier moments of Isn’t Anything. The inclusion of two discs of bonus material help flesh out Filth’s context, especially when it comes to the four tracks of Swans’ self-titled EP from 1982. Longtime (and current) Swans guitarist Norman Westberg had yet to make his debut on Filth, and original guitarist Bob Pezzola doesn't fully convey the earth-moving enormity of what Gira would soon realize; instead, ""Laugh"" and its fellow Swans songs are thinner, more brittle, and come across as the last gasp of no wave rather than a repudiation of it—right down to Daniel Galli-Duani’s serpentine saxophone skronk. That is, when they don’t sound like one of the hundred other Birthday Party clones of the time. Still, they point toward the piercing approach that Big Black and many others would pick up in the coming years, mating inhuman rhythms and sheet-metal guitars with cataclysmic spasms of futility. The generous live material included on Filth’s reissue is the most thrilling and telling part of the whole package. The consternation and confusion of the crowd is palpable in the nervous catcalls and sparse, almost petrified applause. Westberg’s guitar on a live-at-CBGB recording of ""Howling Red Sheet"" is the screech of a wounded Lovecraftian Elder God; the entwined percussion of Roli Mosimann and Jonathan Kane is all post-apocalyptic tribal and future-primitive ritual. Gira still had so much to accomplish with Swans, from proto-pigfucker to slick goth-pop to nihilistic drone to his current symphonies of cosmic transgression and dread. But with Filth, he opened up the Earth with his teeth, blackened and bloody, ready to begin.","Michael Gira was a different person 35 years ago, and Swans was a different band, but on Filth, Swans’ 1983 debut album, the unholy trinity of thunder, violence, and lust had already been powerfully established.

"Oh Man, Cover the Ground",Shana Cleveland & the Sandcastles,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae6b9d034d5c69bf4541/1:1/w_160/8297a456.jpg,2015-05-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20612-oh-man-cover-the-ground/,Suicide SqueezeHairdo,"At first it sounds like a wrong note, low and loud and gently discordant near the start of ""Butter & Eggs"", the opening track on Shana Cleveland’s solo debut. She picks out a quiet acoustic theme shaped roughly like a question mark, then dots it with a bass note that thrums loosely, a rattle that cuts the air and dispels the notion that Oh Man, Cover the Ground will be the kind of tasteful folk record that plays quietly in the background. There’s an entire guitar solo in that one moment, revealing Cleveland to be a deft player and a witty composer. She accentuates certain details with a percussive strike or a sudden strum, and that technique destabilizes ""Butter & Eggs"", which changes shape and direction on her whim rather than by any sense of melodic momentum. She’s been honing her chops as a solo artist for a few years now, although most readers may recognize her as one-fourth of the Seattle garage-pop outfit La Luz. The Sandcastles have been around maybe even longer in some form or another, its membership consisting of whoever happens to be onstage or in the studio with Cleveland at any given moment. For Oh Man, Cover the Ground, the band includes nine rotating musicians who add a flourish of clarinet, cello, and Wurlitzer to these songs. The music on ""Itching Around"" and ""SPATM"" is somehow both lush and austere, as the Sandcastles gently push against Cleveland’s guitar and her sunset of a voice. Even the keyboard solo on ""City to City"" sounds like it doesn’t want to get in her way. Cleveland is a guitarist first and foremost, a vocalist second, and a songwriter third. Her lyrics tend toward a kind of brisk poetry, stark and ominous and generally reluctant to dwell on any one moment or sensation. In just 63 words, ""City to City"" evokes an immense feeling of transience that any touring musician will recognize (""I began to wonder what our house was for""). Most of these songs, however, are about the simple pleasures of another body. ""Sweet Percy Perdue, my nights belong to you,"" she sings on ""Rounding the Block"". ""The peaks and valleys too, all the creatures that you drew."" It’s not what she's singing but the way she’s singing it: her voice straining slightly toward notes just outside her range, drawing out the phrases languidly, savoring the smoothness of those vowels like stones she found on the beach. This is, however, not a singer-songwriter’s album, but a guitar album—as befits a woman who illustrated a full set of folk trading cards. Cleveland may be routinely compared to other female singer-songwriters, but she may ultimately have more in common with the likes of William Tyler, Daniel Bachman, and James Blackshaw—that boy’s club of American Primitivists. The rolling reel that opens ""Holy Rollers"" and the almost Celtic fretwork of ""Quiet as Skin"" suggest an artist who is knowledgeable of the past but not beholden to it. She’s not an ostentatious player, although she certainly has the chops; she seldom solos and usually avoids the fussy filigrees that demonstrate technique as much as they serve the song. There is power in her brand of understatement, in letting a song almost fall apart just to show how sturdy it is.","The vocalist and guitarist Shana Cleveland, a member of the Seattle garage-pop outfit La Luz, proves to be a deft player and a witty composer on her solo debut.

Have a Nice Life,Murs,by: Marcus J.

While his versatility keeps him afloat, it’s tough to get a bead on exactly who Murs is and what he stands for—is he the conscious backpacker or the straight-talking street dude? He embodies the urban alternative, kids who crave artsy shit and push skateboards to the corner store, but after 18 years and many projects, there’s no single album that offers his full narrative. Have a Nice Life is perhaps the closest thing to such a release; many of these anecdotes pertain to Murs and offer insight into his California upbringing, finding the rapper at his most reflective. He’s assessing his current stature and how he arrived at this moment. It doesn’t take long to get the point. He’s got cute kids and a faithful wife. There’s food in the fridge and money in his bank account. Following a slew of record deals—including stops at Warner Bros. and Definitive Jux—Murs seems content at rapper Tech N9ne’s Strange Music label (a notion shouted out a few times on Nice Life). Oh, and in case you didn’t know, Murs gave certain West Coast rappers their first shot to shine. ""I could drop names, I could be that asshole,"" the rapper fumes on ""Surprises"". ""After all that, you’d think they’d be thankful/ But hoes ain’t loyal and niggas ain’t grateful."" Once the brash young reformist, Murs approaches Nice Life with gray-haired wisdom. He’s not trying to prove anything, instead sounding comfortable simply talking to his children and addressing societal issues. ""No More Control"" feels especially relevant amid the recent killings of unarmed black men by police. Yeah, he says, it’s fucked up what the cops are doing, but ""we got to start to take a look in the mirror … if we don’t respect ourselves, then they always gon’ fear us."" Have a Nice Life is as much about Los Angeles as it is about Murs. Between its autobiographical bent and rap-rock instrumentals, the album declares the rapper’s survival while paying homage to friends who didn’t make it. That’s why, at age 37, he’s embracing the signs of advancing age by hood standards. ""I don’t wanna dye my hair,"" Murs asserts on the opening track, ""‘cause a lot of my homies died before they got there."" Just how they passed is anyone’s guess, but listening to Have a Nice Life, it could be from a number of things: Maybe it was from the same stress outlined on ""PTSD"" (""niggas kill niggas just to fuck a bitch"") or ""Woke Up Dead"", which outlines the dangers of L.A. gang life. If those songs peek into Murs’ personal angst, it bubbles over on ""I Miss Mikey"", the album’s closing track and probable mission statement: ""One day I’mma lose and then I’ll be gone, I’m making these songs so that I live on."" As a whole, Have a Nice Life stands as a decent collection of songs that, while palatable, casually floats by in a sea of average beats by Jesse Shatkin, who produced much of the album. The composer specializes in hulking, pop-infused tracks, which don't quite mesh with the rapper's cohesive tales. At times, some of the stories grow stale without strong lyricism. We learn more about Murs, but he's still searching for that complete statement.","On Have a Nice Life, rapper Murs assesses his life and stature in hip-hop two decades in.

Assembling,Two Sheds,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae6913d197565213a0d3/1:1/w_160/095ac041.jpg,2015-05-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20610-assembling/,Crossbill,"Assembling is a thoroughly suburban record. Not in the conceptual sense of Real Estate or The Suburb. Rather, Two Sheds’ sophomore LP is suburban in how it prefers to maintain a distance from the bustle, turnover, and excitement that's so close in a city. When I listen to the Los Angeles quintet, I’m reminded of how quickly their home city can look like Anytown, USA if you drive 30 minutes in any direction—neat little plots, calm, manicured lawns, with the palm trees and sunshine making it look just a little more Californian. Appropriately enough, the CVs of everyone involved are heavy on supporting roles and side projects. After Two Sheds quietly released their debut Strange Ammunition in 2006, singer Caitlin Gutenberger moonlit in Rogue Wave offshoot Release the Sunbird. There, she met new Two Sheds drummer Josh Barnhart, who had once manned the skins for Rogue Wave-ish Port O’Brien. Barnhart replaced Rusty Miller, a collaborator of Cali power-pop mainstay Kelley Stoltz and Grandaddy’s Jason Lytle. The credits of engineer Eli Thomson include Everest and Delta Spirit, both of which are the kind of secretly very popular alt-roots bands you never read about in major publications. And it’s mastered by TW Walsh, a guy name-dropped as David Bazan’s trusted van driver in Pedro the Lion’s ""Bands With Managers"". Bassist Johnny Gutenberger is the outlier, having played for late-'90s alt-rock almosts Far, a band best known these days for giving Lupe Fiasco a hookman or being a major influence on Deftones. But while Two Sheds can sound like just about every band they’ve ever been affiliated with, that overstates their range. None of Far’s quasi-emo alt-metal seeps into Assembling, but it would’ve been a welcome jolt on a record that seems to revel in its lack of urgency. Gutenberger's lyrics tend to express passing concern about things not really worth getting worked up about. ""It’s Okay"" shares a common heartsickness with Rogue Wave’s ""Chicago x12"", of trying to stay enthusiastic while playing to empty rooms. But it’s nowhere close to touching the latter’s devastation and demoralization, the implication being that if no one comes out to see Two Sheds, at least they’ve got each other. Gutenberger's voice is suited for lower stakes, appealing and capable of blending in and reminiscing about the instability or novelty of her '90s influences rather than embodying them. ""Choose"" and ""Nighttime"" are earnest Mazzy Star homage, ""It’s Okay"" is Neko Case after being hit with a noise ordinance, the hints of Liz Phair are from her Whitechocolatespaceegg phase. And those are the edgier parts of Assembling. The core is the kind of clap-happy folk-pop that picks up right where Strange Ammunition left off, which is Los Angeles in 2006. On any given night at the erstwhile Spaceland back then, you might see Elvis Perkins or the Little Ones or the Parson Redheads or any number of Midlake-esque acts and be told in all seriousness that this was everything exciting about indie rock. I found out after the fact that Assembling was the result of a dare where Gutenberger was challenged to write 20 songs per day, and she did so for three days. Accounting for sleep, bathroom breaks, checking Twitter, and milling about the house, that rounds out to a new song every 45 minutes or so. In their words, the 14 resultant songs (and a pitch-shifted conversation about a drum set tagged as the closer) were considered ""solid"" enough to be included here. They are indeed sturdy and uniform in structure, with choruses arriving with the pleasant regularity of the mailman or street sweepers. The breeziness ensures that everything passes by like neighborly small talk, getting on before anything gets too invested or deep. Ultimately, it’s suburban in that there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s certainly a nice place to not have to worry about much. But if you’re feeling even slightly weird or craving adventure, Assembling can remind you just how suffocating Anytown, USA can be.","Members of L.A.'s Two Sheds have worked with Rogue Wave offshoot Release the Sunbird and Port O'Brien.

What You Hear (Is What You Hear),Thomas Brinkmann,by: Miles Raymer,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae2bc0084474cd0c1855/1:1/w_160/2de5e5e5.jpg,2015-05-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20553-what-you-hear-is-what-you-hear/,Editions Mego,"Spend too much time listening closely to music and you may find yourself obsessed with tones, ignoring the melody and rhythm that give songs meaning to most people. It’s a common affliction in recording studios, where one minute you can be doing something relatively mundane like figuring out the right placement for a hi-hat in the mix and the next thing you know you’re hours deep into microscopically tweaking an array of equalizers and compressors, feverishly searching for some sort of tonal nirvana. Usually this is a sign of studio madness, but some musicians and producers have made it a viable way of working. On What You Hear (Is What You Hear), German minimalist techno producer Thomas Brinkmann has gone deliriously over that particular edge. Minimal techno, a genre that revolves around compulsive sonic fastidiousness, is a breeding ground for tonal obsession—the picky ears of its makers and audience have played a major role in keeping pure analog synthesis alive and evolving during the periods when it wasn’t in style. Even within this context, Brinkmann stands out as an especially exacting engineer, and his recordings offer a sense of painstaking sumptuousness that stand apart from the rest of the minimal techno crowd. What You Hear (Is What You Hear) is minimalist, but it’s not techno. Each track consists of a single tone held for anywhere between two and 11 minutes, with minimal modulation and no significant changes in dynamics or pitch. Rhythm is only occasionally a factor, and only emerges as a byproduct of the sustained sound’s internal pulses, never as a separate track. Ambient’s not the right word for it either, because the songs are too alien-sounding to settle into the scenery. The static quality of the compositions don’t make for what’s traditionally considered an exciting listen, but anyone who enjoys dissecting what comes into their ears will find a lot of pleasure in What You Hear. It rewards listeners who take an active role in the listening, those willing to dig deeper, analyzing the elements in the sounds one at a time and teasing apart their structures. But the record’s not just for obsessive audio freaks. If you engage with the songs on their own terms they’re fascinatingly evocative. ""Ziegelrot"" (which means ""brick-red"") is a recursive, juddering howl that sounds like the first feedback-saturated seconds of a cheaply recorded hardcore song extended to the length of an entire 7"" side. ""Mitisgrün"" begins as something like the comforting white-noise pulse of a distant air conditioner unit and ramps up to a throbbing grind so slowly and subtly you’re likely to miss the point where it tips over from soothing to anxiety-inducing. Brinkmann’s experiment in pure tonality is the inverse of the works where he’s effectively removed it from his compositions entirely, producing music that’s pure rhythm. In the incredible video of a performance at Tokyo’s Taico Club, he skillfully etches lines in blank vinyl on eight turntables and constructs a fully rave-able techno song out of the staticky pops the gashes produce. The only apparent direction he has left is to make a record that doesn’t have any musical elements at all. It’ll probably sound great.","On his new collection, the German minimalist techno producer Thomas Brinkmann makes painstakingly sumptuous music that's minimalist, but isn't techno.

Remembering Mountains: Unheard Songs by Karen Dalton,Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adf39d034d5c69bf445c/1:1/w_160/1722186e.jpg,2015-05-27 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20515-remembering-mountains-unheard-songs-by-karen-dalton/,Tompkins Square,"Karen Dalton is one of the tragic ciphers, an Oklahoma-born folksinger who played a long-neck banjo and a 12-string guitar and sang weary, welling songs about bad and broken loves. For decades, late-arriving fans were told she died of AIDS, penniless and displaced, curled up on a New York City street corner. That particular bit of apocrypha has since been debunked (she was in the care of her friend, the guitarist Peter Walker, when she passed away in 1993), but it pervades her memory anyhow: Karen Dalton, lost soul. The saddest, sorriest voice of the '60s. Dalton only recorded two LPs in her lifetime, 1969’s Its So Hard to Tell Who’s Going to Love You the Best and 1971’s In My Own Time, both of which have since been reissued and lionized as lost folk classics—held up, decades later, as examples of how, sometimes, the culture falters, fails, picks the wrong heroes. Dalton wasn’t known as a songwriter—neither record contains a single original composition—but Walker, who oversees her estate, emerged recently with a stack of song lyrics (verses, snippets, poems) that she never got around to recording, or, maybe, never intended to. Dalton’s words were distributed to a handful of contemporary singers, and Remembering Mountains: Unheard Songs by Karen Dalton sees them put to new music, much like Billy Bragg and Wilco did with a pile of unrecorded Woody Guthrie lyrics on 1998’s Mermaid Avenue and again on its companion piece, 2000’s Mermaid Avenue, Vol. II. Bob Dylan said Dalton had a voice like Billie Holiday’s (lots of people thought so), but Holiday sublimated her suffering—there are the tiniest suggestions of it in her control, in the way she judiciously deployed vibrato, the way she pulled back, raised her chin—whereas Dalton let it bubble up, get ugly. There’s a comparable shrillness to vocals from Kurt Cobain, Axl Rose, all the great American sufferers; it’s there when Skip James sings, viciously, ""I'm so tired, and I am tired; I am tired."" It’s there when Dalton sings ""You haven't got a thing to say, you feel you want to run away,"" in ""Something’s on Your Mind"", and it reaches an apotheosis in that song’s devastating coda: ""Well, you know, you can’t make it without ever even trying."" That quality is what allowed her to take other people’s material and make it feel personal—in her voice, everything seems singular, a site-specific wound. The best tracks on Remembering Mountains do the same. Sharon Van Etten opens the record with the title track, the only song for which Dalton receives a non-lyrical credit (""words and chords by Karen Dalton""). Van Etten, joined by the Walkmen’s Hamilton Leithauser, has a particular knack for writing big, sweeping laments—the kinds of aching melodies that make your breath catch—and she manages to match or at least meet the deep melancholy that haunts so much of Dalton’s output. Van Etten sings here, as Dalton often did, of wanting her lover to be better, stronger: ""I’m believing/ You’ll find tomorrow."" Marissa Nadler’s take on ""So Long Ago and Far Away"" is brutal in its ghostliness, like a memory you can’t quite access, a memory that registers only as a loss. ""Friends and lovers all become/ So long ago and far away,"" Nadler intones, her voice breathy, bare. Elsewhere, songwriters build structures around Dalton’s words that feel more anachronistic (Diane Cluck’s beguiling ""This Is Our Love"" could be the lone ballad on any number of million-selling pop records), but few find anything particularly joyful in her lyrics; folks hungry for an alternate narrative about Dalton—something sweeter, more balanced—will have to look elsewhere. Lucinda Williams comes closest to at least finding some toughness in Dalton’s found language: ""He asked me if I needed help/ I told him to go help himself,"" she sings on ""Met an Old Friend"". A few peals of blues guitar act as a kind of confirmation—the look you give after you tell someone to back off. Remembering Mountains is maybe the closest we’ll ever get to hearing Dalton’s own articulations of heartache, although plenty was communicated on her first two records, regardless of whether the words there were her own. Still, there’s a palpable narrative here, a sense of loss and stillness, and it reanimates Dalton, if only for a moment. It’s good to have her back.","The classic Oklahoma-born folksinger Karen Dalton released just two albums in her lifetime, but her estate recently emerged with a stack of song lyrics that she never got around to recording. These words were distributed to a handful of contemporary singers like Sharon Van Etten, Julia Holter, Marissa Nadler, and Laurel Halo, who put them to music.

LO,Crosss,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae4a5e6ef95969321c1f/1:1/w_160/2d87927f.jpg,2015-05-26 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20581-lo/,Telephone Explosion,"Crosss conjure the sound of empires crumbling—theirs is a tremorous, ominous, eerily isolating squall tailor-made for dilapidated castles rotting from mildew and overrun with vermin. The Toronto-via-Halifax trio’s sludgy psych-rock may be too alternately scabrous and cerebral to be classified as metal, unless you’re talking about the actual physical material: This stuff is leaden and impenetrable, with visible signs of rusting and corrosion. On paper, Crosss appear to be a band that has recorded two albums, but really, they’re more like two different bands that have made four EPs. LO adheres to the dichotomous structure of 2013’s Obsidian Spectre, treating its two sides as discrete canvasses to display dramatically different paintings—one rigidly formalist, one imposingly abstract. The former sees March, bassist Ryan Allen, and drummer Nathan Doucet pushing the first album’s acidic aesthetic—whimsical, wandering Syd Barrett-like musings set atop the doomy drones of mid-'90s Earth—toward a more accelerated state of decay. Rather than try to showcase Crosss’ impressive onstage power in all its woofer-blasting glory, LO burrows deeper into the murk—on songs like ""Interlocutor"" and ""Mind"", Crosss come off like an early-'70s free-festival attraction sinking into quicksand mid-set. Though they average out at three minutes, the tracks on LO’s first side are overstuffed with riffs that are complicated enough to be guitar solos, and melodies that swerve and circle back like a bumblebee’s flight path. But the songs are all complex in precisely the same way—nearly every one of them begins with March launching into one of his byzantine verses within the first five seconds, leaving the band little time to establish a distinct identity for each track, and despite the constant rhythmic change-ups happening underneath, the overall pace never moves beyond a lumbering lurch. (Even when March unplugs for the acoustic anomaly ""Dance Down"", there’s no reprieve from the album’s uniformly grim atmosphere—if anything, unfettered lines like ""how can you corrupt my mind?"" only enhance the pervading sense of psychosis.) As such, the 18-minute guitar-scraped soundscape—dubbed ""Enthroning the 4 Acts""—that comprises LO’s back half feels less like a free-form indulgence than a necessary break from side one’s constricting schematic, with undulating waves of feedback gradually yielding to a surprisingly affecting symphony of feedback squeals in the piece’s dying moments. But despite their seemingly oppositional intents, the two halves of LO prove oddly complementary. If LO’s shorter, melodic songs find March projecting the dark majesty of a crazed king madly circling the halls of his empty palace as the peasants outside prepare to revolt, ""Enthroning the 4 Acts"" is the sound of it burning to the ground.","The sludgy Toronto-via-Halifax band Crosss may be too alternately scabrous and cerebral to be classified as metal.

Casino Life 2: Brown Bag Legend,French Montana,by: David Turner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae745e6ef95969321c56/1:1/w_160/fdc08dba.jpg,2015-05-26 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20621-casino-life-2-brown-bag-legend/,Coke Boys,"French Montana won the rap game. He signed to a major label, he scored a few hit singles (""Pop That"", ""Freaks"", ""Ain’t Worried About Nothin"") and released his debut album, Excuse My French**, on the strength of said singles. Since the record's release, though, French’s name attracted greater attention for dating Khloé Kardashian than any music he’s put out. Casino Life 2: Brown Bag Legend, his first solo project since Excuse My French*,* appears to show that life's been good since we last heard from him. The Morocco-born and South Bronx-raised rapper has never shied away from sharing the spotlight on a given song, which was often to Excuse My French's detriment. Casino Life 2 takes new stylistic turns with each new guest appearance, most of which reveal French’s overlooked rapping versatility. The monolithically dark sound that gained him attention beyond New York City a few years ago with ""Choppa Choppa Down"" is still heard on the lumbering ""Hard Work"" and ""Body Numb Full of Drugs"", but the soulful opener ""Hang On (Intro)"" and closer ""To Each His Own (Outro)"" offer a new perspective with a more inward turn, a welcome respite from the rest of the tape’s tiring drug-lord myth building. Still, the clichéd subject matter is where French Montana sounds the most comfortable, as he raps about enjoying the spoils of life. He name drops label-boss Diddy numerous times and there's a Diddy-like top-of-the-world giddiness on ""I Ain’t Gonna Lie"" and ""5 Mo"". It doesn’t hurt that the latter track is produced by trap mastermind TM88 and features young hotshots Travi$ Scott and Lil Durk, so French can rap ""Fall asleep in the East/ Wake me up on the West"" knowing the rest of the talent can pilot the track. That intoxicating aesthetic holds up Casino Life 2 so that ""Moses"", an ingenious pairing of Chris Brown and Migos, can sit on the same tape as a classic smoked out Curren$y track (""In the Sun""). The ability to weave between such varied styles holds everything together, even when weighed down by mediocre features from the likes of Rick Ross and will.i.am. A little more than a week after the tape was released, French’s longtime partner and frequent collaborator Chinx was shot dead in Queens, New York. Casino Life 2 was released a week before his untimely death, but when Chinx appears on ""Off the Rip"", the triumphant turns solemn. The weight of what happened to Chinx hangs over the tape, but by the time it ends French's overriding joy is impossible to ignore.","The Morocco-born and South Bronx-raised rapper has never shied away from sharing the spotlight on a given song.

UFO Rot,Tropical Trash,by: Raymond Cummings,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae5613d197565213a0af/1:1/w_160/d9d4be26.jpg,2015-05-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20596-ufo-rot/,LoadRiot Season,"The earliest recordings from Louisville, Kentucky's Tropical Trash paint a portrait of a band in the throes of a gnarly identity crisis: punchy quickies that straddle hardcore and brownout punk; prickly, atonal half-hour jams that imply psychological warfare; plus the sort of outre, unclassifiable anti-music one might expect Byron Coley to extol in his Wire magazine ""Size Matters"" column. They were, it seemed, covering the spread, and on debut LP UFO Rot, the band flaunts and doubles down on this indecisiveness until it begins to resemble a hard-fought virtue. ""New Flesh"" leads the album off in slash-and-burn fashion, a squealing fit of gnarled guitar distortion and primal drum pound that cuts out almost as soon as it’s begun. Astringent, one-chord thrash dominates the title track until—after a pregnant, feedback drenched pause—the song crashes through to a vista that’s more intensely chromatic and muscular. Enough gaps stud the blurred hardcore of ""Heehaw Collider"" that Tropical Trash have got to be baiting the slam-dancers in their audience. ""Leisure Exposure"" broadens the canvas to a more Fugazi-an notion of punk that contains heaving multitudes: snaggle-toothed slacker-rock solos, scales flambeed though furious ascents and descents, cymbal-strike drizzles, massed, pogoing ignition-rev dashes. Things get hairier on the wild, freewheeling back half. Nine-minute ""Knowing"" glides from steamrolling prog-metal sludge to pulse-lowering snarl and back, while ""Pink Sweat"" genuflects at the glowering low-end of Shellac, eventually shoving white-hot dynamism so deep into the red that the song all but disintegrates. The overall effect, for the uninitiated, amounts to sort of a bait-and-switch, like early, aggro Black Flag giving way mid-set to late, furiously self-indulgent Black Flag. Lyrically, UFO Rot mines themes of discomfort that complement the music’s restlessness, with the sneered non-sequiturs of co-vocalists Jim Marlowe and Ryan Davis calibrated to alienate and reject. ""Any thought, if peeled, will pull apart,"" the duo deadpan on the title track. ""Heehaw Collider"" is home to a tortured refrain of ""I can’t complain,"" while the lyric ""it’s my intention to refuse you"" turns up on two different songs. What fuels Tropical Trash, ultimately, is a raw, generous anxiety—borne of youth, borne of aimlessness, borne of limitlessness—so communicable that it’s nearly anthemic. If that seems slight, it’s certainly worth remembering that cults have been built on much less.","Louisville, Kentucky's Tropical Trash straddle hardcore and punk, while mixing in atonal half-hour jams and outre, unclassifiable anti-music.

Days With Dr. Yen Lo,Dr. Yen Lo,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae349d034d5c69bf44cc/1:1/w_160/e9a51b53.jpg,2015-05-26 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20561-days-with-dr-yen-lo/,Pavlov Institute,"In the opening scene in John Frankenheimer’s 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate, Frank Sinatra’s character, Major Bennett Marco, dreams that he and his former squadron are attending a ladies’ garden party in New Jersey. Soon, we realize the scene is a dream within a dream: The garden party is a shared hallucination by the soldiers, sitting catatonic in a medical theater in China, where they have been made guinea pigs for a Communist brainwashing program. The soldiers’ false tea party and the sordid conference become intertwined—the Communists show up in New Jersey, and the hydrangea-obsessed matron stands at the podium in Manchuria. The film loses itself in the enslaved squadron’s nightmare. Presiding over the pitch-black comedy is the mysterious Chinese doctor and hypnotist Yen Lo, who ultimately brings the garden party to a close by ordering the Sergeant, Raymond Shaw (played by Laurence Harvey), to kill two of his own comrades. The scene introduces the brutal, hopelessly entangled systems of control and indoctrination that dominate The Manchurian Candidate, the elements of the story that interest Brooklyn rapper and producer Ka and producer Preservation on their new album, Days With Dr. Yen Lo. The album does not in any way retrace the plot of the film or the book that inspired it (a page, half-obscured, is the cover of the album), but instead engages with its themes, playing off of soundbytes interspersed between songs. The album and the twist-filled noir share a paranoiac atmosphere: Tension is everywhere and nowhere in particular. Nothing turns out right; no one breaks the shackles that held them without a scar or much worse. ""Yen Lo,"" in both, is the unrepentant arbiter of fate, both the cold facts and entropy of life, concentrated into one force. The primary conflict in Ka’s verses is the same as that of Shaw’s and Marco’s: attempting to self-actualize, after realizing you’ve been under the thrall of a deception that has contorted your entire sense of reality for so long. In most of these songs, the lies Ka unravels relate to crime: the insidious desire to commit it, and the systemic filing-down of one’s moral fabric that allows one to do so. In just a few lines, Ka can evoke simultaneously the fear, desperation, and poisonous ennui of his particular troubled upbringing, though he speaks for more than himself: ""Crime is how mind rewarded doubt/ Time’s a drought, climb that waterspout/ Itsy bitsy, slung to get crispy/ Almost choked in the web spun to fix me."" Ka positions music itself as part of the process of reclaiming himself, and rapping as a way to access thoughts and emotions that might otherwise seem out of reach to him, or those who can relate to his stories. To communicate all this most transparently, Ka lets his words phrase themselves, recalling NYC-area forbearers like Guru and Rakim. The dizzying inner consonances in his lines jump out of their own accord, as if Ka, with his hushed, unwavering monotone, is simply a vessel for them to move through; all of the action and consternation has already occurred on the notepad. His great skill is his almost inconceivable level of control and precision. Just the honeyed sounds of his words are hypnotizing in themselves; his expertly matched vowel sounds melt into one uninterrupted stream in some phrases, registering almost like one low whistle. His pace is continuous, sometimes dizzying. Processing both form and content at once requires a specific type of meditative listening: the kind that can only happen once one has lost track of themselves in the sound, and let distractions and interference gradually fall away, rather than pushing them off. Trying too hard to latch onto anything here means automatically falling behind. But reaching this type of deep-listening nirvana is not a necessity; this is music that sounds great any way you come at it. Preservation’s production is a psychedelic, sometimes seasick symphony of fragments from LPs, often cut out in large swatches and dovetailed into one another expertly. At times, a shag-carpet studio orchestra sweeps toward climaxes without really reaching them; more often, a simple, plaintive guitar lick drones, or a warbling organ peals unexpectedly, recalling either a gospel coda or a spy thriller soundtrack. There are also some of the small, locked-groove loops Ka gravitated towards on his previous two LPs—more pulsations than kernels of melody or licks, flickering like candles on the verge of burning out. One of the most notable aspects of the album is its near-complete lack of percussion. Few of these songs include kick and snare drums, and none are anchored by them. His voice—in the middle of the mix, bolstered by eerie, repitched overdubs—is the only consistent rhythm instrument. Ka has phased out elements of the typical East Coast-indigenous rap beat architecture over his past several releases (most dramatically on the ascetic The Night’s Gambit, with its charcoal-shaded minimalism) and here, we’ve reached a new type of freefall. Ka’s sound is so specific that it is easy to hear a new release, register it as more of the same, and coast through it. But you’d miss the most stunning element of his work: the way in which the rapper seems to cut a little bit more of something away with each new project, something which unnecessarily complicates his ideal mode of direct and razor-sharp communication. Here, he allows more negative space in, creates pictures more economically, peels away some vestigial density. The old releases hold the same power, but every time you grab a new Ka release, it feels as if you are holding a more refined product.","John Frankenheimer’s 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate inspired Brooklyn rapper/producer Ka and producer Preservation on their powerful new album, Days With Dr. Yen Lo.

Multi-Love,Unknown Mortal Orchestra,by: Jeremy D. Larson,Reviews Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae53b1335d7bf1699d5e/1:1/w_160/ba4b63db.jpg,2015-05-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20590-unknown-mortal-orchestra-multi-love/,Jagjaguwar,"Unknown Mortal Orchestra's music is like a game of hide-and-seek, revealing one thing only to bury another. Blink and you’ll miss the guitar in the beginning of Multi-Love’s ""The World Is Crowded"" because a burst of synths comes in and saturates the track to a pure white hum. If you don’t catch the anxieties and heartbreaks of polyamorous love, it’s because Ruban Nielson has compressed and phased his voice down to a thin analog texture. Falling for UMO is as easy as taking time to look for what Nielson conceals in his songs. It can be a vintage Crumar synth tangled in the mix, or him pondering if someone would listen to his ""silly voice"" on the last day of their life; a loose hi-hat on the off-beat subtly driving the verse into the chorus, or him thinking his wife’s love for him is her ""fatal flaw."" For as tuned-in and specific as it is, Multi-Love is multivalent. Next to some baroque '60s beat music there’s a Zappa homage, propped up against a dance track you could find on a Giorgio Moroder record, followed by some pigeon-toed funk that you should probably do a bunch of drugs to. It’s a wunderkammer inside, cramped with hundreds of tiny gestures, musical and lyrical. Recall, this is a guy who’s obsessed with taking huge pop ideas, like ""How Can You Luv Me"" off his debut album, and turning them completely inward. That song could be a Bruno Mars No. 1 hit in the hands of a major label producer. But Nielson is a fussy gear-head who loves psychedelia, shredding on his guitar without a pick, and, well, making music to do a bunch of drugs to. All the pop songs are buried deep in the mossy soul of Multi-Love. Nielson produced, mixed, and engineered the entirety of Multi-Love. Some back-end teams work hard to hide in the shadows and feel that if they do their job well, the listener won’t even notice any production. Nielson is the opposite of that. The production is so central it’s almost another character on the album, corroding and tripping out the instruments, and compressing drum tracks down so they can fit in the palm of your hand. At times it feels like you’re listening to the album with un-popped ears. Once in a while, on simpler songs like the mid-tempo ""Stage or Screen"" or the obtuse motown-soul of ""Ur Life One Night"", make this vintage sheen feel like a crutch rather than a purposeful tool. Nielson's ear for how something should sound is unparalleled, and his fastidious choices behind the boards are a large part of what makes Multi-Love a joy to listen to. It's as if he tried to make Stevie Wonder’s Innervisions and Prince’s Sign ‘O’ the Times in secret, so as not to wake the kids upstairs—private celebrations and private exorcisms. The most outspoken Nielson gets is on ""Can’t Keep Checking My Phone"", a single worthy of Larry Levan’s crate at Paradise Garage as some one-off flamenco disco track stuck near the end of the set. Underneath the spacey dance party, Nielson lays out a bittersweet song about missing someone you love, while the other person you love is right by your side. In a recent profile, Nielson said, ""Think about the two most serious relationships in your life so far, and then experiencing them simultaneously."" Polyamory is an emotionally and spiritually dense topic to approach on an album, and, for someone with a third-eye tattoo, Nielson mostly avoids speaking in hempy clichés. Save for some grand overtures on the title track that actually feel more expository than anything else, his laments about these two women in his life are as finely portioned as the music below it. He ropes his feelings under universal themes on ""Extreme Wealth and Casual Cruelty"". Who wouldn't want to abandon it all and start over again as ""just strangers"" without the strictures of money or society? It's a story as old as time, only in Nielson's case, it just happens to be star-triple-cross'd lovers. This is Nielson's most accomplished album, though it's not his most direct, or brash, or explosive. Those are moods he mostly saves that for the closer, ""Puzzles"". The seven-minute song serves as a tacked-on coda with overdriven '70s hard rock guitar and Nielson stretching the capacity of his vocals to a bluesy peak. It will kill live, as will most of these songs which will bend into longer, louder psych forms in rock clubs. But ""Puzzles"" feels broad and out of place here, despite its charms. Maybe it's the ""Electioneering"" outlier of an album with such an evocative mood. I think there's more to be found in the horn part on the endlessly melodic ""Necessary Evil"", played by Nielson's father. It's soft as Muzak, a simple up-and-down melody with smooth swing rhythm. When Nielson coos the words ""necessary evil,"" the horn line just shifts forward one beat in the measure, making it sound entirely different while actually staying the exact same. It's one small link in a long chain of moments strung together seamlessly and imbued with so much.","The production on Unknown Mortal Orchestra's third album is so central it’s almost another character on the album, corroding and tripping out the instruments. Ruban Nielson's fastidious choices behind the boards are a large part of what makes Multi-Love a joy to listen to.

Fundamentals,Onra,by: Clayton Purdom,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae4913d197565213a099/1:1/w_160/dc6917cf.jpeg,2015-05-22 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20580-fundamentals/,All City,"It would be easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Onra. Over the course of seven records the Parisian producer has doggedly followed the throwback trends of the moment. Early records contributed to a global surplus of California-by-way-of-Detroit hip-hop; a few years later, he and a lot of other people started rooting around in big, breezy synthesizer lines, one nation under a Sonics snapback. Onra never released a bad album in this decade-long span, but he also never exactly released a good one, all defined by an ineluctable acceptableness. But there were a handful of easy-listening bangers spread throughout those records, the sort of amber-hued boom-bap that transcends trend and reference point (""Sitting Back"", ""Hold Tight""), and on Fundamentals he finally locks into that easy groove front to back. The result feels immediately like his best album, or at least his most fun one. The title implies a return to basics, but in practice it’s the opposite: the productions, which look heavily to late-'80s and early-'90s R&B and pop-rap, are dizzyingly diffuse in places. Many, such as ""Like You Miss Me"" and ""Over & Over"", traffic in the same gauzy washes of sound as 2012’s Deep in the Night, but less as a matter of course and more as a purposeful counterpoint to the other, crisper tracks here. It’s Onra’s most writerly album: even if it’s all verse-chorus-verse stuff, it’s a delight to hear the hi-hats on ""Every Second"" rush headlong into the hook, breathless as the beat itself. Don’t let the romantic notes fool you, though: this is low-bitrate barbecue-rap, good on nice speakers but fine coming off a laptop because you’re day-drunk and the playlist was too short. I don’t mean this as faint praise: Fundamentals is purposefully feather-light stuff, and its bounty of guest vocalists seem to intuit this and accordingly not give a shit. Chuck Inglish and the Doppelgangaz drop the sort of placeholder raps that normally only fans of J-pop get to hear (sample lyric: ""I might buy you a scone, or get you a streusel/ This ain’t no Kool-Aid drink mix, it’s Metamucil""), and a parade of professional crooners find their voices phasing in and out of the mix. Do or Die and Daz Dillinger stop by to lend credibility to Onra’s Kangol-era fetishism, his transcontinental, trend-agnostic vision of '90s hip-hop approximating the way it might be experienced in the post-streaming era. Still, these vocal performances, so consistently characterless that it seems to be an artistic intention, point to the very thing the album lacks: a soul. At this point Onra is a portal to his own influences rather than a synthesis or evolution of them; Fundamentals is essentially an album-length recommendation to dig into Mary J. Blige’s early works. This is fine advice, but damning for Onra. His dream of the '90s is frequently beautiful and wholly sincere, but increasingly creepy, full of uncanny-valley hooks and rappers whose facial features seem to blur and morph. Why these people are together is unexplained; the reference points all point to other reference points, an endless loop of hyperlinks atop a glitchy .gif of someone popping champagne. Fundamentals, like every other Onra album, is a well-timed evocation of the past, slotting neatly alongside recent work by Devonté Hynes, Kindness, How to Dress Well, and many others, but there is a difference Onra still doesn’t grasp between being of the moment and being a part of it.","On the longtime Parisian hip-hop producer Onra's new album, Fundamentals, he locks into an easy groove front to back, even when the compositions are dizzyingly diffuse.

"Recollected Ambient Works, Vol. 1: Bored of Excitement",Kid606,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae5dc0084474cd0c18b3/1:1/w_160/8ecc1498.jpg,2015-05-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20602-kid-606-recollected-ambient-works-vol-1-bored-of-excitement/,Tigerbeat6,"For Miguel De Pedro, ambient music is a savior from his darkest curiosities. Erratic glitch, overbearing gabber, pitiless techno, violent jungle, persnickety IDM—they all melt away under the healing balm Kid606 finds in ambient music. And it's been so for a decade and a half now. Since he first ditched the caustic digital processes of Down With the Scene to bathe in The Soccergirl EP and P.S, I Love You's crystalline, ambient ephemera, the California native has continued to sneak out of the rave and into the chillout room. Recent albums found Kid606 increasingly enchanted by that space: Never mind that 2012's Lost in the Game sported backlit atmospherics and titles like ""Gimme Summer"" and ""Step Into the Light You Fucking Idiot"", the soft-focused Happiness followed with a full-on embrace of the changing mood. In a sense, Kid606 has been settling down. Though De Pedro's habits aren't entirely predictable, he can usually be counted on to issue some kind of musical mood stabilizer sooner or later. Recollected Ambient Works, Vol. 1: Bored of Excitement is that exact maneuver, but it's also something unheard of from the electronics specialist: a piano album. Which actually isn't all that surprising. Given De Pedro's trend towards the melodic, it seems natural that the escape he seeks now is peaceful contemplation. You can imagine these seven pieces as a sanctuary: cavernous, majestic, and warm. Restrained and stately, Bored of Excitement searches for a quiet joy in austere processed piano compositions. De Pedro never shies from an upwards chord change, favors the bright twinkle of high-octave harmonies, and is sure to work in a resounding strike of every titular root chord (""A Minor"", ""B Minor"", etc.). And all post-production treatments—i.e. heavy room reverb, barely perceptible delays, time stretching, slow filter sweeps, and additional synth washes—are only meant to enhance the soft halo of light around his performances. There are moments, however, when electronic flourishes and swollen drones gently overcome the simple piano progressions, and they feel like a pointed effort to give Bored of Excitement a bit of Kid606's rambunctious heart. Better late than never, ""F Minor"" and ""G Minor"" both make necessary ripples in a record that assumes still waters will always be deep. De Pedro's arrangements default on minimalism and thoughtful euphoria. The techniques suit him, too, even when they seem to articulate his inexperience with piano. Most of the album is set against backdrops of humming incidentals and tonal whorls, which sound rapturous up to the point that they become a nuisance. ""C Minor"", for instance, basks in the glow of a brilliant counter-melody and its sonorant trails, whereas ""E Minor"" further muddles already nebulous chord phrasings with the stagnant din they create. With all the mist hanging in the air, the rare occasions that we hear an untreated piano are somehow rendered miraculous in their clarity. Bored of Excitement's brief liner notes state that De Pedro began work on the record in Berlin during 2012, ending three years later in Los Angeles. Yet the music does little to reflect the time and space he spanned or the changes he underwent—to its benefit. Each of the seven pieces feels fluid and seamless in sequence, like an orchestral movement slowly building to crescendo for the finale. Which is commendable coming from an artist known for hammering Missy Elliott, Kylie Minogue, and N.W.A. songs into cyberpunk dancefloor salvos. Compared to, say, Nils Frahm or even Jon Hopkins, Kid606 is a tourist at the bench, so his command of electronic processes and knowledge of ambient music is what essentially makes his work with the piano rewarding. That Bored of Excitement is only De Pedro's first volume of such music means he's off to a promising start.","Restrained and stately, Kid606's newest collection searches for quiet joy in austere processed piano compositions. The few post-production treatments—room reverb, additional synth washes—are only meant to enhance the soft halo of light around his performances.

A Shapeless Pool of Lovely Pale Colours Suspended in the Darkness,Smurphy,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae52ea9e61561daa6260/1:1/w_160/88fcdfa4.jpg,2015-05-22 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20589-a-shapeless-pool-of-lovely-pale-colours-suspended-in-the-darkness/,Leaving,"The title of Jessica Smurphy's new album came from a sentence that the Mexico City producer stumbled across in J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan: ""If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colors suspended in the darkness."" That description, which sounds a bit like a compositional prompt Yoko Ono or John Cage might have come up with, happened to correspond with her image of love. But not just romantic love, and definitely not Hallmark Cards' definition—more like love as a cosmic thing, boundless and electric; love as the connective tissue of the universe. ""Love is not only pink ribbons and sugar, it is a living thing, it is sudden, it is insane,"" she says. Smurphy's synaesthesia game must be strong, because Shapeless Pool sounds, in fact, like all those things at once—a squirmy living being, writhing, twitching, sticky sweet. Smurphy comes from Mexico's NAAFI crew, which made its name by putting an idiosyncratic spin on jagged, avowedly marginal styles, from moombahton to tribal guarachero to Jersey-inspired club. But she makes a good fit on Leaving, an L.A. label, run by Matthewdavid, that specializes in outer-limits music from artists like Ras G, M. Geddes Gengras, Knxwledge, and even Julia Holter. She is a psychedelic artist at heart, with an approach that goes to the marrow of the mind/body dichotomy. There are two main facets to her music: hazy ambient and machinelike footwork. The rhythms, played out on high-pitched electronic toms and leathery hand-drum samples, move so fast that they seem almost to stand still. And the haze, meanwhile, works in the opposite way: as a nearly static, gelatinous mass that gradually yields a wealth of detail, the longer you look at it. It all seems simple, lo-fi, even a little bit crude, but it turns out to be wildly complex, and impossible to take in all at once: Every time one thing is revealed, something else is hidden. It's the mountaineer's dilemma: you can focus on the sparkling mineral in the rock face or the overwhelming bulk of the mountain itself, but you can't appreciate both at once. Whatever the track markers might indicate, these aren't so much discrete songs as passages that flow together into long, seamless movements. (The album's only physical release is on cassette, which feels appropriate.) Chiming guitars and whirring drums create a bridge from the opener into the sketch-like ""Sunset"", in which birds chirp in time to the high-frequency hiccup of cell-phone interference, and on into ""Aquarius Risinn"", a breakbeat cut that sounds like a fusion of DJ Shadow, Cocteau Twins, and Tujiko Noriko, with a nod to Sounds of North American Frogs. At the end of side one, ""Le Doppe Shoppe"" offers time-stretched trance arpeggios over haywire son-clave rhythms and drunken bumblebee buzz; karate-flick gongs ease the transition into ""PyramiDUB"", in which the bees persist, but the rhythm morphs into a pattern reminiscent of grime, only hammered out on a tin roof. The B-side opens with more gongs and bells and bowls, watery invocations, and streaks of white noise. Her voice rarely takes the fore, but its presence never feels far from the action, like a benevolent ghost. She sings as though no one ever told her the bars on the stave are supposed to cleave notes into discrete units, but it's not a disagreeable sensation; the way she slides around the pitch fits the general slipperiness of her music. ""Alexander.Technique"" gives us shaker-heavy footwork patterns, chants through a broken microphone, and Woody Woodpecker on military-grade amphetamines. It all drops 40 beats per minute for ""Lean&Mean"", a woozy coda that rides a skronking sax/bass line. Then she lets it fly for the closing ""Pisces"": doorbell-buzz keyboards, Morse-code kick drums, and all manner of incidental clatter, including something that sounds like a typewriter attacking a milkshake. To drive home the title, there is even the sound of splashing water. It is welcoming and bewildering in equal measure, and the same could be said for ""J A R D Í N"", an A-side highlight, and one of the few things here that would make sense on its own, or dropped into another context, like a DJ mix. Where most of the album is as hazy as the skies over Mexico City, this one's all empty space punctuated by small, slivery sounds: woody hand drums, thimblefuls of sampled voice, crystalline trumpets, a hi-hat played by a drummer with restless-leg syndrome. A record scratches back and forth, less hip-hop than a cartoon approximation of hip-hop. Jerking and throbbing, the track evokes a kind of rubbery pointillism, a surrealistic meeting of mallet and gummy bear. It dissolves into a pitched-down snippet of movie dialogue, and then, with ""Wicked"", we're back into more familiar terrain: Rhodes riffing, Smurphy's own watery coos, a child's voice gibbering ""The wicked!"" It's the Brainfeeder wheelhouse, and for a moment, it feels almost like solid ground. Then the loops speed up, handclaps scatter like a flock of pigeons, and we're back in Smurphy's own incomparable world, living and sudden and sugary, our perception stretched taut between the forest and the trees.","Whatever the track markers might indicate, the songs on Mexico City producer Jessica Smurphy's new full length flow together into long, seamless movements of ambient haze and machinelike footwork. She is a psychedelic artist at heart, with an approach that goes to the marrow of the mind/body dichotomy.

Highlights,Tanlines,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae3db1335d7bf1699d36/1:1/w_160/65ef194f.jpg,2015-05-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20571-highlights/,True Panther,"After Random Access Memories, The 20/20 Experience, and Reflektor, we were tired of protracted album release stunts. Now we have Surprise-Album Fatigue. Granted, Tanlines don’t answer to as big of an audience as Justin Timberlake or Beyoncé. But they deserve an immense amount of credit for constructing a rollout for Highlights that likely could’ve gone on for another two years without complaint. The Brooklyn duo’s second LP was teased with a Netflix-aping website, and ""premiered"" with a fake ""conference call"", which featured some ""Sound Advice"" from ""SNL""'s Vanessa Bayer. Eric Emm and Jesse Cohen’s charming social media presence had long established that they’re ""one of us"" and they’re the change we want to see in Music Nerd Twitter: clever, but not snarky, self-aware but not overly self-conscious, willing to poke fun at the inherent silliness of PR, album cycles, and branding without framing the whole affair as meaningless. Now, very little of this innovation or irreverence or ingenuity carries over to Highlights, but the goodwill Tanlines have generated isn’t all for naught. It just allows one to see the divergence between the rollout and the record as an unfortunate coincidence rather than a cynical cover-up. There is a kernel of truth behind the Tanlines-as-TV joke: think of them as the offbeat comedy that got picked up after accumulating a fanbase while muscling through an erratic first season. For the second go-round, reinvention would be unwise or impossible, so the goal is to capitalize on the quirky chemistry of its leads and modify it to establish replicable consistency. Or, to make it ready for syndication; Tanlines are much more effective as a singles act than as the subject of an immersive binge listen. The duo are a study in compatibility rather than contrast, each favoring brassy, spotless tones, Emm’s vocals sounding as much a synthesized version of a real instrument as the actual synthesizers. While male vocalists in this realm typically rely on a bass register to convey sage wisdom, sex appeal, or a sinister aura, for Emm it’s a means of foregrounding Tanlines’ everydude appeal. It works in conjunction with the often maddening mundanity of Highlights lyrics: ""I fall to pieces when you’re away,"" he sings on the opener, the implication being that this meltdown will be short-lived and she’ll definitely be back, probably sometime after the holiday weekend. They’re modest songs for modest moments, occupying the space between the hookup and the breakup, of getting hired and getting fired, that manageable lovesickness, regret, and anxiety that underlie just about every URL and IRL interaction. But the essence of Tanlines lies in the contrast created by the simplicity of their songwriting and the luxury of the sound design. Imagine a child winning a contest where his Construx design is turned into an actual skyscraper; that's Highlights. There isn’t much distance from what could’ve started out as FruityLoops demos or factory presets—Cohen’s arrangements still don’t provide much texture or polyphony. But the post-production is crucial all the same, allowing Highlights to sound like a legitimate pop record rather than shareware. This time out, they recorded in a church with Grizzly Bear’s Chris Taylor rather than in Miami with Jimmy Douglass (Foreigner, Timbaland)—it’s the reverse of what you’d expect from a band trying to update their sound from 2012 to 2015. But Tanlines aren’t really about staying on trend anyways. Since they work with a limited number of tools, it’s often difficult to distinguish one Highlights song from the next, or even remember them 10 minutes after they've ended. However, when it’s a Tanlines song, you definitely know it’s them. It’s an impressive accomplishment for an act that once appeared destined to be a footnote from Brooklyn Indie Rock 2010, a couple of scene mainstays who got more out of tropical keyboard presets than any New Yorker since Swizz Beatz. That said, Highlights hightails down the same escape routes that have been overbooked since the turn of the decade: Balearic, Drive, Caribbean rhythms, New Romantic synth-pop. As with Mixed Emotions, there’s the opener that doesn't oversell its anthemic ambitions (""Pieces""), the New Wave cruiser (""Slipping Away""), the one with an acoustic guitar (""Invisible Ways""). The most notable update in their software results in a track that still could’ve fit on their proper 2012 debut: ""Two Thousand Miles"" is Tanlines’ EDM moment, though the strobing synths and triplet beats are strangely muffled, meant more for an apartment party with noise restrictions rather than the festival tents where the duo have become a frequent and effective crowd pleaser. Tanlines have proven more than capable of hosting a celebration, and they can attract a surprisingly massive flock of hands-in-the-air party people as well. That shouldn’t change, as Highlights is more consistent than its predecessor, which was propped up by a few tentpole singles. But Tanlines could also be the center of the affair, particularly when Emm fearlessly leaned into big pop hooks during ""All of Me"" and ""Real Life"". Those moments are sorely lacking on Highlights, which becomes defined by its deceiving sort of consistency: maintaining a baseline pleasantry that makes the title into the only unintentional punchline of the whole campaign.","The Brooklyn duo Tanlines recorded their second album in a church with Grizzly Bear’s Chris Taylor, and Highlights sounds like a legitimate pop record.

February 15 EP,Nao,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae72ea9e61561daa629b/1:1/w_160/fe5f15e3.jpg,2015-05-22 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20620-february-15-ep/,Little Tokyo,"On her debut EP, 2014’s So Good, London singer-songwriter Nao led with a juicy revelation: the record's first single doubled as our introduction to A. K. Paul, Jai’s equally elusive brother. A. K. was revealed to have had a hand in some of his bro’s best tracks, writing and playing on ""Jasmine"" as well as contributing the unforgettable vocals on the ""BTSTU (Edit)"" demo. Paul's contribution was an intriguing development, to be sure, but the news of his involvement threatened to overshadow the spectacular talent of Nao in her own right. The Hackney native seemed to emerge fully-formed, with an arresting, lean-muscled falsetto and a spiritual connection with turn-of-the-millennium R&B and soul, the kind of bond you only have with the music of your young teenage years. And while the EP’s introductory collaboration was charming in its Paul-isms—the brothers’ trademark diaphanous, multi-layered synth collage work—the following four tracks were even better, peaking with stunning closer ""Adore You"", a graceful midtempo glide that felt like an answer to Miguel’s instant classic ""Adorn"". There’s no word yet as to whether either Paul brother is involved with Nao’s second release, the five-track February 15 EP, but the stylistic overlap is still there. All excel at recontextualizing their '90s-leaning influences into something that feels fresh and not too on-the-nose; their old souls are self-evident without devolving into Instagram-filter-retro wedding playlist pastiche à la ""Uptown Funk"" or ""Blurred Lines"". There’s a significant distinction between Nao’s work and the Pauls’, though. In the brothers’ collaborations, the visible seams are a part of the appeal, emphasizing the individual parts of the busy, loose patchwork. On February 15, Nao plays with just as many disparate influences—purple-hued funk, smoky neo-soul, muted washes of dubstep and other UK bass permutations, the faint pulse of deep house—but integrates them so seamlessly that the stylistic breadth barely registers. The So Good EP kept a brisk, grown-and-sexy steppers’ pace, its midtempo strut gesturing back towards acts like Groove Theory, 702, and Zhané, or even Missy Elliott in slinky ""Pussycat"" mode. On February 15, Nao delves into the neo-soul movement of the same time period, her stride taking on a bit of a hiccupping pimp step as house influences give way to straight funk. ""Inhale Exhale"" and ""Zillionaire"" are pure Soulquarian homage, but Nao shakes the dust off with idiosyncratic, slightly abstracted percussion that seems to have a gently rebellious will of its own. When we think about the sounds and aesthetics of the late '90s and early '00s, the most immediate images are the Y2K retrofuturism of so much R&B, pop, and rap of that time—the wide-eyed and imaginative embrace of these idealistic, spacey digital aesthetics. Think of the cavernous, glossy, white and metallic digitally-rendered chambers that served as backdrops for Janet Jackson or Blaque videos. This utopian vision made sense in an era where people were still wrapping their minds around the baffling expanse of the Internet. On this EP, Nao deals in what feels like the converse of these aesthetics: Instead of constructing idealistic projections of the future, she seems to prefer a nostalgic, tender vision of the not-so-distant past, assembled with shiny new tools and contextualized by the world we live in now. But the main draw of the EP is Nao’s vocals, rich and subtle and instinctually aware of when to dial it down and when to let her upper register flex its full strength. She has an imaginative yet piercingly simple way with words; her lyrics are unembellished but specific, stirring in their directness like an unexpectedly moving still-life painting. Her calm micro-narratives are rendered in dazzling hi-def and zoomed in to minute details like a ""Planet Earth"" freeze-frame, often focusing on the self-evident lushness of nature: images of fruits and changing seasons and rich jewel tones. ""Your silver hair, your red and checked shirt, buttoned to your apple,"" she sings, soaking in her partner on closing track ""It’s You"", capturing the essence of a quiet moment in one calm, precise stroke.","On February 15, London singer-songwriter Nao plays with many disparate influences—purple-hued funk, smoky neo-soul, muted washes of dubstep and other UK bass permutations, the faint pulse of deep house—but integrates them so seamlessly that the stylistic breadth barely registers.

Holly Miranda,Holly Miranda,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae609d034d5c69bf4525/1:1/w_160/8d50f79e.jpg,2015-05-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20604-holly-miranda/,Dangerbird,"In the age of social media and perpetual feed refreshing, releasing new music has become akin to issuing a status update—something that should be done quickly and often, if only to remind everyone you’re still alive. Sure, savvy, big-name artists can use long delays between albums to their promotional advantage, parlaying pent-up anticipation into a major cultural event. But for the typical, blog-buzzed indie-level artist touring the same 200-cap rooms as all the other typical, blog-buzzed indie-level artists, even taking the once-standard 18-month break between releases can be a huge gamble at a time when trends and attention spans seemingly shift overnight. The story of Holly Miranda, however, betrays the benefits of just letting things happen in due time.  The Magician’s Private Library, the Kanye-approved 2010 album that first introduced the Michigan-born, bicoastal-based singer to the world at large, technically wasn’t her debut—she self-released an album in 2004, back when she was an acoustic-strumming open-mic aspirant, and went on to make two records as the singer-guitarist for one-time Brooklyn indie-pop hopes the Jealous Girlfriends. Magician’s, however, clearly marked a major turning point in Miranda’s trajectory, its fantastical fusion of southern '60s soul and hazy '80s dream-pop perfectly timed for a moment when acts like Cults and Girls were putting similarly modernist spins on classic pop-song conventions. And in producer Dave Sitek, Miranda had found the perfect conduit between left-field experimentation and MOR accessibility, his maximally minimalist aesthetic so prevalent on the record, you’d think the album was named after his studio. (Alas, it was not.) But whatever momentum Miranda had acquired with Magician’s would slowly peter out, along with the indie-zeitgeist moment that supported her ascent. In the five years that have passed since the album’s release, all those aforementioned bands have either broken up or drifted to the edges of the cultural conversation; Miranda's XL contract gave way to crowd-funding pitches; and even her most famous cheerleader’s blog has gone offline. Miranda didn't exactly disappear, a seeming impossibility when you’ve been romantically involved with everyone’s favorite ""L Word"" star and joined ScarJo’s supergroup. But her musical output slowed to a trickle, as a crippling bout of writer’s block sent her fleeing from her L.A. home in 2012 to a place that has come to signify rock'n'roll canonization and immortalization: Joshua Tree. Not one to ignore the spiritual significance of such sacred ground, Miranda used the opportunity to get born again. When she sings, ""I’ve been tripping so long"" on her new album’s opening, new-day-rising anthem ""Mark My Words"", she’s not referring to the usual mode of desert-based therapy so much as the protracted process of regaining her proper footing after an extended creative drought. Like its predecessor, Miranda’s first album in a half decade seeks to balance the earthy with the ethereal. But in contrast to the insular, hermetic environs of The Magician’s Private Library, this new one—produced by Miranda and Florent Barbier, with a one-song assist from Sitek—is all open road, both in its vastness of sound and fresh-start philosophies. (""I know this town could be the death of me,"" goes the chorus of ""Come On"", its Edge-inspired gallop pushing the L.A. skyline further into the rear view mirror.) It’s a self-titled release, traditional artist shorthand for ""this is the real me""—accordingly, throughout these 11 songs, Miranda projects a greater sense of confidence and candor, dispensing with the fantasy imagery of her previous record to cut straight to the heart of the matter by openly addressing matters of the heart. Miranda was raised in a strict evangelical household, before rejecting the religious dogma that effectively rejected queer kids like herself; she originally wrote the bittersweet, drum-machined lullaby ""Pelican Rapids"" for the It Gets Better campaign, as a retroactive note of assurance to her teenage closeted self. But when it comes to expressing her distrust of ecclesiastical institutions, Miranda doesn't feel the need to belabor the point; she'd rather appropriate religion's fundamental tenet—the belief in and yearning for something greater than yourself—for secular songs of devotion, and infuse them with the gravitas of modern-day hymns. (The omnipresent baritone-sax hum of Maria Eisen—this album’s star player—inches them toward Spiritualized’s brand of celestial soul.) And while the tumble-in-the-grass romp ""All I Want Is to Be Your Girl"" and the urgent synth-pop of ""Whatever You Want"" respectively document the idyllic beginnings and bitter end of a relationship between two women, Miranda is more liable to write transcendence-seeking songs—like wedding first-dance candidates ""Everlasting"" and ""The Only One""—that can be applied to all sexualities and identities, implicitly promoting the sort of inclusiveness that religious orthodoxy so often denies. The result is an album that feels both disarmingly intimate and broadly universal, and Miranda's voice—fragile and fearless in equal measure—mesmerizes even when the lyrics veer toward non-descript platitudes. But she is occasionally guilty of forcing her hand. The moonlit elegy ""Desert Call""—an elaborate reworking of a stripped-down 2013 single recorded with Sitek—boasts the album’s most dramatic, chandelier-rattling performance, but the extended closing chorus of ""hallelujah"" oversells the weightiness of a song that’s already done much to establish itself as this album’s epic centerpiece. (It also feels like an overly on-the-nose evocation of a song re-popularized by one of Miranda’s biggest influences.) A better measure of Miranda’s re-stoked bravado comes with ""Until Now"", slotted into the climactic penultimate-track position, but stripped down to just guitar and piano. Like the nocturnal serenades that fill up the back half of Big Star’s Third/Sister Lovers, it’s a song that gently guides an emotional roller coaster of an album towards its peaceful conclusion. ""I never opened my eyes till now,"" Miranda sings, before pledging herself to a long-time crush. ""You’ve got some kind of sweetness/ Tied up in that string I’ve been tugging on/ But I’m pulling now."" For a lapsed church-goer like her, it’s a moment of spiritual awakening that no preacher could inspire.","Holly Miranda's 2010 Kanye-approved and David Sitek-produced The Magician’s Private Library introduced the singer to the world at large.

True Colors,Zedd,by: Corban Goble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae7d5e6ef95969321c65/1:1/w_160/b9f71fa2.jpeg,2015-05-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20626-true-colors/,Interscope,"In 2013, Anton Zaslavski—who records as Zedd—went from ""Who the fuck is Zedd?"" to a household name thanks to two ubiquitous singles. First was ""Clarity"", the aural equivalent of standing under a fake waterfall at Tomorrowland, and the brain-invading Hayley Williams feature ""Stay the Night"". This was skyscraping stuff, and it’s a sound that the 25-year-old producer had made his name on behind the boards for artists like Lady Gaga (Zedd contributed three songs to Artpop) and Justin Bieber (Believe’s surging ""Beauty and a Beat""). In 2015, Zedd is not only one of the richest men in the biz, he’s a tabloid star. Given the higher profile, it was probably no surprise that the rumored Selena Gomez collaboration bore fruit in the form of ""I Want You to Know"", the first, Ryan Tedder-co-written single from Zedd’s new album True Colors. For better or for worse, ""I Want You to Know"" is a good entry point for True Colors, a collection of songs that features Zedd consistently failing to open up the playbook or alter the formula. Many songs—opener ""Addicted to a Memory"", ""Straight into the Fire""—feature familiar pop constructions. Not unlike his hits (including his Ariana Grande collaboration ""Break Free""), Zedd routinely uses soaring synth stabs with crystal clear vocals from female singers. While it’s worked in the past, it feels like the primary colors Zedd tends to paint with feel faded. Though Zedd keeps his foot on the pedal, it comes with the cost of diminishing returns. Even changes of pace like ""Beautiful Now""—male singer!—feel flat and corny (""Let’s live tonight/ Like fireflies!""). If you want vague, positive platitudes bouncing off every pocket of pixelated pomp, True Colors is a one-stop shop. Take ""Transmission"", a song that limply thumps around the chorus ""Cause you're never too young, you're never too young, never too young to die"" and features a verse from Maryland rapper Logic that makes Kalin and Myles sound like UGK. It’s tempting to paint Zedd as a singles artist, and True Colors reveals that the DJ doesn’t have much to say at an album’s length. True Colors does traverse familiar, populous formats that may be difficult to innovate on top of, but other posi-tinted, mass audience-focused projects have found success by mixing their own cocktails of EDM, soul, and of-the-minute rap production. Zedd’s True Colors, though, feels underformed and unoriginal. Basically, swipe left.","In 2013, Anton Zaslavski—who records as Zedd—went from obscurity to household name on the back of two ubiquitous singles.

Welcome Back to Milk,Du Blonde,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad93b1335d7bf1699c16/1:1/w_160/d7a02818.jpg,2015-05-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20442-welcome-back-to-milk/,Mute,"In the summer of 2012, after releasing her debut LP Yours Truly, Cellophane Nose, singer-songwriter Beth Jeans Houghton suffered a nervous breakdown, scrapped an entire album, and devised a new plan of attack. She plotted a drastic reinvention and arranged sessions with producers who would nod along with glazed expressions before layering on Auto-Tune and ornamental synths in the studio. Exasperated, Houghton turned to nefarious Bad Seed Jim Sclavunos, impressed by his yen for psych bands like Lemon Pipers and Ultimate Spinach, and developed her classic-rock chops. Then, just before hitting the studio, Houghton eviscerated the work, wrote two new tracks, and rebuilt, once more, from the ground up. The result of the triple-distillation process is Welcome Back to Milk, a radical musical and psychological inversion of its predecessor. Where Cellophane Nose sketched an alluring wonderland, the follow-up finds Houghton, now working as Du Blonde, fierce and firm, assertive enough to know when to keep us away, at a distance that suits her. In the sense that it strives less to be pretty than honest, the album is about growing out of preconceived social roles. Cellophane Nose was a resplendent work of odyssey and intricacy, a feature some critics couldn’t untangle from her femininity: In a short paragraph, the Guardian review describes its ""airy, fairytale quality,"" observes one song ""skipping delicately"" and compares another to ""fellow sprite Alison Goldfrapp."" Perhaps Houghton took it to heart. So Welcome Back to Milk skews primal. The debut’s ukulele, harp, glockenspiel, and Wurlitzer are all out, along with any ""nu folk"" threads; in their place are Stones R&B rhythms, doomed Sabbath licks, blistering Cali-punk, and a primitive kind of glam–the most flamboyant instrument Houghton employs is the voice of Future Islands' Samuel T. Herring, who makes a lovelorn, pantomime-villain cameo on ""Mind Is on My Mind"". But if a picture is forming of barren blasts and ruthless efficiency, that’s not quite it: ""Four in the Morning"" is a wrenching piano ballad, ""Isn’t It Wild"" waltzes dreamily to the stars, ""Hunter"" concedes tenderness for an ex-lover. Still, what’s important is that the record feels fierce, is designed to, and Houghton has pulled no punches in spreading the word. The record’s opening brace alone leaves you dazed throughout the first half: ""Black Flag"" acts out both sides of a lovers’ spat over stormy guitars, while ""Chips to Go"" thunders along on a devilish, Sparks-like riff as Houghton yells and trills theatrically. Third track ""Raw Honey"" simmers, but despite being resolutely unpunk (a frilly guitar solo consumes one-third of its runtime) the fingerpicked hook is so inescapably reminiscent of Californication-era Red Hot Chili Peppers it’s tempting to hear a pass-agg kiss off to Houghton’s ex-beau Anthony Kiedis. The men of Welcome Back to Milk fare about as well as you’d expect, which is not very. On Cellophane Nose’s ""Atlas"", Houghton sat with her boyfriend ""dissecting the atlas for places we’ve been/ Your list is longer, but you’ve got more years on me."" Here, that sort of homey affection would feel jarring: Domesticity has become a battleground where partners pick fights (""If You’re Legal""), polish their egos (""After the Show"") and mansplain your ""issues"" (""Hard to Please""). On ""Young Entertainment"", a shimmering noir-punk number, she demands, ""What is it like to fuck your mistress with her hands tied?"" Welcome Back to Milk scans as an overhaul of its protagonist’s romantic history, a poised reassessment of domestic situations that seemed okay at the time, but maybe weren’t the best, after all. Wherever her gaze turns, Houghton’s conviction is lethal. On ""Mr. Hyde"", she shreds a domineering narcissist to pieces; on ""Four in the Morning"", she shreds herself to pieces; on ""Black Flag"", she simply shreds. This all serves a winning mission statement: Radically reinterpret your past, and your present will look after itself.","British singer-songwriter Beth Jeans Houghton is back with a new name and a new sound. The ukulele, harp, and glockenspiel of her 2012 debut have been replaced with Stones R&B rhythms, doomed Sabbath licks, and blistering Cali-punk.

Mutilator Defeated at Last,Thee Oh Sees,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad92ea9e61561daa612c/1:1/w_160/25296a4b.jpeg,2015-05-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20441-mutilator-defeated-at-last/,Castle Face,"At times, Thee Oh Sees may have sounded scrappy and scuzzy on record, but by the time the San Francisco-based garage rock quartet released 2013's Floating Coffin—their seventh album, give or take—they had become one of the finest live acts around. On stage, they were just straight up better than their peers—faster, tighter, and weirder than the competition.  And then they were gone. Sort of. Later in 2013, singer/guitarist John Dwyer announced that the band would go on hiatus and would cease to perform live for the foreseeable future. Not long after that, though, he announced that a new Oh Sees album, Drop, would see release early the following year. It was all a little confusing, and when the band finally did rematerialize for some tour dates, drummer Mike Shoun, guitarist Petey Dammit, and singer/keyboardist Brigid Dawson were gone from the picture. Instead, Dwyer—who'd relocated to Los Angeles—was backed by bassist Timothy Hellman and drummer Nick Murray. Arguably, Thee Oh Sees have always had a fluid membership, especially when it came to the band’s LPs, which Dwyer sometimes assembled entirely on his own (see 2011’s Castlemania). But when the guitarist stepped out from his bandmates, he tended to explore more tuneful territory, reserving the band’s heavier rock'n'roll output for the whole crew. Mutilator Defeated at Last is Thee Oh Sees' first post-hiatus LP to be recorded using the band’s re-staffed touring lineup. It sounds different from the old version of the band, but not that different. In the past, Oh Sees records were made more or less live, the band bashing out the songs in single takes with no or minimal overdubs. Since reformatting the group, Dwyer has become a bit more interested in the studio. As with Drop, this extra polish and attention benefits Mutilator. There are tasteful psychedelic embellishments—synth wooshes, delay trails—and new instrumentation, like electric organ and acoustic guitar. The fuzz and grime have been peeled back a little, leaving room for more density and detail. By the time Floating Coffin came out, the old version of Thee Oh Sees were at the peak of their ability on stage, but the records were starting to become slightly predictable. Each would contain a handful of fast rock songs, a few slow zone-outs, and one or two detours that broke character. In a way, swapping out his personnel has allowed Dwyer to change the band without altering that formula at all. Mutilator is distinctive in Thee Oh Sees' catalog because different musicians perform it—the drums are slightly swingier, there’s bass guitar rather than a Telecaster covering the low end. Everything else is pretty much the same as usual, down to the lyrics about death and decaying flesh. Thee Oh Sees have one type of song that is consistently great. It’s the fast and heavy track that combines the creepy and ugly sensibility of the Cramps with krautrock's streamlined sense of repetition—""The Dream"" or ""No Spell"", for instance. On any given Oh Sees record, these are the songs that count the most. And Mutilator delivers plenty of these songs. ""Withered Hand"", ""Lupine Ossuary"", and ""Rogue Planet"" each strikes that perfect balance of druggy alienation and soothing forward motion, of sublime rhythmic focus and freaked-out guitar violence.","Mutilator Defeated at Last is Thee Oh Sees' first LP to be recorded with the band’s post-hiatus touring lineup, and it sounds a bit different from the old version of the group. The fuzz and grime have been peeled back a little, leaving room for more density and detail.

Platform,Holly Herndon,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ada89d034d5c69bf43ea/1:1/w_160/cc73984a.jpg,2015-05-21 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20457-holly-herndon-platform/,4ADRvng Intl.,"Holly Herndon’s songs play new tricks on you with each listen. The Bay Area composer and singer’s work percolates in the mind first, unlike the elemental club music that informs its sprightly tempos and ebbing bass. But though Herndon’s music is at its core ""cerebral""—all surface details and richly layered textures—it still exhibits warmth and emotion. Herndon’s ambitious vision was already clear on her first album, Movement, but her range broadened and deepened across a slow but steady stream of intoxicatingly dense singles; Platform is the most complete representation of her music yet. Herndon constructs synth patches from the sound of her voice, whether she’s murmuring, singing tunefully, or on the verge of shrieking. But she also processes and sequences acoustic sounds derived from movement and disorder (what could be shattering glass, a bucket being poured out, the tapping of a keyboard, the swish of a dancer’s legs), molding samples until they no longer reference the action that produced them. Even with the processing, her tracks retain an organic quality, something fleshy that suggests a given sound once existed in space. Into these complicated soundworlds—all of which are rooted in human action—Herndon mixes noises that emanate from the structure of her computer (hums, fan whirs, ""thinking"" noises), as well as its internal audio (she records the sound of her Internet activity and uses it as a source material or a point of inspiration). For her, a laptop is a natural extension of her mind and body rather than a place of escape and self-negation. Platform is animated by a constant conversation between these two elements: the embodied vocalist (usually Herndon) and the digital ghosts in the machine. In interviews, music videos, or on her blog, Herndon spells out her themes and methods. She seems to consider her art as, by design, didactic: In its form and process, it emulates a utopian societal model, one for the next phase of the technological age. Her music offers a vision of a time in which our digital accoutrements might become places for self-expression and improvement, and our relationship with them is less fraught. Herndon doesn’t believe that her work exists in a vacuum; it signifies in all directions, and is tied to and defined by everything around it. By explaining her music, she seeks to set up a more direct relationship with her audience. Clarifying the experiment is, to some extent, part of the whole project. There’s always the danger that channeling our listening according to an artist’s directives means we’ll miss out on engaging with the music in more personally significant ways. But though Herndon unifies her pieces with clear conceptual frameworks, the moment-to-moment experience stokes our subjective impressions. The best of Herndon’s compositions function something like the age-old visual illusion of the young woman with the big hat, who could just as easily be, on second look, a babushka-wearing grandmother. You might focus on the cold digital debris or the human voice crying out one minute and a melody or a meaningful lyric the next. At transcendent moments—busier, murkier work like ""Interference"" or ""Home""—Herndon offers an unclassifiable combination of the two. The previously released single ""Chorus"" provides the album's sonic template. It builds and settles expertly, as if catered toward the energy of a dancefloor in real time, and packs an earwormy wordless chorus. But it breaks through the wall of techno-informed percussion and synth pulsations only sporadically, like a lament filtered through a bad cell connection, or a Fever Ray melody submitted to John Cage-like randomized subtractive processes. Transitional notes fall out like baby teeth and at points the whole thing breaks down into digital chaos—here, Herndon’s Internet chatter is like a primordial ooze the song emerges out of and back into. Those who loved the pop acuity of ""Chorus"" won’t find much else on Platform as persuasive in that vein. In fact, the record’s only weak moments come when Herndon adopts pop song structures instead of self-generated ones. ""Morning Sun"", in particular, is based around low, unembellished melody which doesn’t develop anywhere in particular, accompanied by tittering, Dan Deacon-like arpeggios of vocal phonemes. To liven things up, Herndon lays on threatening sheets of noise atop the mix, but they seem unrelated to the action going on underneath. The most effective tracks offer something more open and spacious. ""Unequal"" highlights Herndon’s distinctive sense of harmony, which often has a haunting, irresolute quality recalling Baroque church music or plainchant. ""DAO"" also highlights her operatic vocalizations, but this time, they play a vicious game of cat-and-mouse with unstable, rough-hewn percussion patches built from everyday sounds (the approach strongly recalls Matthew Herbert’s work sampling household sounds to create elaborate virtual instruments, or Matmos’ surgery-noise drum circles). Platform’s most unusual track sets aside Herndon's usual generative techniques. ""Lonely at the Top"" is designed to induce ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response), a scientifically unexplained process in which exposure to certain sounds induce a tingling sensation on the necks and scalps of the susceptible. Herndon and her collaborator, ASMR sound artist Claire Tolan, adopt the general M.O. of the vibrant and extensive ASMR YouTube community, which is home to endless webcam videos featuring gentle, stylized whispering and tapping sounds. Behind Tolan’s comforting voice, Herndon contributes small, intimate sounds: extremely closely miked and subtly processed, they give the track—an ode to one online enclave that has succeeded in accessing the corporeal in a virtual environment—an otherworldly quality. It's hard to craft avant-garde music that feels truly new; inevitably, new languages correct and build off of the old ones, and create accidental resonances with others. Holly Herndon, by her own account, still believes in a music of ""now."" She eschews the free-associative, playful juxtapositions of fully synthetic sounds preferred by computer-music peers like PC Music's A. G. Cook, Oneohtrix Point Never, and James Ferraro, and insists on building her sound palette from the ground up, or more accurately, outwards from herself. Despite the wide scope of her project, Herndon’s ambitious efforts are appealingly multifaceted and personal, and Platform may turn out to be the most thought-provoking experimental electronic music release of the year. It doesn’t present a solid, replicable blueprint for the future of laptop composition and performance practice, but comes over more like beta of an app, with a lot of room for further development and expansion.","Holly Herndon is an ambitious composer whose work is based on samples and her distinctive voice. Her vision was already clear on her first album, Movement, but her range broadened and deepened across a slow but steady stream of intoxicatingly dense singles; Platform is the most complete representation of her music yet.

Last Year's Savage,Shilpa Ray,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae35ea9e61561daa6239/1:1/w_160/f5b270e7.jpg,2015-05-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20562-last-years-savage/,Northern Spy,"To debut her new album, the New Jersey-born/Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter Shilpa Ray created a parody news site called Savage Times, which streamed her new songs while presenting world events through the lens of a maniacal rockstar. In one story she shows up at Google, ""wearing a green dress and ill fitting heels,"" and throws ""a flaming boulder straight into our servers."" In another article she starts a Twitter war with Ziggy Stardust. In every photo Ray wears an ape mask that has become her avatar on Last Year’s Savage—the equivalent of Bowie’s alien costume from the 1970s or Bono’s MacPhisto get-up from the '90s. The disguise itself is visually striking, albeit obscure; Savage Times, on the other hand, is a pitch-perfect mix of Dadaist punchlines, pointed cultural satire, meta humor, and good old-fashioned punsmithery. Ray brings that same sophisticated, intensely derisive sense of humor to the songs on Last Year’s Savage. ""Johnny Thunder Fantasy Space Camp"" skewers the constant romanticizing of doomed rock stars—male rock stars, although that goes without saying. Over a '50s pop piano line and an insistent snare drum snap, she tells a would-be martyr to go ahead and fall on his sword: ""So you think you’ll die a prince in Joshua Tree…/ I won’t stop you, I’ll be rooting for you 'til my cats get the best of me."" Ray knows we have too many rock'n'roll casualties already; she’d rather play the crazy cat lady as punk icon. ""Nocturnal Emissions"" likewise upends male fantasies with similar insight and agitation, as she recounts her own dreams of gender-blurred virility over a tense rhythm section and rumbling guitar riffs: ""My dick’s bigger, my breasts are thicker, whatever power means."" Ray buys into the same overinflated rock myths she’s puncturing, perhaps because each one represents a way to transcend the limitations of the body and live a bit longer, a bit better. As she cautions on ""Nocturnal Emissions"", ""Don’t ever wake me up, bitch!"" A veteran of the Brooklyn scene who has recorded under various names (Beat the Devil, Shilpa Ray and Her Happy Hookers, just Shilpa Ray) and toured with Nick Cave, Ray delivers these songs in a voice that shapeshifts constantly, hitting every point along the spectrum between howl and coo, between boozy irony and acid rebuke. She does mordant accusations best of all, but there’s always enough gravity in her tone to suggest dark implications to ""O My Northern Soul"" and even ""On Broadway"". Most of Her Happy Hookers are back sans billing, emphasizing odd textures rather than melodies or riffs. Andrew Hoepfner sounds like he has an unlimited supply of Santo & Johnny licks, but they’re tucked into the corners of these songs. You wouldn’t miss them if they weren’t there. Ultimately, the defining instrument on Savage, aside from Ray’s commanding voice, is her signature harmonium, which adds a sardonic drone to the songs. Especially on the album’s second side, Ray’s lyrics are conceptually top heavy, a bit too impressed with their own cleverness. She sings ""Sanitary iPad"" from the point of view of a high-tech gadget that’s obsolete before it even hits stores. ""I’ve got a short shelf life, who’s gonna throw me out?"" she sings, merely alluding to a larger point about the disposability of modern culture. She can’t quite make the inhuman sound human—or vice versa, for that matter. Still, at a time when rock'n'roll’s influence is waning, Ray’s defiant humor is a welcome and bracing change of pace. Savage plays like a middle finger flown in the face of long-cherished conventions, or perhaps that monkey-avatar flinging its own poop at not-so-innocent bystanders.","The New Jersey-born/Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter Shilpa Ray brings her sophisticated, sardonic sense of humor to Last Year’s Savage.

The L-Shaped Man,Ceremony,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae3bc0084474cd0c1876/1:1/w_160/f72b7942.jpg,2015-05-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20569-the-l-shaped-man/,Matador,"Hardcore is a genre that revels in certain clichés—the ultimate of which is making a record that renounces your ties to hardcore. Despite its commonality, it’s still a risky maneuver: perhaps playing in such a stylistic straitjacket has made a band incapable of doing anything else. Even if it’s an artistically successful record, it can alienate old fans without attracting new ones. Most relevant to Ceremony, it’s a card you only get to play once. Six years after they could be accurately described as ""powerviolence,"" the Bay Area group released their John Goodmanson-produced Matador debut *Zoo—*a slog through boggy, primordial punk, interesting for the sole fact that it was made by a former powerviolence band. Ceremony undergoes another drastic change on The L-Shaped Man, but it cannot be leniently judged relative to Violence Violence. They’re now just one of the thousands of indie rock bands that really want to sound like Joy Division, and sounding no more engaged with their source material than the average dude plucking an Unknown Pleasures graphic T off the rack at Hot Topic. Mind you, Ceremony are on their fifth record and are named after a Joy Division song. But at the very least, the veritable return to their roots makes sense within the context of The L-Shaped Man. Ceremony are also one of the thousands of indie rock bands making a conceptual breakup record; and in these situations, such a breakup is assumed to be so catastrophic that it totally dismantles one’s self-construct and leaves nothing but foundation. Joy Division lyrics, advice from your father, bumper stickers that read ""all things pass""—everything you’ve been led to think is trite once you’re out of your teens might actually reveal themselves to be the truth. There’s no way to judge the authenticity of Ross Farrar’s emotions on The L-Shaped Man. But how can he can be exempt on an album where everything feels like facade? In particular, the facade inherent in Ceremony’s own name, as they grab at the most obvious signifiers of their idols and pass them off as their own. For one thing, Farrar’s vocals are now unrecognizable, or only recognizable as Ian Curtis karaoke. To be fair, Curtis is a natural touchstone for a punk rock carny barker, as his enduring qualities—the militaristic cadences, the claustrophobic melodies—can be approximated without much technical ability. But you can’t fake his command or intensity or sonorousness, though Farrar tries. Or maybe he doesn’t try hard enough. The lyrics are delivered with honesty and presumed urgency. They are also proof that those qualities can be less important than thinking before you talk. The dishwater-gray ambience of ""Exit Fears"" implies sleepless nights filled with lingering regret, while Farrar moans, ""The pain will leave in the night/ Memories return in the light""—which seems to express the exact opposite of what he means. ""The root of the world is in the red heart,"" ""you saw yourself walking with no one else and it scared you""—they all aspire to be aphorisms and fade upon impact like a tweet never to be favorited. The album title itself is indicative of Farrar making observations without any insight—men are generally L-shaped, but...so? The lack of resonance is even more obvious in Farrar’s newfound tone, a monster mash of alternating cartoonish bellow and honk which doesn’t sound like Curtis or Paul Banks so much as the dude from Editors drunkenly imitating Paul Banks trying to sing like Ian Curtis. Of all Farrar’s means of cheating towards cogency—repetition of lyrics that just can’t bear the attempts at establishing portent, lending numerous song titles a definitive article to import significance—the most absurd is his Jay McInerney-like tendency to speak almost entirely in the second person. Call it Turn on the Bright Lights, Big City. As a working unit, Ceremony still play with customary, clumsy enthusiasm. The terse drumrolls, plangent guitar fills, and basslines that are all thumbs—it’s all here and played with the expected looseness of a former hardcore band that moved onto garage rock and is now learning post-punk on the fly. It occasionally coalesces into a surf-goth hybrid that at least justifies John Reis being roped into this. Who knows what Ceremony expected of the former Hot Snakes/Rocket From the Crypt frontman, but his production might be more overmatched than mismatched: the confused melodies Farrar strews over the piano plunking of ""Hibernation"" and the wayward guitar leads in ""Root of the World"" can generously be heard as an experiment in avant-garde atonality. Ceremony would’ve been better off phoning a different guy from Drive Like Jehu—put Mark Trombino behind the drums or the boards and he could provide a high-velocity, low-viscosity sleekness that would make relatively hooky outliers like ""The Separation"" and ""Bleeder"" go incognito on satellite radio as enjoyably derivative post-pop-punk. The L-Shaped Man does have an advantage over Zoo, in that it’s interesting in the way any true debacle is, where a band’s conviction is either impervious to any kind of outside intervention or just not subject to it. Just look at the album cover: almost immediately after Ceremony revealed The L-Shaped Man, fans noticed its too-hilarious-to-be-intentional similarity to a gag from the ""A Millhouse Divided"" episode of ""The Simpsons."" This is better known as the ""Can I Borrow a Feeling"" episode, an unfortunate coincidence seeing as how we’re talking about a record whose entire aesthetic is on loan. It’s even more serendipitous in light of the exact scene with the offending Pictionary attempt—there we have Kirk Van Houten, on the verge of a calamitous divorce, yelling at a dinner party crowd who reacts to his inept visual rendering of ""dignity"" with embarrassed silence. Maybe it's good for a laugh, but only as a defense mechanism against the cringe-inducing experience of watching artistic expression abandon a heartbroken man at his lowest moment.","Hardcore is a genre that revels in certain clichés—the ultimate of which is making a record that renounces your ties to hardcore. The former powerviolence group Ceremony's new album, their second for Matador, finds them wanting to sound like Joy Division, and it’s interesting in the way that any true debacle is interesting.

The Desired Effect,Brandon Flowers,by: Jeremy D. Larson,Reviews Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae689d034d5c69bf453a/1:1/w_160/d125cf21.jpg,2015-05-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20609-the-desired-effect/,Island,"Brandon Flowers is hard to pin down as a pop star, in part because he's still playing at being a pop star. After he stepped into the limelight on the Killers’ still-terrific debut at 22-years-old, he made three more records with his band full of bona fide arena anthems as well as cheap knock-offs that substitute as arena anthems. The latter is why it's advisable to skip over most of his 2010 solo debut Flamingos, if only because the beige, desert-tinged production says and adds very little to his songwriting. The album is clunky and rote even by the Flowers metric. But with the help of Grammy-winning producer Ariel Rechtshaid, The Desired Effect gives Flowers new backdrops to play around in. Rechtshaid doesn’t mine the '80s and '90s for inspiration like he's done for Haim, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and many others recently. Instead, he straight up jacks that sound, aiming directly at those fond of the calmer side of Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, or Peter Gabriel. Electric guitars are swapped out for chugging piano lines, hand-clap snares, and melismas sung by anonymous background singers; never mind the inclusion of special guest Bruce Hornsby, a song that samples Bronski Beat's ""Smalltown Boy"" and features Neil Tennant on vocals, and floppy disc after floppy disc worth of synth patches. Credit to Rechtshaid, the album’s big and luxe sound fits Flowers' big and luxe voice. When they sync up in this milieu, against all odds, it works really well. Above these glossy textures, Flowers doubles down on his earnest goobery, which actually brings him closer to this ideal pop star image he's been chasing. Not since Sam’s Town has Flowers sounded so at home in song. ""Can’t Deny My Love"" is a masterclass in '80s production tricks (wooden pan flutes! pitch-wavering synth pads! orchestra hits!) with one of those famous, powerful hooks that made him so likable to begin with. It’s cheesy, but the cluster-bomb of ideas is ultimately what makes you want to go back for repeat listens. Likewise, on the mid-tempo ballad ""Never Get You Right"" Flowers finds the perfect equation for his sincerity and hyperbole. Again, it’s the hook and his voice that do most of the heavy lifting, but the song works because of a simple idea. You look at someone you know and love (who in Flowers' case is possibly a sex worker) and think how ""They’ll turn you into something whether you are it or not/ But they’ll never get you right."" There are more huge Killers-ready songs to fill stadiums or casinos (""Dreams Come True"" and ""Untangled Love"") and hoary love songs (""Still Want You""), but Flowers can’t help but trip over himself as he’s writing. He’s just so daffy. He sings ""Friday nights, football stands"" and you just pray the sports imagery stops there, but sure enough, he follows it up with ""been fumbled by so many hands."" It’s always just one move too many. Sometimes he reaches for the cliché like ""ship of fools"" or ""casting...stones"" and sometimes he does some gangly inversion of one, like, ""She wasn't having anything, no birds or any bees/ Girl, don't go shootin' all the dogs down just cause one's got fleas."" At best, Flowers is too wordy and obvious. At worst, he is BruceSpringsteen_ebooks, cobbling together blue-collar American signifiers in odd arrays that appear to have meaning but are really just empty gestures. ""Whether the people want to accept it or not, we might be the best band in the last long time!” said Flowers regarding the Killers in a recent interview. This quote is great because it says everything you need to know about Flowers as a songwriter: He believes deeply in himself by way of absurd and often extra-grammatical reasons. At his essence, Flowers is a big beating heart that under too much scrutiny will shrivel and die. He is bound for excess and Desired Effect delivers on precisely that, at precisely the level you’d imagine a happily married, 33-year-old with millions of dollars in the bank would. Don’t think too much about the heavy-handed religiosity on ""The Way It’s Always Been"" or the the heartland rock aberration ""Diggin' Up the Heart"". Just let his words wash over you, subtly, like being tackled by 20 puppies. Flowers gives off charm and stupidity in the same breath and it is as comforting as it is disposable. It’s the mark of a pretty good pop star.","On The Desired Effect, Killers' frontman Brandon Flowers goes deep into the pomp of the '80s with the help of producer Ariel Rechtshaid.

Tundra,Lakker,by: Abigail Garnett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae3c5e6ef95969321c0c/1:1/w_160/0988e0f7.jpg,2015-05-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20570-lakker-tundra/,R&S,"A curious thing about the human voice is that it’s a shortcut to the eerie fascination that drives techno music and science fiction alike. Lakker’s Tundra, the Dublin duo's second album in a decade, delves into the uncanny valley of treated vocals, ground up and looped in with all kinds of noise. Lakker weave voices in the style of sacred music into contexts where they wouldn't normally be heard. The resulting effect is spit-shined patches of perfect sonority that make the noise sound brighter, like there’s something alive inside it. Lakker is the project of Ian McDonnell and Dara Smith, two producers who started out as overheated noise-blast collagists on their first album, 2007's Ruido, and then spent a few years producing straight-ahead techno 12”s for labels like Blueprint and their current home, R&S. Tundra falls somewhere outside of both of those approaches. It has the same restless spirit as Ruido—but while that LP was a frantic pastiche of frenetically stitched-together ideas, Tundra’s oddball details are all in the service of larger structures, like glyphs carved into the surface of stone blocks. Its range is too expansive and colorful to fit under the umbrella of club music. Like fellow noise artists Fuck Buttons, whose dizzying fractal scaling on Slow Focus echoes through Tundra’s biggest and boldest tracks, Smith and McDonnell have a loose compositional template here; they tease ideas into play with one another, elaborating but never quite releasing the tension between them. ""Mountain Divide"", the dizzying third track (and first introduction of hostile noise) buries a muffled choral fragment in chaotic whining and sawing—an ""O Fortuna"" for sparking machinery—and stays naggingly dissonant. There’s a narrative quality in the sequencing that brings to mind massive planes swept clear by a destructive force, but Tundra is also touchingly reverent towards humanity. ""Mountain Divide"" is the beginning of a powerful three song segment that includes the luminous ""Three Songs"", and ""Ton’neru"", a wispy ambient piece reminiscent of Julianna Barwick. One of Lakker’s claimed influences is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, an explorer of sacred music and Gregorian chant whose dramatically charged compositions have proved enduringly popular in film and television. Smith and McDonnell share a similar flair for concentrating emotion into refined detail. Only one track here sounds like an exercise rather than a finished composition: ""Halite"", a steady stalactite drip of a melody that never coalesces into something more interesting, despite its near seven minutes, and slows the momentum of the album’s back half down to a sluggish chug. Given the proliferation of disaffected-sounding techno on the Internet these days, it’s easy to imagine this as a tune-out moment for listener, though nothing that follows sounds remotely like it. In fact, the closing four tracks on the album are its purest examples of industrial-strength noise—the title track, which starts out with a good-natured, ear-wormy beat that’s vaguely familiar, slides into a positively romantic-sounding mix of delicately ticking percussion and sonorous humming, only to double back into an apocalyptic, buzzing cloud of noise. Then there’s the final ""Herald"", a burbling, melodic composition that makes for a disarmingly sensitive come-down from the album’s often ominous landscape. That alone indicates that Tundra is a bid for the kind of album-based respectability that’s so difficult for techno crossover artists to achieve, and its accessibility may give momentum to R&S’s own mission to revive their catalog with forward-thinking techno acts that can replicate their late '90s golden age of left-of-center psychedelic dance LPs. As with any piece of music that ebbs and flows this forcefully, you should listen to it loudly, and try to get swept away by it.","Tundra, Lakker's second album in a decade, delves into treated vocals, ground up and looped in with all kinds of noise.

Why Make Sense?,Hot Chip,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ade513d1975652139fea/1:1/w_160/283a416f.png,2015-05-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20506-why-make-sense/,Domino,"""Let's fuck shit up,"" suggests Alexis Taylor on a bonus track from Hot Chip’s sixth album. ""Let's go for a rollercoaster ride—even a shit rollercoaster ride."" The lines are pure punk while everything around them is anything but: Taylor sounds like the universe's loneliest astronaut as synth pulses blink in blackness behind him. The song is called ""Burning Up"" and it's vintage Hot Chip: funny where it might be wistful; wistful where it might be funny. It also serves as a mini-history of the London quintet, who first formed 15 years ago. As the song moves along, youthful abandon gives way to consequence, weight, blame. Co-leader Joe Goddard arrives to split the difference in the final verse. ""My age says I'm an adult but some days my heart will not be told,"" he hums as the track evaporates behind him. ""Hearing teenage symphonies dancing through my head."" With Why Make Sense?, Hot Chip continue to capture pure joy while acknowledging the limits of such a quest. It's an adult album made by a group of guys in their mid-thirties who know all of the trappings of an ""adult album."" These ahead-of-their-time pop omnivores—remember the bewilderment that surrounded the bedroom Prince and Stevie-isms of their debut album in 2004?—are now, remarkably, something of an institution, their eclecticism the new normal. They used to be LCD Soundsystem’s brainy British counterparts (the two bands even shared a member in guitarist Al Doyle), but now LCD are gone, and James Murphy is opening wine bars, and Hot Chip are still here, still looking for spontaneity, still hopelessly bittersweet, still trying to get better, still romantic, still funkier than a bunch of pasty dudes from Putney have any right to be, still making it cool to dance even if you can’t dance for shit. This is the smoothest Hot Chip album, and they’ve never sounded more professional. It's a mixed blessing: For a band healthily obsessed with not making sense, the refined sound can seem a bit commonplace after more than a decade of spikes, jump-cuts, and curveballs. Then again, Hot Chip have always been traditionalists at heart, making pop songs that utilize the vocabularies of house, R&B, and hip-hop rather than the other way around. They've stacked up plenty of bridges worthy of the Brill Building, a phenomenon that continues on the lovingly nostalgic ""Need You Now"", which is about as close as they've come to matching the melancholy perfection of ""Boy from School"". The wafting ""White Wine and Fried Chicken"" takes the band's high/low culture expertise into the realm of gastronomy, and feels like a soul standard for our century. The three-minute song sounds about as straightforward as anything Hot Chip have made, though there are big knots in Taylor's words; whereas much of the band's last two albums dealt with the wonders of stability and contentment, Why Make Sense? seems more conflicted. Existential crises abound, creating discord with the album's glossy finish. Taylor and Goddard ask themselves questions that many almost-middle-aged musicians—especially in the pop and dance worlds—are too scared to broach. They try to find some clarity within the ambiguities of committed relationships (romantic or musical), exposing vulnerabilities in the name of emotional honesty. ""Out of happiness can come a bitterness,"" admits Taylor—the son of a Shakespeare scholar and psychoanalyst—on the booming title track, before mixing in confrontational politics that spin around ideas of personal freedom: ""Why be tough when strength is just for losers/ Be what you are ­at the mercy of your rulers."" Meanwhile, the mildly anti-machine-music ""Huarache Lights"" has Taylor trying to find a heartbeat between ones and zeroes, but he’s too savvy (or neurotic) to construct any bold lines. ""Am I so truthful, or in truth, is the youth just getting old?"" he sings, putting his own perspective into question. On a self-critical bonus track, Goddard suggests, ""I need to separate the head from the body,"" but he knows that can be hard to do—a fact that this album, with its bulbous grooves and anxious themes, makes clear again and again. Why Make Sense? is probably the fourth-best Hot Chip album. But that’s not necessarily a knock, because their fourth-best album is still a very good album. At this point, they seem too smart and talented to really fail. They will always be underdogs that you root for to make songs that highlight the complexity of human experience while also helping you to put those complexities in the back of your mind for a minute. They are confident in their abilities, even when those abilities are aimed at throwing their own confidence into doubt. They are beloved. They are trustworthy. Their senselessness now makes a lot of sense to a lot of people.","With Why Make Sense?, Hot Chip continue to capture pure joy while acknowledging the limits of such a quest.

I Was Crossing a Bridge,Vito Ricci,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae245e6ef95969321be1/1:1/w_160/1cf434e7.jpg,2015-05-19 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20548-i-was-crossing-a-bridge/,Music From Memory,"Vito Ricci has composed some 80-odd pieces over the last 36 years: among them are string partitas written for Kronos Quartet; harmolodic studies inspired by his former teacher Ornette Coleman; a work sampling the sound of Japanese cicadas; and a microtonal composition for bassoon, two Theremins, and something called wrench guitar. You can get a sense of the circles Ricci has inhabited from a 1982 compilation on which he features alongside John Lurie, Peter Blegvad, Arto Lindsay, Christian Marclay, Martin Bisi, and Spalding Gray, among other Downtown N.Y. fixtures. If you don't pay close attention to New York's independent theater and new-music scenes, you may never have heard of Ricci, but he is a cult figure to some. An Amsterdam label that specializes in reissues of overlooked electronic musicians, like the Italian ambient outsider Gigi Masin and the Balearic oddball Joan Bibiloni, named itself after Ricci's 1985 album Music From Memory. (The LP's fans are a dedicated bunch: a batch of deadstock copies recently sold out at $85 a pop.) Now, Music From Memory is paying back the debt with a collection of Ricci's work. Most of it is drawn from the 1980s, rescued from tapes made for theater works by playwrights like Matthew Maguire, Jeffrey M. Jones, and Susan Mosakowski. There are plangent synthesizers and gently pealing guitars; there are chiming echoes of classical minimalism and even synthetic strings descended from the vernacular heritage of Charles Ives. ""Hollywood"" sounds every bit like the incidental music its title would suggest, with its limpid synth pads and ersatz jazz keyboards; the slap-bass-infused ""Dub It"" doesn't have much to do with reggae, though it's certainly indicative of how what we might call ""rainforest noir"" ruled cinematic imaginations in the '80s. As electronic music goes, it's a hard-to-place sound, lacking in the usual stylistic signifiers and now-canonical instruments. (The album notes detail a gear list of mostly forgotten devices like the Octave Plateau Voyetra 8 synthesizer, E-mu Proteus sound module, and Yamaha RX11 drum machine.) The music here sometimes brings to mind Craig Leon's Nommos and the early '80s recordings of the Seattle ambient musician K. Leimer. It shares, at least in part, their technology—long-since outmoded synthesizers, unvarnished drum machines, springy delay that wreathes the music with a hint of fizz—and their aesthetics, a mixture of proto-ambient, late-night television soundtracks, and homebrewed avant-gardism. Both of those artists released electronic music that sounded completely otherworldly in the '80s, and both, like Ricci, have recently been rediscovered, via reissues like this one. In that sense, the compilation says as much about what listeners find value in now as it does the lasting value of the music itself. Today, sounds that even five years ago might have seemed unfashionable suddenly sound fresh. That's not to take away from Ricci's accomplishments: much of I Was Crossing a Bridge is wonderful stuff, even the incidental bits. One of the highlights is ""Commie Stories (Part 9)"", one of a pair of sketches written for Susan Mosakowski's play of the same name. Less than two minutes long, it consists of a single arpeggio played—by hand, from the sound of it—through a delay unit, evoking a burbling water fountain; it's easy to imagine it as the foundation for a transporting techno jam on a label like L.I.E.S. or The Trilogy Tapes. And if ""Inferno (Part 1)"", an eight-and-a-half-minute fugue for shuddering percussion and chirping analog delay, were released on either of those labels today, passed off as a new production from a bedroom studio in Los Angeles or Berlin, nobody would bat an eye. That the opening track, ""The Ship Was Sailing"", sounds like a companion piece to Maxmillion Dunbar's ""Woo"", from the Future Times co-founder's 2013 album House of Woo, speaks to the uncanny timeliness of Ricci's work. It's as though gardens planted in vacant lots in the '80s, long left untended, were finally being harvested, and their heirloom seeds put back into circulation. Two songs on the anthology date from the past few years, and they are, perhaps appropriately, among the album's most musically and conceptually developed selections. ""Deep Felt Music"", nearly 13 minutes long, evokes both Durutti Column and Tony Conrad in its flickering hints of plucked guitar and its shimmering drones, while ""Dox E Koo"", for solo voice and delay, stakes out a position somewhere between Meredith Monk and the haunting tones of Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares. The very finest piece is ""Riverflow (Electronic)"". Plucked acoustic guitar cuts against coolly bowed lines and dissolves into a galaxy of delay and faint percussion; dissonant and arrhythmic, it could almost be mistaken for a Gastr Del Sol outtake. No date is given in the album notes, so I don't know when it was recorded. There's a different version on YouTube, dated 1970, but the album version, sparklier and in much higher fidelity, is almost certainly a more recent recording. But perhaps it doesn't really matter when it was made. The best material on this compilation sounds like it stands outside of time entirely. Unlike linear time, this river flows both ways.","This new collection of the electronic composer and Downtown NYC cult figure Vito Ricci's work is mostly drawn from the 1980s, rescued from tapes made for theater works by playwrights like Matthew Maguire, Jeffrey M.

River,Daniel Bachman,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad87c0084474cd0c1730/1:1/w_160/8baee1e8.jpg,2015-05-19 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20433-river/,Three Lobed,"At their best and worst, solo acoustic guitar albums can feel like workshops, demonstrations meant to spotlight a player’s depth or breadth of knowledge and technique. A genteel folk shuffle cedes to a gnarly blues moan, or a ragtime ditty yields to an extended raga improvisation. Maybe there’s a banjo number, a fiddle tune, or a collage of field-recording abstraction, where crickets chirp or creeks trickle beneath incidental chords. This condition has seemed especially true for the large group of players that has emerged during the last decade. As though to keep stride with our genre-blending times, and to not be bound by old stylistic structures, these young instrumentalists (William Tyler, Steve Gunn, and James Blackshaw among them) have often embraced adaptability more than singularity. Daniel Bachman has spent the bulk of the six albums he’s released during the last four years showing that, even at the age of 25, he can stretch. For 2013’s Jesus I’m a Sinner, he plucked a banjo on one track, picked meditative lines through a haze of eerie effects for the next, and then pranced and plowed alongside an old-time band. There have been little one-instrument symphonies and unadorned folk beauties, irascible strummers and blissful drifters. The variety has made for wonderful discrete moments and galvanized Bachman’s growing reputation as one of his form’s best new practitioners. But it’s also made for albums that were mostly fine—often dazzling but generally distracted, as if Bachman knew how to travel but not exactly where to go. River, Bachman’s seventh album, is the first with a clear purpose and consistent direction. To date, it’s the best work of his career. Though Bachman is now based in Durham, N.C., where River was recorded, he is a native of the northern Virginia city of Fredericksburg, near where the Rappahannock River winds out of the Chesapeake Bay. A set of seven unaccompanied guitar instrumentals, River reads like a private love letter to an old home, written and sent from a new one. Named for another nearby town, the short ""Farnham"" is nostalgic but sentimentally vague, like a winsome feeling in search of the exact childhood memory that inspired it. The two-part, 17-minute suite ""Song for the Setting Sun"" conjures an array of emotions in one fluid listen. In part one, Bachman seems to express anxiety over the disappearing day in a place he loves but must leave; just before the three-minute mark, you can hear him nervously shuffle in his chair, perhaps even sigh. The nerves soon sublimate into contentment, though, as Bachman plays the sort of bright, gentle melody that suggests a hand-me-down folk standard, a musical home remedy meant to quell unease. At one point, Bachman’s busy, bustling strings imply he’s even throwing a backyard party. This material is like a survey of his experiences, not an overview of his abilities. River runs so well as a unit that, unless you’re able to spot the tunes or sleuth the liner notes, you likely won’t detect that Bachman didn’t even write two of these numbers. Bachman undercuts the original sliver of menace in Jack Rose’s ""Levee"", turning what sounds like an ominous threat into a hopeful promise. His chords glow, and his pulse is quick, as if he’s reflecting on a hard place from a safe, removed distance. The same holds for his spry interpretation of William Moore’s patient, playful 1928 delight, ""Old Country Rock"". Bachman fills the spaces between Moore’s licks with brief notes and radiant overtones; he’s practically dancing with the source material. Though divided by nearly a century, Rose and Moore both lived in the riverine area Bachman extols here; Rose grew up in Fredericksburg, and Moore used to cross the Rappahannock for work. Bachman treats their tales with the same familiarity and fondness he treats the land and his own life there. The Rappahannock is Bachman’s thematic thread, an animating and unifying concept that helps all of this material work as a set piece, not just a set of pieces. If he wants to keep his albums interesting, of course, it’s unlikely he’ll return to the same geographical feature often. But maybe that’s not necessary now. During the 14-minute opener ""Won’t You Cross Over to that Other Shore"", it’s clear something has shifted with Bachman’s composition and execution. There’s a little bit of raga and a little bit of ragtime, some rock'n'roll gusto and some bluegrass spirit. But all these elements feel connected and cohesive, like bits moving together with perfectly governed momentum. Even when the song swings from its darkest, slowest drags to its shiniest, fastest flourishes, the results feel more personal than professional, a demonstration of experience rather than education.","The North Carolina-via-Virginia guitarist Daniel Bachman’s seventh album is his first with a clear purpose and consistent direction. A set of seven unaccompanied guitar instrumentals, it reads like a private love letter to an old home, written and sent from a new one.

The Complete Cecil Taylor in Berlin '88,Cecil Taylor,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ade35e6ef95969321b66/1:1/w_160/29d0ca3f.jpg,2015-05-19 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20505-the-complete-cecil-taylor-in-berlin-88/,Destination: OUTDestination: OUT,"One of the more famous descriptions of Cecil Taylor’s piano playing compares his sound to someone playing ""88 tuned drums,"" and it’s true—his all-over-the-instrument dexterity is a physical marvel. You have to recalibrate your imagination when listening to Taylor performing at top speed, the better to make sense of how much music can be made by one person in a single moment. That those note-rich passages routinely add up to unbroken hour-long performances is what makes Taylor seem like the Everest of American music. Precisely because his technique is so potent, critical reaction to Taylor's music usually breaks down into two camps: those who feel the big climb is worth it, and those who don’t. Miles Davis famously walked out of an early Taylor gig in New York. When asked by a 1990s PBS documentary crew about Taylor’s suggestion that audiences should ""prepare"" for his concerts, saxophonist Branford Marsalis dismissed the concept out of hand. But elite opinion has shifted in recent years. A rising vanguard of pianists, led by the likes of Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn, is not shy about praising Taylor’s extreme, often atonal style as a crucial part of the jazz tradition. This advocacy harkens back to the '60s work of African-American poet-critics like Amiri Baraka and A. B. Spellman, both of whom wrote about Taylor’s abstracted connection to the blues as much as they emphasized the pianist’s classical, conservatory training. This recent shift in perception of Taylor's work has been helped along by two significant reissue projects. The first is a fresh and deeply clarifying remaster of Taylor’s seminal 1966 group album Unit Structures (reissued on vinyl and in a ""mastered for iTunes"" edition as part of the Blue Note label’s ongoing 75th anniversary celebration). With this title, Taylor made explicit his idiosyncratic break with previous jazz practices. Instead of charts written out in standard notation, the structure of these compositions was based on sequences of themes, many of which were communicated and rehearsed orally. (Other bits of Taylor’s music might be notated in small snatches, or else delivered to the band live, during Taylor’s feverish piano improvisations.) That Taylor was working with an exploded conception of ""ensemble togetherness"" was indicated by one excerpt from a lengthy bit of free-verse poetry that served as the original LP’s liner notes: ""Time seen not as beats to be measured after academy’s podium angle."" In other words: buckle up. After Unit Structures, Taylor cut one more LP for Blue Note, Conquistador! (also reissued by Blue Note this year). Then the pianist fell into a seven-year recording hiatus. During this period, it was possible for fans to look back at the ""we’re concerned for Cecil’s future"" tone of those '60s music-journalism pieces by Baraka and Spellman and concede that these writers had correctly foreseen a challenging period ahead. When Taylor popped back up, in the '70s, it was often as a solo artist touring in Europe. And, over the ensuing decades, it has been the interest (and respect) that Taylor has received from foreign promoters, crowds, and artists which has contributed mightily to the cause of keeping him afloat, and at work on his art. The most lavish European tribute Taylor has ever received came in the form of a month-long residency in West Berlin, in 1988, which afforded him time to perform in all of his guises—as a solo visionary, as a telepathic improviser playing next to a wide variety of top-shelf duo partners, and also as a big-band and orchestra leader. The results were recorded, and released as In Berlin '88, an 11-CD box set from the Free Music Production label. Longtime Village Voice critic Gary Giddins wrote that ""Cecil Taylor’s Berlin adventure represents his finest achievement."" Then the set promptly went out of print. Thanks to Destination: OUT, the mp3 blog turned Bandcamp reissue-label, the whole set is now available as a high-quality, authorized download, complete with two additional discs of solo works Taylor recorded on the other side of the Iron Curtain in '88. The whole package is now titled The Complete Cecil Taylor in Berlin ’88, and while it’s an investment ($125 for over 14 hours of music), it’s the other iconic reissue event that makes 2015 a prime year for approaching Taylor. The first disc in this set, Legba Crossing, presents the Cecil Taylor Workshop Ensemble, which the bandleader had time to instruct in his idiosyncratic compositional/rehearsal system. There are passages of collective squall here, but in its best moments, you can hear a sense of dawning discovery, as subsections of the group try out Taylor’s serpentine motifs and steadily gain control over them before individual players dare to contribute fluttering improvisations. The takeaway here is that, in contrast with his often lighting-fast pianist playing, Taylor the chamber-music composer has a taste for long, sustained tones, which might entice fans of drone artists like David First (who actually spent some time playing in one of Taylor’s early '70s groups). The next five discs in the Berlin box are all piano-and-percussion duets (each with a different drummer). Here’s where you get several metric tons of Taylor at the piano. On these sets, Taylor is by turns raging and lyrical, though always confident. And the drummers bring out different aspects of his playing. He meets the shrapnel-distributing heaviness of Günter Sommer with similar intensity, on the box’s second disc (Riobec). On Regalia, the occasionally Latin-tinged work of Paul Lovens brings out an interesting restraint. Another attraction of the Berlin box is the double-album Alms / Tiergarten (Spree), recorded by the Cecil Taylor European Orchestra. It’s a major addition to Taylor’s in-print catalog. Behaving less like an orchestra and more like a big band outfitted with famous names from Europe’s avant-garde improv scene (such as Peter Brötzmann and Evan Parker), the group is capable of high-energy blowouts. But like Taylor’s Workshop Ensemble, they play his quieter music with authority, too. Album number nine in this set, The Hearth, takes the cellist Tristan Honsinger and saxophonist Parker, both members of the European Orchestra, and places them in an instrumental trio setting that I don’t believe is duplicated anywhere else in Taylor’s discography. The most divisive album from the original box set follows: Pleistozaen Mit Wasser, which pairs Taylor up with the late British scrape-guitar pioneer Derek Bailey. The first half-hour track features very little piano playing from Taylor: He starts out by accompanying Bailey’s free-improv plucks with poetry (and then various inside-the-piano rubbings). It’s not a disaster, but given the historic meeting between iconic experimenters, it feels underwhelming. Things improve on the second half-hour cut: a stretch of quietly metallic avant-garde music that avoids sounding like well-behaved children sorting the recycling. The richness of the piano (even with Taylor pedaling the mute) contrasts winningly with the dry sound that Bailey coaxes from his electric guitar. The finale from the original box set, Erzulie Maketh Scent, is a solo marathon, broadly similar to other such Taylor records from the '70s onward. And the double-album bonus release, In East Berlin, is split between piano solos and another Taylor hookup with drummer Günter Sommer (who seems less intent on out-walloping Taylor, this time around). Neither East Berlin set trumps the highlights from the original West Berlin box, but hey—as long as you’re paying real money, they’re nice to have. Speaking of consumer considerations, there is the inevitable question as to whether this box set, important as it is, makes for a ""good place to start with Cecil."" The answer is no. You should start with some early Taylor albums first, if only to get a clearer look at his connection to jazz’s past. (And if you elect to pick up Blue Note's new vinyl pressing of Unit Structures, you’ll find a compelling value-add, too, as Taylor’s original poetry has been reproduced on the back jacket.) Though once you've got some grounding in Taylor's core approach, be advised that there's still a full lifetime of music waiting to be discovered.","This landmark set consists of 13 discs and 14 hours of music recorded by avant-garde jazz pianist Cecil Taylor in 1988. Every aspect of his life's work, from solo piano to small combos to large bands, is represented here.

Peanut Butter,Joanna Gruesome,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae13c0084474cd0c182b/1:1/w_160/350685f5.jpg,2015-05-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20533-peanut-butter/,SlumberlandTurnstileFortuna Pop!,"On their 2013 debut Weird Sister, Joanna Gruesome rubbed sugar up against sandpaper until both started to melt. Clean leads and light, melodic vocals trickled into oceans of fuzz under song titles like ""Wussy Void"" and ""Anti-Parent Cowboy Killers"". Two years later and they haven't evened out. Peanut Butter could have smoothed the Cardiff band's sound, finding the happy middle between their rough edges and sticky-sweet center. Instead, it pushes the group's music further out toward both extremes. Weird Sister flung a few deliberate curveballs, like the ""wrong"" chords that rocked ""Madison"" off its equilibrium. Peanut Butter is a tornado full of curveballs. At a slight 22 minutes, it bursts and buzzes, locking into patterns and then exploding out of them once you think you've figured them out. Joanna Gruesome is still partial to melody—the pop syrup flows freely after a quick hardcore fake-out at the beginning of ""Last Year""—but the hooks have lost their primacy inside the band's rough collage. The most interesting parts are now the serrated edges, the way textures brush up against textures, and how unstable the whole freewheeling machine can get. On ""Last Year"" and the aggro-peppy ""Honestly Do Yr Worst"", singer Alanna McArdle snaps out of her light, breathy melodies to find a rhythmic kinship with Perfect Pussy's Meredith Graves. Those choking, biting yelps reveal exhausted phrases here and there, snippets of language like ""I am running on empty."" A song called ""I Don't Wanna Relax"" opens with 12 seconds of blast beats and dilapidated guitar chords. When guitarist and lead songwriter Owen Williams slashes ""There Is No Function Stacy"" sideways with noise-punk breakdowns, it's as if we're getting a glimpse of what exactly McArdle is trying to outrun. Between the bright riffs and the squalls of feedback, a deep instability rests at Joanna Gruesome's core. There's more than just anger in their screams and the quick slams of the bass drum; there's a nervousness too, a sense that anything you could ever hold on to is always on the verge of slipping away. ""I know that life would be alright if I hadn't met you,"" Williams and McArdle sing on ""Separate Bedrooms"", as if seeing into a parallel universe and preemptively trying to reconcile the loss. Even the sub-two-minute tracks, like ""Jerome (Liar)"", seem to argue with themselves, switching modes from ""everything is fine"" to ""nothing will ever be okay again"" in the blink of an eye. Joanna Gruesome combust to keep the world from freezing shut around them. Peanut Butter is a chaotic listen, powerful in parts and fragile in others, and often both at the same time. No matter where it goes, it's always running away from itself.","On Joanna Gruesome's 2013 debut Weird Sister, clean leads and light, melodic vocals trickled into oceans of fuzz.

Sol Invictus,Faith No More,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad02c0084474cd0c1664/1:1/w_160/0b068e7b.jpg,2015-05-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20339-sol-invictus/,IpecacReclamation,"""There’s a lot of stupid things that happen in the world that you can’t control,” Faith No More bassist Billy Gould told Pitchfork. ""It’s funny, but it’s not funny. It’s there. But it’s great to have enough of a connection with that mentality where you can interact with it and poke your finger in it a little."" That joker’s soul, that urge to poke, can be traced through all of Faith No More's biggest moments, from their stunning hit ""Epic"" to their genre-defying, commercially unsuccessful (and critically acclaimed) 1992 opus Angel Dust. From the early 1980s through 1997, Faith No More were the reputable carneys, sporting an array of influences and oddities: everything from Madame Butterfly and Nirvana, to Nietzsche and Miles Davis, and even a not-yet-dead fish. And then they went away. For the past 18 years, fans have waited patiently for Faith No More to wrap up a disappearing act that was the inevitable result of exhaustion, creative differences, and branching paths. Since that time, frontman Mike Patton started his Ipecac label and pursued numerous solo projects, from the poppy Peeping Tom to the experimental supergroup Fantômas to the style-swapping Tomahawk. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum, the group's musical brain, started the bubblegum band Imperial Teen, scored films, and penned an opera about Bigfoot; meanwhile, bassist Billy Gould started Koolarrow Records, and drummer Mike Bordin manned the kit for Ozzy Osbourne. In 2009, the group stirred from its slumber and began performing again. And now, at long last, we’ve arrived at the confrontational Sol Invictus, the follow-up to 1997’s Album of the Year. Distance and time do not make the heart grow fonder, and two decades haven't softened Patton’s coal-black heart. He’s pissed off and proud of it, picking fights with just about anyone and anything. ""Superhero"" sees him spewing taunts at beloved authority figures, each syllable hitting with the percussive force of a slug to the jaw. ""Leader of man, get back in your cage,"" he sneers from atop Bottum’s majestic piano strata, a fool cracking his whip at a lowered God. The humiliations continue with ""Cone of Shame"", which imagines a wrongful lover in a state of depersonalization and animality, while ""Black Friday"" mocks anyone who’s set foot in a Target at 4 a.m. This commentary is far from subtle, but the ridiculousness is part of the experience, and you can’t help but smile at the return of one of rock’s great contrarians. The success of Faith No More’s theatrical approach depends on their ability to organize motifs, riffs, shouts, and whimpers into cathartic musical structures. Most of the album’s songs follow a similar dramatic pattern, with the band bookending their frantic (and typically brief) climaxes with unsettlingly calm passages and plodding tempos. The unassumingly simple melodies in ""Sunny Side Up"" and ""Rise of the Fall"" are set-ups for the carefully-orchestrated rage that lay in wait, and when it hits right the contrast makes for a fascinating listen, especially on the venomous ""Cone of Shame"". But over the course of the album, especially during later songs like ""Black Friday"", ""Motherfucker"", and ""Matador"", the recycled dynamics begin to lose their force. Set aside the negligible opening and closing tracks, and Sol Invictus has just eight tracks spanning 34 minutes, an underwhelming running time considering how long Faith No More have been away. Such brevity could be overlooked if Sol Invictus was accompanied by a significant shift in the band’s sound, but many of these songs feel like retreads. ""Superhero"" and ""Separation Anxiety"", while enjoyable, bear the signatures of ""Epic"" and ""Midlife Crisis"", with their loping piano lines and bloodthirsty rap incantations. Meanwhile, ""Black Friday"" and ""Sunny Side Up"" conjure up déjà vu of Patton’s side projects; ""Motherfucker"" could be a pumped up version of Tomahawk’s ""I.O.U"". There’s nothing necessarily wrong with a band repeating itself. But because Faith No More have such a long history, and their members are responsible for music in a staggering array of styles, it's hard not to expect more, to wish that they might in some way top themselves, or at least change direction. Towards the end of ""Cone of Shame"", Patton admits, ""I’m only happy when I’m pissing you off."" Considering Faith No More’s history of confounding and confronting the listening public and the systems of order which influence it, such a statement could serve as the band’s motto. In that sense, maybe holding something back was the plan all along, and a future Faith No More record (one is said to be on the way) will have something more.","Faith No More are back with their first album in 18 years, and two decades away haven't softened Mike Patton’s coal-black heart.

1000 EP,Ben Khan,by: Renato Pagnani,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae6fb1335d7bf1699d96/1:1/w_160/6ad7564a.jpg,2015-05-18 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20615-1000-ep/,Dirty Hit,"""Do you want to come with me? I want to see what's next,"" Ben Khan sings on ""Drive, Pt. 1"", the last of four songs on last year's 1992, his debut EP. He's talking to a would-be paramour, but due to its location at the end of his first commercial release, the couplet functions equally as a sort of wink to listeners, an invitation to stick around as the enigmatic London producer figures out just what the second phase of his career looks like. Based on the four new songs on his latest EP, 1000, the name of the game in phase two is refinement—and, in some ways, contraction—rather than expansion. Comparisons to Jai Paul's warped brand of R&B are a bit easy, but the two share more than just UK citizenship and a penchant for privacy. Like Paul, Khan favors woozy, blown-out sounds and a similar sample-based approach to his music. But Khan's subatomically-unstable electro-funk relies on his bluesy guitar playing—usually chopped into bite-sized chunks and woven into tracks in a collage-like fashion—just as much as it does his synthesizers. This marriage continues to evolve on 1000. As evidenced on the EP's title track, there's a heavier reliance on guitar, which is allowed to unfurl over longer passages this time around. ""Red"" and ""Zenith"" tip their scales toward the second half of the electro-funk equation. Both tracks contain wandering guitar lines, and when Khan's two favored instruments lock in orbit around each other, the results are thrilling—for Khan, disorienting and intoxicating aren't entirely dissimilar. But 1000 is more claustrophobic than 1992. There's less empty space in these four songs, less room to breathe and stretch out. Whereas the songs on 1992 felt like they covered a lot of ground without rushing, the 10 minutes worth of music here carries a first-draft feeling that never quite dissipates. The narrower palette Khan employs only adds to the demo-like quality: ""2022 Zodiac"" doesn't even feature an entire verse before giving way to a few snippets of film dialogue and then abruptly ending. Even Khan's songwriting feels like an afterthought: a 10-second stretch on ""Red"" finds him rhyming bad with sad and lady with baby, which should let you know just where his priorities on this EP lie. While it succeeds in terms of immediacy, 1000 makes less of a lasting impression than Khan's initial batch of music, cycling through ideas at a dizzying speed in an attempt to stuff it with hooks rather than identify its strongest ones.","Comparisons between Ben Khan and Jai Paul are a bit easy, but the two share more than UK citizenship and a penchant for privacy.

In addition to his role as a guitarist in the National alongside twin brother Aaron, he has a solo album of orchestral work with Jonny Greenwood; he's written and recorded pieces for the Kronos Quartet; he's curated Cincinnati’s weirdest festival; he participated in the hyper-collaborative  work ""The Long Count"" for the Brooklyn Academy of Music. As for his day job, he's sneaky about his influences: Strings might not regularly grace the National's music, but Dessner's simple repetitions often recall Steve Reich's Electric Counterpoint or Rhys Chatham's ""Guitar Trio"". On his sophomore solo release, Music for Wood and Strings, he aims to blur the boundaries separating his two chosen genres by literally inventing a new instrument. In an ambitious move, Bryce Dessner co-designed something called a Chordstick with Aron Sanchez of freak-folk duo Buke and Gase. Their creation is a hammer dulcimer and electric guitar hybrid, combining taut strings with sanded wood and metal fixtures. The instrument only plays two chords, but it's written in a way that dense contrapuntal rhythms—two melodic lines dancing simultaneously without touching—can switch between eight different sets of strings. The resulting sound is complex. It’s thin and full, sharp and malleable, hazy and clear. Brooklyn quartet Sō Percussion employ four of these Chordsticks with remarkable precision in Dessner’s post-minimalism piece, and the sound is the sonic equivalent of WALL·E and EVE dancing in space. Music for Wood and Strings uses repetition as its canvas. The open space between notes throughout the 10 ""tracks""—the tracklist sections off the piece by style, but the album is continuous—encourages contemplation the same way post-rock bands do. It requires repeat listens, which, given the end ""song"" is a reprise of the 35-minute piece as a whole, comes naturally. The use of mirrored inversions within chords and complex rhythms lends the piece an almost instructional quality, as if it’s teaching you quietly how to listen to it. Like David Lang's The So-Called Laws of Nature, it creates its own sound world. Dessner chooses a layering of rich tones inspired by the open chords of American folk songs, a deliberate change from the intensity of his debut Aheym. It begins with elongated whole notes peppered by joyful sixteenths, plucking their way through what sounds like a cave walled with blossoming wildflowers. Later, one Chordstick impersonates a spa-like gong and the others tremor like bugs buzzing near the speaker. In ""Section 4"" and""Section 6"", the bass string is plucked with the warmth of a cello. Occasionally a snare drum pops up, but it stays muted in comparison to the strings. The true beauty of Music for Wood and Strings stems from the enrollment of percussionists, not guitarists, to play these four parts, something that's a little lost in the translation here. Without visual aids, much of the joyful physicality of the performance is gone. Visually, the instruments look like two guitars laid flat beside each other. Sō Percussion don't use hammers to hit the strings. Instead, the players use #2 pencils to tap them like a xylophone, chipping the yellow paint off and creating indents that look like bite marks. Then, of course, come the bows, stretched across the strings and quickly sawed against the highest frets for a trill. Occasionally, the players stretch their thumbs flat against the bridge, pushing down on the strings the way you gently squish an ant on the kitchen counter, creating a muted note. It’s mesmerizing post-minimalism, but in headphones it gets occasionally lost in its own hum. Between his orchestral, chamber, and vocal compositions, this one is Bryce Dessner’s most adventurous work, but its own reverb masks the very complexities it should boast.","On his sophomore solo release, Bryce Dessner of the National teams up with Sō Percussion for a post-minimalism composition centered around the Chordstick, his co-designed dulcimer-guitar hybrid. The adventurous move yields rich, mesmerizing composition, but occasionally it gets lost in its own lulling hum.

"Blues: The ""Dark Paintings"" of Mark Rothko",Loren Connors,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929accd5e6ef9596932199e/1:1/w_160/eb000efe.jpg,2015-05-18 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20305-blues-the-dark-paintings-of-mark-rothko/,Family VineyardFamily Vineyard,"For the last four decades, Loren Connors' guitar miniatures have crept from mysterious and twilit corners, places where bits of blues, jazz, rock, and ambient abstraction formed messy assemblages. Thin little riffs stopped mid-phrase; chords splintered, as if Connors had simply forgotten he was playing them. Background noise cycled through the recording. At first blush, Connors' music can sound casual and even errant, the practice reels of someone learning to play. But stay with it, and the internal logic of Connors' work becomes evident. Rather than mimic the blues of his forebears and heroes, he splits their style open and reorders the elements. In doing so, he can weep with his guitar, moan, exclaim and even stare (almost silently) into the middle distance. To that end, the newly resurrected Blues: The ""Dark Paintings"" of Mark Rothko is one of the more revelatory sets of Connors' career, one that finds him vocalizing through six electrified strings and adds another emotional sphere to his repertoire. The restored and remastered edition from Family Vineyard—an imprint that's done essential work in both preserving and pushing Connors' legacy since its second release, in 1999—almost doesn't qualify as a reissue. Sure, it has all the trappings, like a new cover (one of Rothko's ""dark paintings,"" in fact), new liner notes, and archival addendums that include the original liner notes. But Dark Paintings was barely issued, anyway. Connors originally released it in 1990, under the short-lived named ""Guitar Roberts"" and on his own label, St. Joan Records, in a hand-made edition of between 200 and 300. For years, its seven tracks have existed mostly as a phantom, something you pilfered from an MP3 blog or heard about rather than heard. At last, however, one of the best documents from an essential, transitional phase of Connors' career is widely available. It's another chance to hear more of him and to understand his quiet intensity. ""Blues No. 4"", for instance, begins with a frail melody, Connors stepping up and down across the neck. He applies the same pattern across the instrument's range, high notes that nearly squeal countering low ones that sulk. He stretches some into rock'n'roll leads but mostly lets the notes circle around one another, allowing for variations so slight you barely notice. The music's relative simplicity highlights his vibrato, or the way that the whole piece seems to wobble in time. Using only an electric guitar and a four-track recorder, Connors conjures the essence of a battered old 78, a song spit out by the horn of a hulking Victrola. Connors sings these blues with his fingers. Likewise, during ""No. 6"", Connors sounds alternately like an opera singer and Bessie Smith, with the soprano pleas of his guitar's upper register cutting against a blanket rumble of low notes. Dense tangles unwind into long threads for ""No. 2"". Each time, it's as if you can hear him sigh beneath some heavy burden, like Robert Johnson lamenting the last fair deal or Geeshie Wiley remembering those last kind words. These seven instrumentals represent Connors' responses to a posthumous exhibition of the ""Dark Paintings"" of Mark Rothko, a major ideological and technical influence he's long acknowledged. Rothko finished these works just before committing suicide in 1970. Connors' responses, then, seem like an attempt to live among those same bleak grays and blacks but to not languish in them—that is, to survive by singing about the sadness, not drowning in it. The anguish so apparent in the hand-wringing chords of ""No. 1"" sublimate into a kind of contemplative beauty by the end of ""No. 7"". When I recently revisited Dark Paintings, I heard in Connors' work an unintentional and contemporary connection I'd never imagined: These seven songs use instrumental guitar to produce the same immersive effect as recent electronic work by the likes of Andy Stott, Demdike Stare, and even Zomby. You yield to the feeling of it all as much as the technical form or finesse, however accomplished that might be. And you depend on the glimpses of light—the gentle melodies, the sudden shouts—that creep through the void. Though Dark Paintings lasts only 29 minutes, it's work that's worth hearing on repeat for hours, as if you live inside these sounds. The meticulous, counterintuitive logic comes into slow focus, and perseverance engrained in these reflections starts to become clear. Rather than succumb to the blues, Connors and his guitar get them out the best way they know how.","The newly resurrected Blues: The ""Dark Paintings"" of Mark Rothko is one of the more revelatory sets of Loren Connors’ career.

In Plain Speech,Circuit Des Yeux,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adb113d1975652139f97/1:1/w_160/8112b987.jpg,2015-05-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20464-in-plain-speech/,Thrill Jockey,"Calling music ""meditative"" often means it's mellow and soothing—a conduit for relaxation. But truly meditative music isn't so much sedative as it is transformative, inducing a deliberately slower, quieter mental state. That's the kind of meditation Haley Fohr encourages as Circuit Des Yeux, and never more so than on In Plain Speech. The album is all long arcs and patient development. It's not laid-back; much of it is urgent and dramatically tense. Fohr's not here to placate, but she does seem bent on getting you to step back, to hear things calmly rather than in a rush. If that sounds more like a task than a pleasure, don't worry: Fohr does most of the work for you. Her songs escort you toward stillness and awe rather than requiring you to get there first. The music is immediate and enveloping, and because of her rich, stirring voice, it's sometimes even bracing. But once you're ensnared, it becomes quietly mesmerizing. Part of that comes from the way she builds songs, adding pieces and textures subtly over time. But much of In Plain Speech's meditative power is a product of the wholeness and commitment of Fohr's vision, which communicates itself on a more intuitive level. Often her approach is refreshingly simple: to make you pause, Fohr pauses herself. In ""Do the Dishes"", after a stretched-out haiku moaned over a cycling sample, she retreats into complete silence, then re-emerges with long, wordless tones. A similar full stop comes after the folk-rock climax of ""Fantasize the Scene"", as Fohr appends a string-heavy epilogue that evokes the best dirges of Nico. Though it doesn't contain a literal pause, ""A Story of This World"" is In Plain Speech's most stillness-inducing track, and its best. On the surface, it's a simple folk tune, with acoustic strums, gentle strings, and Fohr's koans about how ""all the gold turns to rust."" But the tune's primal patience—its willingness to hang in space as it moves, to stand rather than sprint—is so thorough it feels like nature. Here and in the slow-burning instrumental ""Dream of TV"", Circuit Des Yeux recalls the Dirty Three, the way they grow a tune so organically it feels more like weather than music—and the way they tease out powerful emotions without triggering easy sentimentality. Past Circuit Des Yeux albums flirted with the maudlin, but In Plain Speech feels brighter and more optimistic; the music seems to be continually rising. Where she was once introspective, Fohr is now interested in human connection, using second and third person more than first. ""Do you roam for the end?/ Do you roam to transcend?"" she asks beatifically in ""Ride Blind"". Later, ""Fantasize the Scene"" dreams of eternal companionship: ""I know a place where we could go/ Maybe I will meet you there/ In a world where we'll go all the way."" The optimism of In Plain Speech still comes with plenty of heavy drama, especially in Fohr's harrowing singing. Dark, thick, and nearly scraping baritone, her voice is so strikingly different —and so unafraid to skirt melodrama—that you can never quite get comfortable with it. But that uniqueness is part of what makes her music so compelling, as is her willingness to drift into wordless sounds—perhaps her recent experience using her voice as an instrument in Mind Over Mirrors was an influence. Part of In Plain Speech's relative sunniness comes from Fohr's embrace of collaborators. She went it alone on previous albums, and the music was accordingly intimate and confined. Here, with the help of some Chicago neighbors—including Cooper Crain (Cave, Bitchin Bajas), Rob Frye (Bitchin Bajas), and Kathleen Baird (Spires That in the Sunset Rise)—her music opens up and spreads out, incorporating more percussion and strings. Fohr's voice remains central, but these partnerships have added new verve to her music. That openness to collaboration dovetails with Fohr's framing of In Plain Speech as an outward-looking album. As she recently put it, ""This record is me putting out my hand and asking the world to grab onto it."" That may seem to contradict the idea of this music as meditative, but it actually fits quite well. Where previous records offered a portal into Fohr's own inner space, In Plain Speech is about altering her listeners' perceptions, and taking them somewhere new.","On her meditative and mesmerizing new album as Circuit Des Yeux, Haley Fohr embraces collaboration, working with members of Bitchin Bajas and other Chicago neighbors instead of going it alone. Accordingly, her music opens up, and the songs on In Plain Speech escort you toward stillness and awe.

Ratchet,Shamir,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae4c9d034d5c69bf44fd/1:1/w_160/611afec6.jpg,2015-05-18 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20585-ratchet/,XL,"""Growing up in Vegas and being the weird one out, you kind of have to put on a tough face,"" Shamir Bailey tells those tuned into his Ratchet Radio playlist on Spotify. There’s both weirdness and toughness in droves on his debut album-cum-deliverance, Ratchet. Less than two years after sending a demo cross-country to Brooklyn's Godmode imprint, Shamir signed to XL Recordings—a label known for pop outliers like Dizzee Rascal, M.I.A., and FKA twigs—and got his face on a Times Square billboard. On Ratchet, an honest, earnest pop record, Shamir elaborates on the gutsy melodies of those early demos and singles and makes good on the hype. Produced entirely by Godmode label head Nick Sylvester (a former Pitchfork contributor), Ratchet feels like a study in the best dance-pop of the past decade, from the dank basslines of the Ed Banger collective to the melodic, moody prance of Hot Chip, the flamboyance of the Scissor Sisters to the technical, four-on-the-floor finesse of Azari & III. This powers a record that’s about the sine wave of adolescent emotions; Shamir, a cherub-faced fashion kid with a voice like Crystal Waters, flips easily between confidence and vulnerability. The piano house/diva vocal-influenced R&B track ""I Know It’s a Good Thing"", from last year’s Northtown EP, merely hinted at how dance-indebted this record is. Acid basslines chug and squelch on ""Call It Off"" and ""Hot Mess"", and ""Make a Scene"" and ""Head in the Clouds"" both ascend to frenzied, laser synth peaks. House, particularly within the context of its early black, gay roots, has been described as liberating. There’s a freedom narrative at play on Ratchet too, as Shamir excises those childhood demons while calling upon the showy, campy glamor of his hometown. ""Vegas, we’re sinners all right, at least at night,"" Shamir warbles on the lounge-y intro track, named after the city. Shamir's voice is the most immediately unusual element; whether singing or rapping, he moves from comely to coy to cocky, depending on what the song calls for. Like on ""Youth"", a nu-disco lament with a soulful breakdown, where he pours his tinsel voice over a double-time rattle and a Morse-quick buzz synth. Each word trickles out slowly and precise at first, and then it’s like he backs away from the mic to sing from the gut, trilling and ad-libbing to a rapturous breakdown. Squint past his vocal brass and the dazzle of the production and there’s that weirdness and toughness. ""On the Regular"", a gleaming, dance-rap contagion, is the kitschy lure into the album, more subdued than Azealia Banks’ ""212"" but sharing a spiritual bounce and temerity. ""Don’t try me, I’m not a free sample...Haters get the bird, more like the eagle,"" he alternates between a regal, almost sensual moan and breathless rapping, which dilutes the crassness of alluding to dropping down and thrusting his crotch in someone’s face. And on the wry ballad ""Demon"", about a life-altering relationship, ""If I'm a demon, baby, you're the beast that made me."" It’s a beautiful, delicate melody that’s slightly blue, and brings Shamir as close as he’ll get to straight up vulnerability on a pulsing, in-your-face record. Perhaps most indicative of Ratchet’s pseudo-redemptive, leaving-Las-Vegas arc is ""In for the Kill"", an orchestral freak-out that finds Shamir looking back to say, ""I’ll be back someday, and when I do I promise you, I won’t make the same mistake."" The adult Shamir has reconstituted his precious voice as armor. He might resemble past baby-faced rap and R&B stars like IMx or TBTBT or B2K, minus the hyper-alpha masculinity, but Shamir fits in with today’s genre-bending pop stars. Ratchet is as melodically and thematically confident as Rihanna and Willow Smith, but his aesthetic—a Vegas pixie, a black man making poetic and flagrantly rococo dance pop—is a challenge and a reclamation, not just of ""ratchet,"" but the queer, racialized roots of house music and the unabashedly flamboyant history of black pop music. We revere Prince and are fascinated by Young Thug, both unapologetically outre musicians walking the line of black masculinity, but they qualify that with reams of virile, hetero fuck-anthems. Frank Ocean came out and said it. Shamir, on the other hand, conveys a more ambiguous sensuality that presents a challenge to pop—his lane, for sure—especially given his soft, high-pitched, luminous voice. He doesn’t tell us anything about his sexuality, but we all know how people can treat artistic, effete boys. What Ratchet’s 10 songs of self-discovery say without saying at all is that there’s liberation on the dancefloor.","Ratchet, from Las Vegas singer-songwriter Shamir Bailey, feels like a study in the best dance-pop of the past decade. It's an honest, earnest pop record, as Shamir elaborates on the gutsy melodies of his early demos and singles.

Boys,Crocodiles,by: Pat Healy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae54b1335d7bf1699d61/1:1/w_160/b3a71d56.jpg,2015-05-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20595-boys/,Zoo Music,"Crocodiles have been subletting their sound from the Jesus and Mary Chain since their full-length debut in 2009. Brandon Welchez and Charles Rowell continue to crash at the Reid brothers’ pad for the first half of their fifth album, but by side two of Boys, they’re finally ready to move out. Maybe it will be good for them; this flat was getting pretty musty anyway. Boys has the requisite reverb and guitar fuzz and Welchez talk-singing about life ""in the clubs, on them drugs."" The first few songs are living-on-the-edge narratives that would sound way more badass were they not discredited by clichés like ""cold as ice"" and ""sharp like razorblades."" It also doesn’t help how heavily they borrow from badasses who came before them. There’s a big Ringo drum fill in ""Foolin’ Around"" that is so recognizable it takes away from anything original that might be going on around it. And when Welchez delivers the phrase ""down on the street"" in ""Crybaby Demon"", you can almost hear his rationale during a corporate presentation: ""The Stooges sang a song called ‘Down on the Street’, so if we plop that phrase into this song here, we can optimize our badass market viability."" The irony is that there was no board of directors to impress with Boys. It’s being released on the Zoo Music imprint, which Welchez runs with his wife, Dum Dum Girls frontwoman Dee Dee Penny. (The album was also made possible by a PledgeMusic campaign.) So why do Crocodiles end up sounding like the world’s safest dangerous band? Maybe because as tenants of the Reids’, they don’t want to rearrange too much? Maybe they want to ease their fans into their new sound? Whatever the reason, by the fifth track, when Welchez asks, ""Hey, boy! Why you gotta be so hard?"" he might as well be posing this question to himself, as he takes off his leather jacket and begins to explore the emotions and rhythms of recording in Mexico City. It’s almost as if the first half of the album is comprised of songs that Crocodiles had finished writing by the time they got to the studio, and the second half is all of the stuff that they came up with while they were there. And this exploratory spirit is where Boys finds its strength. All cool guy posturing is gone by the time they get to ""Blue"", a wispy melody that recalls the Zombies. This might be the most honest thing Crocodiles have recorded yet, with lyrics like, ""Years chained up in shame, nothing but family to blame/ Now when darkness arrives it swallows all that lived inside."" Also noteworthy is the interplay between the polished pop structure and the queasy guitar on ""Peroxide Hearts"". It's unclear what they are going for with the song ""Transylvania"", which seems to broach themes of trans-identity. The spirit of the song is reverent and anthemic, but lines like ""sometimes it's such a drag to be a man"" miss the mark, unless the mark was groan-inducing puns. Incidentally, the song's chorus may be the catchiest thing on Boys, and whatever else it represents, it shows us Crocodiles actively moving outside of their comfort zone. The same goes for the syncopated rhythms they put under numbers like ""Kool TV"" and album closer ""Don’t Look Up"". Whether this was the influence of producer Martin Thulin, the band soaking up their environs in Mexico City, or a little bit of both, it’s a winning combination. Crocodiles have referred to this new sound as salsa-punk and ""muy chingón!"" which, roughly translated, means ""fucking awesome"" in Spanish. They don’t quite get the salsa part right, but that’s what makes this unique. Some of the most inventive music can come from people not quite understanding a different kind of music: The fact that this braver experimentalism rounds out an album that begins with old formulaic fuzz provides hope that the next Crocodiles release will actually be fucking awesome.","When Crocodiles take off their leather jackets and let Mexico City seep into their skin is when Boys gets interesting. But for the first half of their fifth album, Brandon Welchez and Charles Rowell play it safe and continue to kneel at the alter of the Jesus and Mary Chain.

Brother I Prove You Wrong,Charles Cohen,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae21c0084474cd0c1846/1:1/w_160/7b0544ee.jpg,2015-05-15 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20546-brother-i-prove-you-wrong/,Morphine,"People don't tend to think much about gestures when considering electronic music—that is, hands, and the shapes they carve. Think, for a moment, of a rock guitarist or a jazz saxophonist or a classical pianist. Your mental picture probably involves the splay of their fingers, the angle of their backs, the tilt of their heads. But electronic music is largely disembodied. Imagine a studio, and you'll probably think of someone hunched over a computer keyboard; imagine a live performance and you'll probably think of the same thing. For the Philadelphia electronic musician Charles Cohen, though, the gesture is everything, even if the gesture itself—flicking a switch, twisting a knob, quickly reconnecting a patch cable—is utilitarian rather than expressive. His instrument of choice is a Buchla Music Easel, an arcane synthesizer built in limited quantities in the '70s. Where the evolution of electronic instruments has been, in large part, an arms race of bells and whistles, the Easel's biggest selling points are its limitations. It does without a traditional piano keyboard in favor of a touch keyboard, which forces the performer to search for modes that go beyond the typical 12-tone chromatic scale. More strikingly, the Easel features only a single oscillator, which means that it's capable of just one sound at a time. The tradeoff is the many possibilities the instrument offers for modulating and manipulating sound in real time. As Cohen explained at a workshop during the CTM Festival last year, ""All the action in the Easel is in control. That's sort of a Buchla concept: complicated control over simple sounds, as opposed to many other instruments, where you have very, very complex sounds but only simple control."" Cohen, who is in his late sixties, has been at it long enough to have become a proper virtuoso on the Easel. He is primarily a performer and an improviser, not a recording artist. Two years ago, Rabih Beaini's Morphine label released a decade's worth of Cohen's experiments in a series of LPs that were eventually collected in the double-disc anthology, A Retrospective. But Brother I Prove You Wrong is all-new work, recorded specifically at Beaini's behest, and it reflects the lessons he has learned from years of live performance on the Easel. Whereas many of Cohen's earlier pieces had been made with the use of multi-tracked tape, the Brother tracks were all recorded using just the Buchla and a delay unit, and mostly done in single takes. It is a curious sound, both spindly and sinewy all at once. In place of long, held tones, the music tends to proceed like a succession of water droplets. The careening blips bring to mind fireflies in a dark cavern or the orbits of subatomic particles; like atoms, the music consists primarily of empty space. The album begins, with ""Cloud Hands"", as if assembling itself out of nothingness, as arrhythmic whippoorwill trills gradually settle into a gentle contrapuntal pattern that feels, briefly, almost Baroque. The hypnotic ""Sacred Mountain"" chugs ahead at 85 beats per minute, with a steady 4/4 pulse and an ascending arpeggio that spins like a water wheel. It might almost be techno, and so might ""The Boy and the Snake Dance"", which, once it materializes out of the mist and locks into a regular tempo, brings to mind the pinging dissonance of Robert Hood. As spare as the music may be, it's hard to believe that just one instrument is in play, particularly given the way that Cohen uses his sequencer and delay unit to create layers. ""Formation of Matter"" features sludgy bass formations shrouded in metallic echo; it feels like moving through a fog of iron fillings. The air is heavy with the memory of bells—all tail, no peal—and gossiping modems. In ""Beirut"", a dubby bassline reminiscent of Pole paces beneath a rapid-fire battery of ring-mod tones. The illusion of fullness is overwhelming. Cohen has said that he begins his performances by picking up where he last left off, and a similar sense of continuity runs through Brother. Some tracks are explicitly interconnected: In ""Visitors of the Sacred Mountain"", a faint echo of the previous track's main motif percolates deep in the mix, almost out of earshot, shrouded in brittle, crystalline chirps, like the cries of frozen birds. Mostly, though, the through line makes itself felt in the way Cohen's single-oscillator synth morphs across the course of the album. It is in constant motion. Otherwise repetitive arpeggios dodge and feint around their indicated paths, ululating pitches rise and fall, and the music's timbre is as mutable as a bead of quicksilver. It sometimes feels like you're listening to the inner life of a dial tone. As it happens, the mind/body duality appears in ""Mankind and Mannequins"", a groaning, gurgling piece accompanied by a surrealist, spoken-word vignette that asks what the thoughts of a rock and a mannequin might sound like. It is a static scene, a scene of stillness, yet the sound is restless—indicative, perhaps, of the motion inside these apparently inanimate objects. The rock lies inert, the mannequin's hand is crooked just so. But the atoms that comprise the sound of their thoughts are a nonstop swirl.","The Philadelphia musician Charles Cohen, who's in his late sixties, plays a Buchla Music Easel, an arcane synthesizer built in limited quantities in the 1970s.

Visions,Jupiter Jax,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae1f13d197565213a056/1:1/w_160/b1ad9061.jpg,2015-05-15 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20544-visions/,100% Silk,"Like his label home 100% Silk, Jupiter Jax fetishizes the dance-music past, both in brazen broad strokes and sly details. The Maltese producer, born Rudi Agius, called his first solo release City Life '88: The title is a jumbled reference to Inner City's chart-climbing ""Good Life"" single from 1988, and its biggest highlight was an overt play on ""Voodoo Ray"", A Guy Called Gerald's acid-house classic, also from '88. Which is to say Agius practices legacy worship—music by classic house purists, for classic house purists—and he simply oozes the stuff from his arsenal of hardware. Every DJ set, SoundCloud sketch, remix, live show, tape, and 12"" explores the potential of repurposing Chicago, Detroit, and London club scene histories. ""House is a feeling,"" exclaims the '91 Todd Terry staple, to which Jupiter Jax seems to reply, ""House is the feeling."" So goes Visions, a generous debut album built on memories of house at its most euphonic and soft-focus. To his credit, Agius goes deep into the eras and locations he loves, even to the point of hosting Chicago house legend Merwyn Sanders, a founding member of Virgo Four, on the gliding single ""The Light"". And though the addition looks nice on paper, it winds up somewhat gimmicky and half-baked in practice: Sanders' words of mystic wisdom are mumbled and buried under grandiose flute samples, New Age synths, and hand drums, almost like the most important part of his contribution was the feature credit. Jupiter Jax treats guest appearances by Xosar and Mykle Anthony with more care and precision, producing tracks that actually play to and spotlight their vocal strengths. Visions shines brightest when vintage house is used to help materialize the artist's own ideas. Too often, ""vintage house"" is the idea, full stop. Suffice it to say the record could rightly be called a pastiche, albeit a varied one; nods to Larry Heard, Ron Trent, 808 State, the Orb, Kevin Saunderson, the Future Sound of London, and more pop up for those who are looking for them. Agius treats each familiar Roland synth patch and drum sample with reverence and tenderness, so when individual wrinkles appear, they make a big impact. ""The Deepest"" diverges into a low-lit '90s rave palette, and it initially comes off like a version of Zomby's ""Tears in the Rain"" after the clouds cleared away. But about halfway through, Agius introduces an ascendent melodic theme and headstrong bassline, effectively lifting the mix off the soaked concrete. In that turn, we see Jupiter Jax for who he is—specifically, a tuneful artist interested in creating overtly romantic and emotional dancefloor experiences. Agius has knowingly set himself up against titans, so it's his attention to detail, sleek production chops, and compositional prowess that ultimately have to win out, and they do. Visions makes smart use of space for the most part, never choking out a track's atmosphere and rarely losing its way in a dense fog. Jupiter Jax just about overextends his abilities on ""Beyond the Walls"", but opener ""Armed for Peace"" and cloud-hopping standout ""Soul Searchin'"" are prime examples of what makes Visions so immediately likeable: two weightless grooves that want nothing more than to paint constellations behind your eyes. It doesn't matter much what dusty singles the tracks remind you of when Jupiter Jax plays them in a dark, crowded room.

Blossoming Decay,Noisem,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae5eea9e61561daa627a/1:1/w_160/9faf68a4.jpg,2015-05-15 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20603-blossoming-decay/,A389,"One of the first things people mention about the Baltimore metal band, Noisem, is their youth. This seems increasingly less important in the Internet age, when a 10-year-old can download the entire Carcass discography at the click of a button, and searching out obscure, far-flung scenes isn't as hard as it once was. We're living in a time when a novice can become an ""expert"" in a night, even if they don’t understand what begat what or comprehend the context. And that's why Noisem impressed people with 2013 debut, Agony Defined: Here we had guys between the ages of 15 and 20 coming off like folks twice their age, adroitly resurrecting the past. Agony Defined, which blurred nine songs into 26 minutes, was exhilarating, a mix of old-school whammy bar-rich thrash and death metal with little bits of grind and punk thrown about. People were fair when they brought up Slayer and Napalm Death's Scum. As mentioned when I called it my 10th favorite metal album of 2013, it reminds me of the more extreme music that got me into metal as a kid, when I'd moved beyond the hair metal of my older sister and MTV and discovered speed and thrash at the pay-to-play venues in southern New Jersey. Their second album, Blossoming Decay, is burlier. The playing itself sturdier, faster, and more hulking. Some of this could be due to the lineup change: bassist Yago Ventura is now handling guitar and vocalist Tyler Carnes' older brother, Billy, who also did the cover art, is on bass. (It's probably worth noting that the group now features two sets of brothers: the Carneses along with drummer Harley Phillips and his brother, guitarist Sebastian.) More likely, though, it's about getting more comfortable as songwriters and experimenters, hence the ambient cello pieces that start the first and second sides with an eerie, heavy drone. The blazing solos are still there, but the actual riffs pull as much of your attention this time. That, and the singing is freer, gnarlier, and more rabid—it's a nonstop vocal attack that comes off more punk and personal than Agony. On Blossoming, Noisem have worked in larger doses of grind and death and punk; there's less time to take hold of the whammy. We get nine songs in 24 minutes, and that includes those cello pieces (which come off as soft, low-tech industrial ambiance) as well as the 4-minute ""Cascade of Scars"", which opens on a doom note, and momentarily brings to mind Converge. For such a short album, there's plenty of variation, like the floor-punching youth crew pulse in ""1132"", the catchy opener ""Trail of Perturbation"", the blistering shout-along in ""Replant and Repress"". This is a record that'll appeal to punk kids—and Trash Talk fans—as much as it'll blow the minds of metalheads. In part, this is because, for all the technical prowess, there's a lot of heart on the record. In a recent Decibel feature, the Carnes brothers talked about their mother abandoning them at a young age, and being raised by their rock'n'roll-friendly father (who stole Billy a guitar to practice on when he was a kid). Tyler's mentioned being into Robert Smith's lyrics, and the words of Converge's Jacob Bannon—poetry, more or less. This album carries that kind of weight: flowers are reincarnated as shards (and, later tossed into the sea) and there are suicidal thoughts, sinking stomachs, lacerations, hazy memories. There's a lot of blood and more than a few knives. There's a general anxiety, along with a song called ""Another Night Sleeping in the Cold"", that resonates deeply when you know the singer's backstory. This human element of Noisem is appealing. These are not songs about horror films, they're songs about the personal horrors of life and living. Which may be another reason that, as brief and rabid as these songs are, they stick with you. At the end of this cacophony, it's easy to want to listen all over again. And it's just as easy to be excited about how much these guys have already progressed in such a short time, and how much more music they have left to create.","The Baltimore metal band's second LP charges through nine songs in 24 minutes, mixing old-school thrash and death metal with bits of grind and punk.

Simple Songs,Jim O’Rourke,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929add2ea9e61561daa6199/1:1/w_160/428bd068.jpg,2015-05-15 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20488-simple-songs/,Drag City,"There was a time, from the late 1990s to the mid–2000s or so, when Jim O’Rourke sat at the center of a peculiar intersection of experimental, indie rock, and electronic music. His name on a record was an assurance of a certain level of quality, and he had his name on a great number of them. During these years, he engineered, produced, mixed, and played on records by Smog, Sam Prekop, Faust, John Fahey, Wilco, Stereolab, Tony Conrad, Sonic Youth (of which he was a member), Beth Orton, Superchunk, Phill Niblock, and many more. In a suspiciously high number of cases, he was involved in one of those artists' best records. We’ve heard so much about the abuses of digital technology over the last five years—the compression, the brick-walling, the poor mastering, the lack of dynamic range. Well, O’Rourke didn’t do that stuff; in fact, he defined himself against it (he’s never released his solo work on mp3 and, in fact, only released his solo albums digitally at all in the past month). The music he worked on didn’t necessarily surface on radio, but it sounded fantastic in your living room. Throughout the period just before and just after the millennium, no one better exemplified the promise of what was then called post-rock—music steeped in tradition that also looked beyond it, integrating traditional tools with new technologies and exploring new contexts. And then, on top of all that, there were Jim O’Rourke’s solo albums. Starting with 1997’s Bad Timing, O’Rourke has released a series of what are usually called his ""pop"" albums on Drag City. Not all of these have vocals (Bad Timing focused on steel string guitar and whimsical Americana, while 2008’s The Visitor is a difficult-to-classify proggy electro-acoustic instrumental suite), but O’Rourke’s Drag City solo records have threads running through them, from shared title inspirations to artwork to musical quotations from one album to the next. O’Rourke enjoys games and references and limitations that allow him to create a world where his music exists. Each album stands on its own but also feels like a brick in a slowly building wall. No two of O’Rourke’s solo albums sound alike; each exists in its own space. For Simple Songs, that space is firmly in the smart singer-songwriter world of the 1970s, the place where Van Dyke Parks and Randy Newman might be hanging out and drinking and telling dirty jokes. When O’Rourke first sang on Eureka, his voice stuck out like a crumpled bag of Cheetos on Queen Elizabeth’s dinner table. Part of the charm of the music came from hearing a guy who could not sing gamely do so, voicing complicated melodies while surrounded by luxurious production. It made no sense and somehow, because of that, it worked. With Simple Songs, O’Rourke’s voice has deepened and become more gruff, and he sounds almost normal. There’s a timbral similarity here to Cat Stevens, though O’Rourke couldn’t have that kind of innocence and sweetness even if he wanted to. Instead, the lyrics are the usual mix of dark humor and misanthropy, with occasional glimpses of warmth. Album opener ""Friends With Benefits"" begins with ""Nice to see you once again,"" and it seems like he’s addressing it to listeners who haven’t heard from him in a while, but then he follows that with ""Been a long time my friends/ Since you crossed my mind at all."" O’Rourke’s songs are saying real things, but they are also constantly subverting themselves, in love with pop-lyric tradition while pushing against it. O’Rourke is the kind of songwriter who titles a closing song ""All Your Love"", but makes the chorus ""All your love/ Will never change me"" and then cuts that sentiment with ""I’m so happy now/ And I blame you."" O’Rourke is always clever and funny, but the driving force in his music is the art of the arrangement. Many of the greatest pleasures on Simple Songs come from how certain instruments are layered together, how the chords are voiced and the harmonic progressions unfold. The songs, played by O’Rourke and a cast of Tokyo-based musicians, are generally driven by guitar and piano, but strings, pedal steel, mandolin, horns, and woodwinds are all featured prominently. There are gorgeous instrumental bridges and codas, like the one in ""Half Life Crisis"" that finds O’Rourke braiding a Fripp-like electric guitar lead and pedal steel around a violin line. Getting the mix perfect is supremely important; there’s never too much of anything, and nothing is ever buried. Midrange detail is prized over booming low end. Dynamics are powerful but not overpowering. Every instrument has its place. All of which is to say that Simple Songs is a subtle record that avoids extremes, which also makes it a record out of time. It’s a record that asks you to come to it. If O’Rourke ever felt the need to keep up with every development in music, that time has passed. After moving to Tokyo in the last decade, O’Rourke has been a less central figure. He stays busy in music, art, and film, but much of his work doesn’t travel beyond Japan. He has his handful of obsessions, his rules, his limitations, and once in a while he returns and gives us a record like this, something that will be sounding good five or 10 or 15 years from now, or whenever the next solo record comes along.","Jim O'Rourke's first solo album on Drag City in six years finds his brilliant ear for arrangement and love of dark humor intact.

High on Tulsa Heat,John Moreland,by: Corban Goble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae1bea9e61561daa6211/1:1/w_160/4bf3ae6a.jpg,2015-05-14 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20540-high-on-tulsa-heat/,Old Omens,"The lane is wide open for the would-be country revivalist. As the mainstream product increasingly incorporates new sounds and attitudes, there will always be audiences yearning for the sparer, ""rootsier"" sounds transporting them back to the days of the Highwaymen. It's an evergreen niche, and it is forever welcoming to new entrants. Enter Oklahoman songwriter John Moreland. Though Moreland has been making this sort of music since 2008—his last release was 2013's In the Throes, a sorrowful and spare collection of heavy-hearted country rockers—his background playing in local punk and hardcore groups gives him a good feel for forcefulness. Many of the songs on Moreland's new album High on Tulsa Heat, arguably Moreland's prettiest if not his most most musically vivid release, capture this feeling—""Cherokee"", in particular, weaves a solemn guitar line with Moreland's weathered vocal to devastating effect. (""I've got a taste for poison/ I'm giving up on ever being well/ I keep mining the horizon/ Digging for lies I've yet to tell."") High on Tulsa Heat is filled with simple delights like ""Cherokee"". Songs like opener ""Hang Me in the Tulsa County Stars"" and the title track push Moreland's voice forward while accenting its weary wisdom with simple accompaniments—sliding guitar, pedal steel, economically applied—and harmonies (""Heart's Too Heavy""). High on Tulsa Heat finds a nice balance between the spare and sad (""Cleveland County Blues"") and warm moods, and on balance, it's strangely uplifting. Moreland lacks the cynical sharpness and humor of fellow travelers like Sturgill Simpson—whose Metamodern Sounds of Country Music stands as a high watermark for this generation's wave of ""alt country"". Moreland's songs are simpler and open up in more conventional ways. On High on Tulsa Heat, small details feel like major victories—for instance, the soft tambourine and shaker flourishes on album highlight ""White Flag"". Moreland's music is sad, to be sure—but even as he's singing about being useless and an addict (""You need something stronger/ A drug to kill the hunger/ And ease the awful pain of living here"" from ""You Don't Care for Me Enough to Cry""), you can hear a palpable hope for redemption coursing through. There is plenty of well-worn sentiment and saltiness in his music, but there is also a relatable humanity that makes High on Tulsa Heat worth going back to. Though many of the songs convey images of earthiness and of dirt, there's a beauty that helps the collection soar above the ground.","John Moreland lacks the cynical sharpness and humor of fellow travelers like Sturgill Simpson—whose Metamodern Sounds of Country Music stands as a high watermark for this generation's wave of ""alt country"".

Send Two Sunsets,Gacha Bakradze,by: Nathan Reese,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad9013d1975652139f65/1:1/w_160/02a9afaf.jpg,2015-05-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20440-send-two-sunsets/,Apollo,"In the fractured, constantly evolving world of electronic music, it's tempting to prioritize the shock of the the new: the post-ironic zap of PC Music, the maximalist eclecticism of Hudson Mohawke, the sculptural zen of Oneohtrix Point Never. But sometimes old sounds can be worth revisiting, especially if they're molded by a particularly sure hand. Newcomer Gacha Bakradze, who hails from Tbilisi, Georgia and splits his time between Paris and his native city, isn't interested in carving out a signature, cutting-edge sound. Instead, his debut LP, Send Two Sunsets, floats atop a bath of well-worn nostalgia that, by definition (and purpose), asks little of its audience except to be soothed. In his press materials, Gacha cites shoegazers Slowdive, German experimentalists Cluster, and Madchester mainstays the Durutti Column among his inspirations. Each touchstone is easy to spot—so easy, that, at times, Two Sunsets scans as an homage to its forebears. Like much of Cluster's ambient work, Gacha’s leans towards sounds that are unabashedly pleasurable to experience. The aptly titled ""Bliss"", featuring Natalie Beridze—a frequent collaborator of Gacha's who also performs under the name TBA—shifts between delicate synth-pop and ambient psychedelia. ""Blue Distance"", on the other hand, uses MIDI plugins seemingly discovered beneath Dire, Dire Docks or sourced from Cisco's ""Opus Number 1"" CallManager Muzak. Though Gacha employs those tools deftly, the spa-day palette recalls sounds that have also been mined by recent producers looking to revive new age in the new millennium; fans of How to Dress Well's ""Ocean Floor for Everything"" will recognize a shared sentimentality for 64-bit sequencing. Send Two Sunsets comes on the heels of two EPs, Remember and When the Watchman Saw the Light, both released via Apollo Records, the ambient-leaning subdivision of R&S Records. R&S, aside from its roots in the Belgian New Beat scene of the mid-'80s, has released music from Aphex Twin, C. J. Bolland, and James Blake over the years. It's a label that carries three decades of history, yet continues to push the medium forward. (Recent signees include genre-benders like Lone and Tessela.) But it's clear from the beginning that Send Two Sunsets is more historical excavation than vanguard innovation—a position Gacha seems happy to occupy. Sunsets can largely be seen as a continuation of Gacha's previous two releases, whose tracks ebb and flowed with a similarly harmonious calm. (Just looking at the album cover will likely give you some idea of Gacha's palette, whose Mediterranean rhythms evoke the Balearic '80s at their most relaxed.) Over the course of its relatively brief nine tracks, Send Two Sunsets oscillates between low-key house (""Street Talk""), bubbling ambient (""Blue Distance""), and meditative pop (""Send Two Sunsets""), but all share similarly aquatic presets. Album opener ""Abandoned City"" falls into the first category, with New Age arpeggios and no percussive elements to speak of. It's a sound that brings to mind Jürgen Müller's Science of the Sea, an album that had originally been marketed as a rediscovered record from the early '80s only to be revealed later to be a modern production. Here, there's a similar feeling of productions that have been submerged and forgotten only to be unearthed decades later. ""Waterfall"", a gorgeous track that also features Beridze, shimmers like refracted sunlight. Then there's ""Let Me Love You"", an amalgam of deep house and deconstructed R&B that sets indistinct vocals amidst piano and understated percussion; repeat listens reveal a track not only exceedingly pretty, but disarmingly soulful. More often than not, Sunsets continues to reveal new facets the more time you spend with it, the familiar giving way to deeper emotional undercurrents just below the surface.","Gacha Bakradze, an electronic producer who hails from Tbilisi, Georgia and splits his time between Paris and his native city, isn't interested in carving out a signature, cutting-edge sound.

Life of a Hot Boy 2: Real Trapper,Bankroll Fresh,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929addb9d034d5c69bf4431/1:1/w_160/58377f6a.jpg,2015-05-14 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20499-life-of-a-hot-boy-2-real-trapper/,self-released,"Bankroll Fresh was once known as Yung Fresh, and appeared alongside Mr. Perfect-era Gucci Mane on a small handful of records. Now, with a minor hit in 2014's Cash Money-referencing ""Hot Boy"", a Mike WiLL Made It cosign, and Instagram shout-outs from Drake and, uh, Marilyn Manson, he is Bankroll Fresh, one of several young ATLiens making a move for his city's street rap center. Perhaps because of his older pedigree, the rapper's style doesn't owe Gucci as much of a stylistic debt as others in the current Atlanta rookie class. This is his substantial advantage: at a time when most emulate a series of now-conventional flows, Bankroll seems intent on scratching out his own fresh rhythmic pathways, discovering his own pocket in the groove. (""Free Wop Freestyle (Free Gucci)"" is the exception that proves the rule.) Bankroll's vocal tone doesn't have the same effortless panache and character of Gucci's own; in some ways he seems downright regular. But Gucci's influence looms so large in Atlanta street rap that this is a refreshing strategy, exhibiting an inner artistic confidence. Externally, though, Life of a Hot Boy 2: Real Trapper is a spare, skeletal record, more a model on which to build possible futures than a real destination. The album is least imaginative in its opening moments, which feel like an overt attempt to recapture the spirit of Trap or Die/Thug Motivation-era Jeezy, with producer D.Rich emulating the sheet metal symphonies of Shawty Redd. But the bulk of the tape sticks to Bankroll's core sound, an unwavering flatline on a black-and-white canvas, dominated by locked-in, often against-the-beat flows (""Thats Whats Goin On"") that emphasize repetition with the deliberate percussiveness of a typewriter. Thus far none of his records have replicated the success of his last tape's big single ""Hot Boy"", and none here seem poised to do so either. But even that record felt like something of an uphill hit, its chorus successful mainly through bludgeoning repetition. The effect of this dry, minimal approach to trap music is going to limit this tape's audience from the jump: to enjoy this record, you've got to really love the bare-bones particulars of street music, distilled not so much in the service of therapeutic aggression—as it was for Flockaveli—but as a kind of audience GPS. To put it bluntly, the album's subject matter doesn't extend too far beyond that of Gucci's ""My Kitchen"". Here, it suggests, is Atlanta's missing piece, at a time when eccentric ATLiens like Young Thug, Future, and Rich Homie Quan experiment with different textural palettes and shades of emotion. Bankroll, by contrast, hasn't fleshed out his world much yet, leaving these songs as line-drawings of the dope dealer day-to-day over three-note piano loops. Not that there aren't inspired moments, particularly in the tape's second half. The Zaytoven-produced ""Ten"" features some tongue-twisting lyrics (""Livin like the mob, fly to Vegas just to ditch ya/ Dom Perignon sipper, cigar-clipper, Vuitton slippers""). The buzzing King Cee O-produced ""360"", much like his ""Screen Door"" collaboration with Mike WiLL on the latter's Ransom, suggests the rapper's style works best with some driving momentum behind him. The tape's best song overall is the D.Rich-produced ""Fabulous"". With brushed snares that sound lifted from former No Limit producer KLC, quivering synthesizers borrowed from Gucci Mane's Fat Boi-produced ""Haunted House"", and a piano loop that suggests the atmosphere of 2Pac's DeVante Swing-produced ""No More Pain"", the song is at once several sounds and none—less a costume than a creation. The stripped-down sound of the record makes Bankroll easily adaptable to different styles—the album's closer is a Zaytoven version of Master P's ""I'm Bout It, Bout It""—without committing too completely to anything, and his facility for off-center flows is impressive. But he also stands in the shadow of more audacious experiments that have hit hip-hop in recent years: Big Sean, of course, has been doing the against-the-groove rap style for some time. But he's the tip of the iceberg in Detroit, where artists like Pablo Skywalkin and Yae Yae Jordan experiment radically while keeping the street approach at the forefront. In the drill scene, Keef has incorporated melody into his songs while virtually uncoupling himself from the rhythmic grid, and King Louie experimented with repeating flow patterns (and even recorded his own similar Gucci flow tribute back in 2009). Atlanta is a hotbed of hip-hop talent, it's true, but that's also a marketing cliche. Now that its singular space within hip-hop has been so well-established over the past two decades, each new artist arrives with the pressure of its city's proven track record behind it as decorative momentum. Only today, Atlanta faces new challengers, and artists like Bankroll don't have as clear a lane as they once did. This isn't to suggest Bankroll Fresh isn't an original voice. But just being from Atlanta may no longer guarantee you the biggest footprint, and Life of a Hot Boy 2 doesn’t make much of one by itself.","Bankroll Fresh, who had a minor hit with last year's ""Hot Boy"", is one of several young Atlanta artists making a move for his city's street rap center. Life of A Hot Boy 2 is a spare, skeletal record, suggesting an inner confidence.

Rivington Não Rio / Forsyth Gardens EP,Prefuse 73,by: Ron Hart,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad70ea9e61561daa60ee/1:1/w_160/78bbfdd0.jpg,2015-05-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20415-rivington-nao-rio-forsyth-gardens-ep/,Temporary Residence,"The beats Guillermo Scott Herren has been constructing as Prefuse 73 for 15 years resemble the work of a master graphic designer. The way a skilled Adobe Creative Suite architect takes old, obscure fonts and images and re-appropriates them against a backdrop of razor-sharp typesetting and wide-open white space is retro-futurist art of the highest order, and it is similar to the way the Miami-born, Atlanta-bred producer builds his beats from fragments of voices, instruments and found sounds reprocessed through his MPC. And while he got his start in the experimental/post-rock realm under his Delarosa and Asora and Savath y Savalas monikers, it was Prefuse 73 that exhibited Herren's true skill set as a producer and composer. His grooves were not so much chopped up and flipped, in the DJ Premier sense, as they were shattered like an antique plate, only to be reassembled with the delicacy of a day-camp craft project. His debut under the Prefuse handle, 2001's Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, harnessed the energy of Radiohead's Kid A and planted its formula smack in the middle of a white-hot hip-hop New York City underground, in the midst of Def Jux's heyday. It also gave Herren's label at the time, Warp Records, the credibility it so desperately sought out upon moving their offices to New York City: In the years that followed, Warp would come to depend on Herren's uncanny knowledge and talent as a de facto A&R guy to help the label transcend its rep as a purely IDM imprint by introducing them to some of their most popular acts, including Anti-Pop Consortium, Battles, and a young DJ out of Los Angeles by the name Flying Lotus. Here in 2015, FlyLo is one of the biggest names in abstract hip-hop. Meanwhile, the man born Steven Ellison and the curated roster of acolytes on his own boutique label—Brainfeeder Records—are inspiring a whole new generation of DJs and beat junkies to smash their preconceptions of rhythm and piece it back together as they like. For Warp, Flying Lotus has become an event artist on par with Boards of Canada and Aphex Twin. Meanwhile, the man who brought the kid to the party found himself dropped from his longtime label. In 2013, he launched his own micro imprint Yellow Year, yet couldn't sustain the funding to keep the hustle going. Now, fully empowered by a new deal with Temporary Residence, Ltd., who picked him up on the good word of pals Kieran Hebden and Nigel Godrich, Herren reboots the Prefuse brand for the first time since 2011's dicey The Only She Chapters with not one but three new titles. Some have criticized Herren in recent years for falling too deep into the chasm of his own wild ambitions, exploring his Catalina heritage with Savath and losing the plot of Prefuse on such lackluster fare as 2007's Preparations and 2009's Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian. With this past April's Forsyth Gardens and new full-length Rivington Não Rio, Herren returns to the essence of what made works like Uprock, The 92 vs. 02 Collection and One Word Extinguisher such essential sonic backdrops for walks along the chain-linked fences of shady, grass-patched lots in pre-""Girls"" Williamsburg. Following the meh response to his Warp swan song, it seems like Herren has reckoned that the human voice works best for his beats when it is diced into a million fragments, and he juggles the oohs and aahs of random vocalists on Forsyth highlights like ""Genderations"", ""Still Pretending"" and ""Sará Teflón"" with the same deftness he showed to Erykah Badu back on Uprock in 2001. Elsewhere, his ties to the old Chicago indie Hefty Records can be heard in the Tortoise-esque sway of such heady LP jams from as ""Applauded Assumptions"" and ""Jacinto Lyric Range"". ""Mojav Mating Call"" is the closest you will ever hear to an aesthetic compound of Prefuse, Delarosa, and Savath yet, as if he is utilizing Rivington's penultimate track to fuse them all together permanently. Meanwhile, Herren's multi-dimensional ear remains firmly affixed to what's hot with the limited guest list space made available for these works, Rivington in particular. ""Infared"" is featured on both Forsyth and Rivington, and is enhanced by the stoned soul wobble of Sam Dew, formerly of the severely slept-on Atlanta art-rock outfit Cloudeater. Former Savath associate Roberto Carlos Lange of Helado Negro fame helps Herren dive back into the science of their old outfit's sole Stones Throw LP, 2009's La Llama on ""See More Than Just Stars"", and flexes his newfound affiliation with Temporary Residence by recruiting Rob Crow on ""Quiet One"", a mellow synthpop gem that's more Pet Shop Boys than Pinback. The supreme assist happens on ""140 Jabs Interlude"", which features the criminally, perennially overlooked Busdriver and his longtime associate Milo, who uses his ""middle finger to smear shit on far-fetched idols."" The relationship between Prefuse 73 and Temporary Residence has certainly inspired the producer to peel off his best work in well over a decade, while proving exactly how well he will fit beside the likes of old pals from the Books Zammuto and Paul de Jong, William Basinski, Grails, and Rachel Grimes on one of the best label stables going right now. But ultimately, what Forsyth Gardens, Rivington Não Rio and the upcoming trilogy finale, the more ominously hued Every Color of Darkness EP, accomplish is to provide a memento on where all the long division that factors into today's beloved L.A. beat science originates. And not to take anything away from FlyLo, the Brainfeeder squad, or their advances in bringing the fusion of jazz and hip-hop to its most progressive and organic period in years, but it is rewarding to have Herren's voice at the table again, to remind the world where a sizeable chunk of this sound derived.","Newly signed to Temporary Residence, Guillermo Scott Herren reboots the Prefuse 73 name with a series of EPs which constitute his best work in well over a decade.

Frozen Niagara Falls,Prurient,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adaf5e6ef95969321b0a/1:1/w_160/688e19d4.jpg,2015-05-14 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20463-prurient-frozen-niagara-falls/,Profound Lore,"Prurient, the main guise of Dominick Fernow, peels back the grislier aspects of the human condition within the boundaries of noise music. He doesn't just talk about desire and hate and pushing oneself in his music, he soaks those very feelings into his works. Within his massive discography, littered with limited-release tapes that can be frustrating to any would-be collector, are his ""statement"" records, which often introduce new elements that advance his artistic growth. Among these are 2006's Pleasure Ground, where his talents for rhythm really started to bloom, 2011's Bermuda Drain, his blackened new wave masterpiece*,* and 2013's Through The Window, where he nearly ditched noise for unknown-hours techno. Frozen Niagara Falls, Fernow's latest double album, is definitely one of his ""statement records,"" and it brings back much of the harsh noise that faded away from his more recent works, but it's neither a ""return to form"" nor a retreat into his early career. With Niagara, he's taken strengths from his entire oeuvre to reach deeper into himself and produce what may be his best record yet, one that brings all the fulfillment of noise and transcends them all the same. Fernow's moved back to New York from L.A., where he was briefly a member of Cold Cave, and Niagara cements that return. There's none of the techno of Window or any traces of his European adventures following his side project Vatican Shadow's frequent touring there, and only some of Bermuda's bizzaro synth-pop. There are no remaining traces of Fernow the underground playboy posting swanky selfies on OkCupid; on Niagara, he is once again the man standing shirtless outside in the New York winter. The closest to anything resembling Bermuda is ""Every Relationship Earthrise"", which would make for excellent darkwave if the hiccuping beat would hold still. Fernow takes the tools most noise artists use as ends themselves and uses them to further narratives and enrich the compositions. Take ""Traditional Snowfall"", which starts off as a murder-romance fantasy—""I want to rip out your lower back/ And suck the air out of your lungs/ And wrap my hands around your neck/ And collapse your throat/ And squish your thorax/ And kiss you""—but turns into a rumination on the ambiguity so prevalent in modern love: ""Friends are everywhere but I'm always leaving/ Dismantling us with rumors."" (Maybe some of the club weariness of Window stuck around after all.) Fernow takes that confusion and buries it in the hisses and frantic electronics, so that it bleeds through every element of the track. Huge blasts of static and contact mic chaos come back into the fore, a passionate and turbulent dance between beauty and ugliness. To work with contrasts like that, on that deep a composition, is a rarity in noise. It may seem weird that Prurient would have ""hits"" or ""fan favorites,"" but they do exist. Fernow designed Niagara to be sprawling and cohesive, and there are multiple competing candidates for new ones here, across the spectrum. The first would probably be ""Dragonflies to Sew You Up"", with percussion that resemble Godflesh's drum machine becoming sentient and suffering a panic attack. Beneath the barrage, blue synthesizers and pianos chime, barely surviving the mortar-fire of the percussion. In the lyrics, Fernow flips the script on how lust is portrayed in noise—it's far from the simplistic objectification that comes too often with big, burly loud music. There's a conflicted pain when he screams, ""IN AUGUST/ YOU'RE OVERDRESSED/ PLYWOOD BROKEN/ UP ON IMPACT."" A line like ""I promise I will only fuck prostitutes"" may seem comical on paper, but add in the context of Fernow's vocal performance, and it's clear he takes no pleasure from yelling such a thing. Fernow's synths sound both lusher and icier than they did on Drain, thanks to producer Arthur Rizk, known for his work on Power Trip's Manifest Decimation, Inquisition's Obscure Verses for the Multiverse, and other notable recent metal and hardcore records. Fernow has pushed the limits of what lo-fi can do—Pleasure in particular is a testament to the beauty of buried synths—but with his grander ambitions, he needed a bigger sound, and Rizk's contributions are so invaluable he may as well be Prurient's second member. Niagara is Prurient's most developed record, not just for its length, but the attention to detail that Rizk provides. Fernow's original intent for Niagara was to source all of the material acoustically, with no electronics at all. That would have been radical, even for him. Still, upon first listen, it is jarring to hear acoustic guitars, provided by Rizk and Fernow, in the beginning of ""Greenpoint"", Niagara's peak New York song. From there, it descends into throbs of darkness, but that's only part of the point of the song. While ""Greenpoint"" is about someone Fernow knew, when I read the lyrics my mind went to Oliver Sacks' New Yorker essay on monologist Spalding Gray's descent into irreversible depression that led to his suicide in 2004. Gray's thoughts of suicide always centered around drowning and his mother, whose own suicide figured heavily into his work, and it's eerie that ""The East River isn't romantic anymore you know/ That's where the suicides go/ Or maybe that's what you want in the end/ To be mixed together and reunited with your mother"" are almost as if they were about him. It's specific yet flexible, adding another layer of complexity as only Fernow can. Like ""Greenpoint"", closer ""Christ Among the Broken Glass"" shows a side of Prurient that is sometimes overlooked: poignancy. It's also the closest thing to Fernow's original vision for Niagara, which makes it an even more appropriate ending. The sound of fire combines with the guitars, evoking a séance more than a campfire. Like ""I Understand You"", the closing track from JK Flesh and Prurient's Worship Is the Cleansing of the Imagination where fragile glimmers of serenity are eaten without mercy by squalling feedback, ""Christ"" reveals itself slowly. Niagara was recorded ""in the spirit of homelessness,"" and Fernow's lyrics in ""Christ"" capture how winter brutalizes the homeless and how self-sacrifice can make one appear messianic, especially when that figure is among the afflicted themselves. The man, ""Jesus of cities,"" becomes both more noble and more destitute with every verse—""Cobbling together syllables/ Over a frostbitten tongue/ Trying to remember the prayers""—though this isn't about pity, but about reality. Fernow's hushed vocals don't even come in until close to the end of the song, and they make his silent stalker tone on Window sound pronounced in comparison. Who knew that one of the least noisy Prurient songs would strike the deepest? A double noise album is a lot to take in, and Prurient's never been about accessibility. He's also not about acceptable signifiers; he's bigger than noise. He offers an endless, probing self-exploration that simply isn't found in noise, metal, hardcore, power electronics, whatever harsh music you can think of. In that regard, Niagara is a landmark not just in Prurient's discography, but within extreme music. His few utterances in ""Falling Mask"" sum up the experience of the album, and of his body of work: ""What we do/ We invite pain/ It's ok to be hungry/ Hunger is normal/ I'll meet you there."" He knows Prurient isn't for everybody, and that's part of the appeal, but if you're not going to invite growth and reveal yourself, why bother?","With Frozen Niagara Falls, Dominick Fernow has taken strengths from his entire oeuvre to reach deeper into himself and produce what may be his best record yet, one that brings all the fulfillment of noise and transcends them all the same.

Danger in the Club,Palma Violets,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad7bea9e61561daa60ff/1:1/w_160/c19eb3dd.jpg,2015-05-13 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20423-danger-in-the-club/,Rough Trade,"What is it with trad British indie-rock bands actively selling themselves short at the moment? Vaccines frontman Justin Young has said of their forthcoming third album, ""We wanted to make something that sounds amazing next year and then terrible in 10 years."" And here's Palma Violets' co-frontman Sam Fryer: ""There's no producer in the world who could make us sound professional."" At least Catfish & the Bottlemen reach for the sky (or Glastonbury's main stage) as they're scraping the barrel. Perhaps it's a symptom of having been the barometer/straw men of the Great British Music Press Hype Machine (the sheer fact of which seems to prime the nation's indie bands for America's contempt): retreat before you get replaced. Reviews of Palma Violets' 2013 debut, 180, lambasted fickle British music magazines for telling teenagers that the all-male London four-piece were the next big thing (what a crime), while conceding that the record's punch-drunk mix of Gun Club swagger and the Clash's more jovial insurrection was actually alright. On Danger in the Club, Palma Violets have willfully regressed, from punk to pub-rock—or ""pre-punk"", as they've been calling it. Spearheaded by Dr. Feelgood, Brinsley Schwarz, and Eddie and the Hot Rods, pub rock was a reaction against prog, glam, and bands ascending to theater venues that priced out their early supporters. The genre was quickly trumped by punk proper, and doesn't have a lot of cachet today. Palma Violets have talked about briefly hating each other by the end of the tour for their debut album, and having no ideas for their second as recently as midway through 2014. 180 wasn't original, but it had energy and high stakes on its side: its youthful relationships were either world-beating or the end of the world, and the nonsensical titles/lyrics (""Johnny Bagga' Donuts"", ""Chicken Dippers"") hinted at a wealth of winking in-jokes between besotted friends. The band members are only now in their very early 20s, but the mood on Danger in the Club is misanthropic, tired of life and home and girls. ""I would rather die than be in love"", the band's other vocalist, Chilli Jesson, sings on ""Coming Over To My Place"", a dissolute memory of the melody to the Cure's ""Friday I'm in Love"". With the help of a supporting gang, he sings the line over and over, in a state of forced triumphant collapse that just seems sad. Danger in the Club is beset by a powerful sense of dread, but there's little effort in Palma Violets' performance, despite their claims that producer John Leckie drilled them to extremes. (It's worth remembering that after an uninspired debut, he helped tease The Bends out of an equally mixed-up young Radiohead, who came to him, as Palmas did, for his work on Magazine's 1978 album, Real Life.) They wanted to retain the quality of their early demos, but the boggy result lacks the debut's clarity. The bottom end bludgeons and their surf guitars are sloppy, the band playing like drunken British seaside pier entertainers reduced to grabbing from their '00s forebears. Interpol's self-pitying specter looms on the dismal ambience of ""No Money Honey"" and the moronic, Byronic ""Matador"". ""Secrets of America"" rips off the returning Libertines' shambolic rockers without any of their heart, and ""The Jacket Song"" sounds conspicuously like Doherty and co's lovely ballad ""Radio America"". For their many faults, the Libertines, Palmas' Rough Trade forebears, had astute things to say about British class and society. The main lyrical takeaway from Danger in the Club is that Jesson and Fryer are dreadful poets, attempting to pass off misery as depth and exhibiting a noxious distaste for the women that have left them, or deigned to try and love them. The record opens with an iPhone recording of the owners of the Welsh studio they recorded in singing ""Sweet Violets"", a comic traditional about how women are only interested in a man's money. Where the Palmas mythologized girls on 180, here they're a nuisance or wearying source of pain at best, slappers (the title track) at worst, something to be stepped on to feel better. ""We'll probably burn out and fail"", Fryer and Jesson sing on ""Girl, You Couldn't Do Much Better on the Beach"". ""Well, at least I was a marvelous failure/ You'll be like the rest… a nonsensical benign success!"" In a recent NME feature that gauged political feeling among bands in the run-up to the UK general election, Jesson, said that Palma Violets had ""tried to consciously not be political"" on their second album. (It's hard to believe they tried much at all.) ""Everything is so fucking politically correct at the moment that if you say something out of line it's almost like you're trying to provoke something,"" he said, risibly. A charitable perspective might see the band's embrace of pub rock as a conscious rejection of political correctness in the form of so-called good taste; the reality is that it seems like a last-ditch attempt to aestheticize a sublime lack of inspiration.","The members of Palma Violets are only now in their very early 20s, but where their debut had high stakes and energy, the mood on Danger in the Club is misanthropic, tired of life and home and girls. Produced by John Leckie, of Radiohead's The Bends, the album aims to capture the rough energy of their demos.

Hud Dreems,Knxwledge,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adebb1335d7bf1699cb0/1:1/w_160/728cea4f.jpg,2015-05-13 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20510-hud-dreems/,Stones Throw,"Toward the middle of Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, on one of its best songs, ""Momma"", there's a woozy funk groove produced by Glen Boothe, who records under the name Knxwledge. The beat first appeared on Boothe’s relevnt.b/sde_LP, but its re-emergence on Butterfly is the biggest look of his already prolific career. Boothe’s Bandcamp page boasts more than 60 projects—""light work"" by his standards—each one made of deconstructed soul samples and thumping drums. While it’s probably too easy to compare Boothe with hip-hop producers J Dilla and Madlib, the similarities are glaring: Dilla’s voice is heard throughout Boothe’s new album, Hud Dreems; the music is wonky and off-kilter, much like Madlib’s output, though Boothe’s version is more organized. The man himself is quiet and reserved. While he rarely gives interviews, in April, he told Passion of the Weiss that he grew up in church and recorded sermons as a child. ""I was trying to grab everything I could grab, you know?"" Boothe said. ""For the most part, I was grabbing oldies on the radio when I couldn’t be at home. And when I wasn’t home, I would leave that shit recording, like when I had to go to church or something. Just leave that going so when I come back I have something to chop."" So, in a way, Boothe’s been perfecting his craft since childhood. That quote explains the scenic aspects of the producer’s music, and why he opts for dusty field recordings in lieu of modern-day gloss. Boothe is an old soul. Given his work thus far, it’s clear he’s in it for the long haul. Boothe isn’t here to blow up from one song; he’s looking to build a lasting legacy one beat at a time. Hud Dreems is a 26-track collection of short-bursting vignettes and random vocal clips. It’s constructed as a beat tape largely devoid of standout songs, an efficient suite of head-nodding instrumentals keeping an upbeat pace. Many of these tracks barely pass the one-minute mark. They’re sequenced without breaks for a seamless listening experience. Given Butterfly’s success, Hud Dreems presents Boothe to a bigger audience, though the sounds contained here are typical for the Los Angeles resident. Boothe takes seemingly disparate sounds and blends them into wobbly, Cali-infused compositions. He pulls largely familiar tones—a well-known song or identifiable voice, for example—and remixes them into off-kilter melodies. That approach makes the music feel accessible, even if the time signatures are clearly out of whack. Across several releases, Boothe has flipped countless musicians—Biggie, Camp Lo, and D’Angelo, among others—into his own mix of cosmic soul. The same goes for Hud Dreems: On ""jstowee"", we hear Erykah Badu coo softly amongst the track’s stampeding bluster. There are two unmistakable Nas clips—one on ""letuleave.[geekdop]"" that borrows the intro of the rapper’s ""Money Is My Bitch"", the other on ""faraway"" that samples a Nas dialogue from 1998 movie Belly. Havoc (of Mobb Deep) drifts easily, his sampled line from ""Win or Lose"" working as an indirect mission statement for Boothe: ""My destination’s the top of the world."" By definition, Hud Dreems is an instrumental release, yet the producer skillfully arranges these verbal fragments to liven the procession. In doing so, the album breezes through golden-era rap and R&B while remaining very much in the now. It properly showcases Boothe’s wide-ranging sonic palate and offers a hearty glimpse into musical yesteryear. As a result, Hud Dreems feels remarkably nostalgic. It’s a fully realized effort, bridging a gap between older and younger listeners, and serving as a nice starting point for new Knxwledge consumers. If Kendrick brought you here, Hud Dreems will make you stay for a while.","Following his appearance on Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly, Los Angeles producer Knxwledge returns with a robust collection of dusty soul samples and trunk rattling beats. Hud Dreems is a 26-track collection of short-bursting vignettes sequenced without breaks for a seamless listening experience.

Dumb Flesh,Blanck Mass,by: Nathan Reese,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adaac0084474cd0c1771/1:1/w_160/6431a144.jpg,2015-05-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20459-dumb-flesh/,Sacred Bones,"Since 2008's Street Horrrsing, Fuck Buttons has served to sublimate the noise genre into something that fans with lower tolerances for extreme music might enjoy. From the band's unlikely (but fittingly epic) use in the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, to its status as festival mainstays, Fuck Buttons have brought music of the most punishing variety to an unusual level of popularity. If ""pop"" is what's popular, then Fuck Buttons fit the bill by definition, but no other act of their level can claim to scorch audiences with Fisher-Price-processed screams, only to rocket into a stratosphere of major-key bliss. For every club-leaning detour (""Prince's Prize"") or humanist anthem (""Olympians""), there's a relentless ""Brainfreeze"" to remind us that the band is as unruly as ever. The same can be said for the duo's solo ventures. Though Dumb Flesh is the second full-length LP from Blanck Mass, the stage name used by Benjamin John Power, it's been four years since his self-titled debut and three since his ""White Math / Polymorph"" single. In that time Fuck Buttons also released Slow Focus, their biggest-sounding record to date, and Andrew Hung, who records under his given name, dropped the retro-bizarro weirdness that was the Rave Cave EP. (Sure, Beck plays a Game Boy on stage, but who can say they made an entire album on one?) Dumb Flesh is an often-fascinating document of Power's evolving tastes over that time period, as well as a departure from his murky first album. While Blanck Mass often featured glacial build-ups and monotonous loops, Dumb Flesh is filled with handclaps, 808s and is-that-human-or-what? vocal samples. But for a record whose cover art is pinkish folds of human biomass, much of Dumb Flesh is actually pretty darn accessible. It also serves as occasional proof that Power is amenable to the idea that people might actually want to, like, dance to his music. As the title and cover art suggest, Dumb Flesh is an album about the fragility of the human body, one that uses sonic degeneration as a metaphor for the biological kind. Opener ""Loam"" is a sound-collage of groaning vocals enmeshed with reversed tape hiss, while a mid-tempo chillout cut with squelching synths and a head-bobbing beat is called ""Atrophies"". Across the record, Power uses sounds that meld into each other fluidly, an ouroboros of cyclical synths where you don't know where one loop begins and another ends. Fuck Buttons solo projects often give the chance to spot individual seams in what usually appears as a singular, monolithic endeavor, but Dumb Flesh could be mistaken for the latest Fuck Buttons album, albeit one looser and less cohesive than usual. The themes may be dark, but the songs often contain the ecstatic blissfulness of the band's best and most transcendental beauty. ""Cruel Sport"", a name that echoes Fuck Buttons' enormous-sounding second album, for instance, starts with a driving beat similar to ""Olympians"", but just before the five-minute mark the synths clatter and collapse into a squiggling pile—a breakdown in the literal and metaphorical sense. The shift plays like a commentary on Power's past; rather than achieving total liftoff, Power proves he can still take us all the way there and then deliberately doesn't. While ""Cruel Sport"" works, sometimes the less intense tracks don't quite land; ""Lung"" is a low-key track that sounds like you're waiting for a particularly avant-garde conference call—pleasant, but it's just not what Power does best. Largely, however, Dumb Flesh is a pleasure. Album closer and highlight ""Detritus"" has multiple movements and features Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe of 90 Day Men on vocals. It's here that all of Power's strengths come out at once: dark noise gives way to a pounding rhythm which, in turn, melts into a tapestry of airy synths. If Dumb Flesh is about the prison of the body, ""Detritus"" is an entire life-cycle in eight minutes. Over his career, both in Fuck Buttons and as a solo artist, Power's music has been an exercise in the sweeping emotional and physical power of sound itself. Fuck Buttons may be unlikely stars, but their music's pure momentum almost guaranteed its audience by force alone. Like Power's best work, Dumb Flesh moves you when it literally moves you.","Dumb Flesh is the second LP from Benjamin John Power, one-half of Fuck Buttons.

Hairless Toys,Róisín Murphy,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adfec0084474cd0c180a/1:1/w_160/bf9cb1ab.jpg,2015-05-13 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20518-hairless-toys/,PIAS,"""I didn’t become a pop star, and nobody knows exactly why,"" said Róisín Murphy of her last full-length album, 2007’s Overpowered. In retrospect, it’s shocking everyone didn’t immediately grasp exactly why. Never mind the talk of career repositioning and the Super Glue-sticky singles and the high-fashion diva-ing—Overpowered may not have been immediate, but it was classic in its own way, and prescient. There’s no shortage of people dissecting her influence on other artists’ gonzo fashion, and many artists are now making dancefloor tracks that embrace house piano and disco tropes, even if they’d fizzle and die if held up next to ""Let Me Know"". But given the modern dance revival’s rigid stratification of artists into shrugged-away female vocalists and celebrated male producer-celebrities, perhaps it’s for the best that Murphy has shied away from trends, and with a few exceptions, mostly foregone guest spots. Indeed, Murphy’s output over the past near-decade has been wildly unpredictable, ranging from dance bangers with porno guitars (""Orally Fixated"") to an Édith Piaf-inspired EP of Italian art songs not to mention two remix EPs that might have stirred the highest of emotions on the dancefloor, if only people heard them. And Hairless Toys continues this trend. It’s the most cerebral work of Murphy’s decades-long career, and arguably the one with her most creative control yet, letting listeners closer into her head than ever yet keeping them at a distance even there. The album comes with a few preconceptions. ""Gone Fishing"" was inspired by the New York ball scene, which, coming from a white Irish woman well after ball culture returned to the mainstream, has the potential to get dicey fast. And Murphy’s rationale for the record—""I envisioned ‘Gone Fishing’ almost as a song from a Broadway musical version of [iconic documentary Paris Is Burning]""—is not so far from Madonna co-opting vogueing into a machine to make herself endless context-free royalties. But ""Gone Fishing"" is less sonic homage, more earnest expression of empathy. And if Hairless Toys takes anything from that world it’s the subtext: it’s largely an album about confronting one’s failures and anxieties and outsider feelings and mythologizing them. Sometimes others are invited in. ""Exploitation"" is nine-and-a-half minutes of circling closer and closer around one obsessive question: ""Who’s exploiting who?"" The sexual overtones are there if you’re looking for them, the sociological analogies almost make themselves: artists exploiting subjects, or vice versa. But that’s all overly serious for a track this deliberately whimsical: polyrhythms, a cartoon cliff-dive of a guitar riff after the lyric ""the depths that they will go,"" fax-machine noises—all fascinating sounds, manipulated one after the other to make you think they mean something. ""Exploitation"" is also the most traditional single on an album mostly concerned with inner pain. ""Uninvited Guest"" is more typical, describing a quite specific emotional state: the near-agoraphobic inertia—total inactivity from the outside, a deafening restless twitch on the inside—that comes of anxiety and having enough money to stay there forever: ""I could get out of my head/ Even all the money I have left, I could buy another day of nothing."" The music’s somewhere between synesthesia of the mood and a dark joke at its own expense: hi-hat tremors, backing vocals elbowing through the mix, a bridge to lose time in, a helpless shrug of a whistling line. (Murphy, like just about everyone who shares a genre and gender, has fought off Kate Bush comparisons, and continues to do so; but ""Guest"", in topic and particularly in its wry gallows humor, is much like an introvert’s ""Sat in Your Lap"".) ""Exile"" is a torch song delivered in a wearied whisper, every note heard through smoke, evoking less the dance floor than a bar that’s 2 a.m. empty. ""Unputdownable"" is a traditional Murphy extended metaphor—lover as page-turning book—with a mid-track swerve that reveals it not as a love song but something less requited, more unknowable: ""I’d open up the book and climb right up out of the town...if you’d allow me to read your mind."" (Like much of Hairless Toys, it almost seems like a comment on the record as well.) It’s heady stuff, but the album’s emotional landscape is sketched so distinctly there’s ample reason to stick with it. There’s also, three-fourths through, a musical payoff. ""House of Glass"" delivers grand statements, often set stark against the music as if underlined in fire: ""We were glass house girls in our plastic wigs and pearls""; ""People like us from broken homes never throw stones""; ""Little pieces of a broken dream""; ""Built a house of glass out of fragments from the blast."" Fittingly, it also builds up to the album’s centerpiece: the chords from ""Exploitation"", the ascending peals from ""Gone Fishing"", disco guitar licks and swarming background vocals assembled into a fragile yet stunning climax. It’s all gleaming and immaculate from a distance, sharp and shattered if you get too close.","The Irish singer's first full-length album since 2007’s Overpowered is wildly unpredictable, moving from torch songs to extended disco bangers, and the variety suits her.

Bush,Snoop Dogg,by: Julian Kimble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad8ac0084474cd0c1736/1:1/w_160/10a9e818.jpg,2015-05-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20435-bush/,Columbia,"Over the course of two decades, Snoop Dogg’s adaptability has allowed him to move from the G-funk of ""Gin and Juice"" to the sweaty club anthems of ""Down 4 My N’s"" to the reggae of Snoop Lion. His voice sounds good over all kinds of production, but some of his best late-period work has come when collaborating with the Neptunes. The success of ""Beautiful"" established Snoop, the Neptunes, and Charlie Wilson as a powerful team, and led to the Virginia producers contributing several tracks (including the chart-topping ""Drop It Like It’s Hot"") to his 2004 album, R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece. With Bush, fans who might have yearned for a Snoop album produced entirely by the Neptunes at the time (almost) get their wish: Pharrell Williams handles the boards here, with occasional assistance from his former production partner Chad Hugo. Bush was conceived as a tribute to the funk and R&B of the 1970s, and the familiar wail of Stevie Wonder’s harmonica on the stand-out opener, ""California Roll"", establishes the mood. Over an instrumental as smooth as a ride down Rodeo Drive on an 85-degree day, Snoop's croon is convincing enough to sell lines like “So if you wanna go to Melrose/ Let’s hit Adidas, girl, we got our own shell toes."" Pharrell positions L.A. as the nucleus of luxury and vice (""Baby you can be a movie star/ Get yourself a medical card, yeah/ ‘Cause that’s how California rolls"") on the sticky hook, and Wonder accents P’s trademark falsetto with background vocals. Both Snoop and Pharrell are products of the '70s, so it makes sense that they'd embrace the ambiance of the music they grew up listening to, and that they'd be pretty good at it. The mood holds from the bubbly disco of ""R U A Freak"" to the Nile Rodgers-inspired guitar work on ""Awake"", a song that brings to mind the second wind you get during a party’s final 20 minutes. On ""Peaches N Cream"", Snoop, Pharrell, and Wilson combine once again for an infectious retro-funk fusion. From start to finish, Bush is a feel-good record. Snoop has said that he tapped Pharrell for creative guidance because he wanted a cohesive sound for the album. At just 41 minutes long, Bush is indeed an easy listen, but the songs also bleed together. ""I Knew That"", for example, opens with the same motif as the one used on the superior ""Peaches N Cream"". And although the album features just 10 songs, it feels like there are only about six. Bush is designed to function as an old funk record that you can let run for an entire party’s duration, but its uniformity might make it less appealing over the long haul. Still, it makes sense for Snoop to be making this type of music at this stage of his career, as he approaches his mid-forties and rap recedes into his past. The music puts past images of him grooving to Bootsy Collins while stoned in Baby Boy or dancing to Funkadelic in The Wash in perspective—funk has long been his lifeblood. So while Bush is strong enough musically, you can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if this crew had followed R&G with a full-length a decade ago, when everyone involved was still in his prime.","With Bush, those who yearn for a Snoop album produced entirely by the Neptunes almost get their wish: Pharrell Williams handles the boards here, with occasional assistance from his former production partner Chad Hugo.

Anxiety's Kiss,Coliseum,by: Jonathan K. Dick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad6fc0084474cd0c170f/1:1/w_160/c8064f71.jpg,2015-05-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20414-coliseum-anxietys-kiss/,Deathwish,"The phrase ""grown up"" often feels like a backhanded compliment when applied to a band or its sound. It praises their current efforts by way of dismissing the steps they took to arrive at that destination. In that regard, Coliseum's progression over the course of 12 years and five full-lengths has been less an exercise in growing up and more one of ""growing in"" to a sound, one that hits its highest point on their newest album Anxiety's Kiss, which sharpens all of their musical developments into their finest point yet. The result is a pop-savvy sound that 2013's Sister Faith only hinted at. In the relatively short amount of time of the group's existence, Coliseum has made the label rounds, releasing all but two of their records on different labels. This might be a trivial observation for other bands, but it's been a continual point of distinction for the Kentucky-based three-piece, with each album moving in a pointedly different direction than its predecessor while keeping a rock-solid punk-rock ethos at their base. Beneath every shift, vocalist/guitarist and founding member Ryan Patterson barked his lyrics with absolute fervor and passion. While their punk roots remain wholly intact, the band has grown into a comfortable but still-powerful force. Much of that growth can be attributed to bassist Kayhan Vaziri and drummer Carter Wilson, both relatively recent additions to the band who have proven invaluable in fleshing out the band's sound. Paired with Wilson's straightforward, loosely executed rhythmic style, Vaziri's bass works as much melodic nuance into the songs as Patterson's guitar. Anxiety's Kiss wastes no time in announcing its intentions with the radio-ready ""We Are the Water"", a pop-punk anthem owing as much to the Replacements as it does to Fucked Up, complete with gang-vocal refrain. The post-punk-tinged followup ""Dark Light of Seduction"" chases the immediacy with a slow burning churn, and a subdued layer of electronic noise that the band has folded into their mix over the last two albums. This muted sense of nuance is what gives Coliseum's music an amorphous tendency, and while that's sometimes worked against them in the past, here it allows them to shift weightlessly from near post-rock atmospherics on the outstanding ""Dark Light of Seduction"" to blistering anthems like ""Drums & Amplifiers"", all without losing a core sense of focus. Just shy of 40 minutes, Anxiety's Kiss packs in a surprising amount of singalong hooks, and you can sense their comfort with them. They've always had these proclivities lurking in the background, and this time around they embrace them as the next logical step. For longtime followers of the band, Anxiety's Kiss has the feel of a logical endpoint, the latest natural development in an impressive career of progressions.","Over the course of 12 years and five albums, Coliseum have grown and shifted without ever abandoning their punk roots or sacrificing their power. Their latest, Anxiety's Kiss, embraces a pop-savvy sound that 2013's Sister Faith only hinted at.

New Alhambra,Elvis Depressedly,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adceb1335d7bf1699c82/1:1/w_160/c553b1ee.jpg,2015-05-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20485-new-alhambra/,Orchid TapesRun for Cover,"On the second song of Elvis Depressedly's latest LP, singer-songwriter Mat Cothran lays out a guiding principle: ""no more sad songs."" For those who've followed his recordings over the past half-decade, this could come as something of a surprise. Both under the Depressedly banner, which also includes multi-instrumentalist Delaney Mills as a permanent member, and his solo project Coma Cinema, Cothran has built an expansive discography that leans heavily toward the downcast. But this time around, Cothran hints early on that things are going to be different and they largely are. For New Alhambra, his seventh and latest release as Elvis Depressedly, he's crafted a utopian sort of indie-pop, an ecstatic evocation of the second coming, professional wrestling, and radical positivity. It's been a long journey to this point for the South Carolina-born Cothran. As a fiercely independent home-recording apologist, his efforts have always been aided—or hamstrung—by whatever half-broken equipment he could get his hands on the moment the songs started pouring out. In leaner times, this often meant that his releases were unapologetically lo-fi, a quirk of his work that cut both ways. When outlining quiet despair, the grit and grime functions as a poignant mirror for his work, but on more buoyant numbers the nuances—the comedy and uplift that he often seeks to convey—could get lost in the muddle. So to hear him proclaim, less than five minutes into his newest record, that those gloomier moments had been excised could have been cause for concern. But with the exception of Coma Cinema's 2013 Posthumous Release, recorded in Los Angeles with production help from local band TV Girl, New Alhambra is his most traditionally well-produced record. Cothran's guitars roil and collapse with a multi-dimensional shimmer and Mills' keyboard parts are given body and voice that would've been impossible on the crackly Elvis Depressedly recordings of the past. With such a solid production backline, Cothran's given room to experiment more than he ever has before. He coats vocals in idiosyncratic, nauseous chorus effects (""Ease""), scatters pitch shifted vocals throughout, and even manages to squeeze in a reversed guitar solo for good measure (""New Heaven, New Earth""). Cothran and Mills achieve a textural depth that's rare for songwriters in this lane. There's far more corners to explore than on, say, a Jackson Scott record, but they also manage not to overcomplicate things and ruin the unique magic of the brittle aesthetic. It's hard to imagine a more perfect vehicle for Cothran's wholehearted embrace of optimism. He explicitly invokes the Bible on a number of occasions throughout the record, but when he does so it's only to underline themes of rebirth. He proves that he can write with delicacy about joy and love and light just as easily as he can about Satan and burning churches. On ""N.M.S.S."", he proclaims that he ""love[s] everyone that [he has] ever known"" and he ""go[es] to sleep still believing"" in an abstract ""someday"" that might come for him. It's a plain little sentiment, but it works with what's around it. Watery guitars and plodding kick drums open up and buoy his open-hearted vocal. He's happy, if only intermittently. And unlike Pharrell's catchy, dead-eyed assertion of the same, Cothran's musical encapsulation of the feeling is even-keeled and aqueous—true to the hesitant hopefulness that can follow in the wake of overwhelming depression. But maybe that's the fleeting feeling Cothran has been trying to get at all along. He's said that those who weep while listening to his songs are doing the equivalent of ""crying [while] watching 'Looney Tunes' or something."" That sells short the fragile honesty of his work, but it speaks to the triumph of New Alhambra's overall enterprise, that such an assertion finally makes sense. For the first time, we can laugh right along with him.","For Mat Cothran's seventh release as Elvis Depressedly, he's crafted a utopian sort of indie-pop record, an ecstatic evocation of the second coming, professional wrestling, and radical positivity.

Mask,Icky Blossoms,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae0613d197565213a02d/1:1/w_160/d41a5ccb.jpg,2015-05-12 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20524-mask/,Saddle Creek,"In hindsight it's clear just how much Icky Blossoms were acting on their first album. The Omaha trio's self-titled 2012 debut was beholden to the rigid, impersonal conventions of electroclash, even when it seemed as if the group's interests lay elsewhere. There were moments where the band's primary singer Sarah Bohling in particular sounded as if she longed to emote, but she restrained herself, because genre protocol dictated she remain as dispassionate as the sequenced pulses behind her. On Icky Blossoms' sophomore album Mask, Bohling recasts herself as a real, vulnerable human being. Though the band still draws from the same pool of '80s synth-pop, dance, and electro-rock, they've replaced the aura of debauched sex that hung over their first album with a sweeter, more romantic focus. That retool is underscored by the change in producers. For their debut, Icky Blossoms recruited TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, who manned the boards as if wearing surgical gloves, but on Mask they partner with a collaborator closer to home, Saddle Creek standby Mike Mogis, a producer who isn't shy about leaving fingerprints. Mogis has some experience with electro-pop, with credits on the Faint's Wet From Birth and Bright Eyes' glitchy one-off Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, but generally he doesn't do genre exercises. His specialty is albums that sound unmistakably like Saddle Creek albums—snug, vividly colored records that play as if crafted by a bunch of friends squeezing into a studio on a night off and helping each other out. Mask fits that mold, with contributions from a half dozen or so players from the usual circles, including Cursive's Patrick Newbery, who plays trumpet on a track, and the Faint's Todd Fink, who lends some additional production and earns an especially warm thank-you in the liner credits (""Your knowledge of electricity is invaluable and your dog is awesome."") At its best, Mask captures the spirit of the label's heyday records. With its squealing guitars and manic tempo, ""Phantasmagoria"" channels the vicious side of the Faint's miswired electro-punk, while the record's catchiest single, ""Living in Fiction"", elbows its way toward one of those generous, jubilant choruses that used to leap so effortlessly off of Bright Eyes albums. And Bohling even sounds like a typical Saddle Creek protagonist now. She sings opener ""In Folds"" as a prolonged sigh, her voice quivering with echoes of Conor Oberst and Jenny Lewis. Mask's songs often place her in the same position those label luminaries used to write from, unable to shake the traumas of past relationships and unsure of her ability to secure future ones. ""I get so trapped in my head sometimes I turn what I love into a monster,"" she laments on ""The Spiral"". Though it lacks the sparkle of some of the album's snappier electro-pop numbers, one of Mask's most lasting songs is also its most naked. On ""Want You So Bad"", the band dials down the synths to a murmur, accentuating Bohling's loneliness with some barren guitar strums as she pines for a lost love. ""I let go for you,"" she sings, ""Forever I've been waiting now."" It's a decidedly un-showy track for a band that usually prefers very showy sounds, and it probably would have brought the band's chic debut album to a halt. But it slots in comfortably on Mask, a follow-up that finds Icky Blossoms letting their guard down and embracing the values of their music scene, where there's no higher form of fashion than wearing your heart on your sleeve.","The Omaha trio's self-titled 2012 debut was beholden to the rigid, impersonal conventions of electroclash, but they've replaced the aura of debauched sex that hung over their first album with a sweeter, more romantic focus on Mask.

The Hydrangeas Whisper,Boof,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae489d034d5c69bf44f6/1:1/w_160/49b4608b.jpg,2015-05-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20579-the-hydrangeas-whisper/,Running BackBubbleTease Communications,"Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’ ""Uptown Funk"" just spent fourteen consecutive weeks atop the US Billboard charts.  Two years ago, Daft Punk’s ""Get Lucky"" topped the charts in 30 countries and became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time, its parent album Random Access Memories taking home the Grammy for Record of the Year. Which is to say, there’s a mint to be had in mining the sound of early '80s R&B, boogie, and electro-funk right now, whether you take your cues from the Gap Band or Chic, Morris Day and the Time’s ""Jungle Love"" or Thriller. By such a metric, Baltimore-born, Sheffield-based producer and house-music veteran Maurice Fulton should be a multi-platinum artist and in-demand producer for big artists. But in reality, Fulton remains a hard-to-pin figure in the deep house underground, avoiding big festival stages, dropping album-length releases without notice and eschewing publicity, media and interview requests. Two-plus decades into his music-making career, he does whatever he damned well pleases. The past three years have seen Fulton release an album under the guise of a Finnish jazz trio Syclops, a set of tough house productions to back a powerful Swahili singer Mim Suleiman, a sensuous remix of Rhye, a twisted EP with Japanese icon DJ Nori, and a third album from Fulton with his wife Mu (under her full name Mutsumi). Almost all of them were quick blips on the dance music landscape, some of them released only digitally via his BubbleTease Communications label. Two months ago, one of Fulton’s many guises, Boof (a project which seems preoccupied with flowers of all varieties), appeared seemingly overnight with the release of The Hydrangeas Whisper. This one gets a physical release this week courtesy of Running Back, giving fans a slightly more tenable grasp on one of dance music’s most elusive figures. Like a bumblebee in a botanical garden, Boof finds Fulton alighting on many different sounds, never quite settling into any one. In the past, Boof reveled in Fulton’s jazz side, and this album is no different. ""Intro to It's Sunny S Outside"" sounds like it borrowed the drum machine from George McRae’s ""Rock Your Baby"" and added a George Benson guitar figure, resulting in a swirling Balearic number. Then Fulton does his one-man ""Get Lucky"" robot band on ""Birgit Boogie"", a grid of go-go bells, hand drums and closed hi-hats. Nagging clean guitar upstrokes and champagne-bubble synths give the track an airiness that counterbalances the fat, wobbling bassline underneath. ""Just on the Swings"" imagines Nile Rodgers’ guitar lines atop a SAM Records’ groove before stomping on the overdrive and flange pedal. But from there, Fulton becomes a bit restless. The title track recreates the sort of inert, hissing ambience of Wolfgang Voigt’s GAS project, and the suspended synth chords of ""Cat Soulcat Strut"", sounds like an imagined sweet spot between the Gap Band’s 1984 hit ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me"" and Arthur Russell’s ""Go Bang #5"". The album veers into clanging metallic minimal techno accompanied by furious Cuban hand drums, to arcade blips dumped into a '90s house track, to a swing number on ""Emi's M"" not unlike a robot jazz ensemble tackling ""Take Five"". These jumps might derail another album, but as is always the case with Fulton’s productions, he has a singular talent for making the most idiosyncratic and random of sounds seem natural.","By all rights, Baltimore-born, Sheffield-based producer Maurice Fulton should be an in-demand producer for big artists, bringing vintage house and electro to the charts. But he remains an elusive presence, and on his latest release under his Boof moniker, he displays his singular talent for making the most idiosyncratic and random of sounds seem natural.

HIVE1,Tyondai Braxton,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adaec0084474cd0c1778/1:1/w_160/b14d2ee3.jpg,2015-05-12 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20462-hive1/,Nonesuch,"In recent years, we've seen plenty of indie-world talents—like St. Vincent's Annie Clark, the National's Bryce Dessner, and Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood—crossing over into the realm of contemporary classical music. (Dessner and Arcade Fire instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry are even working on a collaborative piece for the New York Philharmonic, to be played late in 2015.) But how many of these hybrid-genre composer-performers have actually thrown over the alt-career entirely, in order to make notated music an essentially full-time creative pursuit? Tyondai Braxton is the lone brave soul in that regard, going back to his triumphant solo album Central Market—a ripping and riff-heavy collaboration with the Wordless Music Orchestra, released on Warp Records in 2009 (while he was still a member of Battles). At the time, the record signaled Braxton's growing restlessness inside the math-rock and indie scenes. Since that statement of purpose, though, his discography has grown at noticeably gradual pace. He wrote a short piece for an avant-garde marching band (""Pulse March""), contributed a track to a Philip Glass remix album (and collaborated onstage with the legendary composer), while occasionally playing a variety of glitzy gigs (often involving improvisation) in and around Brooklyn. The highest-profile of these performances was the 2013 debut, at the Guggenheim Museum, of Braxton's HIVE project: a multimedia extravaganza described in promotional materials as ""part architectural installation and part ensemble performance with five musicians sitting cross-legged atop their own space-age oval pods."" In more down-to-earth terms, Braxton had conceived of a percussion-meets-electronic music piece. After some positive live reviews—and additional performances in other locations—the Nonesuch label has now released a 42-minute version of the work, titled HIVE1, which was recorded over a two-year span. I didn't catch the live iteration, and so can't speak to its success as a multimedia affair—but as a home-listening experience, HIVE1 is intriguing, fitfully exciting, and also sometimes a letdown. In combining an evident love for the percussion works of 20th-century modernist composers like Edgard Varèse with his own prodigious beat-making skills, Braxton has created an eight-movement suite that sounds not terribly different from what you'd get if you built a playlist in which Karlheinz Stockhausen's ""Zyklus"" bumps up against Vision Creation Newsun-era Boredoms remixes by Yamantaka Eye. Sufficiently avant, to be sure, but also a little ragged at its edges. ""Gracka"" kicks things off with a promising arpeggiated digital riff, before hand-clappy syncopations join in, halfway through the three-minute running time. Later, a brief, stereo-panned chordal vista hints at some grand, possibly-orchestral designs—right before the track peters out. The eight-minute ""Boids"" follows, and its disconnected swirls of percussion make for HIVE1's most aimless stretch. It's not that sparse percussive music can't hold one's interest as a general rule (as the absurdist and entertaining theatrics of composer Mauricio Kagel's music demonstrates). But on my initial HIVE1 listens, I grew impatient every time, right around here. Was this surround-sound, live-at-the-Guggenheim production not going to quite translate as a two-channel headphone-trip? Thankfully, it's on ""Studio Mariacha""—with its plush waves of digitally warbling, video-game-style exhalations—that HIVE1 takes off for real. The following number, ""Amlochey"", announces a steady groove, straight away, and features some bell-like digital timbres that carry a hint of melody, too. And the lengthy closer, ""Scout 1"", is everything you could want from this project: drum-circle bliss, grizzled low-end, oscillating counterpoint in the upper pitch registers, and a potent cluster chord that someone in the ensemble leans on a few times during the final seconds. A surprising, ecstatic triumph—and then it's all done. Overall, it's clear that HIVE1 doesn't manage to engage all of its composer's talents, despite its occasionally locked-in blend of notated percussion parts and sharp electro-production. This judgment is especially difficult to avoid given that another one-off piece of Braxton's, ""Casino Trem"", has also made its way to market on the same release date. Written for the new-classical players in the group that is (somewhat awkwardly) named the Bang on a Can All-Stars—and appearing on that group's latest album, Field Recordings—""Casino Trem"" contains some HIVE1-style beat programming, but also a post-minimalist electric guitar part that recalls the most rousing moments of Central Market. Braxton's seven-minute contribution climaxes with a rave-up section that pairs a mournful clarinet line with jaunty samples that sound like they were recorded outside a local carnival's funhouse. It's weird, dark and fun all at once. In short, it shows an exciting way forward, whereas HIVE1 can't quite shake the feeling that it was best experienced live.","Tyondai Braxton's latest solo project is an album adaptation of a multimedia extravaganza he staged at the Guggenheim in 2013. The music is an eight-movement suite of percussion and electronics that combines avant-rock influences like the Boredoms with the sounds of 20th-century modern classical composers.

Songs From Suicide Bridge,David KauffmanEric Caboor,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae339d034d5c69bf44c9/1:1/w_160/ea111c3b.jpg,2015-05-11 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20560-songs-from-suicide-bridge/,Light in the AtticLight in the Attic,"How many albums like Songs From Suicide Bridge are out there in the world? Hundreds? Thousands? Hundreds of thousands? In 1982, two aspiring singer-songwriters named David Kauffman (from Madison, N.J.) and Eric Caboor (from Burbank, Calif.) met at a venue called the Basement in Los Angeles, threw together a couple of their best tunes, pressed a couple hundred copies of a record, and then went their separate ways. Since then the only album they made under their own names has been consigned to estate sales and flea markets, waiting for subsequent generations of cratediggers to fish it out, dust it off, and find something that resonates across the decades. Private-press records such as Songs From Suicide Bridge are relics of an age of physical media, but in the digital age, it’s easier than ever to get lost works back in print. Labels like Light in the Attic, Paradise of Bachelors, Numero Group, and Delmore Recordings are doing the important work of unearthing these artifacts, even if the market seems to be increasingly saturated with reissues of the undiscovered and the uncelebrated, the obscure and the unconsidered. These reissues are as much about what might have been as they are about what actually was. What if Songs had heralded a long and prolific career instead of an obscure cratedigger treasure? What if it was the first of many albums made by Caboor and Kauffman rather than the only one? In this case, I doubt their fortunes would have changed significantly—which shouldn’t be read as an insult. Caboor and Kauffman aren’t a pair of forgotten geniuses, and this new reissue flatly rejects the notion that they could have been stars: ""Fame and fortune demanded certain qualities and it became increasingly obvious that they had none,"" writes Sam Sweet in the liner notes. And yet, that only makes these songs more powerful: As its title suggests, Songs From Suicide Bridge is about depression and despair, about the gnawing suspicion that you don’t belong in this world, and their professional frustrations only reinforced that sense of alienation. The austerity of their sound may have been a product of their limited resources—much of the album was recorded in a makeshift studio in Caboor’s backyard—but they managed to create something distinctive in its spareness, with a bit of reverb in the vocals and a crisp, at times percussive acoustic guitar sound that intensifies the songs intense isolation. Songs From Suicide Bridge doesn’t sound like a product of the hedonistic '80s. Instead, it seems to predict the dire introspection of the '90s. ""I have nothing but the end inside of me,"" Caboor sings on ""Angel of Mercy"", nearly a decade before Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana would ride similarly dark thoughts into the mainstream. As often happens with this kind of subject matter, the drama occasionally lapses into melodrama, especially on ""Life and Times on the Beach"". The song begins with Kauffman reminiscing about his childhood—playing baseball, going on family vacations—but the memories grow less sweet as he proceeds—dropping out of college, moving to L.A., getting nowhere close to realizing his dreams. As the guitars grow tenser and the pace quickens, he admits, ""What I need to end it all is right… within my reach."" You might expect to hear a gunshot or a last exhalation in the brief ellipsis, something to signal that the song and the life have ended. Instead, the music starts back up again, quiet and tentative yet offering no resolution to Kauffman’s story. It’s a startling moment, yet there’s something lurid about the way it takes you right up to that life-or-death decision and just abandons you. On the other hand, it also sounds like a pivotal passage on the album, the point to which the first side of the album has been building. The intensity of that experience lends the second side a new and necessary lightness. Caboor and Kauffman play ""Midnight Willie' as a parody of coffeehouse singers, cracking up as they compare their woes to those of a crippled hobo playing for change outside the Monterey Hotel. And closer ""One More Day (You’ll Fly Again)"" expresses something in short supply on this album: actual honest-to-God hope. Fortunately, neither Caboor nor Kauffman took his own life. Both of them did, however, sacrifice their dreams of stardom for less glamorous but more reliable work. So Songs becomes a suicide note to the music industry explaining why these two talented singer-songwriters decided to end their careers. (Eventually, they did reunite in the late 1980s for a pair of album as the Drovers.) On this would-be swan song, they managed to express these dire emotions with startling candor, eloquence, and directness, soundtracking their worst fears with furious acoustic strumming. Yet, the great discrepancy between their musical and their professional accomplishments lends Songs From Suicide Bridge a sense of gravity and impossibly high stakes, as though they knew they had only one chance to get everything right. Ultimately, the album thrives on its own obscurity, which 30 years later thrums in the background behind all that strumming.","In 1982, David Kauffman and Eric Caboor met at a venue in L.A., threw together a couple of their best tunes, pressed a couple hundred copies of a record, then went their separate ways.

Who Me?,Juan Wauters,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adc3b1335d7bf1699c63/1:1/w_160/f1148836.jpg,2015-05-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20477-who-me/,Captured Tracks,"Juan Wauters’ sweet, unvarnished folk-rock comes from a forgotten New York, between the suburbanization and white flight of the 1950s and the impoverished 1970s, when it was enough for Simon & Garfunkel to visit the Central Park Zoo on the A-side of the single and the Queensboro Bridge on the B-side, when people’s hearts were alight with hope for a new baseball club called the Mets. His second album, Who Me?, features 13 songs, all of which are less than three minutes long and several of which are less than two, played on about as many chords. Most of them are arranged for acoustic guitar, electric bass, and other things that can be rehearsed in the living room without bothering the neighbors. Simplicity here isn’t a matter of technical limitation but of philosophical stance: For Wauters, music stopped evolving when the Beatles decided mysticism was more complicated than puppy love. Wauters has always seemed breezy but never quite so meek. I first encountered him as the singer of the Beets, a bratty, separatist band whose songs were anchored by declarations so simple they sounded like Zen aphorism. (My favorite of these is still probably ""If you’re cold, get a coat,"" though I also get great comfort from ""There’s only one horse and twenty riders/ Only one of them will get to ride it,"" which I take to be a metaphor for the narrow odds of success.) Whatever certainty he had has winnowed. ""I grew up thinking I’d be a hero,"" he sings on ""El Show de Los Muertos"". ""I grew up thinking I wouldn’t be them/ But what am I doing/ Here alone lost and wondering/ How many times do I have to die to be only me?"" Doubt is universal, but Wauters always seemed like someone able to enjoy himself in spite of it, someone who brandished his cardboard sword and charged the castle laughing. That’s him on the cover of Who Me?, standing on the hood of a car with the Manhattan skyline in the background, dwarfing the buildings but shying away from the camera. Later, he said he looked uncomfortable because they had to stop traffic in order to take the shot. Being in the way isn’t really his way. I like Wauters; I want him to win in part because I don’t think he cares much about winning. His songs are a stay against the passage of time: Kid to adult, openness to inevitable close. Music that takes on smallness as a cause—the third, self-titled Velvet Underground album, Daniel Johnston, half the history of indie pop—usually carries within it some hard intimation of purpose, a candle flame, a secret message that tells the people who bother to stick with it that they are in fact on the true and noble path. Call it the secret toughness of wimps. Every time I see the title of this album I reflexively think, yes, you*!*","Most of the songs on Juan Wauters' second album of sweet, unvarnished folk-rock are arranged for acoustic guitar, electric bass and other things that can be rehearsed in the living room without bothering the neighbors.

O.K.,Eskimeaux,by: Tess Duncan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad88c0084474cd0c1733/1:1/w_160/e7a53435.jpg,2015-05-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20434-ok/,Double Double Whammy,"The most appropriate word to describe Gabrielle Smith's solo project Eskimeaux might be ""togetherness."" The band founded Brooklyn songwriting and art collective the Epoch in 2011 along with several of their friends, but this sense of mutual support and do-it-together philosophy has long been a part of Smith's M.O. She originally formed Eskimeaux in 2007, all the while happily joining her peers' and fellow collective members' bands—Bellows, Told Slant, and Frankie Cosmos. Smith's songs reflect this type of profound concern for the well-being of those around her, an eagerness to take a backseat when others need her and a longing to still express her own sharp meditations on love and loneliness. Several of the songs on O.K. are new versions of previous recordings, but this time around Smith has scaled back to outline each melody in clearer brush strokes. Where certain tracks on 2013's Igluenza were monotone or drawn out, they graduate to fully formed pop on this release. Before, ""I Admit I'm Scared"" felt flat despite its visually compelling lyrics (""Everything I said spewed like sparklers from my mouth/ They looked pretty as they flew but now they're useless and burnt out""), while here it's one of the album's strongest moments. Subtle harmonies slowly coax Smith's gentle alto into a confident soar over Felix Walworth's galloping drum fill. She casually divulges secrets as though her arm is already on your shoulder, her quiet relatability spiking upwards at the climax (""If I had a dime for every time I'm freaking out/ We could fly around the world or just get out of your parents' house""). This encouraging, comforting voice permeates O.K. It may not always come in the form of a soft whisper in the night, but somehow it feels as if Smith is lending her ear to you rather than the other way around. Whether she's letting you know that it's okay to be scared and sad—notably on danceable bedroom pop number ""Alone at the Party""—or tenderly confessing how important you are (""The Thunder Answered Back""), the sweetness isn't saccharine, it's sincere and intimate. And when the entire band accompanies Smith on the latter track, she serves gut-wrenching doses of candor: ""It must feel like fucking hell/ To be a patchwork of yourself."" Smith is a hyper-aware observer, able to pinpoint others' despair just as well as her own. Sonically, O.K. is the most fitting pallette for Smith's work. In the past she's played around with drum machines and broken synth beats, which weighed her down in gloomy, droning noise. This LP finally matches Eskimeaux's illuminating presence. She slips from sparse indie-folk to ethereal pop throughout the record, each arrangement rich and meticulously composed. The band never overpowers Smith's celestial vocals, and she's able to keep up with the slow-burning tension when it eventually detonates. Walworth's attentive drumming is a welcome addition that swells and retracts to complement Jack Greenleaf's twinkling synth arpeggios. At face value, it's easy to mistake Smith's nursery rhyme name-dropping and misty-eyed warmth for childlike naiveté. However, she's no Pollyanna—she's simply acknowledging the darkness and aiming to move past it. O.K. invites us to view the world through Smith's eyes. The unassuming strength of her vision is what makes that invitation so worth accepting.","An encouraging, comforting voice permeates O.K., Gabrielle Smith's second album in her solo project Eskimeaux. O.K. invites us to view the world through Smith's eyes, and somehow it feels as if Smith is lending her ear to you rather than the other way around.

1000 Palms,Surfer Blood,by: T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae4f13d197565213a0a1/1:1/w_160/e198f5a3.jpg,2015-05-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20586-1000-palms/,Joyful Noise,"Five years isn’t really a long time, but in the lifespan of a band half a decade can feel like an eternity. Back in 2010, Florida’s Surfer Blood were riding high on the success of Astro Coast (deservedly so, considering how great that record is. Go back and listen to ""Swim"" to jog your memory). A year later, the band released an EP, Tarot Classics, and busied themselves with endless touring, including a dream stint opening for the Pixies. Though they just seemed like a bunch of kids from Florida, the band—in particular frontman and primary songwriter John Paul Pitts—ripped like an heir apparent for the guitar-pop throne previously kept warm by the likes of Stephen Malkmus or Rivers Cuomo. Unfortunately, it was not to be. In 2012, just before the recording of the band’s major label debut, Pitts was arrested (though never officially charged) after a physical altercation with his then girlfriend. Though details of the events of that night remain vague (you can read Pitts’ statement on the incident at the band’s website), the fallout from the arrest (and the seemingly endless amount of online discussion that ensued) did irrevocable damage. As a result, 2013’s Pythons seemed to emerge from under a dark cloud—a fraught, anxious record that, whether intentional or not, played out like an anguished mea culpa. A year after its release, the band was dropped from Warner Brothers. The future seemed nothing if not uncertain. So now, some five years after their debut, Surfer Blood return with 1000 Palms, a record that tries (and occasionally succeeds) at recapturing the messy exuberance of their debut. Self-recorded by the band largely in the living room of drummer Tyler Schwarz' parents’ house (and later nicely mixed by Rob Schnapf), the record is not only surprisingly upbeat, but surprisingly clean-sounding as well. Freed from the constraints of a major label (""We weren’t better off in paradise/ All we ever got were parasites"" remarks Pitts on ""Dorian"") the band take advantage of their newfound autonomy to unpack some of the psychic trauma they've endured over the past few years. And while one might expect this to be an opportunity for some cathartic guitar shredding, 1000 Palms is a little short on the epic riffs and the earworm hooks of earlier albums, in favor of tastefully employed synths and an overabundance of blandly pretty mid-tempo tracks, which, while never terrible, still feel oddly muted. The first five tracks establish a kind of emotional palette that, taken on their own, would make for a killer EP. Album opener ""Grand Inquisitor"" is big and booming—packed with the kind of guitar squalling and turn-on-a-dime signature changes that could almost pass for an old Pale Saints track (it helps that Pitt’s voice is a dead ringer for Pale Saints’ Ian Masters)—and evidences the kind of dynamic that made early Surfer Blood records fun. ""You wrote the finest record I’d ever heard,"" sings Pitt, ""It never occurred that you’d rather throw it all away/ Launch the CD-R into the bay."" On ""Island"" Pitt details a kind of creative discontent that pops up again and again on Palms: ""A shadow fell on me today/ It paralyzed my tongue, eclipsed my brain"" while the guitars morph from overdriven fuzz into melodic lines reminiscent of early-'80s new wave. The album's poppiest moments are often married to Pitt’s most pained sentiments, as on ""Feast/Famine"" where Unrest-like guitar jangle is set against Pitt’s own self-doubt: ""Sometimes I feel out touch with who I am/ I can’t see no symmetry/ It’s feast or famine."" 1000 Palms vacillates between songs about frustration and songs about love, which themselves run the gamut from endearingly sweet (the gorgeous New Year’s Eve romance of ""I Can’t Explain"") to the treacly and forgettable. 1000 Palms is consistently lovely and never terribly misfires, but in its same-sounding second half you can't help but wish it fired at least a little harder. Ultimately, 1000 Palms sounds like emotional throat-clearing, the transitional sound of a band finding their bearings, resetting their dials, and getting back on their feet in the wake of a lot of personal and professional turmoil. One would hope this would prove to be a pivotal turning point for the group, but the recent news of guitarist Thomas Fekete’s illness (he’s been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer) seems yet another blow to the now-beleaguered band. 1000 Palms does an admirable job of squaring itself with the past, as evidenced on album closer ""NW Passage""—an acoustic missive about breaking through impossible frozen barriers, forgiving and forgetting, and learning to get up again after falling face-first in the mud—but it ultimately all feels a bit tepid and desperately polite. Make no mistake, it’s all good, this business of letting go of bad baggage, but now that they’ve done so, here’s hoping Surfer Blood are more willing to stick their necks out next time and jump headlong back into the fray.","Surfer Blood return with 1000 Palms, a record that tries hard (and occasionally succeeds) at recapturing the messy exuberance of their debut.

Dark Bird Is Home,The Tallest Man on Earth,by: Jeremy D. Larson,Reviews Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adc8ea9e61561daa618a/1:1/w_160/da91e562.jpg,2015-05-11 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20481-dark-bird-is-home/,Dead Oceans,"The music of Kristian Matsson (who records as the Tallest Man on Earth) doesn't carry the same loneliness of other heartbroken folkies; Matsson's music, instead, has solitude. Loneliness is a condition, a place you end up and from which you are eager to leave, but solitude is a choice. Like Henry James or Emily Dickinson, who best detail the workings of their mind when they are cloistered away from the world, Matsson is more concerned with a wellspring of autonomous thought rather than the chirpings of modern society. His voice and his guitar jig around some distant forest maypole, out of touch and out of sync with everything 21st-century. Instead, he's loosely moored to his dreams, his wanderlust, and all the other broad stuff of poetry that glows brightest in total seclusion. It used to be easy to hear this solitude in Matsson's music. His first few albums featured only his rich, bleating voice and his acoustic guitar, and listening to his early records can feel like hearing someone rediscover the unfettered joy of playing music in real time. Naturally, for the last few albums, Matsson has been adding tiny layers of instrumentation behind him and the fire of his early days has dwindled into the mist of the songs' arrangements. Dark Bird Is Home, his first album since 2012's There's No Leaving Now, continues in this vein, and Matsson's persona fades even more into the tapestry he's made with his music. Matsson handles most of the performances, including keyboards and drums. He has some extra players—most notably background vocals and strings from Bon Iver's Mike Noyce—to fill the songs out, but the majority of the starry musical textures are Matsson's. He recorded the album in odd places in his native Sweden and surrounding countries, and the dusting of synths, pedal steel, french horns and trumpets on the album say a lot by saying very little. ""Timothy"" turns on a winsome clarinet figure played by Matsson, and it's the perfect amount of simplicity to ornament his songs without upsetting the whole equation. Matsson still hasn't ""gone electric,"" and blessedly still avoids the MOR folk-rock tropes of stomping and big-ticket whoa-oh'ing. Behind all the arrangements, front and center on every track, is still his voice. That voice undersells nothing: There are no wanly delivered lines, no flat and dour stretches of singing. His voice is prismatic, used like an old-guard storyteller who hews his words to any kind of feeling he wants. He does bittersweet reassurance on the stunning title track, and the way he tip-toes down the phrase ""Still we're in the light of day"" is hypnotic. He does sockless campfire guy on ""Beginners"", a song so whimsical it could land a three-movie deal with Disney. He even does the soft-rocking-through-the-sadness on ""Sagres"", where whispers for the audience to ""come on"" at the end of the chorus feel like the coyest Bruce Springsteen impression in history. Words come out of his mouth brimming with so much emotion, they land just shy of over-singing. Matsson has always been a little obtuse with his lyrics, and that can be charming or intriguing: The ballad ""Little Nowhere Towns"" is Matsson half-drunkenly retelling a tale of heartbreak, languishing in the imagery, nearly impossible to pin down. There's some bitterness about his own songwriting, perhaps: ""And I'm racing through my pockets now/ 'Cause I'm starting to believe/ Selling emptiness to strangers/ A little bit warmer than my dreams."" Elsewhere he's more inscrutable. The chorus of ""Singers"" goes ""But we're only gone like singers are till springtime/ Let them out, if they should let them out,"" which never opens up on repeated listens to reveal more than a tangle of words. The big choruses feel undercut by the sometimes-tangled poetry of the words, which get lost in metaphor en route to making their point. On ""Sagres"", he cuts through all the artifice with a striking moment: ""It's just all this fucking doubt,"" he sings, barely squeezing out the line. It feels like everything he's been trying and failing to say elsewhere. Which is why Matsson seems like someone who writes songs for himself alone. There's plenty of second-person on the record—a ""you"" who he walked some trails with, a ""you"" he's letting go of—but these are songs too caustic and bittersweet to be odes. If his last record was about putting down roots, here he's picking them back up again. It is his most personal record, but not because it's bare and raw, but because it's surreal and dreamlike. He flits between our reality and his own, a world of only dreamers and travelers, flickering lights of towns, shadows and ghosts, birds and trees. It's his way finding joy in his solitude.","Dark Bird Is Home is Kristian Matsson's most personal record as Tallest Man on Earth, but not because it's bare and raw, but because it's surreal and dreamlike.

GRM Works / Pacific Tubular Waves/Immersion,Beatriz FerreyraMichel Redolfi,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae09ea9e61561daa61ec/1:1/w_160/da816389.jpg,2015-05-08 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20526-grm-works-pacific-tubular-wavesimmersion/,Recollection GRM,"Reissue culture gets derided for many reasons—they comprise the majority of RSD chum; they can obscure newer artists; they make for long queues at record pressing plants. Some see them as a pernicious symptom of something deeper: Britt Brown of 100% Silk wrote that the proliferation of past musics ""reveals a host of aesthetic anxieties, disappointments, and insecurities lurking beneath the surface of our 21st century music landscape."" But when reissues serve their highest calling, they shed light on voices neglected by history, and were it not for reissues and rediscovery, a generation of vital female electronic composers might have been lost. It was in the late '90s, near the end of her life, for example, that BBC Radiophonic Workshop member (and ""Doctor Who"" theme composer) Delia Derbyshire received some recognition for her electronic music, and it's only in this century that more notice has been paid to the likes of Laurie Spiegel and Suzanne Ciani. Argentinean composer Beatriz Ferreyra, an early colleague of musique concrète inventor Pierre Schaeffer who studied at the Paris Groupe de Recherches Musicales studios from 1963-70, only had her work issued (by the label) in 2012. The Recollection GRM label, which has done fine work reissuing epochal works from the likes of Schaeffer, Luc Ferrari and Bernard Parmegiani, two recent reissues investigate Ferreyra's overlooked work and a revered obscurity from Michel Redolfi. Ferreyra's release pairs two shorter '60s works with two longer, more recent compositions, and there's a fluidity to her work that suggests her methodology remains unchanged. The 21st century pieces are crisper and clock in at over twice the length as the earlier ones, but they sound of a whole. The accompanying notes, referencing alchemy and the Qabalah, suggest that change and the mercurial state of the natural world is a crucial theme to Ferreyra. ""Demeures aquatiques"", from 1967, manipulates the sounds of metal sheets and glass rods to explore what Ferreyra writes is ""the flow constantly facing the ebb."" In it, a nervous wobble of electromagnetic tape gets nearly submerged by a drone before high fluttering tones shoot up, those high frequencies themselves becoming a drone. ""Médisances"", from the next year, is a four-channel piece turning orchestral instruments and mouth harp into salt water taffy, twangs and bowed strings slowed to an exhilarating crawl, all leading up to an exclamatory yelp at the last moment. There's a similar sense of speed on ""Un fil invisible"", which warps its source sounds at a dizzying rate. At the same time, there's far more space and silence in the mix for the smaller sounds to move about, with strings zooming, tactile objects bursting into stardust, and small scurrying sounds suggesting mice aboard a space station. Fans of the furthest fringes of electronic dance music might recognize Michel Redolfi’s name, as his music has appeared in mixes by Demdike Stare, Rene Hell and early on in Four Tet’s Fabriclive mix, leading into twisted UK garage. As the 3D graphics (like the original edition, this reissue includes a pair of 3D glasses in its gatefold sleeve) and title attests, Redolfi became enchanted with the Pacific Ocean during a seven-year period he spent in California ""attempting to musically translate my discovery of the Pacific,"" as he puts it. Having spent one season learning to surf in the Pacific Ocean—which more often than not meant learning to read its temperamental, ever-changing waves and not be overwhelmed by its powerful currents—Redolfi’s compositions are a remarkable ‘translation’ of that body of water. Deploying the then-newfangled Synclavier digital synthesizer (which around 1977-78 was used primarily by Frank Zappa and Wire producer Mike Thorne), ""Pacific Tubular Waves"" differs radically across its five movements. Redolfi conveys a wide emotional range on this side: giddiness, exhilaration, bewilderment, glee, panic, uncertainty, and both an eerie and sun-kissed state of calm. While one side explores the surface of the Pacific, ""Immersion"" uses as its source sounds from hydrophones submerged into the ocean itself. The design of Redolfi’s compositions can feel macro and micro at once, where the sensation of the Pacific’s vastness as well as the way small droplets bead up on your skin are both tangible. One can visualize the tiny bubbles surrounding each sound event here and ""Deep Immersion"" in particular is mesmerizing. There’s a peculiar contradiction at play when it comes to reassessing such obscure electronic compositions. On one hand, they are cloistered soundworlds, artifacts with no outside signifiers; on the other, they don’t sound dated. Despite the five decades separating some of Ferreyra’s works, one won’t find any correlation to the many changes that mainstream music underwent during that same time period. They both exist outside of time, yet now feel at home in the modern electronic moment, where it’s normal to have DJ sets in the footwork/Fade to Mind/Hudson Mohawke mode be quicksand-solid and quickly morphing. In an uncanny manner, both reissues anticipate an aesthetic that now lurks just beneath the surface of our 21st century music landscape.","When reissues serve their highest calling, it's to shed light on voices neglected by history. These two reissues, from Recollections GRM, focus on two neglected voices in electronic composition from the '60s and '70s. While both albums oddly exist outside of time, they both feel at home in the modern electronic moment.

Michael Angelo,Michael Angelo,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adadea9e61561daa6156/1:1/w_160/f95ff3f0.jpg,2015-05-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20461-michael-angelo/,Anthology RecordingsAnthology Recordings,"If reissue labels are to be believed, then a staggering amount of top-shelf singer/songwriter and psychedelia albums has been slipping through the cracks for decades. In the last several years, we've seen a daunting uptick in ""lost classics,"" freshly unearthed, which begins to generate a sort of uncanny ""How-can-this-be?"" tingle that you might recall from the deluge of posthumous 2Pac releases. There’s a fine line between ""rescued from history"" and ""dredged from oblivion,"" and with each new rarity and oddity, we’re given a chance to suss out where that line sits. In Michael Angelo Nigro’s case, what we're being given is an interesting artifact, a pleasant record, and probably something that sounded both a little weirder and more interesting around the time it was recorded, in 1977. Nigro was a session player in Kansas City then, and he tracked the album at night and at off-hours at Liberty Recording, the studio where he worked. He was interested in the Beatles and the Byrds, and Cream, and Greek mythology, and he played everything on the album except the drums. He was very clearly in his own headspace, and the record has a dreamy, unhurried feel. The label didn’t want the thing when it was done, so off he went, to a smaller studio called Big-K, which mixed and released 500 copies. The end. Except now Anthology, the offshoot of Mexican Summer devoted to reissues, has tracked down a sealed original copy and remastered it with Nigro's blessing, presenting it to us as the latest in a line of lost psych classics. It has some scruffy bonafides in this realm; it was included on the late Acid Archives author Patrick Lundborg’s list of his favorite private-issue albums, and 7”s of ""Sorcerer’s Delight"" can still fetch good prices on Discogs. But today, Nigro's gentle, warbly psychedelia has to fight for attention amongst similarly themed stuff being made today, on labels like Drag City and Captured Tracks. Nigro's record might have technically been first, but since it’s being heard in context, it’s gotta wait in line, just like all the rest of us. Michael Angelo Nigro’s voice is a sweet instrument, and filtered through synths and ringing open guitars on ""Flight of Pegasus"" he sounds like a romantic, unabashed in his visions of ""a sea of dreams and love"" and ""Grapes of Atlantis/ Falling from celestial vines."" The chord progressions feel bent backwards by acid, which Nigro swore he never took in a recent interview with Aquarium Drunkard, and the guitar leads alternate between reminding you forcefully of George Harrison and Arthur Lee. On ""Journey (to Find Who We Are)"",  his voice sounds uncannily like early Paul Simon, and the verse melody that feels like it could be mapped onto Simon & Garfunkel's ""Patterns"" without too much deviation. These comparisons mount over the short album’s 10 tracks, and register like little pinpricks in its aura. You might find yourself enjoying it while wondering: What is here, exactly, that can’t be found in the ocean of similar material, stretching back decades, and all of it gobbled up and apprised by thousands of psych-pop aficionados? For Nigro, who has seen his album bootlegged persistently over the decades, having it back in print with his blessing probably closes an important internal circle. But for us, it might be more a curio than an essential document.","Only 500 copies of Michael Angelo's 1997 self-titled album were pressed and the album has often been described as a lost psych-folk classic. Mexican Summer's Anthology imprint offers a new reissue that allows it to be heard outside of collector's circles.

Jackie,Ciara,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae2eea9e61561daa622b/1:1/w_160/0289c4e3.jpg,2015-05-08 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20555-jackie/,Epic,"Motherhood has often brought out the best in your fave pop stars. Mariah, M.I.A., Madonna, Kelis, Beyoncé: all have stellar postpartum releases to their names, with some explicitly riffing on the theme, and others signaling a shift—sometimes patronizingly referred to as more 'mature'—in sound. These albums all sound very different, but they form a sort of collective statement that motherhood isn't some aesthetic, thematic or musical purgatory for women. We are not content, these working women say, on being aged out, or matron-ized, by the youth-oriented trajectory of the industry. ""Man, I just delivered a nine-pound, 10-ounce baby. I'm a bad motherfucker,"" Ciara drawls on ""Jackie (B.M.F.)"", the explosive intro track on her sixth album, Jackie. Named after her own mother, Jackie doesn't necessarily shift Ciara's sound so much as a frame it with a faint redemption narrative, centered around the birth of her baby and her breakup with rapper and erstwhile ex Future. ""You actin' like you upgrading me, I upgraded you/ You and me at Fashion Week in Paris, I put you onto that new,"" goes the album's first single, the breakup ballad ""I Bet"". But Ciara's never been much for album-length statements. Instead the ATL-reared R&B pop star, best known for her sensuous, studious approach to choreography, has created a career by rewiring the city's full throttle hip-hop motifs into club-friendly pop. Jackie doesn't do much to allay the feeling, which has followed her for her whole career, that there's better R&B pop out there. But instead of positioning herself against Rihanna—who is only just starting to really find her vocal strength, and who is decidedly not a dancer—or Beyoncé (ha ha), Ciara is content to be a reliable mainstay, a translator of Atlanta's ever-shifting avant-garde and the constant bringer of high-energy dance anthems. She's innovative within her own framework: Before Beyoncé started dabbling with bars, Ciara was already rapping on 2013's ""Super Turnt Up"" and the album-less Mike WiLL Made It single, ""Wake Up, No Make-Up"". The problems with Jackie, a serviceable record that gets better with multiple listens, is that unlike her previous releases it's more heavily focused on paint-by-numbers Dr. Luke electro. And, an even bigger problem—and this is where Ciara has always faltered—is that it hints at a storyline, but doesn't go deeper. Moms totally care about more than just being moms, but consider that Ciara's records are also too often about nothing at all, and it's hard not to wish she'd gone into more depth. It's an opportunity and, again, on Jackie, she doesn't take it. There's a song called ""Lullaby"" that's not about a baby but tucking a lover in for the evening. The actual lullaby comes toward the very end, with ""I Got You""; she sings ""Hush, Little Baby"" while Future Zahir gurgles the outro. There are interesting moments: the hesitant merging of post-ratchet trap and drum and bass on ""B.M.F."", the Niles Rodgers-esque retro-soul bounce of ""Kiss & Tell"", and her beatific, waxy vocal performance on ""That's How I'm Feelin'"" and ""Fly"". Both are pillowy Polow Da Don electro-lite bangers—the former featuring Pitbull and Missy Elliott—referencing early Ciara, like the jock-jam energy of ""1, 2 Step"". For Jackie's deluxe edition, Ciara calls upon Joe Jonas to switch up the dewy, gloriously shady ""I Bet"", featuring imitation-Future yelps and adlibs. And second single ""Dance Like We're Making Love"", is a gorgeous, sleek midtempo track, similar to Frank Ocean's ""Novocane"" but with a bigger, airier hook. She carried her last album cycle off a slow jam about a very public romance (""Body Party""), but ""I Bet"" just isn't as strong. Jackie's best moments come on those Polow power jams, when the music imitates the explosiveness of Ciara's movement. What would've made Jackie better than the last album—what would've given her the edge that her peers maintain—is some insight behind Ciara's redemption songs.","Named after her own mother, Ciara's sixth record Jackie doesn't shift Ciara's sound so much as frame it with a redemption narrative, through the lens of motherhood, centered around her breakup with rapper and erstwhile ex Future.

Full Communism,Downtown Boys,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae4b5e6ef95969321c22/1:1/w_160/251880da.jpg,2015-05-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20584-full-communism/,Don Giovanni,"If you want to know why Downtown Boys sound so angry on their debut album Full Communism, watch the music video for ""Wave of History"". In the clip, the Providence-based band outlines the realities of prison overcrowding, the racial divide in U.S. arrest rates, and the number of people killed by police—very real problems that, for many, are remarkably easy to ignore. Our screens offer countless alternatives to anything remotely ""unpleasant"" or ""depressing""; even as militarized police line city streets and 24-hour news networks, they're forced to compete with a bottomless pit of interspecies friendship GIFs. Victoria Ruiz of Downtown Boys engages with the country's broken systems and the resulting frustration fuels her lyrics. The 28-year-old worked for the Rhode Island Public Defender, aiming to combat racist and classist policing tactics. She currently works with Demand Progress, and she recently wrote an op-ed on Ferguson. Joey L DeFrancesco, 27, was her co-worker at a hotel; they attempted to start a union since the employees were, as he described it, ""treated...like garbage."" (DeFrancesco later quit that job with magnificent flair.) ""Sometimes people ask, 'Don’t you get sad worrying about this stuff all the time?'"" Ruiz said. ""It upsets me because it is negative and absolves the person of the responsibility of realizing that we all have to think about these things."" Full Communism is an album-length exercise of that responsibility. Downtown Boys have two horns and plenty of aggression in their arsenal and, as they play, they force you to acknowledge the world around you. The title ""Break a Few Eggs"" pretty well encapsulates the nature of the project. Songs challenge white hegemony, entitled bro culture, and more with churning rock'n'roll lined with Adrienne Berry and Emmett FitzGerald's saxophones. (Between this album and that Pill EP, it's been a good year thus far for the rock sax.) DeFrancesco's guitar, Norlan Olivo's drums, and Dan Schleifer's bass lock in for a fuzzy, chugging barrage. Racism and homophobia are alluded to in shouts but the music isn't cynical; everything seems to be underpinned with the sincere desire that things actually get better. ""We make, we made, we will make freedom,"" Ruiz sings in rapid succession on ""Desde Arriba"". They've talked about how they encourage a ""space of collective power"" at their live shows, which makes sense—Full Communism, both in message and mayhem, has the power to whip a roomful of people into a frenzy. And that's the important bit—this music is saying some real shit, yeah, but it's doing it with a completely unhinged voice. As advocates of human rights, Downtown Boys are well-versed in the history of bland protest songs. ""Political music is often cheesy or boring, so no one listens to it,"" DeFrancesco has said. ""As much as we hate on aesthetics by themselves, they obviously matter."" Matching substance with style is easier said than done—Downtown Boys could easily fall into punk's trap of loud and fast monotony. They don't, though, keeping things diverse and well-sequenced. Where the horns on ""Monstro"" lend a soft, beautiful counterbalance to DeFrancesco's jagged guitar, ""Traders"" is bookended by silence and goes full speed punk at the center. Full Communism's songs are performed in both English and Spanish—Ruiz said the band approach music ""with the intention to speak to as many people as possible."" The album's last two tracks are covers—one in each language. There's ""Poder Elegir"" by Los Prisioneros, a song the Chilean band recorded as an effort to urge people to fight conformity and complacency during the rule of dictator Augusto Pinochet. The other: Bruce Springsteen's ""Dancing in the Dark"". When Ruiz shouts the Boss' world-weariness, she sounds as though she's already started a fire of her own. The covers are effective—the ideal pairing of pop infectiousness and calls to action. Downtown Boys insist that nothing's going to change unless people actually get up and do something, and they've offered a soundtrack that makes positive action feel both attainable and liberating.","The Providence-based Downtown Boys create fiery punk rock with a sharp political edge. Their lyrics challenge white hegemony, entitled bro culture, and more while the music offers a distinctive mix of buzzsaw guitars and saxophone.

The Epic,Kamasi Washington,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae305e6ef95969321bf9/1:1/w_160/0441ce5e.jpeg,2015-05-08 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20557-the-epic/,Brainfeeder,"It is probably impossible to discuss Kamasi Washington's new record—all three impressive hours of it—without copping to at least some awareness of two extra-musical truths. The first of these holds that, as a member of the studio wrecking crew that brought Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly into being, this saxophonist-composer is unusually well poised to secure the attention of listeners who have previously been uninterested in jazz. (This past spring's celebration of all-things-TPAB was sufficiently strong that Billboard even published a well-reported piece that detailed exactly how Lamar's album came to feature so many jazz figures, including Washington.) The second truth is that jazz could use a few more people with Washington's cachet in the wider world—touring with Snoop Dogg, or putting out albums on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder imprint. Admitting this is not tantamount to saying that jazz is in some unhealthy creative state (it isn't), but rather that the music currently faces an uphill struggle in the marketplace (as it often has). You can see hints of these outside considerations in some of the pre-release writing around The Epic—virtually all of which cites Washington's hip-hop associations as a reason to pay attention to his big debut as a jazz bandleader. (Washington cut one prior album as part of a collective, in 2004, but this set is his real coming-out party.) One can imagine other elite contemporary jazz artists grinding teeth while checking Twitter, muttering to themselves: if anyone paid attention to me, they'd notice the post-turntablism beats in my music. Given all this, it's something of a gobsmacking paradox to discover what a hip-hop-free zone The Epic is, and how enamored of jazz's past it turns out to be. This triple-album set is an extravagant love letter to (among other things): soul jazz, John Coltrane (various periods), and 1970s fusion leaders like Miles Davis and Weather Report. The Epic's Disc 1 opener, ""Change of the Guard"", might as well be titled ""We Love All Kinds of 'Trane"". Its ringing opening piano chords sound almost entirely lifted from the playbook of McCoy Tyner, the pianist in Coltrane's so-called ""Classic Quartet."" (That's the group responsible for A Love Supreme.) The opening theme in the saxes is something that could only have been written after ""Impressions"". And the harmonious writing for Washington's string section recalls posthumous Coltrane releases like Infinity—tracks from which featured orchestral overdubs supervised by Alice Coltrane (who is, as you may have read, Flying Lotus's aunt). Toward the end of the 12-minute tune, Washington's tenor sax solo veers off into flights of screeching intensity that were the hallmark of Coltrane's later groups—specifically the ones that also included Pharoah Sanders. (Who is, by the way, still active—and still great, on the evidence of last year's record with the São Paulo Underground.) What The Epic does come to sound like, over the course of its significant running time, is a generational intervention—an educational tool that widens the definition of styles that fall under ""jazz classicism."" With his writing for string sections and chorus, Washington even flirts with that most dreaded of appellations: smooth. But these specific choices also wind up paying dividends: The calmly spiritual voices and Washington's wailing playing during the back half of ""Askim"" feels novel. Three hours is a lot of music, and Washington uses the space to range freely—the R&B vocals of Patrice Quinn crop up roughly once per disc, and there are long sections that feel indebted to grittier funk and soul. Washington has a healthy sense of melodrama, which is especially clear whenever the chorus swoops in with open-hearted ""ooohs"" and ""aaahs"", aiming straight for the listener's gooseflesh. Meantime, some of the longer, less ambitious instrumental tracks (like ""Isabelle"") play things much safer, in a kind of chill-jazz mode that features greasy-soul-organ and tasteful solos from Washington's large cast of skilled supporters (like electric bassist Thundercat and trombonist Ryan Porter). While faultlessly executed, these are the only moments across the music's three-hour sprawl that resemble padding. On the uptempo, high-energy music, like the updated Miles Davis-isms of ""Re Run Home"", as well the potent Disc 3 closer, ""The Message"", Washington and his band truly excel. The big news is that The Epic actually makes good on its titular promise without bothering to make even a faint-hearted stab in the direction of fulfilling its pre-release hype. If you came for the hip-hop associations, and can't listen for anything else, you will surely be disappointed. But to listen like that is to cheat yourself. If you want rapping over contemporary jazz, you can find it elsewhere. If you're in the mood for acoustic adaptations of electronic-music practices, look to Vijay Iyer Trio's recent Break Stuff (specifically, the track ""Hood"", which is a shout-out to Detroit DJ Robert Hood). You can find more studiously contemporary R&B vocals on Robert Glasper's recent Black Radio series. Kamasi Washington's epic isn't the place for those things—though it is also a zone of surprise. Instead of a self-conscious attempt to seize someone else’s idea of the zeitgeist, it's a large and generous canvas, clearly created in the hopes of attracting new visitors to the post-Coltrane wing of the jazz museum. At this point, that project is its own form of radicalism.","Kamasi Washington, a member of the studio band that composed To Pimp a Butterfly, has released a triple-album set that functions as an extravagant love letter to (among other things): soul jazz, John Coltrane (various periods), and 1970s fusion leaders like Miles Davis and Weather Report. It’s a large and generous canvas, with the feel of a generational intervention.

Chassis,Psychic Reality,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ade813d1975652139ff4/1:1/w_160/6c6304a3.jpg,2015-05-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20508-chassis/,Intercoastal Artists,"Leyna Noel's first album as Psychic Reality was called Vibrant New Age, but the music sounded more like fuzzy new wave, or maybe lo-fi disco. Pulsing with rattling beats, blurry neon synths, and Noel's skyward voice, it fit snugly into chillwave’s turn toward the dance floor. That move was spearheaded in part by the label 100% Silk, a sub-imprint of Not Not Fun (which released Vibrant New Age) led by L.A. Vampires' Amanda Brown (Noel’s bandmate in Pocahaunted). So the whole scene had a family vibe, and Vibrant New Age carried the bloodline well. That movement has died down a bit, but on Noel's second album, Chassis, she holds firm to that style while trying to push it further. Her music is now grimier and denser, and it’s more inventive, more willing to color outside its own lines. The best moments throb with rhythm and soar with melody, conjuring an alternate past where new wave and disco burrow happily into the dirt while staring beatifically at the sun. Noel can mellow her grooves too, but with mixed results; her slower, less beat-driven material is uneven and prone to stasis. But overall Chassis generates more energy than it saps, and pumps more blood than it drains. Noel finds electric power in pounding, nerve-tweaking tracks like escalating opener ""Life Is Long"" and the beautifully bouncing ""Bambini Art"". Here she seems laser-focused on inducing hypnosis by a thousand cuts, with every sound contributing to an overall hazy cloud of entrancement. ""I have not slept a lot,"" she sings at one point, and it sounds like it. Her busy mix is aided by talented collaborators—particularly M. Geddes Gengras, who is credited on one song with ""stuttering"" and another with ""wizardry""—but this is clearly Noel’s show, as her personality seeps through every pore. That personality is obsessed with danceable retro-pop, but Noel avoids anonymity by burning the edges of her sound and drenching it with atmosphere. In this way she shares a sensibility with Meghan Remy of U.S. Girls. Both are unafraid to boldly echo the past through their homemade filters, confident that their own distinctive characters will make the music rise above mere homage. Only when Noel calms things down does she risk losing that character. Slow-burning tracks like the tropical ballad ""90 Regina"" and the distant ""Sueño"" are admirable attempts to change pace, but they come off inert, like balloons in search of helium. Some of her restrained tunes do lock in well, though, and Noel wisely ends Chassis with her best one, the gripping ""Index of First Lines"". The key is a detonating drum machine, which provides such an intriguing spine to her torch-song purrs that it keeps the tune from ever sitting still. Chassis doesn’t always motor forward that well, but when it does, Noel’s creative restlessness is potent fuel.","On her second LP as Psychic Reality, Leyna Noel makes her music grimier and denser.

II,Metz,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad8f9d034d5c69bf43bf/1:1/w_160/e311376d.jpg,2015-05-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20439-ii/,Sub Pop,"In the run-up to II—the sophomore set from Toronto noisemakers Metz—frontman Alex Edkins promised three things: ""We are not going to clean up our sound, we are not going to hire a big producer, we are not going to try to write a radio song."" True to his word, II is another snarling beast of a record, 10 more all-lunging, all-screaming anti-anthems crammed into another chaotic, cloistered half-hour, every inch as grotty and combustible and unfriendly as its predecessor. Once again produced by Holy Fuck's Graham Walsh and engineered by Alex Bonefant, II is a refinement, not a reinvention: if you liked Metz, well, have another. Metz spent five years honing their considerable strengths—Edkins' caustic fretwork and vocal agita, Hayden Menzies and Chris Slorach's stampeding low-end—before unleashing their self-titled debut. And, on II, they seem to feel no particular need to tinker around with what got them here. They still draw most of their inspiration from turn-of-the-'90s post-hardcore and the Nirvana albums on either side of Nevermind, and they still believe three-and-a-half minutes is about as long as any song has the right to be. The terse II comes in a smidge less rigid than its predecessor, a shade or two darker, a touch more physical. Not that you'll notice; once the bassline of opener ""Acetate"" takes hold, for 30 short minutes, your thoughts become a smear of white. These songs are not ""catchy"" by any traditional metric; they don't so much get stuck in your head as get lodged in your skin. Metz take great pains to avoid your standard verse-chorus-verse structures, and II, even more than the debut, downplays the traditionally ""songier"" aspects of these songs for a series of weaponized strikes. Still, beyond a few drop-outs and punch-ins, these songs all seem to gnash about in a fairly similar fashion. Hayden Menzies' bull-in-a-China-shop drums are unrelenting, but they rarely push too far past their original tempo; Edkins talks his way through a few of these verses, but he's every bit as likely to start off in a full-on wail, and his riffs, while bludgeoning from the get-go, never seem quite sure how to up their own antes. All of this makes the first 20 or so seconds of any Metz song roughly as thrilling as the last 20, which gives II the feeling of falling down the same set of stairs ten times in a row. There is not, as Edkins promised, anything for the radio on II, but neither is there much attempt to chart new territory, no ambitious gambits or radical tempo-shifts, nothing they haven't already proven themselves capable of in the past. These songs barely give themselves space to meander or develop; they pull the cord, and off they go. By and large, they perform their seethe-pummel-repeat routine with an almost mechanized precision. This one thing, they do incredibly well. Then they do it nine more times. In fact, II is often more compelling on the rare occasions when Metz pulls back on the brontosaurus riffage and focuses on the connective tissue, the strands of sinew that surround many of these songs. The windchime-scrape at the tail end of ""Spit You Out"", the frizzy intro lick to ""I.O.U."", the whinnying strum at the top of ""Kicking a Can of Worms"": all these strange, static-y interludes, brief though they may be, build the kind of tension Metz are all too game to release. It's a shame they couldn't find a little more space for it. Fleeting though they are, these little interstitials provide a few much-needed valleys to II's overabundance of peaks. Throughout II, just about anything is prone to set Edkins off: crass commercialism, self-loathing, painkillers and—horror of horror—waiting in lines. These are angry-sounding songs, no question there. But when a typical chorus goes something like ""painkiller, painkiller/ that's why I feel unreal/ painkiller, painkiller/ that's one hell of a deal,"" you start to wonder if Edkins is really screaming out of some deep-seated passion, or if this is just the kind of music you scream over. In interviews, Metz claim to be a punk band largely because it's the one genre the three of them could agree on. They're not claiming to be anything they're not, but—after two records far more similar than different—one can't help but wonder what else they could be. Were they willing to risk more, to stretch out further, to try a few more new things on for size, II might've sailed right past its beloved predecessor. But by sticking so closely to the script laid out by their debut, II is the one thing punk rock should never be: careful.","On II, the Toronto band Metz still draw most of their inspiration from turn-of-the-'90s post-hardcore and the Nirvana albums on either side of Nevermind, and they still believe three-and-a-half minutes is about as long as any song has the right to be.

Wilder Mind,Mumford & Sons,by: Maud Deitch,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad795e6ef95969321aa8/1:1/w_160/d5990d63.jpg,2015-05-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20421-wilder-mind/,IslandGlassnote,"Mumford & Sons didn't have to be awful. A British neo-folk band, liberally applying the trappings of Americana, they made big songs well-suited to big stages, and they made them about as well as possible. But awful they were, nonetheless, a band so determined to be huge that they willed themselves into anonymity. Their latest effort, Wilder Mind, is a ""rock"" record in the least interesting sense of that word—a pastiche of the genre’s most common elements, from big percussion, electric guitars, and warm synths, to poignant but ultimately surface-level lyrics. It has all the elements of radio-friendly 2015 American rock'n'roll, with very timely nods to Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen, but what it’s lacking in is any kind of originality, or message—and most importantly, it’s lacking in banjo, the only thing that ever set the band apart from the bro-rock horde in the first place. With the production help of James Ford (member of Simian Mobile Disco, and producer for Arctic Monkeys) and Aaron Dessner of the National, the band has successfully created perhaps the most adequate commercial rock album of 2015. It’s fine. But fine is nowhere near good, and, when the music is this empty, it might actually be worse than bad. Love songs are low-hanging fruit, and on Wilder Mind, Mumford picks from the lowest branches. The first words uttered on the album's opening track, ""Tompkins Square Park"", are ""Oh, babe,"" and like a boyfriend offering a generic apology, the song that follows sounds like it could be applied to any romantic situation at any time. There’s so little actual heart present in the songs, so little heartbreak, that it’s hard to imagine they were written from any kind of real place. This is music without any real center, designed only with montages and ""Grey’s Anatomy"" climaxes in mind. What the album sounds like, above all else, is easy money. These are songs that reflect emotion but generate none. They don't have feelings, they have #thefeels. The ‘I’ in these songs feels heartbreak but not too much; longing, but not too much; joy, but again, not too much. The influence of Dessner’s production is obvious in the richness of the arrangements, but where the National’s enormous sound is countered by obtuse and specific lyrics, Mumford matches a big, general sound with big, general statements of longing, and it falls flat. Petty and Springsteen are storytellers, bringing tangible and unique perspective to their personal narratives and those of their subjects. Mumford is telling the tale of the everyman, in that their narrative could be literally about every single man. Songs like ""Believe"" are so lumbering that they are almost vulgar. ""I don’t even know if I believe/ Everything you’re trying to say to me,"" Mumford sings in his best Chris Martin-soft-voice, before laddering up to a loud, crunchy apex of sound that explodes into a plea for some kind of redemption. The conflict on Wilder Mind is pedestrian—the confusion of someone with nothing real to lose. On ""Cold Arms"", the only song on the record that provides a vague respite from the formula, pairing Mumford’s plaintive vocals with a single electric guitar, he sings of a relationship where he and his partner are simultaneously ""bloodshot and beat/ and never so alive."" There’s no evidence of life on the track itself, which follows every imaginable rule so closely that all traces of life are erased. Many of the songs on the album reference specific locations in New York City, from the aforementioned opener to the galloping ""Ditmas"", which names the small Brooklyn neighborhood, home to many members of the National, where the album's demos were recorded. But they make no reference to any location outside of their titles, and listened to sequentially, it seems as if any of these songs could switch titles with the next one with no discernible effect. They are 12 variations on vaguely Don Henley-inspired arena schlock, and in this transition, they've found a new bottom. Mumford & Sons' only hope to stand out was lost in favor of a cheap imitation, and not even a banjo can save them now.","With the production help of James Ford (member of Simian Mobile Disco, and producer for Arctic Monkeys) and Aaron Dessner of the National, Mumford & Sons has successfully created perhaps the most adequate commercial rock album of 2015.

Sprinter,Torres,by: Jillian Mapes,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acbb9d034d5c69bf423b/1:1/w_160/42dfde64.png,2015-05-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20290-sprinter/,Partisan,"Questioning what you once held fundamentally true is exhausting, but in every possible way, Brooklyn-via-Nashville singer-songwriter Mackenzie Scott's intense, spiritual sophomore album as Torres suggests that this is work worth doing. Her 2013 self-titled debut felt inherently raw in its stripped-down folk-rock, a sound akin to that of her future collaborator Sharon Van Etten. On Sprinter, however, Scott shrouds her voice with feedback and heavier rock instrumentation, created alongside PJ Harvey producer and percussionist Rob Ellis. The sound is like a gauze bandage covering the emotional wounds, the profound isolation and fear of abandonment, that sit at the heart of Sprinter. But Scott lets a little red bleed through nonetheless, and for listeners, at least, that's a good thing. An album ago, Scott told what was presumed to be some version of her own adoption story with ""Moon & Back""; the song is written from the perspective of a woman who left a letter for the baby she gave up, but no names are given. Though Torres continues to write from perspectives besides her own—and it continues to prove interesting—on Sprinter, any trepidation she may have felt over first-person narrative is pushed aside in pursuit of unflinching honesty. On the album's stunning, solo acoustic closer ""The Exchange"", Scott is direct where before she was mysterious: ""Mother, father, I'm underwater, and I don't think you can pull me out of this,"" she coos in the chorus. ""Blew my per diem on an eighth of Blue Dream/ So I can breathe but I still can't breathe,"" Scott adds, revealing her coping method of choice—sativa-dominant hybrids. The song's arresting plainspokenness recalls Neko Case's memorable a cappella declaration of abandonment and rejection on The Worst Things Get, the Harder I Fight...'s ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu"". Sprinter splits its mood between depression and rage, mirrored in the album's loud-quiet musical dichotomy that is not unlike that of early PJ Harvey albums. With the aid of her co-producer Ellis (showing off his status as an underrated rock drummer who makes every beat sound crisp), Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley (who recently helped Perfume Genius also reach a musical state as real as it is deeply unsettling), and Harvey bassist Ian Oliver, Scott fully inhabits her loudest moments by inching towards post-rock and synth-rock. The album's crowning achievement, ""Son, You Are No Island"", forges a mystical through line from Celtic music to Hole's ""I Think That I Would Die"", to Godspeed You! Black Emperor, to Mica Levi's Under the Skin soundtrack. This song simmers with rage, a stick of dynamite waiting to blow, but it's Scott's restraint in delaying the explosions—first a wall of hardened distortion, then via vocal loops—that hits the hardest. When she lets her depressive side out, Scott can ramble slightly. On ""Ferris Wheel"", Scott takes her time meandering through intense pining for another who's ""got the sadness too"" while an echoing guitar provides a woozy background twang. For such a slow pace, it goes on about twice as long as it needs to (seven minutes). On the flipside sits ""Cowboy Guilt"", a rare light spot that lasts less than three minutes. Scott captures the thrill of instant interpersonal connection via the quick and steady beat of a drum machine and flourishes of a music box melody. When Scott can find the right balance of these elements—dark, introspective, midtempo, highly distorted, and in the four to five-minute range—she hits a sweet spot, like on ""New Skin"" and the album's title track. These are the songs where Scott seems to lay out her thesis statements with a slight nods to theology; on ""New Skin"", atop a formidable '90s alt-rock build, Scott offers up a conclusion she's come to already: ""If you never know the darkness, then you're the one who fears the most."" Identity is the thorniest of growing pains, particularly when—like Scott—you come from adoptive lineage and a Southern Baptist upbringing you're now sussing out on your own. Wherever she might be on her own personal journey, Scott sounds on her records like someone getting closer every moment to her ultimate truth.","On her second album as Torres, Brooklyn-via-Nashville singer-songwriter Mackenzie Scott shrouds her voice with feedback and heavier rock instrumentation, created alongside PJ Harvey producer and percussionist Rob Ellis.

MCIII,Mikal Cronin,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad9cc0084474cd0c1757/1:1/w_160/7ffc33d9.jpg,2015-05-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20448-mikal-cronin-mciii/,Merge,"On ""Turn Around"", the opening track and lead single on MCIII, Mikal Cronin sings some sweet bromides about the passing of time. His lyrics are punctuated by little directives, like ""Turn it down,"" ""stop,"" or ""turn around,"" ""here it goes,"" and the arrangement seems to be responding to him, amping up or quieting down depending on the line. Without a devastating hook—like the one on ""Weight"", the opening track and lead single from Cronin’s 2013 full-length, *MCII—*it feels a bit like listening to stage instructions from a power pop song to be finished later, a rote rehearsal from a tired director. The consecutive, uniform titles are apt: MCIII plays like a photocopy of MCII, with added incidental noise yielding substantially diminished returns. That said, MCIII was copied from good source material. Cronin sounded radiant on MCII, his supple singing inflected with subtle melodic idiosyncrasies and unfussy displays of considerable vocal range. Still, timing helped him. Cronin’s story—a dynamic songwriter hidden deep within San Francisco’s garage rock nouveau until Merge Records asked for an album—was perhaps one of his best hooks. Devotees of Cronin’s collaborator, Ty Segall, relished the idea of a pianist anomaly in a scene that seemed so singularly fixated on fuzz. It all conspired to artificially inflate MCII’s reception, which helps explain how MCIII sounds so much like it and so disappointing. MCIII’s press emphasizes that it’s a bigger record, stuffed with strings and horns and whatever else, but it's a red herring, a pretty transparent attempt to distract from the record’s fundamental shortcomings. MCIII’s string quartet contributes no more emotional heft than one violist did on MCII’s ""Change"", a song that also benefited from the feeling of velocity intimated by players pushing the beat. There’s less of that live ensemble feel to propel MCIII, none of the syncopated groove from a solid MCII track like ""See It My Way"". Instead, there’s a Greek instrument called a tzouras on ""ii) Gold"", which sounds pretty cool, but that’s a regrettable swap. And even a symphony couldn’t redeem a pop-rock record without commanding lead vocals. Here, too, MCIII suffers a bit. Cronin’s dulcet hesitance has given way to slightly meeker delivery. The hooks are there—in the engaging vocal counterpoint to a descending horn line on the bridge of ""Say"", for instance—but they’re difficult to appreciate. The pat literalism of the lyrics—""I’m not alone,"" ""God, I need some control,"" ""I feel like I’m dying,"" and the like—doesn't help. The conceit of MCIII’s second half involves a song suite about loss of personal agency, acceptance, self-discovery, and other such hallmarks of personal songwriting. This quasi-concept is basically indiscernible, indicated only by some hastily appended numerals at the beginning of each song title (One track, the rather beautiful but interlude-like ballad, ""v) Different"", appeared sans numerals on a compilation last year.) Considering Sonny and the Sunsets’ recent Talent Night at the Ashram and Jack Name’s Light Show, noncommittal concept records are fashionable among Californian garage outliers nowadays, but even a qualified application of the tag to MCIII is a stretch. Once the numerical song suite starts, the most important realization you are left with is that this record is front-loaded. That’s because ""i) Alone"" is an arduous intensity hike to nowhere, ""ii) Gold"" leans on the mid-tempo thud that was tiresome back on Mikal Cronin, and the outro of ""iv) Ready"" is just mercilessly redundant. Some seething guitar solos crop up, but nothing especially unhinged in light of his earlier collaborative work with Segall and MCII’s ace rave-up, ""Change"". Cronin’s lithe vocal melodies do sound beautiful on the spry closer, ""vi) Circle"", a reminder of the voice that commanded so many new listeners last time. Sequenced last, the song title is probably supposed to lend some poetic finality, but it speaks better to Cronin’s creative stasis.","Cronin's MCIII follows in the footsteps of his power-pop breakout MCII, his first for Merge Records. The album adds strings, horns, and unusual instruments to the mix, and features a song suite about loss of personal agency, acceptance, and self-discovery.

Peripheral Vision,Turnover,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad995e6ef95969321ae2/1:1/w_160/b90c9388.jpg,2015-05-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20446-peripheral-vision/,Run for Cover,"Though it’s a warm and often gentle record, not much about Turnover's Peripheral Vision is subtle. Start with the cover, which is a pretty girl in a field, her image washed out, soaked in amber and obscured by a spiderwebbed glass. She’s real, but she’ll be forever out of reach, and this is exactly the kind of feeling Turnover evoke over and over again here, with just enough reverb and treated guitar to create distance and depth around every pensive daydream. If you’re into the idea of planning a mix to commemorate the girl that will get away, there's about seven songs here that can get you started. Quite the coincidence that Peripheral Vision shares a very similar name as Title Fight’s risky, triumphant reinvention Hyperview, as well as its producer. In each instance, a traditionalist punk band goes headfirst into more aqueous forms of indie rock, but retain qualities which put them at an advantage over the countless wan, limp bands who decided to sound like the Smiths from the beginning. In Turnover's case, their pop punk past is nipping at their heels: Their self-titled debut EP justly earned the tag, and even after 2013’s Magnolia smoothed out some of their more Warped Tour affectations, they were doing shows with Dashboard Confessional 2.0, This Wild Life, and the perpetually short-pantsed, hair-gelled schlubs in New Found Glory as recently as last month. But you can tell that they come to their new sound from a realm that prizes vocal, lyrical and sonic clarity—Austin Getz's vocals are unusually upfront and legible for this style of music, and Will Yip’s production is crystalline and sleek. ""Radio-friendly"" is mostly theoretical in 2015, but Yip tends to work with bands who've managed to find young, dedicated, merch-buying audiences who still believe in the idea of big-tent alternative rock as a refuge. And so you hear a lot of atypically crowd-pleasing, extroverted maneuvers here—the gorgeous opening reverie of ""Cutting My Fingers Off"" is blown open by a bridge of pulse-quickening drum rolls similar to Brand New’s ""Sic Transit Gloria…"" or any given Explosions in the Sky song. The chorus of ""Take My Head"" is florid, AP English self-pity delivered as a pop punk shout-along, ""Humming"" is sophisticated bedsit pop that expresses the same desires as ""Dixieland Delight"" or ""Chattahoochee"", minus the geographical signifiers. But just as often, the gap between where Turnover is and where they want to be is painfully obvious. Throughout, Getz's lyrics are either effective or seriously awkward and there’s very little in between. He's earnest enough when he's fussing over his transition into adulthood (""New Scream"", ""Hello Euphoria""), but just as often, he's reading off Robert Smith flashcards, his imagery full of dissolution, disintegration, dizziness, disappearance and descent—you get pretty much all of the above during ""Dizzy on the Comedown"", which reveals the wisdom of bands like Wild Nothing who purposefully go blank on lyrics. Despite its stylistic reverence, Peripheral Vision can actually be novel when Turnover most resemble their previous incarnation. On ""Diazepam"", Getz emasculates himself as a preemptive strike against the inevitable—""Your father doesn’t like me ‘cause I’m not into sports/ And your mother won’t approve because I’m not of the cross/ I took an upper before your sister’s wedding just to help me pretend,"" creating a heretofore-unfathomable nexus between Blink-182 and Galaxie 500. And then there’s ""I Would Hate You If I Could"". Think of your favorite Real Estate song. One of the really chill ones like ""Green Aisles"" or ""Pool Swimmers"". And then, instead of a chorus reminiscing about the simple, bittersweet pleasures of suburban life or the challenges of fatherhood, how about the bitter memories of rough sex with your ex, pinning her against the wall and trying not to wake her roommates. They still sound like Turnover’s application to Captured Tracks finishing school, but retain pop punk’s main lyrical drivers of social and sexual insecurity. It's hard to figure out an appropriate emotional reaction to the raw, honest, and unsympathetic character in ""I Would Hate You If I Could"". Perhaps the message is that even as your tastes in music mature, getting fucked over in a relationship hurts as much as it does when you’re 16. That’s not supposed to be the enduring message of Peripheral Vision, at least not according to Getz. He explained the album’s overarching theme as, ""I always remember things better than they were and miss people more than I should."" Those are the feelings this music is meant to convey, but as a document of a young band in a sharp and tricky growth spurt, Peripheral Vision still can’t hide how messy and complicated real life can get.","On Peripheral Vision, Turnover move past their pop punk origins into sighing, wistful indie*.* The best songs still sound like Turnover’s application to Captured Tracks finishing school, but retain pop punk’s main lyrical drivers of social and sexual insecurity.

We can quibble about the particulars—are robots cool? sure, robots are cool—but in practice, there is no arguing that sci-fi is not cool. Even the Sci-Fi Channel hedged its bet and changed its name to Syfy. I am talking about dimly lit basements and damp, beige convention centers: these are not cool spaces. But Nosaj Thing, god bless him, has done his best to rebuke that notion, to find the sexiness buried under the jumpsuits. Along with Flying Lotus, the Brainfeeder continuum, a bunch of West Coast glitch-hop, and their spiritual forefather, El-P, Nosaj creates music that evokes at once the infinite blackness of deep space and the curving, gleaming chrome that moves through it. It is what plays when you type ""Andromeda galaxy"" in as your Uber destination. Fated is Jason Chung’s third album in six years, and, zoomed out, it’s not so much an evolution as a continuation of the style he’s established. There’s an unearthly sense of calm to the entire affair: the beats skitter, sure, but the hi-hats on ""Erase"" sound like they’re echoing through an empty hull, not going haywire. Opener ""Sci"" takes a minute to breathe to life, runs a finger down some Vangelis chimes, then takes a minute to slowly retire. (At 2:22, it’s one of the longer tracks here.) Listen closer, though, and you can hear the progression Chung’s made over time, perhaps most clearly by looking at the series of ""Light"" tracks that stretch through to his first record. ""Light #1"", from 2009, recalls the laser-fire panic of Ikonika’s debut, which would come out the next year; 2013’s ""Light 3"", which closed off the warmer Home, looked toward '90s drum'n'bass while still making room for keening, heart-sick melodies; this album’s ""Light 5"" is a series of de-escalating pulses, at times registering as little more than a heartbeat. Fated, in other words, is Chung’s case for himself as one of hip-hop’s preeminent modern minimalists, and the results are frequently sublime. You can imagine Thom Yorke hearing the pattering melancholy of ""Medic"" and quietly snapping his copy of King of Limbs over his knee. The otherworldly Primo boom-bap of ""Realize"", at 90 seconds, almost evokes the Midnight Eez or one of Dilla’s dusty old beat tapes, were it not for the wheezing cyborg synthesizers. All of the sonic choices on previous records were similarly meticulous, but here they’re assembled with the almost architectural grace of a Oneohtrix Point Never composition. While Fated follows a direct throughline from earlier Nosaj Thing albums, one can also draw a clear line to R Plus Seven’s fixation on dated computer tones, as well as its sense of slow-burn, alien awe. This is not without its dangers. Splitting the difference between ambient and hip-hop is generally a fast track toward adderall-core study music—shout out to Blue Sky Black Death—and, to be fair, Fated is an overwhelmingly pleasant listen. It is decidedly un-dazzling. But quiet doesn’t mean it can’t also be daring. So many of Nosaj Thing’s contemporaries deal with in-the-red maximalism, all hyper-compressed drums and lens-flare dynamics. But while FlyLo looked at Blade Runner and saw great plumes of fire and neon street fights, Nosaj Thing saw something else: two robots falling in love. Accordingly, Fated’s deeply electronic soundscape is most striking for its humanity. Throughout the record, Chung extracts vocal lines like threads of gossamer, treating human voices like violas to bow in much the same way that, say, Prefuse 73 treated them as toms to thwack. On ""Cold Stares"", the most vocal track of Nosaj Thing’s discography, Chance the Rapper charts the dark corners of this possibility space, musing and sighing and crooning in a robot-human duet. This is a very small sort of revolution, suggesting, like Spike Jonze’s Her, that the delineations between hard sci-fi and soft sci-fi might not be so rigid, and that our transhumanist future might still find room for some of life’s more corporeal pleasures.","On Fated, Jason Chung continutes to makes the case for himself as one of the L.A. beat scene's preeminent modern minimalists. He creates music that evokes at once the infinite blackness of deep space and the curving, gleaming chrome that moves through it.

You Should Be Here,Kehlani,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae1e5e6ef95969321bd2/1:1/w_160/5e882289.jpg,2015-05-06 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20543-you-should-be-here/,self-released,"As red herrings go, first single ""The Way"" off Kehlani’s first official album, You Should Be Here, is a doozy. The song is a sensual shuffle that channels SZA, Jhené Aiko, and Kelela, from spacey, hesitant vocals, to a slowed-and-pitched-down rap (from the typically nimble Chance the Rapper), to the lyrics—it’s a straightforward ode to lust, all about desire and longing and waiting for the moment where wanting and having your partner collide. It’s a fascinating song, and only in the most superficial ways does it suggest anything about You Should Be Here’s loftier goals. The song’s lyrics might be the biggest red herring of all. Kehlani spends most of You Should Be Here switching between telling various dudes to get their shit together and the rest on a mission to inspire humanity. Kehlani has little in common with other former-child-stars-turned-singers Zendaya or Tinashe (Kehlani and her band made it to the finals on ""America’s Got Talent""), and she has little in common with the music of cool, casually misogynistic R&B bros, and in spite of a connection to PARTYNEXTDOOR and hailing from Oakland, neither of those facts figure much into her music, at least on an obvious level. If there’s a contemporary comparison to be made, it’s Frank Ocean. Kehlani, along with right-hand-man producer Jahaan Sweet, shares Ocean’s auteuristic vision and plainspoken eloquence. And, much like Ocean, when Kehlani veers toward the maudlin, somehow the sincerity of it all redeems itself. The beating heart at the center of You Should Be Here forgives some of these dips into mawkishness. You Should Be Here’s dynamism and generosity is something to be amazed by, especially considering Kehlani is all of 19 years old. On the stunning ""Wanted"", she sings, ""As a woman/ When you are broken/ You make a choice to stay down or go in,"" but the chorus, one of resounding triumph, begins with the declaration, ""He makes me feel wanted/ Like no one has before."" Kehlani weaves an emotional, stirring thread through her songs that mostly feels joyful, even when she’s lurking on Instagram (""Jealous"") or being vexed by a new flame (""Yet""). When some of these songs soar in their choruses, like on ""Wanted"", the title track, and the synthy, bubble-gummy kiss-off ""How That Taste"", Kehlani’s full-throated vocals and live-band sound recall '90s R&B groups like Total. But the album also strays to lots of other places: into jazzy, new jack swing-influenced R&B, straight-ahead devotion hymns (penultimate stomper ""Bright""), capital-P pop ballads (closer ""Alive"", which would not sound out of place in a current adult-contemporary rotation). It’s this unabashed ambition that makes You Should Be Here resonate long after one has internalized its motivational urges (""Can't nobody love somebody that do not love themselves"") and tender observations on the mechanics of relationships (see the wistful ""Unconditional""). That Kehlani manages to breathe new life into these sounds and romantic musings is inspirational. She keeps telling people to follow her lead, too—just refer to the album’s title*.*","Kehlani has been compared to Tinashe and other alt-R&B singers, but a closer comparison is Frank Ocean. Kehlani, along with right-hand-man producer Jahaan Sweet, shares Ocean’s auteuristic vision and plainspoken eloquence. You Should Be Here’s dynamism and generosity is something to be amazed by, especially considering Kehlani is all of 19 years old.

Box Set,Red House Painters,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adf6b1335d7bf1699cc7/1:1/w_160/77b72343.jpg,2015-05-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20517-box-set/,4AD4AD,"Red House Painters were fairly popular in the early '90s, but details on them were scarce. This was all before the Internet, so you basically had what a jewel box told you. It's hard to imagine at this point, but when I first heard them, I didn't know anything about Mark Kozelek, the frontman and mastermind behind the project. I'm not sure I knew his name, and I definitely didn't know what he looked like, or his personality outside of the songs. I also had no idea the band was a quartet, or that they lived in San Francisco (in Kozelek's case, via Ohio). At least for me, Red House Painters existed outside of a scene, too. They had a familiar record label with its own distinct aesthetic, but that was the only real touchstone. Not that any of this is bad. The songs on the first four albums—1992's Down Colorful Hill, 1993's pair of self-titled albums (the first nicknamed Rollercoaster, the second Bridge, after the photographs on their covers), and 1995's Ocean Beach (here packaged with the Shock Me EP from a year earlier)—felt personal and private enough that it was easy to get lost in your own head while listening. They featured heartbreaking, personal lyrics and were accompanied by stark, often naturalistic photographs on the covers. The package came with the crystalline, spacious production and Kozelek's clear, powerful voice, and these things merged in an almost mystical way. The material felt less composed or worked over; it was more like the songs were birthed fully formed. They could drift on for more than 10 minutes, but you kind of gave up on keeping track of this kind of thing. When old albums get reissued, which they increasingly do, the practice usually offers a chance to hear familiar songs again, sometimes with remastering, maybe a few bonuses. Some listeners are feeling nostalgic, seeking to recreate the original context in their minds, while many others are learning about the material for the first time, and aren't all that clear on the context beyond the updated liner notes. 4AD's decision to reissue Red House Painters' first four albums as a fairly spare limited-edition Record Store Day box set (on bronze vinyl, with individual album reissues on black vinyl to follow) offers a unique angle: The band's cantankerous frontman (as we can now call him after that whole War on Drugs debacle) is much better known, and known quite differently, all these years later. Now you do know exactly who Mark Kozelek is, or at least you think you do. It's important to remember, though, that the group wasn't just Kozelek. At least not at the beginning. For the first three full-lengths, it was Kozelek on vocals and guitars along with drummer Anthony Koutsos, bassist Jerry Vessel, and guitarist Gorden Mack. (Koutsos and Vessel continued with Kozelek to 2001; Mack left in 1995 and was replaced by Phil Carney, who still plays with Sun Kil Moon now and then.) Starting with Songs for a Blue Guitar, which followed Red House Painters' last album for 4AD Ocean Beach, Kozelek basically started doing everything on his own. He released it on Supreme Recordings, a label owned by John Hughes and under the auspices of Island Records, which reminds me that he's the only person from Red House Painters who also went on to act in movies. Even accounting for the added years and maybe some Kozelek burnout, the four LPs in this boxset remain Red House Painters' most magical records, and some of the most beautiful works of Kozelek's career. If you're someone who's been put off by his feuds and outbursts, put aside those reservations—these records deserve it. And, really, when you come back to them, even after all these years, that mystery somehow still remains. In fact, now and then I need to remind myself just who it is I'm listening to. Unlike later SKM, the vocals are treated with airier effects. The production is deep and spacious, and sounds very 4AD. Kozelek's lyrics are personal, and moving, but come cloaked in ellipses and metaphor rather than the tell-all logorrhea of Benji. The first song we heard from Red House Painters is ""24"", the magisterial slowcore opener on 1992's Down Colorful Hill. It's from the point of view of someone, aged 24, worrying about growing old: ""Oldness comes to rile/ The youth who dream suicide."" This is a concern across all of Kozelek's work, and it's easy to imagine him worrying about these same things when he was 9 going on 10. The start of ""24"" is nearly silent—gentle minimal guitar before drums come in; it almost sounds like the start of a Codeine track. These songs were demos, and are lightly touched up for the proper 4AD debut, but still sound spare and homemade and thin in the best way (a way that works with the confessional tone of the material). Red House Painters are more of a definable rock band on Colorful, though, with fuzzed guitars, martial drumming, and more basic structures; on the slinky post-rock of ""Japanese to English"", you can imagine them in a practice space, jamming it out. In this sense, it's less otherworldly than the next two albums. On the anguished second track, ""Medicine Bottle"", he offers up some of the detail-rich run-on lyricism that he returns to later with SKM. There's a playful country western-tinged sendup ""Lord Kill the Pain"", which takes Kozelek's depressing lyrics to a comical extreme with lines like: ""Kill my neighbors/ And all my family too/ They doubt my direction."" Of course, he's likely partially serious, too. This humor is something Kozelek has maintained, even when his critics think of him as being peevish or over-sensitive. There's the nostalgic, quietly heartbreaking ""Michael"", a song about someone wondering whatever happened to their best friend from years earlier with both funny (""Do you remember our first subway ride?/ Our first heavy metal haircuts?"") and moving (""I remember your smile in the sun/ The day-dreaming boy without your shirt on…"") details. It ends with Kozelek noting that the connection is still there: ""You're the oldest juvenile delinquent bum/ My best friend."" It's the gorgeous title track that hints most at the truly brilliant second collection, Rollercoaster. It's nimble. It feels effortless. It expands to 11 minutes without seeming to push very hard. It barely matters what he's saying because of how it's paced and how it's said. On Rollercoaster*,* it felt like RHP existed outside of everything, and listening now, it still feels that way. Down Colorful Hill is an excellent, idiosyncratic debut, but it doesn't quite prepare you for the 1993 collection. Mark Kozelek produced Rollercoaster, and it's proof enough that he's the best person to be handling the knobs on his own songs: the guitar sound is perfect, songs burst and bloom, the vocals are placed perfectly like ghosts. Overall, Rollercoaster and Bridge, released the same year and featuring songs from the same session, move away from the more songwriterly approach of the other work in Kozelek's career—the production is more distant and expansive, and the instruments are given to lengthy excursions and big blasts of guitars. There are technically 14 songs on Rollercoaster, but it's not the kind of album where you stop to note these kinds of distinctions: Each song feels like a detail in a large painting. On it, Kozelek fears the violence in his blood, remembers being an outcast, worries about getting older and losing meaning and connections (""Scares me how you get older/ How you forget about each other""), dismisses a girl in New Jersey, acts like a romantic asshole (""I still feel the sting in my hand/ From when I hit you/ I keep your picture tidy and safe in a shrine""), confesses that he's afraid to drive, and manages to do all this in moving, atmospheric anthems that resonate two decades later. The songs tend to go on forever, and it seems like Kozelek assumes if he stops, his subject might disappear. He returns again and again to the idea of forgetting, and he doesn't leave out the details that could make him look bad: ""I've had enough of the/ Brutal beatings and name callings/ To lose me to this bed/ Bruised internally, eternally."" You get warts and all, even in songs that feel like they could be sonnets. He wonders a lot where people are. The 13-minute ""Mother"" is filled with the sort of raging fear of loss that we hear later on ""I Can't Live Without My Mother's Love"". The album also features ""Katy Song"", a classic Kozelek eight-and-a-half-minute paean to not being enough. If you ever need to cry on command, I recommend taking a listen. Rollercoaster closes with the brief, compact ""Brown Eyes"", a two-minute acoustic jangle of a song that suggests where he goes on Ocean Beach and onward (and, itself, ends with a lovely 40 seconds of quietly expansive drums and dainty guitars). Rollercoaster was followed by Bridge in October of 1993; it featured songs from the same recording session as Rollercoaster, and on paper looks like an odds and sods—its eight songs include a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's ""I Am a Rock"", a feedbacking rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", and a more electrified, revved-up take on Rollercoaster's ""New Jersey"". But Kozelek is a master of covers, and makes the songs his own; plus, there are more than enough originals here to balance it out. The standouts here are the songs that sound most like they'd fit on Rollercoaster, the pastoral ""Bubble"" and the dark, strummed ""Uncle Joe"", which starts with the line ""where have all the people gone in my life?"" and finds him in pain after late-night television is over. (I've seen kids on lyric ""meaning"" sites likening ""Bubble"" to Internet dating because of lines like ""I embrace the moment, I'm in love with a dream/ And toy with ideas that burn deep inside me/ Cause a picture is all you are to me/ A picture is all you'll ever be."") Throughout, the tone is eerier and somehow more quietly violent than Rollercoaster. This comes to a head on the eight-minute ""Blindfold"" that moves through lyrics like ""What possessed you not to include me?/ How have you failed to invite me/ How could you laugh with her in that theater?/ When you're off and I'm alone?"" and ends with Kozelek howling his best grunge (nay, metal) howl, raging louder than the drums or clashing guitars around him. The final album on the box, and his last for 4AD, is 1995's Ocean Beach. It opens with a sunny, lilting instrumental called ""Cabezon"", three breezy minutes of pleasant music. The album, in general, seems to be Kozelek's California record, and stands out from what came before it. The first proper song, ""Summer Dress"", is in the more usual downcast Red House Painters' mode, but the songs are folkier and less amorphous; overall, this is the one RHP offering you could compare to Toad the Wet Sprocket and be basically right. The hooks are immediate, the sequencing rock-album complete: The wistful ""Summer Dress"" transitions to the gently fuzzed rock of ""San Geronimo"" which moves into the piano-led ballad, ""Shadows"". You get almost hippie-like noodles on the steel-guitars of ""Over My Head"" (before which we get studio chatter that jokingly mentions ""new age windchimes"") and an echo of past melancholia with ""Red Carpet"". It's a stately, well-composed collection, and it's beautiful. The use of feedback is delicate (even on the more searing close of ""Moments"", which is reminiscent of the way Yo La Tengo use feedback). It closes with the 13-minute ""Drop"", one of Kozelek's best heartsick pieces: ""I'd like to come home to see you/ And to catch your sickness by the bedside/ But then you'd know how much I really need you."" With him it's never easy, of course, and he adds: ""But then my hate for you/ Makes my feelings altogether drop."" It's a masterful closer, and an example of how Kozelek can draw you into his world and make you forget time's passage, even as he obsesses over it. For this box, its sister is the four-song Shock Me EP. ""Shock Me"" is a Kiss cover, though you wouldn't know it unless you'd memorized the 1977 original. You get it here in both its four-minute ""electric"" and 11-minute acoustic version, along with two very good, shorter songs, ""Sundays and Holidays"" and ""Three-Legged Cat"". It's great to have it in the box, though sonically, it would've made more sense to pair it with either Rollercoaser or Bridge. Listening closely to these records now shines a light on the rest of Kozelek's career. It's the most you can hope for as far as reissues go, and it really does feel like a skeleton key returning to these albums you thought you knew so well. You think of these songs, with their fear of growing old and dying, and put them in context with all the songs from his youth he and his band have covered (by artists like AC/DC, Kiss, Simon & Garfunkel, John Denver, Paul McCartney), and where he's ended up now, singing about being old, and you realize that time itself was always the preoccupation here, as well as the inevitability of death, even in your happiest moments. And you realize, listening, that you got older, too.","The four early-'90s LPs in this box set remain Red House Painters' most magical records, and some of the most beautiful works of Mark Kozelek's career. If you're someone who's been put off by his feuds and outbursts, put aside those reservations—these records deserve it. Even after all these years, that mystery somehow still remains.

California Nights,Best Coast,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae2d5e6ef95969321bf1/1:1/w_160/be6aa104.jpg,2015-05-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20554-california-nights/,Harvest,"As Voltaire said, if a Best Coast album named California Nights didn’t exist, it would be necessary to create one. This is the band’s third LP, following the Fade Away mini-album that aborted the attempt at repositioning Bethany Cosentino as a stripped-down singer-songwriter, as on 2012's The Only Place. Instead, California Nights layers the fuzz back on top of her distinct voice for a radio-friendly take on '90s alt-rock—an attempt to stay part of the establishment as natural questions arise over the diminishing returns of the band’s core formula. Much was initially made about Cosentino's penchant for pot, even as much of the music on Crazy for You sounded relentlessly sunny in ways that being stoned often is not. Here, the tone is thicker. Producer Wally Gagel also helmed Fade Away, and California Nights is a natural extension; there are the familiar reference points of surf rock and garage rock, and the band occasionally heads in heavier directions. The title track and ""Feeling Ok"" find a midpoint between shoegaze and Sheryl Crow, the strangled reverb of ""Sun Was High (So Was I)"" taken to its well-produced conclusion. When she sings ""I stay high all the time just to get by"" on the former, the music envelops her thoughts like a bad trip. Meanwhile, she’s added faint notes of sophistication: There’s what passes for a bridge on the aggressively catchy ""Heaven Sent"", which is only one line repeated a few times as the music drops in and out in classic pop-punk stop-time, but enough to change up the verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure so ardently followed on previous records. California Nights is a professional album: heavy-ish, filled with hooks, somewhere between ""fast enough to dance"" and ""slow enough to sigh to while looking out of a window."" There’s nothing with the ubiquitous charm of Crazy for You—no ""Boyfriend"" or ""Our Deal""—but Cosentino's voice is bright, clear, and full of emotive sentimentality. As a lyricist, she remains a devout student of what Lester Bangs dubbed the Lou Reed ""I walked to the chair/ Then I sat in it"" school of lyrics; she expresses herself clearly. The nadir comes during ""So Unaware"", when she literally sings ""What is life?/ What is love?""—the core question of many works of art, true, but usually they're explored rather than just stated. As usual with Cosentino, you'll either be infuriated by the simplicity or endeared by its earnestness. Anyways, it's not like ""She loves you, yeah yeah yeah"" is featured on any AP English exams. It's easier to be annoyed when Cosentino lapses into rote sentiments, especially since her voice seems so sure of its rightness. ""Jealousy"" is addressed to those amorphous ""haters,"" the bane of any successful person's existence, and offers the deeply uncomplicated observation that ""girls will be girls and boys will be boys/ It's just the way it is."" A warning sign goes up when you consider Cosentino is no longer a broke-ish slacker sitting on the couch with her cat and her bong. She's achieved a level of success that allows her to appear in whiskey ads and design her own Urban Outfitters clothing line, while ignoring the obvious political implications. And why shouldn't she? Anyone with a problem is only a hater. At times, it seems her insistence on affectless slackerism is less a genuine expression than a cynical pose, aimed at ensuring she stays part of the establishment. As Drake will tell you, there's a lot of money in being fashionably moody. And yet for all the formal or ideological complaints, Cosentino remains remarkably capable of riffing on heartbreak, and the concomitant yearning. On ""When Will I Change"", she sings openly about what some would see as her self-absorption: ""It's not that bad, and I have no reason to be sad/ But I find a way almost every day to stay this way."" Well, it’s honest. If this is what Best Coast continues to give us after six years and three albums, you can either shrug it off or let the vibes carry you away.","California Nights layers the fuzz back on top of Bethany Cosentino's distinct voice for a radio-friendly take on '90s alt-rock—an attempt to stay part of the establishment as natural questions arise over the diminishing returns of the band’s core formula.

Actions,Turn to Crime,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adee5e6ef95969321b7a/1:1/w_160/ea517e98.png,2015-05-05 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20512-actions/,Mugg & Bopp,"If ever anyone needed a reset button, it’s Derek Stanton. Over the course of three promising but frustrating albums with his prior band Awesome Color, the singer/guitarist drove himself into a ditch of Detroit retro-worship. The primal, sexual, radical sounds of the Stooges and the MC5 were Awesome Color’s paint-by-numbers palette, but aside from kicking out a few sweaty, muscular jams, the Michigan-bred band never managed to creep out from under the shadows of their granddads, let alone retool that sound for a new frame of reference. If someone cooks up a Motown: The Musical-style tribute to Detroit’s late-'60s/early-'70s rock scene, Stanton could lead the house band. That’s not entirely a compliment. Stanton managed to find new footing last year with Can’t Love, the full-length debut by his new band, Turn to Crime. With new collaborators Ian Saylor and Dorian Foerg, he’s modified his basic Detroit-centric approach. As on Can’t Love, Turn to Crime’s new album Actions strips away the massive, spastic guitars of Awesome Color in favor of a sculptural, hollowed-out thrum. Instead of finding a new method by which to draw inspiration from his influences, though, Stanton has simply modified that list. It’s not a dramatic shift. Action primarly sets itself apart by doing to Suicide exactly what Awesome Color did to the Stooges: mimicking them. ""This Is What You Wanted"" smears swirls of synths over a stiff, faux-motorik beat that misses the tension between organic and inorganic that made Suicide so astounding. Things get worse on __""__Impatience"", an appropriately named drone that’s about as transfixing as cough syrup dripping from a spoon. The song has the cruelty to stop cold after four minutes, only to lurch back to life and trudge on for another nerve-deadening minute and a half. ""Prince of Slackers"" tries harder, with its loose-lipped, Lou Reed sneer, but its clattering guitars and cardboard-box beat result in the unfortunate—and possibly accidental—outcome of sounding like a half-assed Strokes demo. As with Awesome Color’s collected output, there are glimpses of brilliance on Actions. Stanton’s barbed-wire guitar solo on ""Light"" is a spasm of inspired lunacy; the underwater funk of ""Without a Care"" has a breezily goofy hook to it. The title track is a dead ringer for Iggy’s Berlin period, all chilled melody and Bowie-indebted atmospherics, but stops short of being a rehash. An entire album of such stuff could be beautiful. But ""Feels Right"" highlights Stanton's deficiencies as a lyricist. ""If it feels right/ Then it is right,"" he chants throughout the song’s eight-and-a-half-minute run time. The dedication to such a banal bit of druggy sloganeering doesn’t translate into much; it just seems lazy. But hey, if it feels right, right? Stanton and crew clearly adore the styles of music they emulate. But they refuse—or are simply unable—to ignite with a spark of their own. That is, after all, what groups like the Stooges and Suicide were all about: annihilating shit to see what might spring up in its ashes. When it comes to retroactivity in music, there’s spirited revivalism, and there’s Time-Life oldies infomercial nostalgia. With Actions, Stanton inches closer to the latter.","Derek Stanton's prior band Awesome Color drew primarily from the Stooges and MC5.

Born Under Saturn,Django Django,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adea13d1975652139ff6/1:1/w_160/939fb9bc.jpeg,2015-05-05 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20509-born-under-saturn/,Ribbon Music,"On their Mercury Prize-nominated self-titled 2012 LP, Django Django revived a very specific ""sound of the future"", defined around 2000 by a cluster of ""forward-thinking"" UK rock bands like Super Furry Animals, Clinic, Simian, Badly Drawn Boy, and the Beta Band, and ushered it into the present day. Django Django's hodgepodge approach and affectless harmonizing made the Beta Band reference, in particular, hard to avoid (it probably didn't hurt that drummer/producer David Maclean’s brother used to be in Beta Band). But as a jumping-off point, these influences are limited, and the possibilities of the sound taper off the second you start to repeat yourself or lose your sense of irreverence. On Born Under Saturn, Django Django fall into both traps. Even so, their range of raw skill is impressive. The songs present themselves as physical challenges: Can Django Django give Stereolab’s ""Metronomic Underground"" a jamband reworking? ""Giant"" says ""yes."" Can they repurpose surf-guitar riffs without actually making surf-rock? ""Shake and Tremble"" pulls off that trick. Can the juddering bassline of Big Boi’s 
""Shutterbugg"" coexist with monklike harmonies? ""First Light"" answers in affirmative. But can Django Django juxtapose starched-stiff British accents against vibrant Caribbean rhythms? There’s a thirteen-minute stretch stuck right in the middle of Born Under Saturn, from ""Reflections"" to ""Shot Down"", that emphatically states ""no."" More so than their woolier debut, Born Under Saturn is a demonstration of what Django Django can do rather than what they have to say or how they feel. The almost-constant harmonizing of Vincent Neff’s staid vocals surround these songs in a case of stained glass, lovely but nearly impenetrable. Hammer away enough at the album and some kind of center emerges: ""High Moon"" might be about restorative nocturnal powers, ""Shot Down"" might be a crime narrative, and maybe the album title is meant to suggest a motif of planetary influence and rebirth that gets vaguely touched upon throughout. But Neff lends not a speck of vibrato, grit or inflection to anything, and thus, not a speck of urgency or instability or any emotional resonance. The busy arrangements and serious frontloading make Born Under Saturn’s 54 minutes a demanding investment, and the effort it takes to simply get any sort of visceral pleasure out of it makes it feel twice as long. And so the best record Django Django may end up putting their name on is 2014’s Late Night Tales compilation. It tells you everything about the band that Born Under Saturn does: they see themselves in the lineage of late-'60s, early-'70s pop weirdos, but they listen like modernist samplers and crate diggers—witness the inclusion of Bob James’ endlessly resourced ""Nautilus"". A telling and exciting three-song stretch includes Massive Attack’s supervillainous cover of John Holt’s rocksteady classic ""Man Next Door"", TNGHT’s ""Bugg’n"" and Stankonia deep cut ""Slum Beautiful"". All of those acts have likewise been lauded for their omnivorous artistry and loved because their songs have distinct character and hooks. Django Django are clearly inspired by them, but when I think about how they fit amongst their most frequent comparisons in the UK Class of 2000, I remember SPIN's infamous pick for album of the year: something that also packed an incredible amount of musical information in a small space but was only as lovable as its input. It was ""your hard drive"", and unfortunately, that might be the best likeness for Django Django.","Django Django see themselves in the lineage of late-'60s, early-'70s pop weirdos, but they listen like modernist samplers and crate diggers.

Marauding in Paradise,Jazz Cartier,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae2fc0084474cd0c185e/1:1/w_160/cfc6ca84.jpg,2015-05-05 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20556-marauding-in-paradise/,self-released,"Jazz Cartier is Toronto's first post-Drake rapper, an artist who benefits from Drake’s razing of American rap’s once-inviolable boundaries, but with no formal ties to the OVO crew. Jazz, who also goes by Jacuzzi La Fleur, has managed to build a sizable local fan base—still rare in a city long referred to by local artists as the Screwface Capital—by establishing a grimier counter-narrative to Drake’s opulent, uptown vision of a city newly christened The Six. On his polished debut album, Marauding in Paradise, he deploys the new nickname just once, on ""Local Celebrity Freestyle"", setting up his own us-vs-them, downtown/uptown dichotomy: ""I’m from Toronto, but they call it the Six."" But Marauding isn’t antagonistic: it just offers a counterpoint, a glimpse into a different, younger subset of Toronto’s art and party scene. Living in a city giddy off one man’s come up, Jazz prefers to move to the sound of his own voice. And his elegant, elastic bark is loud and clear: The best moments on Marauding are fearless, theatrical. Jazz assumes the bluster of a corner preacher on ""Guardian Angel"" and gives the intro track about soured relationships a gothic vibe, reminiscent of the skits on early Dungeon Family records. (After a brief verse, the song tumbles into a snippet from Mista’s ""Blackberry Molasses"", confirming the allusion.) Elsewhere, on ""New Religion"" and ""Holy Shit"", he’s unafraid to shriek, wail and growl into the mic. To allow Marauding a chance to connect, you have to push past some of the overt sonic and aesthetic allusions to Houston rapper Travis Scott, which compromise the sound of an original voice shining through. On the evidence of Marauding, however, we should give ‘Cuzzi some time to distill this influence. There’s exciting trial-and-error happening everywhere on the album: His willingness to play with flows, his eye for detail, a surprising grip of giddy, geeky quips (""I’m Kanye with shrugs""; rhyming Dom Perignon with M. Night Shyamalan) and the ability to work with his right-hand-man producer, Lantz. Together, they temper the record’s sometimes-overwhelming maximalism at the right moments. The tape lacks a signature song, one that sums up the world Jazz lives in and invites us in. ""Switch"" and ""The Downtown Cliché"" feature the on-trend pairing of bottom-feeding bass/triplet cavalcades. Lantz distills a variety of vibes, from post-trap bangers and PARTYNEXTDOOR-style bedroom soul to Easy Mo Bee boom bap and the Vine-brittle blap of Terio’s theme song. Most compelling are his transitions, particularly on songs like the beautiful Toro Y Moi flip, ""Rose Quartz/Like, Crazy"", and ""Flashiago/A Sober Drowning"". Here are some things we learn about Jacuzzi from Marauding, though: he is, or has been, a drug-addled party kid and a lovesick lothario, and has gone from being the only black kid in an Idaho classroom to too expensive for your features. It’s not easy to inhabit these identities on a single album—let alone your first—but Jazz is agile enough to pull it off and, like Toronto, he’s still growing.","Jazz Cartier is Toronto's first post-Drake rapper, establishing a grimier counter-narrative to Drake’s opulent vision of the city.

Loyalty,The Weather Station,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acf69d034d5c69bf42a9/1:1/w_160/a66ed205.jpg,2015-05-05 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20330-loyalty/,Paradise of Bachelors,"Tamara Lindeman is no longer singing about white lilacs, wild columbine, rhubarb pie and big jars of honey. On two previous albums as the Weather Station, Lindeman used acoustic guitars, banjos and a lexicon of bucolic imagery to write graceful, generous folk songs. The material wasn’t simple so much as vernacular, so that even the Toronto songwriter’s most intense reflections on love and lust espoused a downhome familiarity. But Loyalty, Lindeman’s third and best LP, continues the inward pull of last year’s incisive EP, What Am I Going to Do with Everything I Know. Her once-plaintive confessionals have morphed into intimate but impressionistic character studies, where the songwriter spares neither herself nor her subjects an analytical eye. And the acoustic instruments that once galloped or crept behind her have morphed into abstract backdrops—sophisticated but understated settings that accent the expressive voice above them. Loyalty feels like a 40-minute glimpse into a secret world, where familiar people (sisters, mothers, lovers) and traditional sounds (a fingerpicked guitar, a patient piano) lead intriguing, uncanny lives. It’s a place that demands to be revisited. To make Loyalty, Lindeman and a minimal crew decamped to a deteriorating French mansion for a long wintertime recording session. Collaboration has long been integral to the Weather Station’s records, from a set of duets released in 2013 to the way in which Everything was recorded by two different bands in two different countries. But only Bahamas leader and multi-instrumentalist Afie Jurvanen and accomplished engineer Robbie Lackritz joined Lindeman along the Seine. They shared production duties, while Lindeman and Jurvanen split a dozen instruments evenly. These 11 songs often suggest you’re sitting with the trio in some small parlor as they play. The drums shuffle or canter quietly. The guitars stay hushed. The only real instrumental break, the smoldering electric coda at the end of ""Tapes"", remains gentle, hinting at an outburst but never delivering it. And whether hitting the brassy highs of ""I Could Only Stand By"" or the diffident lows of ""Personal Eclipse"", Lindeman’s voice rarely rises above an elegant whisper. It’s as if she’s trusting these revelations only to the people in the room. All of this material indeed seems confidential, like a list of life problems that Lindeman is still trying to sort out for herself. Opener ""Way It Is, Way It Could Be"" sets the stage for this exacting ambiguity, where the uncertainty of the future unspools from a discrete, difficult present. Here, a relationship is good but neither as honest nor forgiving as she hopes. The partnership’s survival suggests a Schrödinger’s cat scenario, where Lindeman can simultaneously envision success and failure. During ""Personal Eclipse"", she takes stock of her general discomfort with society—its catcalling men, her introversion amid others’ extroversion, the loneliness such tension can induce—and tries to tease out its source. It’s an open-ended self-evaluation, with more lingering questions than actual answers. And ""Like Sisters"" questions the limits of friendship and choosing sides, even when it imperils your own happiness. ""Sometimes you give, you’re giving all you have,"" she offers, stretching those last words with what sounds like regret. ""And sometimes you’re the taker."" The detail-oriented approach that delighted on the Weather Station’s early records reappears on Loyalty. Mesas are ""strange and red and snowy."" Rivers are ""serpentine, glinting."" The low sunlight of November is ""impossibly bright."" Paired with the external turmoil and internal debate of these lyrics and the private way Lindeman and Jurvanen deliver them, such observations give Loyalty the feeling of fastidiously edited old journal entries—too lean and evocative to be a first draft, but still true to experience. It’s an approach that puts Lindeman in the company of Bill Callahan and Joni Mitchell, songwriters whose careful combinations of pedestrian details and profound insights also created secret, self-sovereign worlds. And like both of those songwriters, she’s a singer with an unmistakable and communicative voice, able to convey hope and hurt with equal clarity. During standout ""I Mined"", Lindeman admits she is stuck: There’s a fundamental but indiscernible flaw in her current relationship. It’s the pea beneath the mattress that keeps her up at night, even as the seasons come and go. She alternately wants to find and fix it or just forget it and carry on. But she knows that’s impossible. ""Your trouble is like a lens through which the whole world bends,"" she confides over prismatic piano, her voice suddenly harmonizing with itself as if to emphasize that this is the record’s thesis. ""And you can’t set it straight again."" These 11 tunes are expressions of woes that you can’t quite correct but can’t let go, either, worries that plague you but push you onward, too. These are public folk songs about the private problems—breakups and makeups, depressions and deaths—we’ve all suffered.","Loyalty feels like a 40-minute glimpse into a secret world, where familiar people (sisters, mothers, lovers) and traditional sounds (a fingerpicked guitar, a patient piano) lead intriguing, uncanny lives.

Runddans,Todd Rundgren/Emil Nikolaisen/Hans-Peter LindstrømTodd Rundgren,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad0f9d034d5c69bf42d9/1:1/w_160/76185d18.jpg,2015-05-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20349-runddans/,Smalltown Supersound,"Todd Rundgren had mastered the art of writing the perfect pop song by the time he was 23—so he’s spent the next four decades trying out pretty much everything else. While his early-'70s chart success posited him as a stateside McCartney, his subsequent career more closely resembles that of an American Eno: a musician-cum-conceptualist who didn’t so much forsake rock stardom for the avant-garde as inhabit both worlds simultaneously. Rundgren is forever at the center of infinite extremes: proto-punk instigator and prog-rock architect, celebrity and cult hero, casino-circuit nostalgia act and remix-ready electronica enthusiast, autocratic auteur and promiscuous collaborator, bitter cynic and spiritual humanist, genius and jester. He’s the iconoclast revered by everyone from Daft Punk to Prince to Earl Sweatshirt; he’s also the guy arguably responsible for inventing Smash Mouth. As he gets older, these internal contradictions have only become more pronounced—this spring sees the release of two albums that respectively play to his accessible and exploratory impulses. But while the song-oriented solo release Global and high-concept progasaurus Runddans couldn’t be more different in sound and scope, they leave similar impressions: while it’s reassuring that Todd Rundgren is still with us in 2015 indulging his every whim, the batshit-bonkers music often misses the mark on ""inspired irreverence"" and lands directly in outright embarrassment. Global is Rundgren’s small-u utopia album, dressing up his meditations on the environment, feminism, civil rights and community in synth-slicked rock and post-rave sonics, recalling 1993’s techno manifesto No World Order—albeit, mercifully, without the attempts at rapping. (And much like his tour for that album, Rundgren’s current stage set is more superclub throwdown than a rock show, with the singer flanked by Dâm-Funk and choreographed dancers.) But it’s an album where the timely, ripped-from-Twitter lyrics—complete with references to Miley Cyrus and Malala Yousafzai—clash awkwardly with the dated sound. For a record so topically consumed with the here-and-now, Global feels like it could’ve come out over a quarter century ago: with its gated-reverb drums, robo-filtered vocal hooks, and arena-rock chug, the opening ""Evrybody"" recalls the Reagan-era moment when '60s veterans started lacquering up old standards with '80s production gloss. ""Blind"", meanwhile, rails against bible-thumping, climate change-denying Republicans over boudoir-summoning soft-rock, complete with a Sanbornian saxgasm. Perhaps Global’s anachronistic sound is Rundgren’s way of emphasizing that the issues he’s addressing were just as pressing three decades ago and we’re still no further ahead. But even more tasteful production couldn’t redeem the goofiness of ""Earth Mother"", a salute to famous female activists torpedoed by rote songcraft and hackneyed lyrics. (""We got a little bit too much testosterone/ Need a little more progesterone."") Rundgren was the rare rocker of his vintage to embrace electronics early on (he was eagerly heralding the death of rock'n'roll as far back as 1975), but Global finds him trumpeting the music’s transformative, communal virtues like a neophyte who’s just come back from his first Burning Man, resulting in tracks (see: ""Global Nation"") that resemble advertising jingles for Euro-trance compilations. Likewise, the acid-house throb of ""Flesh and Blood"" doesn’t simply flaunt the influence of EDM, it’s about EDM; as Rundgren marvels at ""the bang-bang-banging of a drum machine"" and ""the thunderous groove,"" he comes off like a glowstick-twirling Marv Albert doing play-by-play from the middle of a rave. When Rundgren dials down the bluster, Global yields moments of understated beauty: the addiction-themed ""Fate"" boasts a dreamily ascendant chorus, and the soft-focus ""Soothe"" has enough genuine ache to cut through its '80s movie-montage sheen. But for an album preaching a message of unity, Global just doesn’t hold together very well. If Global overwhelms its four-minute songs with conflicting aesthetics, Runddans encounters the opposite problem: it unfurls across an IMAX-sized canvas, but struggles to stretch out its concept to fill the space. The product of a mutual-admiration society forged with Norwegian space-disco dynamo Hans-Peter Lindstrøm and Serena-Maneesh mastermind Emil Nikolaisen, Runddans is a 39-minute album broken up into 12 tracks, meant to be experienced as a single continuous piece. Cleary modelled after the side-long cosmic-fusion suites Rundgren fashioned on 1975’s Initiation or with his contemporaneous art-rock ensemble Utopia, the album is an exciting proposition on paper. While Rundgren regularly communes with classic-rock peers—he’s a long-time member of Ringo Starr’s All-Star Band and appeared on the ex-Beatle's recent solo album—Runddans marks a rare instance of working with younger spiritual kin less interested in his catalog of hits than his excursions into futurist psychedelia. For its first half at least, Runddans lives up to its big-event billing. Its movements are arranged along a loose cycle-of-life narrative that conflates childbirth with spiritual awakening (sample title: ""Liquid Joy From the Womb of Infinity""), with the scene set by an entrancing swirl of oscillating electronics, gong-crash eruptions, and wordless vocals. The moment of birth is marked by Rundgren’s first utterance of Runddans’ central lyric—""I have waited for this moment for what seems like nine lifetimes/ You will never be closer than you are now/ Put your arms around me""—like a parent casting his eyes upon his newborn for the first time; tears of joy spring forth in the form of a gushing guitar solo set atop a celestial disco groove. But once it achieves lift-off 15 minutes in, Runddans must grapple with the same question all new parents face after the immediate thrill of birth wears off: What now? The trio’s answer is to instantly deconstruct what they’ve so carefully crafted, randomly fiddling with console levels and chopping up the beat to bring the piece crashing down. It’s not unlike the sudden tape-slice change-up Tortoise introduced 14 minutes into their own art-rock colossus, ""Djed"", violently disrupting the song at its hypnotic fever pitch. But rather than use the opportunity to open up Rundanns to new structural possibilities, the trio and their small orchestra of supporting players cycle through endless variations on the piece’s main melodic motif, dressing it up variously in space-age bachelor pad exotica, sci-fi Beach Boys harmonies and West African rhythms all while the throughline turns evermore hazy. By the time Rundgren’s incessant vocal line slips out of sync with the Pompeii-scaled Pink Floyd lurch of ""Wave of Heavy Red (Disko Nectar)"", Rundanns starts to feel like the prog rock version of Too Many Cooks: one idea repeated and reformulated past the point of absurdity into the realm of insanity. And sadly, there are no great rewards for your endurance here: unsure of how to end the thing, the trio opt to build the penultimate house workout, ""Ravende Gal (Full Circle)"", around their phone conversations about how to end the thing. Maybe that outcome isn’t too surprising, given Rundgren’s long-standing fondness for breaking the fourth wall. But while Rundanns has all the makings of a late-career triumph, it’s less a new watermark for Rundgren’s sprawling discography than an analog to it: beautiful and baffling in equal measure, all over the map, and beholden to nothing but its own inexplicable logic.","Todd Rundgren continues to play to extremes with two new records, solo release Global and high-concept progasaurus Runddans, made in collaboration with Hans-Peter Lindstrøm and Serena-Maneesh mastermind Emil Nikolaisen. They couldn’t be more different in sound and scope, but they show an iconoclast continuing to indulge his every whim.

Hairball,Nai Harvest,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad98b1335d7bf1699c21/1:1/w_160/c8d3aa92.jpg,2015-05-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20445-hairball/,Topshelf,"Like pretty much every band linked to the ""emo revival"" of the past several years, Sheffield duo Nai Harvest has tried to talk their way out of it. In an interview from last year, guitarist/vocalist Ben Thompson shrugged, ""I don’t want to be picked up as an emo band in 2014 and then thrown on the floor when it’s not a trendy thing to like or talk about anymore."" The connotations and stereotypes behind that term are still a contentious hot topic (no pun intended), so it's in their best interests to keep a distance. But it was merely part of Nai Harvest’s larger concern of being pigeonholed in any way; upon shifting to a grungier, more '90s-indebted sound on EP Hold Open My Head, Nai Harvest stated they didn’t want to be classified as grunge or '90s-revival either. Though Hairball is far slicker and focused than their previous work, Nai Harvest's requests are still likely to fall on deaf ears: you’re more likely to misrepresent them if you don’t talk about the '90s. As with their debut Whatever, it’s an enjoyable listen because of its lack of innovation, rather than in spite of it. But back in 2013, Nai Harvest at least had novelty going for them: It was refreshing to hear guitarists take notes from American Football and Mineral after two straight decades of indie rock more or less acting like Pavement, My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth were the only bands to exist in the '90s. However, Thompson’s twiddly, Kinsella-esque guitar figures of the past have fully given way to fuzzy, jangly open chords. Lew Currie’s zig-zagging, stop-start rhythms have now been aligned to straight-ahead sprints and brisk jogs—think of a more raw Teenage Fanclub or a punkier Ash, but certainly not any bands from the American Midwest. And it does give Hairball a much broader appeal than Whatever. Freed from knotty progressions, Thompson can draw out his vocals in a nasal bray accentuated by a trebly, distorted mic—think of Liam Gallagher fronting the sort of modest UK indie band that Noel might scorn in print because they didn’t aspire to play Wembley. That said, Nai Harvest does have populist ambitions, as evidenced by the production of Bob Cooper, who previously worked with Empire of the Sun and Sky Ferreira. It’s an extreme stretch to recognize his influence without checking the credits first—there’s nothing at all glam about Hairball. It is, however, stylishly tousled, greasy and glossy in a way that makes you think ""Hairball"" would work as an ironic name for an expensive gel. When Nai Harvest are at their most edgy and brash, ""Spin"" and ""Sick on My Heart"" provide a legitimate buzz, just the right amount of bubblegum grunge, tart pop-punk and hi-fi enough production. Which could translate to ""alt"" or ""1995"", though there’s a more contemporary precedent, as Nai Harvest situate themselves in the six-month span in 2010 between Wavves’ King of the Beach and Cloud Nothings’ self-titled album. But the comparisons become less flattering and more revealing as Hairball goes forward. Dylan Baldi cannot stop writing indelible hooks, while Nathan Williams’ personality always manages to emerge whether his records sound like an oxidized cassette or a million dollars. Nai Harvest...well, they don’t like to be confined, but that’s something that comes across more clearly in their interviews. With barely any deviation in tempo, tone or texture, Hairball just wads up into an indistinguishable mass: Thompson’s vocals predictably trace over the chord progressions or they just double lead riffs. Throughout, he’s bummed about something or other, girls, growing up, himself—it's all part of the same malaise. ""Ocean of Madness"" is the standout by default, since it has an actual bassline and an appealing, ""Semi-Charmed Life""-style cadence in its bridge. But just when it appears that Nai Harvest has set itself up for the big score, Thompson offers this as the chorus: ""Don’t let me drown in an ocean of madness/ I wanna swim in an ocean of you."" This may be the first revelation of Thompson’s songwriting personality, as ""Gimme Gimme"" shows a similar sweet tooth for cloying power-pop. But when he sings, ""gimme gimme your sugar joy,"" it doesn't feel like sincerity, but that most unfortunate of '90s influences: sarcasm. Hairball is certainly an evolution for Nai Harvest, but it’s tough to really call it progress.","Nai Harvest draw influence from '90s emo and alt-pop, and Hairball, like their debut, is an enjoyable listen because of its lack of innovation, rather than in spite of it. Some of the album recalls the tart pop-punk spot between Wavves circa-King of the Beach and Cloud Nothings.

Fading Love,George FitzGerald,by: Jamieson Cox,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad979d034d5c69bf43cb/1:1/w_160/e7093452.jpg,2015-05-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20444-fading-love/,Double Six,"A quiet figure on the periphery of this generation of British electronic music, George FitzGerald has spent the last half-decade carving out a space for himself with a series of increasingly refined EPs, singles, and remixes. If you want to think of that space in purely geographic terms, it's somewhere between the pop-friendly house and garage of his native London and the patient, muted techno of his adopted home, Berlin. You can also think of it as music with one foot in the club and another in the aisles of your local fast fashion emporium, living in that liminal realm between body music and headphones-oriented composition. FitzGerald isn't an innovative force by any means, but he's an expert synthesist, able to fold a wide array of influences into radiant, splashy cuts like 2013's high water mark ""I Can Tell (By the Way You Move)"". Fading Love is his first full-length release, and it's marked by a maturity that FitzGerald's earned through his time in the trenches, writing and mixing and performing dozens of live sets. As part of the larger arc of FitzGerald's career, Fading Love is a natural step forward: it's his most writerly album to date, largely eschewing software and completely avoiding sampled vocals in favor of more rounded, organic sounds and live guest vocalists. Its best qualities are ones that typically lurk in the background of electronic music: restraint, consistency, and an eye on achieving larger thematic goals. The album is built around a relationship that fell apart, and it's appropriately overcast given that fact. There are moments where you can hear FitzGerald toying with a melody that could easily fill a club or send a festival crowd into a frenzy, only to pull back and focus on melancholy once again; ""Knife to the Heart"" is the best example, with a titanic synth line worthy of EDM's bro princes relegated to spot duty. Its other highlights find a middle ground between the genteel, bookish techno of label-mate Jon Hopkins and the ruthless pop-house of Disclosure, electronic music's reigning boy kings. Single ""Full Circle"" and ""Crystallise"" manage an impressive balancing act: you can imagine them slotting in on the radio somewhere, but they also don't sound quite like anything else in that sphere. Delicately constructed and heavy with emotion, they're the best examples of what FitzGerald can accomplish working in this transitional vein. Fading Love is set up to reward the same focus it demonstrates: if you dig into each new muted meditation and immerse yourself in FitzGerald's bubbling little temples of thought, you'll find yourself entranced. It doesn't have the same impact when it's flipped on in the background, soundtracking chores or a morning commute: then, it verges on soporific. The guest appearances by singers Oli Bayston (a.k.a. Boxed In) and Lawrence Hart don't help: they're meant to complement FitzGerald's arrangements rather than create any sort of spark. FitzGerald has talked about playing these songs live and reaching the live proficiency of artists like Caribou, an exciting prospect—it's easy to imagine the bulk of Fading Love blooming into something more cathartic and immediately engaging. But even in this basic state, the album is a complete statement that's comfortable in its own skin.","FitzGerald is an expert synthesist who merges the pop-friendly house and garage of his native London and the patient, muted techno of his adopted home, Berlin.

Almighty DP,Chief Keef,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929addfc0084474cd0c17d5/1:1/w_160/5023ddf1.jpeg,2015-05-04 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20502-almighty-dp/,self-released,"In the 1985 William Friedkin film To Live and Die in L.A., Willem Dafoe portrays a murderous counterfeiter who paints in his spare time—only to burn the canvases. As his Instagram teasers and leaked YouTube snippets suggest, Chief Keef's official releases are just the tip of a massive recorded archive. But Keef is interested in what he's doing today, not what he's done; new projects make his old work irrelevant. Many of his songs, long-forgotten evidence of a particular tributary of his evolution, lay dormant, unreleased, or lost—like the original version of Bang 2, which promised songs such as the DP Beats-produced ""Stop Calling"". Although credited to Lil Keis when it leaked—DP was locked up at the time—the song was the first in a series of collaborations between DP Beats and Chief Keef. At the time, its addictive giddiness suggested a surefire smash; now it languishes in poor quality on YouTube—burned, essentially—and Keef has long since moved on. Almighty DP is a DJ-free CD-quality compilation put together by DP Beats himself, the first in a series of tapes culling the duo's work together, songs released primarily over the course of the past year. It's essential not just because the music is uniformly great—by any standard, this is one of the most consistent tapes in Keef's catalog—but because it captures a period of time in which each individual piece is in danger of being lost, released only as a low-quality YouTube snippet, or perhaps never seeing the light of day at all. Where Young Chop built upon more maximal tendencies, DP Beats is detail-oriented, conveying more subtle shifts of mood. Though the producer is based in North Carolina, his sound has shaped the popular music of the Midwest: the enigmatic melancholy of ""Tec"" and its sour brother ""Fool Ya"" were both major regional records last summer, with ""Fool Ya"" receiving regular spins on Power 92 and cresting 8 million views on YouTube. Though neither made an official Chief Keef project, both are included here in pristine quality, capturing drill music's recent drift into the disorienting. DP's more recent work is represented in cuts like ""Don't Love Her"" (originally intended for Keef's unreleased Thot Breaker project), which piles on layers of keyboard melodies to suggest a sugary rush. It's the kind of giddy thing which would normally accompany a song about a new crush, giving Keef's icy denials an ironic frame. Many of the best records here work similarly, as miniature synthesizer symphonies that aim for synapse-overload. Though DP's work shares the same roots as the 808 Mafia formula that dominates the Southern club circuit, he's got more ideas, a more subtle sense for vibe, and ornate tastes. DP likes active snares and tricky drum programming, and Keef—in splitting the difference between rapper, auteur, and songwriter—knows how to best complement these widely varying canvases. On ""Runnin""—one of the tape's more recent records—he fits his voice right at the center of the cascading keyboards with a hooky central melody, letting the beat swirl around him. When the melody jumps up and down like a jagged EKG, as on ""Worries,"" he raps with a deadened affect. The records which best illustrate the duo's chemistry, though, aren't always the most complex: ""Know She Does"" relies on a simple four-note melody, and its directness is euphoric. But perhaps the tape's best record—the bonus track ""Rolls"", hidden on the second half of ""All In""—is the best example of DP's ability to effortlessly juggle intricate, interlocking melodic pieces without losing sight of the bigger picture. The swarming whirlwind of sound acts as a sweet release while Keef croons in craggy autotune. But the song's success is all in the details, the way DP plays with the EQ settings, giving shape to the track that makes it less loop than song. Anyone interested in current street rap's potential for emotional breadth shouldn't miss it.","Almighty DP is a compilation put together by Keef collaborator DP Beats, the first in a series of tapes culling the duo's work together.

Their energy comes from punk but their style comes from somewhere older and more obscure—a Victorian attic, maybe, or the kind of basement where the band’s singer Frances Quinlan got turned onto punk in the first place. This was ten years ago or so. Quinlan had just graduated from high school and was touring around with a folk record influenced by playful, sharp-witted writers like Joanna Newsom and Kimya Dawson. The record, Freshman Year, felt cute and warm but took dark turns into the nightmare logic of children—one song, called ""Bruno Is Orange"", is sung from the perspective of a girl who fears that the government is going to put her friend in jail because the two of them kissed. Eventually, Quinlan formed a band with her brother Mark and a bassist named Tyler Long and assumed a sound that filtered Quinlan’s storytelling through the rough, emotionally unguarded approach of bands like Rilo Kiley or Bright Eyes—bands who turned diary entries into anthems and vulnerability into a shuddering kind of power. Their first album, 2012’s Get Disowned, is a messy world where people stomp on old floorboards for percussion and saw violins like they were made of something stronger than wood. Everything is governed by Quinlan, who sings in the wild voice of someone casting out demons (or having the demon cast out of them). Its second song, ""Tibetan Pop Stars"", should be etched in titanium and shot into outer space for safekeeping. Painted Shut is cleaner but just as purposeful. The album was produced by John Agnello, who has also worked with Kurt Vile, Dinosaur Jr., Sonic Youth and the Hold Steady—bands who play full-blooded classic rock with an idiosyncratic slant. (Quinlan once ended an interview by thanking Neil Young and the nature documentarian David Attenborough, both of whom have fascinated stoners and gentlefolk alike for decades.) For as bullish and dramatic as the music seems, the songs here often escalate for several minutes before making a point you think they’ve already made, like a series of false floors that open to bigger and bigger rooms. Quinlan is a sharp writer who understands the poetry of deflection, of putting herself to the side of the drama instead of in the middle. ""Powerful Man"" tells the story of a parent hitting their child from the perspective of a teenage bystander: ""Your dad told you not to look at me/ Down came the fists hard upon your head,"" she sings, no special inflection. ""I was the only other adult around/ I was the only other adult around."" What might’ve been just another routine tragedy becomes an exploration of guilt and responsibility. After all, Quinlan can do something about the situation but the kid can’t. Painted Shut is being released on Saddle Creek, a label built on the kind of romantic, middle-American indie that made Hop Along possible in the first place—music more indebted to the 1970s than the 1980s, more to the earnest mythologizing of folk than the grandstanding of rock, more to the fantasias of Edward Gorey and e.e. cummings than to the flash of the city; music for rickety houses in college towns and the lonelyhearts who collect in their corners like dust and give each other stick-and-pokes. I’d say it all seems old-fashioned but it has been this way for about 25 years and seems part of a longer continuum all the time, so who knows. My favorite song here is a dusky, countryish ballad called “Horseshoe Crabs”. “Hey did you hear me, mom? Baby’s headed home,” Quinlan sings. “Against your wishes I went into the woods alone.” She goes on to tell us about concrete things: A pellet gun, a broken nose, a Jackson C. Frank song played for a college kid on his nylon-string guitar. Nothing seems to mean much alone but it accrues a kind of magical importance, a collection of almosts-but-not-quites. Heartbreak here isn't an abstraction but an event, one in which something falls on the ground and breaks and nobody seems to have the wherewithal to put it back together. As for the Jackson C. Frank song, Quinlan barely makes it through, but like all the failures documented on Painted Shut she still manages to sound triumphant singing about it.","The Philadelphia band Hop Along's energy comes from punk but their style is indebted to the romantic, middle-American indie of Bright Eyes and Rilo Kiley.

PC Music Volume 1,Various Artists,by: Jia Tolentino,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae1cc0084474cd0c183b/1:1/w_160/34a49311.jpg,2015-05-04 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20542-pc-music-volume-1/,PC Music,"PC Music Volume 1 is anti-physical music for an anti-physical time. Like everything that A. G. Cook’s London-based label’s released since 2013, these 10 songs are invocations of the hyperreal, created to meet the anxieties of an age where bodies are rarely written about as sites of joy or authenticity, and more frequently discussed as zones of inequity, violence, embarrassment and pain. The desire to exist as a well-tended garden of pixels fuels many of our culture’s dominant systems: the databases of altered thoughts, distorted images, the avatars that demonstrate reaction or stand in for action. Like all of these networks and products, PC Music answers our desire to escape the burden of physical presence—and in the process ends up sharpening and perpetuating the desire even further. Both a label and a self-contained genre, PC Music is constructed from deep abstractions of pop and experimental electronic music; its building blocks are the musical equivalent of emoji, symbols that replace words that replace voices. It’s an airbrushed articulation of digital life in all its silly, beautiful, desperate triviality; it has an avant-garde surface but is reactionary in its bones. Sonically, it’s a response to today’s alarmingly easy production glosses, the intense plurality of sub-subgenres that flourish online. If pop’s basic work is to grab you by the heart, PC Music flips and disses that aim completely. The label’s sound resembles what aliens would produce if they sunk a jukebox in acid and then tried, from the randomized wreckage, to communicate some version of love. Instead of affection, they’ll give you a heart-shaped simulacrum—and maybe, as suggests PC Music, that’s what you wanted after all. When physical presence is a source of so much complication, sometimes an abstraction is the only thing a person can bear. A test of the boundaries, possibilities and limitations of this ultra-focused aesthetic, PC Music Volume 1 compresses two years of work into a half-hour. Taken together, the rapturous, nightmarish cartoon corpus is maddeningly effective; it solidifies PC Music’s ability to only produce strong reactions, whether starry-eyed captivation or powerful revulsion or a nauseating juxtaposition of both poles. There’s a meaningful spectrum of approaches within the PC Music ethos—classical composer Danny L Harle’s ""In My Dreams"" has a heartbreakingly soft, sweet, harmonic gravity, while A. G. Cook’s alter ego Lipgloss Twins’ ""Wannabe"" is a chopped-up, anti-melodic spatter of brand names and robot garble—but there’s a relentless logical consistency to the sound. Every track feels almost auto-generated, scrambled, which makes the human precision in each arrangement even more eerie: PC Music sounds chaotic but is sneakily minimalist, deliberate to the last distorted note. The calculation behind this effect is a large part of what makes it monstrous: it’s the sound of whimsy without spontaneity, lightness without joy, longing without knowledge, aggression with no object. It’s a dollhouse universe, for female voices and female figures only. The male producers and artists are controllingly invisible in PC Music, and it’s hard to say whether that’s a real aesthetic constraint or a deliberate large-scale perpetuation of the idea of women as powerless, squeaky, sweet. The genre, anyway, has been slapped with labels of ""gender appropriation,"" and the sound does feel awkwardly, distinctly male sometimes, in its ""South Park""-ish warehouse artlessness. But, if anyone’s really in drag here, it’s humans pretending to be avatars—the total elision of soul. Like a Kardashian, PC Music cannot be insulted by the word ""contrived."" PC Music is deeply contrived; it’s fake as hell, that’s the point, that’s the entire energy. But this ethos, of course, has its limits. PC Music only works when its theoretical intention lines up with its physical effect: when you listen to it and become instantly depersonalized, blissfully and bubbly, more pixel than flesh. The best route to this end naturally centers on pleasure. In Volume 1, the pastel jelly-bean melodies and baby-girl anime coos of Hannah Diamond’s ""Every Night"" and A. G. Cook’s ""Beautiful"" reach this synthetic liftoff; the two pair up again for ""Keri Baby"", a maniacally playful track with a stormy bassline, a bubble noise vamping, a refrain of ""Give it to the girl/ Give it to the girl/ Give it to the cutest girl."" The closing track, easyFun’s ""Laplander"", is transcendent: all simulated mechanical longing, synth squeaks and stilted voices reaching for ecstasy. In tracks that are less joyful—GFOTY’s ""Don’t Wanna / Let’s Do It"", for example—the self-perpetuating darkness and denial that PC Music draws on gets a little too clear for comfort. PC Music is escapism whose primary effect is to remind us of what we’re trying to escape. We can’t trade body for avatar; we can’t displace longing forever. But for the space of an album—the sheer forcefulness of this intention smashed into a dizzy half-hour span—the sincerity within our most fundamentally artificial impulses comes calling. You wish you didn’t live in a world that produced PC Music, but you do—and because you do, thank the god in the machine for PC Music. It’ll come whispering and screaming in an absolute vacuum; it’s a party reconstituted long after anyone’s been there to laugh. It’s empty, and yet somehow the stakes are monumental. Can you chip your way to the real through this pixelated thicket? Well, you can, and worse, you have to.","PC Music Volume 1 compresses two years of A. G. Cook's London-based label into a half hour.

Fast Food,Nadine Shah,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ada15e6ef95969321af3/1:1/w_160/81d48f36.jpg,2015-05-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20452-fast-food/,Apollo,"Nadine Shah has a dark, plum-tart voice, with a generous vibrato that trembles on ""warble""; in a recent Quietus profile, even her own mother mistook her for a man (Drenge was playing on BBC, and her mother thought it was her, to Shah’s amusement). When her voice enters, the atmosphere changes. She can make almost anything sound remarkable, or at least interesting, and her sharp, incisive rock songs shimmer with a ripe theatricality every time she opens her mouth. Each song on Fast Food, her second LP, feels offered up and expertly framed, a series of rock songs given the lighting and treatment of museum objects. There is nothing particularly surprising or unsual going on in the makeup or her composition, which combine acoustic guitars with reverb’ed electric, a pretty time-honored and standard backing. But the band, which is excellent and intuitive, feel mostly in place to set the stage for Shah, who stands at the footlights on Fast Food and creates a powerful sense of intimacy and vulnerability. The best songs here zero in on a single evocative moment and spellbind you with it. She has been compared, often, to PJ Harvey and Nick Cave (""That damn Nick Cave"" even gets a wry-sounding shout-out from Shah on ""Fool"") and while you can’t exactly hear Rid of Me or The Boatman’s Call resounding in Fast Food, she shares a certain sea-swept melancholy and a preoccupation with power. On ""Matador"" she moans about hooded eyes and nightfall over spaghetti-western guitars, which swell into a slightly cartoony blood-moon peak. ""I heard you were a man who does not cry,"" she sings with an audibly curled lip on ""Washed Up"". Maybe because her voice is already so distinct, and such a larger-than-life character, the songs that dial back to smaller moments tend to hit the hardest. They feel the most humane, and the most affecting. She can sing with tremendous tenderness, and ""Divided"" is a terrific love song, full of specific feeling. ""I let my hair loose for you, but I would scrape it back as soon as I would leave,"" she sings huskily. Something about the catches and crags in her delivery, her halting phrasing, carries the weight of real conversation, something between lovers over morning coffee. She told Rookie that the song ""Stealing Cars"" is about her struggles with panic attacks, and how irrational thoughts manifest themselves in her dreams. The song moves at a leisurely pace, while her vocal traces a drowsy arc around three or four notes. It doesn’t feel like anxiety, but it invites you close anyhow, using an admission of struggle as a sort of invitation into an inner circle. It’s gorgeous, especially when the harmonies sail in and flesh out the main melody with a downward tug of yearning. There isn’t much going on in the lyrics, just a few images about finding solace in the arms of another; Shah’s best work hangs on simple gestures. ""And there was nothing else to do but fall in love with you""—those are the only words to the five-minute, two-chord ""Nothing Else to Do"". It’s a gorgeous, fairly time-stopping song, a moment that doesn’t need any elaboration to transfix you. It just needs the sentiment, the bare accompaniment, and Shah.","Nadine Shah has a dark, plum-tart voice that makes almost anything sound remarkable.

Foremost & Fair,Home Blitz,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ade2c0084474cd0c17dc/1:1/w_160/7783f2bf.jpg,2015-05-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20504-foremost-fair/,Richie,"Preceding nearly every line on Foremost & Fair is a gasp. On the opener, ""Seven Thirty"", Home Blitz frontman Daniel DiMaggio erratically sucks air in before he pushes any out. Those spasms anticipate the album’s pace: Foremost & Fair is a spritely, frantic power-pop record, and when it does lose momentum, it’s an act of willful, jarring derailment. Which is fantastic, since DiMaggio knows the mechanisms of a song intimately enough to enact swift sabotage and leave a gorgeous wreck. While other recent power-pop records have owed a debt to tuneful punks like the Buzzcocks, Home Blitz is more evocative of power-pop’s nonstarters: the now-marketable misfortunes of Big Star and Rockin' Horse and the skinny-tie flops who disappointed label execs in the wake of ""My Sharona"". It’s a good time to be into that stuff. Labels like Sing Sing Records have redeemed scores of bands once snubbed by market forces or their own immutable peculiarities. Foremost & Fair brings the latter camp to mind, except Home Blitz sounds simply committed to its left-field flourishes. Sure, nowadays the genre has relatively little commercial potential to squander, but DiMaggio flaunts his oblique streak like a point of pride, or protest. It’s what compels repeated listening. To begin, there’s his voice: Breathy like Brett Smiley or Milk ‘n Cookies’ Ian North, unapologetically affected like Game Theory’s late Scott Miller, and often a bit pitchy. DiMaggio spikes saccharine melodies with bratty little gestures, rebelling against his own compositional knowhow. Also, the vocals rest decidedly on top of a mix that’s saturated with shimmery tones: teeming harpsichord, zippy keyboard, sunburst acoustic guitar picking. There’s little low-end to temper all of that, which amounts to an almost unrelentingly bright listen and underscores the album’s insistent urgency. The very first line goes, ""Seven-thirty headed towards seven forty-five."" The 37-minute record scrambles to fit into that 15-minute window. Foremost & Fair’s A side is a salvo of impeccable songs. ""I'm That Key"", sequenced second, surges with radiant vocal hooks, careens through a solo, and stumbles into a busted outro. On ""The Tide"", DiMaggio cheekily narrates romance and seaside whimsy, while ""A in E"" is reminiscent of approximately eight swaggering Big Star tracks. ""Downtown"" is the album’s punchiest song, where a clipped riff trades jabs with the trap kit before it collapses into an arrhythmic bridge and then regains velocity. The longest song, at almost five minutes, is ""The Hall"", where chintzy snare and clinking metal keep a glacial pace as sharp keys and guitar ring out beneath DiMaggio’s bleating. It’s an audacious centerpiece, like grandiose glam balladry running a glitter deficit, and a signal that DiMaggio isn’t content to dish sugary ditties, which ""Why It Cries"" almost immediately reinforces—without the same listening pleasure. ""Why It Cries"" is longer than ""The Hall"", but it can’t exactly be called a song. For over five minutes, it sounds like someone is looking for something in a cluttered music studio, appended by an impromptu Celtic jam. Since DiMaggio’s songs tend to implode in one way or another, ""Why It Cries"" seems like the autodestruct function planted at the core of Foremost & Fair as a whole. Or maybe it’s an elaborate set-up for a cruel joke: Slog through the tedium and meet ""Sick and Crazy"", an exultant song that’s punishingly short at a mere 44 seconds. DiMaggio, who has helmed Home Blitz for about 10 years, has issued scores of format, label, and genre-ambivalent recordings. Considering all of that, the initial panting on ""Seven Thirty"" is less like anticipation of the upcoming sprint and more like reeling from an earlier marathon. In hindsight, that bit of sputtering will also emerge as a clarion call for the whole of Foremost & Fair: DiMaggio foregrounds eccentricities, which only outlines the strength of his conventional songwriting in relief.","Home Blitz's Foremost & Fair is a spritely, frantic power-pop record.

The Good Fight,Oddisee,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad56c0084474cd0c16e6/1:1/w_160/a80bc5b2.jpg,2015-05-01 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20397-the-good-fight/,Mello Music Group,"Oddisee’s music has taken many forms over the years: On his early compilations—101, Foot in the Door and Mental Liberation—Odd was the scrappy upstart, his distinct D.C. drawl and heavy drums carrying a unique ""golden-era"" hip-hop tinge. As leader of the Diamond District with rappers yU and Uptown XO, Odd is the mature figurehead: The group’s 2009 debut, In the Ruff, is a widely heralded classic in D.C.’s underground rap circles. In 2011, Oddisee released what’s probably his most lauded project to date, Rock Creek Park, a mostly instrumental album dedicated to his own bike rides through the sprawling D.C. landscape. By 2012’s Odd Renditions, you got a sense that he wanted greater visibility: He spit rhymes on Bon Iver samples and flipped Marvin Gaye into a danceable rap tune. Though in recent years, Oddisee’s tone has grown more acerbic. On his 2013 mixtape, Tangible Dream, Odd wagged the finger at fake friends and naysayers. He reserves some vitriol for The Good Fight, his sophomore album, though he sounds remarkably comfortable throughout its 12 tracks. He does more singing (""First Choice"", ""Meant It When I Said It"") and flirts with different time signatures (""Counter-Clockwise""). ""That’s Love"" recalls spacious funk, and on ""Fight Delays"", he brags a little more than usual: ""They tell me I ain’t buzzin’, well, last year I made well over a hunnid stacks."" That sort of straight-ahead statement is rare for Oddisee, who’s largely kept silent about his financial gains, though in 2010 he moved to Brooklyn from the D.C. area to further monetize his career. The Good Fight is technically a hip-hop record, but the vibe here is decidedly eclectic, building upon the kaleidoscopic method he’s employed for 13 years. If Odd’s debut album addressed the uncertainty he felt about his artistic trek, The Good Fight proclaims the success of said path. He references a ""working"" plan that eschews mainstream attention and the fame that comes with it, choosing instead to be the low-key jetsetter culling inspiration from his global travels. As a result, The Good Fight exudes a sense of artistic freedom not heard on Oddisee’s previous releases. The music feels distinctly international and unhindered, far removed from the straight-ahead boom-bap he used to make. He’s always created on his own terms, but The Good Fight feels like a hearty ""fuck you"" to prevailing groupthink and the industry’s creative limitations. Still, it’s clear Odd has grown tired of the false starts. On ""Want Something Done"", he complains about the phone meetings. He bemoans superficial demands and his own struggles to be heard. ""Glorifying music that’s abusive and a threat to us,"" Odd quips, ""and if you got a message in your records, you collecting dust."" That’s become a common theme for him, in particular, on 2012’s ""That Real"", where the rapper contemplated his vision and the widespread anonymity felt by underground rappers. He revisits the notion on Good Fight standout ""What They’ll Say"", but the message quickly floats by: ""I know that my intentions go unnoticed, a part of me wants attention."" That’s long been Oddisee’s dilemma: On the surface, you’d think he doesn’t care about making it, yet there’s a part of him that values mainstream acceptance. The Good Fight is a streamlined reminder to ignore the restraints. Great music is great music, no matter where it comes from.","On his new album, The Good Fight, rapper/producer Oddisee eschews mainstream attention and creative limitations. It's technically hip-hop, but it goes in all sorts of musical directions.

Transporteur EP,Bitchin Bajas,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adc1ea9e61561daa617e/1:1/w_160/1507025e.jpg,2015-05-01 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20476-transporteur-ep/,Hands in the Dark,"On last year’s self-titled double LP, the Chicago-based trio Bitchin Bajas—which began as an offshoot of psych-rock ensemble Cave—paid expert homage to the zone-out music of the 1960s and '70s, perfectly reconstructing the psychedelic easy-listening of the era. The group—Cooper Crain, Roberty Frye, and Dan Quinlivan—got all of the ingredients right. The record’s eight compositions were perfectly dialed in, both in terms of influences (Terry Riley, Laraaji, Popol Vuh) and the vintage gear and methods required to channel them (tape machines, loops, electric organs). It was like taking a stroll through a museum exhibit, a blissed-out reminder that, at this point, ambient music has a deep and well-established history. Bitchin Bajas appeal is that they so expertly recreate a style of music designed for simple pleasure. This might make the trio sound like some sort of New Age cover band, but that’s not exactly the case. They don't create knock-offs or copies. Instead, they apply the same compositional methods and get results that are unique, but familiar. If you've spent some time with Terry Riley’s A Rainbow in Curved Air, Fripp and Eno’s Evening Star, or the Kuckkuck label catalog, Bitchin Bajas will register as more of a good thing. But on the group's latest EP, Transporteur, the trio has stepped back from their influences a little. The music is still meditative and trance inducing, but it’s harder to draw a direct line to an existing work or style. Even though it’s labeled as an EP, at 34 minutes Transporteur is a sizeable chunk of music—four pieces that almost all stretch out to around nine minutes. The tracks are still based on repetitive looping phrases, but the instrumental palate has shifted, moving away from sounds that were wedded to yesterday's mystical moment (mainly, the electric organ) and relying more heavily on sequenced analog synthesizers. The first two tracks, ""Rias Baixas"" and ""Planete T"", hew more closely to the Bitchin Bajas' established formula. A droney loop is introduced, then augmented with lush keyboard figures. It's great and thoroughly drifty stuff, if reminiscent of pastoral German synth noodlers like Cluster. The EP's second half moves into more distinctive territory. On ""No Tabac"", a percussive synthesizer sequence is paired up with flute doodles, which slowly evolve and accumulate urgency. Closer ""Marimba"" is particularly unusual. The process is basically the same—a burbling synthesizer loop evolves with the accumulation of additional instrumentation. Only here, the focus is on rhythm and percussion, rather than ethereal tones and pads, with seemingly random bongo-like sounds, hand claps, shakers, and additional percussive elements. At times, the music recalls Congolese electric thumb piano ensemble Konono N°1, albeit with a more overtly psychedelic bent. It’s excellent modern ambient music, exercising restraint, never crashing into a crescendo, and sustaining interest while remaining rooted in repetition. In addition to a great record collection and a well curated studio, Bitchin Bajas have also internalized the concepts that made vintage ambient music engaging. Particularly, how tape loop-based or repetitive compositions can distort your perception of time, that they can supply a sense of stillness in motion, where seven minutes can slip by almost entirely unnoticed.","Chicago-based trio Bitchin Bajas once again pay homage to the zone-out music of the 1960s and '70s, perfectly reconstructing the psychedelic easy-listening of the era. But this time they are carving out an even more distinct path.

+-,Mew,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acb813d1975652139dfe/1:1/w_160/d3a6b8f6.jpg,2015-05-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20288--/,InterscopePIAS,"A summation of Mew's position: Mew are seriously uncool; they are also too cool to be popular; they are somehow both at the same time. Blame prog-rock for giving them a raw deal. The Danish quartet certainly had the optics to earn the tag: witness their magnificent hair and garish album covers. They've also released only two LPs in the past nine years, and one was meant to be listened to as a continuous 54-minute suite and had a 23-word poem as its title. But unlike contemporaries Muse or the Mars Volta or Coheed and Cambria, Mew isn’t alerting sheeple to the mindcrimes of the Matrix, nor does their technical ability manifest in 64th-note runs in 11/8 time. They mostly write love songs. All of which made them one of the more unique, if not necessarily successful, rock bands on a major label in the past decade. Those days are done, but thankfully, you wouldn't know it from +-. Despite technically being an indie rock band now, Mew brings back Michael Beinhorn as a producer, a guy who was last convinced to come out of hiding by Courtney Love. And that was five years ago. If you’re unfamiliar with Beinhorn’s work, he produced Superunknown, but also a lot of very, very expensive-sounding albums that would frequently sell for pennies in used CD stores throughout the '90s—we’re talking Ozzmosis, Mechanical Animals, the Verve Pipe album after the one with ""The Freshman"" on it. As a result, +- is liable to be one of the more magnificent-sounding rock records you’ll hear all year: The first thing you hear is a harp, while Jonas Bjerre’s pristine vocals continue to be exempt from the inexorable march of time. There’s some serious technique at play and Beinhorn ensures you hear all of it in high definition—Bo Madsen engages in some nifty pull-off runs, Silas Utke Graae Jørgensen plays impossible-sounding fills on tom drums. There are numerous moments where Mew switch tempos and time signatures and others where it could pass as King Arthur on Ice in Space. The removal from any earthly concerns or obligations is echoed in the chorus from +-’s opener as Bjerre sings, ""I’d rather be a satellite."" The blinding, gilded tone is charming rather than obnoxious because Mew never use their exquisite and excessive tastes to glorify themselves as rock overlords. Their songs continue to be sweet, almost twee at their core. ""Satellites"" is probably the most grandiose song ever written about ""movie night"" and Bjerre’s lyrics remain curious, obtuse and playful—""The Night Believer"" and ""Interview the Girls"" spin elaborate conceits out of what sound like true stories at their core, and somehow work on both the mundane and fantastical levels. A gushing romanticism unifies both the lyrics and the music itself, which takes Mew past black lights and dry ice and into the neons and pastels of '80s pop cinema. ""Making Friends"" is a startling foray into cocktail-hour jazz, replete with stiff, Quincy Jones-style riffs. Both Bjerre and Kimbra's vocals on ""The Night Believer"" have the eerie, almost inhuman perfection of a Eurovision competitor. The dazzling ""My Complications"" could be taken as Mew joining the War on Drugs, Lower Dens and Twin Shadow in paying homage to Rod Stewart’s ""Young Turks"", though they bring in Bloc Party's Russell Lissack to play Top Gun leads and create a more comprehensive time capsule. The range allows +- to be Mew’s most consistently engaging record, even if it’s also the longest on both a cumulative and per-song basis. Unlike with No More Stories... and Glass Handed Kites, there’s no delineation between what they perceive as an interlude, exposition or proper song. You’re still guaranteed stretches where everything becomes a gorgeous mirage and Mew conveniently packages almost all of these lulls into the 11-minute ""Rows"". Still, in light of the theatrics and grand gestures that precede it, ""Rows"" feels like a necessary comedown before the closing prom theme ""Cross the River on Your Own"". It’s also perhaps the best proof of Mew’s aesthetic singularity: ""Cross the River"" accidentally and unmistakably evokes the chorus of N.W.A.’s ""Automobile"" and still could be used by Baz Luhrmann to soundtrack a slow dance in the Sistine Chapel. So despite maintaining just about every quality that got them plugged as prog, +- argues for the reframing of Mew as a dream-pop act.","The blinding, gilded tone of +- is charming rather than obnoxious because Mew never use their exquisite and excessive tastes to glorify themselves as rock overlords.

Dig even a little into this scene and you’ll quickly hit upon the name Loke Rahbek: a member of noise duo Damien Dubrovnik, synth-pop trio Lust for Youth and the neo-folkish local supergroup Vår; a solo artist operating under pseudonyms like LR and Croatian Amor; and co-owner of Posh Isolation, a small-press label and shop in Copenhagen’s Nørrebro district. Rahbek is everywhere and nowhere, the axis on which Copenhagen’s underground scene revolves. Puce Mary, real name Frederikke Hoffmeier, debuted on Posh Isolation back in 2010 with Piss Flowers, a cassette of obscure industrial rumblings, and since then she and Rahbek have periodically worked as a duo, The Female Form being their third recorded collaboration. But 2010’s Lucia and the following year’s The Closed Room were made while both were barely out of their teens, and The Female Form feels like a bold step forward, showcasing not just the pair’s improved compositional prowess, but also the new spaces they have grown to inhabit. Part recorded while the pair were composers in residence at EMS, a lavish state-funded studio in Stockholm equipped with vintage Serge and Buchla synthesizers, The Female Form lingers on the threshold between gritty basement industrial and the rarified field of electroacoustic composition. Everything here is crisp and in focus, and while there are no obvious beats, a fundamental sense of rhythm lies beneath everything. ""Swim"" and ""With Complete Will"" find the pair layering and binding circling loops into hard, grinding monoliths of sound, allowing them to gradually accrue mass, or disintegrate into clean tones and ultra-high frequencies that needle away at the edge of human perception. Both supply occasional vocals, which are stentorian and buried, occasionally making themselves intelligible amidst the clamor. On ""A Body Reimagined"", a throbbing generator drone gradually takes on an increasingly gnarly, growling texture as Rahbek issues abrupt commands: ""Arms bent/ Hips forced apart."" Information accompanying The Female Form explains that it concerns ""intimacy and the (im)possible relation of the sexes."" Like much of Posh Isolation’s output, The Female Form has a complex relationship with industrial history. It operates loosely in the lineage, but dispenses with hoary old transgressive provocations—the misogyny, the ambiguous use of totalitarian imagery—in favor of more contemporary concerns: intimacy and communication, sexuality and gender identity. Which is not to suggest that the pair are uninterested in nudging at boundaries. Damien Dubrovnik shows have incorporated elements of Actionist performance art and Artaudian theatre, Rahbek finding exotic ways to debase himself—gagging himself with a microphone and plunging his head into a bucket of ice. Meanwhile, ""Impure Fantasy"", the pair’s collaboration on Puce Mary’s 2014 album Persona, pitch-shifted vocals to a gender-neutral place to explore fantasies of submission. There are echoes of that track on ""Liquefying of the Flesh"", Hoffmeier speaking coolly of ""punishments exchanged for favors"" as brief bursts of pink noise lash like a whip. Throughout, she shadows her monologue with panned and processed recordings of her own voice choking and crying out. In exertion, or exultation? It’s not quite clear, and the uncertainty is probably the point. As accomplished as The Female Form is, it feels somewhat standoffish, leaving a lingering sense that its experiments in fantasy and intimacy come from a place which we, the listeners, are excluded. Perhaps in the future, Rahbek and Hoffmeier will find a way to make us feel like something more than voyeurs. Still, for a record that explores a proposed gulf between male and female experience, the participants feel very much of a kind—musically, philosophically, even visually. This impression adds a strange but inviting frisson to The Female Form. It's always encouraging when a record that raises more questions than it answers feels less like a tease, and more like the beginning of a conversation.","The Female Form has a complex relationship with industrial history, operating loosely in the lineage, but dispensing with hoary old transgressive provocations—the misogyny, the ambiguous use of totalitarian imagery—in favor of more contemporary concerns: intimacy and communication, sexuality and gender identity.

.Wav Theory,Towkio,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae155e6ef95969321bbd/1:1/w_160/2e66e544.jpg,2015-04-30 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20536-wav-theory/,self-released,"Preston Oshita—who records as Towkio—does not want to settle for just good enough. Last year the 21-year-old acknowledged to the Chicago Tribune that following the respective successes of fellow SaveMoney members and childhood friends Chance the Rapper and Vic Mensa, there are high expectations for him on his first full-length release. He addresses them directly on *.Wav Theory'*s Chance-featuring second track ""Clean Up"": ""I get it get it, your friends did it, they famous/ And you rap, too, so when you gon' make it?"" On his debut, he attempts to find a voice that is distinctly his own, to varying results. Towkio's best trait is his ability to craft an effective pop track. He can flow nimbly, but the content of his lyrics often veers toward saccharine, rendering him more vocalist than rapper. ""I Know You"", for example, is a simple love song, but FKJ's smooth production and Towkio's catchy sample-aided chorus make up for less creative lines (""And I could take you there/ Like two shoes, girl, we make a pair""). On ""Free Your Mind"", Towkio rides a house beat, offering some basic uplifting words (""I can free your miiiiind!"") alongside Donnie Trumpet's horn playing and breaking into short, catchy clips in the third verse. He knows how to keep the listener's attention, even if he has not yet figured out how best to provide substantial lyrical depth. Towkio's attempts at wisdom tend to read as buzzwords or markers for profundity, rather than anything meaningful. The title track that opens the album features dial-up sounds and waves crashing, as well as the various connections among ""The brain, [which] controls the heart/ The mind, [which] controls the brain/ The sun, [which] controls the moon/ [And] the moon, [which] controls the waves."" Although admirably starry-eyed, the concept is generally lost on an album largely consisting of poppy, dancey love songs. Towkio finds his way to some genuine emotions on the Kaytranada-produced ""Reflection"", the story of a cocaine-addicted woman he still loves. The song digs deeper because of its tight narrative, attention to detail, and grounding in reality, in addition to Kaytranada's melancholically danceable beat. As a pure bar-for-bar rapper, Towkio relies too heavily on backpack similes and punchlines to convey hackneyed ideas, as on ""Clean Up"": ""I give them monkey bars, them bitches hold weight/ The game like 'Madden' in '08, I swear it's fucked up."" On ""God in Me"", however, he compares himself playfully to an ""infant or a puppy,"" not something you would catch more self-conscious rappers doing. Unfortunately, he ends up losing the beat—a reminder that he is anything but a finished product. The Social Experiment's Peter Cottontale serves as the mixtape's executive producer, alongside Towkio himself, and the Chicago quartet's sound is apparent throughout, with official credits on five of the 12 songs. The songs on the tape strike as either ""cool"" (""RN"", ""Reflection"", ""Break You Off"") or ""happy"" (""Clean Up"", ""Free Your Mind"", ""Heaven Only Knows""). Because Towkio deals in abstractions, there is little conflict or tension on the album, and the ideas with which he is grappling exist in the clouds. He admits as much on ""Break You Off"": ""What we have in common is the conscious/ So I speak on the subjective 'cause the rest is nonsense."" Towkio's nebulousness leaves .Wav Theory as an enjoyable album that asks few questions and gives few answers.","Towkio is an associate of Chance the Rapper and Vic Mensa, a part of their SaveMoney group, and on his debut, he attempts to follow in their path to success.

Four Phantoms,Bell Witch,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad15b1335d7bf1699b34/1:1/w_160/6bdc5e15.jpg,2015-04-30 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20352-four-phantoms/,Profound Lore,"The colossal pieces on Four Phantoms, the second album from Seattle duo Bell Witch, aren’t merely about death. Instead, they detail painful, violent ends inflicted by nature’s four forces—fire, earth, water, and wind—that the dead are forced to endure for eternity. There’s a suffocation, where the victim breaks teeth to keep breathing, and an immolation, where the narrator becomes ""the blooming ash."" One ghost falls into an endless canyon forever, while another buried at sea swims in salt water and skin. A case-by-case survey of horrible ways to go, Four Phantoms is appropriately and hyperbolically morose for the subgenre known as ""funeral doom."" But Bell Witch answers the extreme, existential despondency of these motifs with absolutely triumphant songs, built with heroic riffs and headstrong rhythms. Four Phantoms, then, is like second-line funeral doom—very heavy metal that celebrates life by staring straight at death. Though Bell Witch were good from the start of their 2012 debut Longing, bassist Dylan Desmond and drummer Adrian Guerra are great on Four Phantoms because they’ve recognized and addressed their own faults. Longing, a six-song set that also examined mortality, was promising but unfocused, moving between lethargic 20-minute slogs and mid-tempo marches, horror-sample instrumentals and tone-obsessed drifts. Desmond plays a six-string bass, meaning he’s able to elicit piercing, guitar-like leads and subdural lines from one instrument. On Longing, the capability felt like a compositional toy he was still learning to wield. But the pair refined their approach for Four Phantoms, eliminating extraneous elements and moving fluidly between what remains. Recorded by resurgent metal impresario Billy Anderson, this hour is sharper, louder and brighter than the last one. Too often with doom or stoner metal, the mantra ""everything louder than everything else"" leads to self-defeat, where members crowd each other out of the mix and reduce the music’s overall impact. (See, for instance, Windhand’s Soma.) Due in part to the band’s slim configuration, Four Phantoms feels sculpted, each part perfectly visible and framed. The result is a high-tension, high-contrast mix of ideas and idioms, where brutal doom and filmic post-rock share space with melodies worthy of glam-rock and manipulated textures similar to experimental acts like Locrian. These four pieces collectively suggest that metal is an incremental form: Substantial differences in how something sounds and in what niche it lands stem from subtle decisions about how fast, long or loud certain parts are played. Bits of opener ""Suffocation, A Burial"" sound like thrash metal drugged to stoner speed. ""Judgment, in Fire"" suggests Sunn O))) exploring liturgical music and adding a percussive pulse. This hybridized scheme gives Bell Witch an uncanny appreciation of momentum. The type of low-and-slow music Bell Witch makes often requires a real commitment from the listener, a certain patience with songs that creep through half-hour spans to reach their high-volume peaks. But even during the pair of Four Phantoms numbers that break the 22-minute mark, Bell Witch don’t stall. Sure, they lock into loud, sustained roars, as with the start of ""Judgment: In Air"", and lurk in muted valleys, as when Desmond takes a glacially paced bass solo during ""Suffocation, A Burial"". But they emerge from that last reverie with a  jolt so loud it’s terrifying, especially if you’ve fallen for the bass’s soporific sway. As the song marches toward its end, Guerra doubles and triples his steady beat, and Desmond plays a melody so radiant it seems like an isolated Van Halen lead. Like the album itself, the moment aims for (and often achieves) symphonic grandeur, both in scope and sound. Bell Witch's commitment to progress is most obvious on ""Suffocation, A Drowning"", the longest song of their career and their best use of a guest musician to date. Both Guerra and Desmond sing, but their ranges are typically limited to ghoulish incantations, monstrous growls and terrified screams. So they recruited a real vocalist—Erik Moggridge, who sings solo and plays acoustic guitar as Aerial Ruin—to create what’s essentially a long-form power ballad. It arches and lifts, arriving at a hook so intoxicating you can envision lighters being raised. As Moggridge croons about ""the strangling beast"" of the ocean around him, Bell Witch turns funeral doom and its moribund focus into a beautiful hymn meant for the living.","The Seattle duo Bell Witch aims for (and often achieves) symphonic grandeur on Four Phantoms, an album of very heavy metal that celebrates life by staring straight at death.

The Waterfall,My Morning Jacket,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad55ea9e61561daa60c8/1:1/w_160/9122e338.jpg,2015-04-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20396-the-waterfall/,CapitolATO,"""I'm getting so tired of trying to always be nice,"" Jim James laments on ""Big Decisions"", the first single from My Morning Jacket's seventh LP The Waterfall. It's a surprising line from James, a guy responsible for a nearly weeklong music festival in Mexico named One Big Holiday. If there was a mean bone in his body, we haven't seen it before—My Morning Jacket lyrics are mostly praise and posi-vibes, feeling wonderful about a wonderful higher power for giving wonderful men the most wonderful voices. On ""Big Decisions"", James pushes back on the weight of a lopsided relationship, and the mundane, everyday struggle is charged with everything that has made My Morning Jacket one of the most likeable major American rock bands of the 21st century—reverberating Flying V guitars, James’ expansive rebel yell, explosive harmonies and reverb capable of canvassing the entirety of Manchester, Tenn. and beyond. Even if James is reasserting himself in an atypically selfish way, it sounds like a triumph big enough for everyone to share. Since My Morning Jacket abandoned the grain silo on their 2005 masterwork, their albums have followed a similar format: reverb or no reverb, James’ saintly voice can redeem anything, so no song idea was too strange as long as it could still work at Bonnaroo. On that level, The Waterfall does little you haven’t already heard from My Morning Jacket; they just regain the quality control that abandoned them on Evil Urges and ditch the damage control that pervaded Circuital. ""Believe (Nobody Knows)"" feels precision-engineered for the express purpose of opening My Morning Jacket's live show for the next two years: a big, windmilled chord anticipates every low-register repetition of the title in the prechorus, preparing for when James lets the final ""BELIIIIIIIIIEVE"" rip an octave higher. And that’s where the Klieg lights inevitably hit, as does the same recognizable liftoff from ""Wordless Chorus"" and ""Mahgeetah"", a feeling that the possibilities of life itself are limitless, not just the range of My Morning Jacket. You can’t fake something like ""Believe (Nobody Knows)"" if you haven’t played in front of tens of thousands of festival goers. Then again, few found fault with the first ten minutes of Evil Urges and Circuital; the measure of a My Morning Jacket album is their success at doing what’s not expected of them. Compared to ""Highly Suspicious"" or ""Holdin’ on to Black Metal"", the risks here are more manageable, the results far more successful: there’s ""Compound Fracture"", which tails off into a coda of keyboard flutter and falsetto after flaunting Chvrches electronic stomp and Some Girls strut. ""Get the Point"" delivers James’ most biting lyrics to date within a McCartney-esque acoustic ditty (""I'm trying to tell you plainly how I'm feeling day to day/ And I'm so sorry now that you ain't feeling the same way""). The electronic cut-and-paste of ""Spring (Among the Living)"" is a sleek, modernist iPad compared to ""Cobra""’s bulky, retro ENIAC, while Eastern modes poking through ""Like a River"" and ""Tropics (Erase Traces)"" scent the chillout tent with lavender incense rather than the usual weed smoke. It reaffirms that MMJ are one of the most exciting American rock bands going when they’re at their most generous, curious and restless, as they are here. But ""Big Decisions"" puts the focus squarely on a new place for an MMJ record: the lyrics. The song, and the album as a whole, gives Jim James The Person center stage for what feels like the first time, instead of just The Voice of Jim James. As on record, James has been open with the big picture while skimping on the details—after 15 or so years of giving his all on stage, he’s left just as much off it, and here he is at 37, nearly crippled by workplace injuries, spent from partying and wondering aloud in Rolling Stone, ""what have I done wrong in every relationship I've been in until now?"" There are legitimate personal stakes here and The Waterfall allows for James to express some uncharacteristic negativity without dwelling on it. For a record of spiritual and romantic reckoning, it’s remarkably level-headed and pragmatic. James sweetly coos over Chi-Lites psych-soul, ""It’s a thin line/ Between love and wasting my time"", clearly assessing a broken situation to which he mends on ""Get the Point"": ""Daydreaming of leaving/ I only had to do it."" He wishes his ex the best of luck and then immediately celebrates the exhilarating, frightening rush of single living on ""Spring (Among the Living)""—during each rambling guitar solo, you can picture James right-swiping to his heart’s content. For many, Jim James is basically synonymous with My Morning Jacket, so it’s justifiable to find parallels in the rejuvenation of each—My Morning Jacket has another album on the way some time next year. It’s welcome news for the band's fans, but maybe a bit disappointing considering how a predetermined release schedule usually results in two very good albums in place of one great one, and The Waterfall gets close to greatness. With a little troubleshooting, it might have matched At Dawn's cohesion or Z's dazzling diversity: The misty-eyed reflection of ""Only Memories Remain"" cycles back to a breakup narrative on Side B that otherwise feels like it was put on shuffle, and The Waterfall stalls the most during the usually incendiary guitar workouts. But this is Jim James accepting where he and My Morning Jacket are at the moment: a bit older, a bit broken, more skeptical but very much among the living.","The Waterfall, My Morning Jacket's seventh album, is less a return to form than to spirit, reaffirming what an exciting rock band MMJ can be when they’re at their most generous, curious and restless.

Deep in the Iris,Braids,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ade1c0084474cd0c17d8/1:1/w_160/9ddd7059.jpg,2015-04-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20503-deep-in-the-iris/,Arbutus,"What remains of a relationship after it ends? Pictures, text messages, mementos, sure, but the hardest things to hold onto are the fleeting sensations: the taste of a person’s mouth, the feeling of first standing naked in front of them, the dent in the pillow where a lover’s head once laid. Braids’ third album Deep in the Iris plays as a record of all these tiny memories, accrued in the aftermath of losing someone. The record is rich with startling little images: Stories of being pushed down the stairs, being confronted as a child for mistakes made, wanting to crack the eggs of a group of hatching pigeons flicker across the album’s lyrics. They dance above the quicksilver music, vivid and unreal, and illustrate that sometimes the clearest thing you can remember from a long-forgotten moment is the way the sun felt on your skin. Sonically, Deep in the Iris is dramatically different than the band’s previous release Flourish//Perish. Whereas in the past the Montreal-based trio’s sound has been similar to their electronic contemporaries like Purity Ring and Majical Cloudz, here the band ditches anything stark and futuristic. Instead, they opt for fleet, skittering jazz percussion, crackling beats and stuttering cuts in vocals, while delicate, classical piano runs beneath the electronic instrumentals. The glitchy, warped surface is offset by the clarity and versatility of Standell-Preston’s narrative vocals, which pull everything into focus. On ""Taste"", singer Raphaelle Standell-Preston describes how the taste and feeling of someone you love never really leaves you, even when they treated you abusively to begin with (""We experience the love that we think that we deserve/ And I guess I thought I didn't need much from this world,"" she muses). And sometimes the band examines that isolation in a larger, societal context. ""It’s not like I’m feeling much different than a woman my age years ago,"" Standell-Preston begins on ""Miniskirt"", a song about rape culture and the cutting feeling of being objectified by men.  On ""Sore Eyes"" the synths rise, hinting at an actual dance track, before they fall back to the throbbing repetition of the song's bassline. The movement echoes the push and pull of the song’s message, as Standell-Preston breathily relays her dual desire and disgust in a song about watching porn on the Internet. Deep in the Iris never lets you get quite too familiar, or comfortable. In the album’s track ""Bunny Rose"", Standell-Preston contemplates getting a dog to ail her loneliness, one which will always be waiting for her to come home. And it’s this sort of heartbreakingly simple desire, wanting to be unconditionally embraced by another when you come home, that pulls this album's messages about broken relationships to a universal plane. And while all those intensely specific sensations of an ended relationship do not get clearer with time, on Deep in the Iris it’s clear they are nevertheless always somewhere within you.","Braids’ third album Deep in the Iris deals in the intangible memories that remain when a relationship ends.

Ripe,Slug,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adb813d1975652139fa6/1:1/w_160/44ce8856.jpg,2015-04-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20469-ripe/,Memphis Industries,"Slug leader Ian Black is from Sunderland—about as far northeast as you can go in England before reaching Scotland—and he used to be a touring member of Field Music. The Brewis brothers engineered and played on Ripe, which was recorded at their small studio on the banks of the River Tyne and bears all the hallmarks of their flinching funk deconstructions. That connection is the obvious reason to listen to Slug’s debut, which works as a fine stopgap while Field Music work on the followup to 2012’s Plumb. But Black is more than just a caretaker, indulging the prog specter that only haunts the edge of the Brewises’ compositions. Black dots his nervy songs with imperious choruses that owe a debt to Queen and Greek tragedy, and there are two lengthy instrumental interludes here: ""Weight of Violence"" is a muted steel drum dream that acts as a palate-cleanser, but ""Peng Peng"", a baroque piano suite that breaks into a yowling guitar solo, is a bit ostentatious in context. The best of Ripe maintains an invigorating tension between this introversion and theatricality: the pointillist percussion and surf guitar of ""Sha La La""; the sleazy funk guitar that romps through ""Cockeyed Rabbit Wrapped in Plastic"", as Black adopts a passionless falsetto to indict the untouchable elite. On ""Greasy Mind"", he slithers between tightly coiled guitar parts, while ""At Least"" pairs a barbershop chorus with a searching, forlorn synth part that recalls the Specials’ ""Ghost Town"". Slug’s debut took four years to make, but it feels right that it’s finally out a month shy of the British General Election—in his calm courtroom tone, Black spends much of Ripe criticizing electioneering and the deliberate narrowing of message for political gain. He sings in a combative, sly tone, condemning a single, repellent ""you"": the powerful character preserving the status quo to save his own neck on ""Eggs and Eyes"", the right-wing figures claiming to be the voice of the working class on ""At Least"". Whoever it was written about, it’s impossible to hear that song’s ""creepy crawly fatigue of your mouth/ That does sup beer and shout"" without thinking of Nigel Farage, the leader of the rising but hapless right-wing UKIP party, who is rarely pictured without a pint and his Cheshire Cat grin. Contrary to the saying that good music thrives in bad times, the tenure of the right-leaning Conservative Party (in coalition with the left-wing Liberal Democrats) hasn’t provoked a particularly visible upsurge in politicized British music. But if the idea of hard times as a creative impulse was ever going to hold up, it’s in the North East, the area hit often hardest by government cuts. There’s little choice but to be self-sufficient 300 miles from London, a model that Field Music have pioneered. For all its minor stylistic differences, Ripe is very much forged in their image. But if any traditions in British indie rock are worth perpetuating right now, this inventive, engaged stable is the one to back.","Slug leader Ian Black used to be a touring member of Field Music, and the Brewis brothers engineered and played on Ripe, his solo debut.

Cosmic Drag,Daniele Baldelli,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae025e6ef95969321b9a/1:1/w_160/f946721a.jpg,2015-04-29 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20521-cosmic-drag/,Endless Flight,"Daniele Baldelli is often cast as the Italian counterpart to Larry Levan, and the two have a lot in common. In 1977, as Levan was opening the Paradise Garage in the gritty heart of Hudson Square, Baldelli was brought in as the resident DJ at posh discotheque Baia Degli Angeli, looking out onto the Adriatic Sea. As Levan drew on countless genres to craft what would become the ""Garage"" sound (disco, new wave, synth reggae), Baldelli took eclectic records ranging from Steve Reich to Eurodisco cheese to Fela Kuti, sometimes layering three to four records to craft a sound soon dubbed ""Afro/Cosmic"" when he moved over to the Italian club Cosmic in 1979. Defined by synths that aim towards outer space and hard percussion influenced by thundering tribal drums, Baldelli’s mesmeric, head-widening sound and eclectic selections have influenced numerous generations of DJs and producers, from DJ Harvey to Todd Terje. But while Levan descended into drugs and died at a tragically young age, Baldelli—now in his sixties—has had a renaissance of sorts. He’s remixed Museum of Love as well as Róisín Murphy and recently turned in a marathon set in Coachella, Ca. After numerous mix CDs, edits made in conjunction with younger Italian artists like Marco Dionigi and Luca Roccatagliati, this month sees the legend release Cosmic Drag. With its title and four other song titles bearing the word ""cosmic"" (two more reference space) you can already anticipate what Baldelli has in store here. Even if there isn't a new sound to be discovered across these dozen tracks, Cosmic Drag exceeds expectations, with almost every track bearing a shooting-star thrill. And as one would expect from an iconic DJ known to unearth rare tracks, Baldelli excels in sussing out the sweet spot between genres and exploring the new space between. So while ""Ballbearing"" opens with electro pings and a metallic chug, midway through a vintage synth melody emerges and gives the track buoyancy and lift. The rubber band bass of ""Space Dumper"" suggests where '70s funk meets German kosmische, with a psychedelic guitar lick made to sound like rippling water on top. There’s a sameness to some of Baldelli’s productions here, to where I’d have a difficult time telling you which track is ""Cosmic Particles"" and which is ""Cosmic Glide"", much less which one is ""Cosmic Drag"". But there are standouts: the upbeat disco-funk of ""Mooneyes"" and the heavy Afro drums that roil across grandiose melody and Speak-&-Spell vocals of ""Chop and Roll"" are worthy of entry into the Afro/Cosmic canon. If he hadn’t rendered them himself, no doubt Baldelli would want to weave them into his set.","Legendary Italian DJ Daniele Baldelli delivers a new LP that exceeds expectations, with almost every track bearing a shooting-star thrill.

Qalgebra,Hagerty-Toth Band,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ade7c0084474cd0c17e4/1:1/w_160/4c4fb2b6.jpg,2015-04-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20507-qalgebra/,Three Lobed,"On paper, the pairing of Neil Michael Hagerty and James Jackson Toth is too on-the-nose. Both have histories in groups (Royal Trux and Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice, respectively) who began as sprawling avant-rock outfits, then gradually incorporated traditional influences— blues, country, classic rock—without losing their eccentric edges. Their solo careers have followed similar paths, glancing at the past while breaking open the future. Even Hagerty and Toth’s singing voices—a mix of nasally twang and slacker drawl—are similar. The prospect of a collaboration seems redundant, likely to sound like just another record in their vast discographies. It takes Qalgebra about 10 seconds to blow those worries away. The coiled riffs and crackling beat of tightly-wound opener ""Spindizzy"" sound more like vintage Meat Puppets than anything Hagerty or Toth has done before. The song’s taut energy doesn’t last for all of Qalgebra, half of which is occupied by a single 18-minute title track filled with ebbs and flows. And the overall sound isn’t a radical departure for either artist; you’ll easily recognize their voices, riffs, and sly senses of humor. But for the majority of Qalgebra*’*s five songs, Hagerty and Toth (alongisde bassist Darin Gray and drummer Eric Van Leuven) find a level of urgency and sharpness distinct from their previous efforts. It's as if they were only able to play for a weekend and had to make the most of every moment. Nothing sounds rushed, but everything moves forward at a steady, enthralling clip. The pair feed off each other naturally, their adventurous guitar playing bleeding across every moment while never obscuring basic, uncomplicated songs. There’s also something funny and oddly joyful about Qalgebra. Most of the tunes swing with a casual levity that at times approaches giddiness. The music’s playful atmosphere is made literal by Hagerty and Toth’s deadpan banter at the end of tracks, which sounds like an aging stoner’s version of mid-album rap skits. (Representative sample: ""What’s the best word?"" ""Biggie fries."" ""That’s two words."") Whatever the pair might have been smoking, it gives Qalgebra an endearing breeziness. That feeling is what makes the long, album-ending title track fitting, despite being a stylistic opposite to the rest of Qalgebra. At first glance its improv aura makes it seem like filler, an easy way to pad an EP out into an LP. But a few listens reveal logic in the sonic rambling, much the way Yo La Tengo’s extended jams are like stretched-out echoes of tighter tunes. The expansion comes as a bit of a relief after four much snappier songs, but what matters most is how psyched everyone sounds about playing with each other. Both Hagerty and Toth have traversed dark places in their work, but Qalgebra is unabashedly happy, and all the better for it.","Neil Michael Hagerty and James Jackson Toth both have histories in groups who began as sprawling avant-rock outfits, then gradually incorporated traditional influences.

It’s tempting and unfair to speculate on what Jackson Scott should’ve done here; he doesn’t owe the listener anything besides his best effort. But Scott wouldn’t even be in this position were it not for four-track charmers like ""Sandy"" or ""Evie"" or ""That Awful Sound"". Those songs had Scotchgard-huffing vocals, crackle and hiss, tape warping, but the sound effects weren't the source of their power: Scott’s strengths are in pop songwriting, not production. And Sunshine Redux does everything it can to bury his melodies, vocals, and lyrics in favor of… not much of anything, really. Even more denatured and opaque than the soupy Melbourne, Sunshine Redux is self-produced to a gooey, garish, gritty and barely mobile gel—the sound of gum refusing to leave the bottom of your shoe. Considering the tools available to even the most novice and/or cash-strapped home recorder, one has to hear all of this as a protracted aesthetic choice rather than a result of economic necessity. And so the question throughout is, simply, why? Why does Scott subject his vocals to so many forms of disorientation when his indecisive melodies barely sound like they’re aware of their surroundings to begin with? Peering into the lyrics only reinforces the confusion. As with the music, the words are vaguely surreal, inscrutable but one-dimensional. Coming from an acolyte of Syd Barrett, a song called ""Merry Nightmare"" hits squarely on the nose. In the preceding song, he revisits the juxtaposition of whimsy and brutal violence from ""Sandy"", but the utter blankness of ""Save the World"" makes its Dr. Seuss-quoting chorus (""Oh the places that you’ll go/ When you’re far too young to know"") come off like a Korn-y gimmick. Had Sunshine Redux preceded Melbourne, perhaps it could be heard as the work of an immature artist trying to develop a feel for songwriting voice and production. Or, like the hundreds of passable records of crudely recorded psych-pop to which it’s comparable, perhaps it wouldn’t be heard at all. But Scott seemed like he was already beyond that. There’s one lyric from ""PRPLMTV"" that could be read as introspective—but ""when you went to college to blossom in folly/ You took lots of molly,"" is Scott making a nonchalant cop to being a dude who isn’t much interested in meeting expectations. Melbourne wanted us to believe that Jackson Scott was subverting pop. Here, he’s just subverting himself.","There were some fine songs on North Carolina singer/songwriter Jackson Scott’s proper 2013 debut, Melbourne.

MG,MG,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad6ac0084474cd0c1705/1:1/w_160/3d6c305e.jpg,2015-04-29 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20410-mg/,Mute,"The best bits on Depeche Mode's 2013 album Delta Machine were the intros. Once the songs got underway, the band mostly just went through the motions, dutifully recreating the same arena-ready hooks and overblown saints-and-sinners metaphors they've been dealing in for decades. But for a few sweet seconds before the bombast began, there was just the zap and gurgle of Martin Gore's synthesizers. For anyone who heard the distant promise of a far different, more interesting record in those moments, you're in luck: Gore's new solo album is an all-synthesizer affair. No guitars, no drums, no blues riffs, and, most important of all, no vocals—which means no tangled religious conceits, no BDSM analogies, no rhyming ""soul"" with ""control."" Gore has done solo records before—1989's Counterfeit EP and 2003's Counterfeit 2, both collections of synth-pop covers of songs by Nick Cave, Lou Reed, Vini Reilly, et al—and he's done instrumental electronic music in his duo VCMG, with his onetime bandmate Vince Clarke, later of Yazoo and now Erasure. But MG is something new. These are sketches rather than songs, and, unlike VCMG's visceral, sternum-punching, 10,000-watt techno throb, they're designed mostly to fade into the background. Some tracks feature subtle beats, but for the most part this is ambient music the way Brian Eno envisioned it, as a kind of sonic wallpaper. That's no slight: the record's low stakes help make evident what it excels at, which is sound design—a careful sculpting of electricity and air. It feels less like fine art than exceptional craftsmanship, but that's OK; the world needs beautifully thrown pots as much as it needs Picassos. A few tracks here began life as demos for Delta Machine; Gore finished MG in 2013, after the band finished touring. He recorded it in his home studio on, principally, a modular synthesizer system. Modular systems are something like the Legos of electronic music: Users build their own, custom synthesizers by patching together various devices into mazelike configurations, the functionality of which is often pretty fuzzy even to the person cabling them together. That unpredictability is important: it means that the process of wiring things together is largely inseparable from the process of composition. It is experimental in the most basic sense—Let's see what happens when we plug this into this—and that sense of curiosity is at the heart of MG. It sounds pretty much like what it is—someone alone in the studio at night, twisting knobs, feeling his way gingerly along the signal chain. In both its restraint and its moodiness, it turns inward, not outward. To listen to it feels a little like eavesdropping on someone else's thoughts. Gore has described the album as ""kind of atmospheric and filmic,"" and he's right; it would be easy to imagine almost anything here working as a soundtrack cue. The average track length is around three minutes, just long enough for an idea to blossom and shrivel, like a flower in time-lapse. The gnarled arpeggios and general menace of tracks like ""Spiral"" and ""Stealth"" recall Nine Inch Nails' Hesitation Marks, while elsewhere the album suggests a grittier, more minimalist answer to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' soundtrack to The Social Network. And it's impossible not to think of Tangerine Dream and Vangelis in the context of the album's most dramatic tracks. ""Crowly"", with its slow, stately melody, is a gleaming hovercraft of a tune, pretty clearly modeled after the Blade Runner soundtrack, and the closing track, ""Blade"", doesn't even try to hide its inspiration, as augmented chords dissolve into fizzy streamers. For all the album's modest ambitions, it doesn't lack for variety. ""Pinking"", which opens the album, is the lone track to feature something like vocals, in the form of the gauzy choral pads familiar from New Order's Power, Corruption & Lies. It's a wisp of a thing—just two-and-a-half minutes of harpsichord-like chimes and celestial sighs. It would be easy to imagine it as the basis of a Depeche Mode song, and who knows, it might have made a great one. But it's pretty much perfect as it is. Too much music is led astray by its creators' attempts to add more; the great beauty of MG is that at a certain point while he was plugging in cables and twisting knobs, Gore simply said, ""Enough,"" and it was.","Martin Gore of Depeche Mode's new solo album is an all-synthesizer affair, and in its restraint and its moodiness, it turns inward, not outward.  To listen to it feels a little like eavesdropping on someone else's thoughts.

Intermission EP,Trey Songz,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae0b9d034d5c69bf4486/1:1/w_160/d1d4a821.jpg,2015-04-28 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20527-intermission-ep/,self-released,"Last year’s Trigga arrived at an interesting point in Trey Songz’ nearly decade-long career. Mr. Steal Your Girl has never been in danger of falling off, but on his sixth album, he seemed to have more competition than ever as the dude-R&B sphere over-brewed with stylized, specific points of view. Ty Dolla $ign had officially arrived, with ""Or Nah"" creeping up the Hot 100 and ""Paranoid"" still in radio rotation; Chris Brown was somehow bigger than ever, riding high off addictive-but-repugnant single ""Loyal""; Jeremih had gotten his second wind, steadily becoming rap’s favorite guest vocalist, and PARTYNEXTDOOR, the Weeknd, and a league of imitators were occupying the moody lane left open as Drake drifted away from R&B. As his less firmly established peers have dipped their toes into the ""alt-R&B"" pool or flirted with EDM to stay relevant, Trey’s point of view has remained trendy but traditional, his generation’s best candidate for R. Kelly’s torch-bearer; and while he’s subtly evolved over the years, gracefully embracing hip-hop and R&B’s increasing cross-pollination, he hasn’t made too many pronounced stylistic shifts. He might lack the crossover appeal or critical darling status of, say, The-Dream or the Weeknd, but his singles discography is unimpeachable—not to mention, he can sing any of the aforementioned under the table. Trigga emphatically reaffirmed Trey’s hit-making pedigree: The album spawned a whopping six singles, best among them Nicki Minaj collaboration ""Touchin, Lovin"". Trey and production team The Featherstones dabbled in the surefire 2014 hit strategy, ""interpolate a '90s classic"" (in this case, Big and Kells’ ""Fuck You Tonight""), but made sure to slyly note, ""If we talkin’ bout sex, girl you know I invented that""—a reminder of his indelible stamp on millennial baby-making jams. But Trey’s alpha-male anthems have always had a bit of a chauvinistic edge, and ""Touchin, Lovin"" succeeded in no small part because it allotted space for a strong female perspective as a counterpoint to the bro-y narcissism of a guy used to having his way. If you squint, Trey’s recent six-song Intermission EP, a stopgate to tide fans over until Trigga: Reloaded this summer, does what Trey does best: provide a no-skips-required sex playlist, or at least an escapist fantasy for zoning out at your desk. The satiny synths, leisurely finger-snap percussion, and evocative bass rumbles, all providing a cushion for Trey’s velvety tenor, are the aural equivalent of scattered rose petals and lit candles. But the fantasy quickly fades: almost every song doubles down on the #meninist platitudes and reductive misogyny more than anything he’s released to date. Intermission feels like a conceptual homage to pick-up artist bible The Game. ""Don’t Play"" starts seductively enough, with its spacious, Jeremih-esque atmospherics, but quickly devolves into negging on wax. ""You got my time, girl, don’t you disrespect it,"" he huffs, barely concealing his impatience with his companion’s sexual ambivalence. ""Good Girls vs Bad Girls"" has Trigga reducing half the earth’s population to an Archie Comics trope, then wondering why he can’t seem to find meaning within this sad binary. ""Boss"", perhaps unwittingly, provides the EP’s only real moment of vulnerability. The track borrows a feeling from Drake circa 2010 (a time when Drizzy needed Trey’s co-sign to get a leg up, strange as that may seem now), not just in mood and cadence, but in the same defensive paranoia, obsessed with the idea that women are attracted by his status and adjusting his expectations accordingly. ""I don’t judge her, don’t judge her/ But I could never love her/ ‘Cause I’m just an entertainer/ And soon she gon’ fuck another,"" he sings, a riff on Drake's guarded ""Miss Me"" verse and a flash of context for the surrounding callousness. But it still doesn’t make the project’s overwhelming misogyny any easier to swallow, sexy as the sound may be. It’s a move as perplexing as it is disappointing. Meninist flailing is for dudes struggling to overcome their terrible personalities, like Eminem. And Intermission’s spite towards women is especially baffling considering they comprise the vast majority of his fandom. What part of The Game is that?","Trey Songz's recent six-song Intermission EP, a stopgate to tide fans over until Trigga: Reloaded this summer, does what Trey does best: provide a no-skips-required sex playlist, or at least an escapist fantasy for zoning out at your desk.

Love Story,Yelawolf,by: Jay Balfour,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae115e6ef95969321bb1/1:1/w_160/3edb598f.jpg,2015-04-28 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20531-love-story/,InterscopeShady,"Yelawolf has spent years making Love Story, his second official album as a major label artist and first release since 2013’s Trunk Muzik Returns. The title of that last project, a mixtape, says plenty: Yelawolf was trying to recapture something he’d lost along the way. In the early years of his career, Yela seemed to be rattling around an industry that didn’t quite know how to deal with him. By 2009 he’d been signed and dropped by Columbia Records—an official debut got lost along the way—and then found his stride with a mixtape that might remain his best work to date. Trunk Musik 0-60, Interscope’s street album rehash of that mixtape, is the other contender. Yela had found a place—Interscope seemed to get him—and struck a chord. When Radioactive rolled around in 2011 it felt like Yelawolf had broken a promise, or at least lost himself, in failed (and weird) crossover attempts. Unfortunately, and for different reasons, Love Story vies with that last album as the worst music of his career; as a result, it’s also getting harder to remember the gritty luster of his peak. Even worse, this new project seems to cement a damning new identity for Yela: once-compelling mixtape artist, shoddy album-maker. With 18 tracks spanning more than 74 minutes, Love Story is far too long to accomplish so little and hits the same notes over and over again. It’s draining. Most glaring is Yelawolf’s devolution as a rapper: He’s developed a bad habit of leaning on cringey similes and seems to have forfeited the snappy, accelatory delivery that made 0-60 so fun to listen to and hard to rap along with. ""Still on that grass like John Deeres,"" he raps on ""Whiskey in a Bottle""; on ""Love Story"", he offers ""Got my weight up like I’m carrying fat people."" Here he is denouncing wannabe rednecks on ""Change"": ""Yellin' redneck, you about as red as the color blue is."" Those types of lines not only sound worse the second (and third) time around, they run rampant. On ""Disappear"" he feigns a cathartic letter to an estranged father—""You told me what you did, carpentry, right?""—and then at the end of the song a supposed-to-be-big reveal falls hopelessly flat: ""I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?"" Love Story has moments that seem to aim at Americana. Sometimes that means thigh-slapping, rootsy country (""Have a Great Flight"") and sometimes it’s psychedelic southern rock. In either case, they cast Yela as a cheesy pastiche artist. ""Johnny Cash"" features the rapper narrating his arms-length relationship with a live audience and then for a hook he just says ""Johnny Cash"" like half-a-dozen times. At surface level at least, ""Best Friend"" is the album’s attention-grabber with the solitary feature in the form of an extended, rambling Eminem verse. The appearance is the first we’ve heard from Em in 2015 and it’s a characteristically jumbled bit of technical braggadocio. At one point he strings together a series of bars that internally carry ""shiggy-shock"" and ""im-piggy-possible"" and ends with, ""word to the diggy doc/ Stiggy-stopping is not an option."" It’s like Eminem is breaking down a complicated piece of Ikea furniture and purposefully veering away from the instructions in putting it back together. Once it all fits, it’s hard to see what the point was. As both an executive producer and label-head, Love Story signals a failure for Eminem as well, and bears the same structural flaws that nag his own late-career output—namely, a lot of filler, poor sequencing, and just too much of the same damn thing. Em’s fingerprints are all over the music and his own production credits yield plodding, heavy-handed beats that don’t suit Yelawolf’s once-erratic flow. The WillPower produced ""Till It’s Gone"", a single released last year that found a place during a plot climax on the FX show ""Sons of Anarchy"", feels like the best the album has to offer. Yelawolf doesn’t strain his singing here and settles into a marching flow over the looped-up acoustic guitar and heel-stomping bottom end. The hook is still full of platitudes and a not-so-productive tautology, but as a whole it’s better than everything else here. ""Fiddle Me This"" caps off the album with a rote ""Devil Went Down to Georgia"" interpolation bleeding into a gratuitous scratching interlude, and Yelawolf raps, ""Yeah, I've done come a long way."" Like the rest of the album though, there doesn't seem to be much to show for the journey, and Yelawolf sounds like he's just going through the motions instead of actually covering ground.","Yelawolf has spent years making Love Story, his second official album as a major label artist and first release since 2013’s Trunk Muzik Returns. It seems to cement a damning new identity for him: once-compelling mixtape artist, shoddy album-maker.

These Things,Looper,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929add99d034d5c69bf442e/1:1/w_160/5d2730d1.jpg,2015-04-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20497-these-things/,Mute,"In 1997, Stuart David was Belle and Sebastian's bass player, and Looper was his side project with his wife Karn David. Then he left Belle and Sebastian to concentrate on Looper, who made three albums and a few singles between 1998 and 2002 before going wherever it is that pleasant, unassuming little bands go. And now we have this five-disc boxed set of Looper's (nearly) complete discography, including the new ""guess what, we're back"" album Offgrid: Offline (available separately only as a download). It's not straightforward reissues, though: all the tracks have been resequenced into thematic compilations with neologistic titles. One, which starts with their most-frequently-used-in-movies-and-such track ""Mondo '77"", is devoted to instrumentals and near-instrumentals. Another, which starts with one version of the how-Karn-and-Stuart-met story ""Impossible Things"" (and features another half an hour or so later), collects the tracks on which Stuart reads spoken-word pieces in a subdued voice over not-especially-intrusive musical beds—the sort of thing he'd done with Belle and Sebastian on ""A Century of Elvis"" and ""A Space Boy Dream"". A third assembles the band's more straightforward pop songs, like 2002's ""Fucking Around"", an unnervingly violent cousin to ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"". Then there are two further catchall song-based discs. One of them claims to draw on hip-hop and R&B-inspired ideas about beats (Looper always did like DJ-scratch sounds), and the other on a broader range of electronic music, but the distinctions aren't especially clear in practice. Both are also generally the Looper recordings that have aged most poorly, like a 1999 single called ""Who's Afraid of Y2K?"", in which Stuart's repeated murmur of ""maybe Y2K will bring the rain"" occasionally gives way to weary electro-burbles. This seems like a very strange way to reframe the work of a band whose three previous albums can be found used online for a penny apiece. Looper have always been a mix-CD band—a track at a time can be a refreshing interlude in a collection of music by other people—and if their earlier records rarely stuck their heads up too high, at least they had a welcome variety of approaches. But sorting their music into stylistic piles exposes their weaknesses. Their best songs (""Uncle Ray"", ""Burning Flies"") have a bit of bitterness and swagger about them, but too many others are anemic sketches—they've got a nice keyboard tone, or a decent rhythm loop, and perhaps a little snippet of melody, and then they just shrug their shoulders and do their thing for a few minutes. ""It was mainly Best Ofs I liked when I was growing up,"" Stuart noted in a recent Philthy Mag interview. ""That was what really made me want to rearrange the tracks for the boxset. Into something like a collection of Best Of CDs."" That's not how best-ofs work—and, actually, a tight, smartly sequenced Looper greatest-hits album would be a likable addition to an indie-pop shelf. These Things clarifies the band's aesthetic, but it makes them harder to listen to.","In the late 1990s, Stuart David left Belle & Sebastian to concentrate on Looper, his side project with his wife Karn David.

IF,Paul de Jong,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad0b5e6ef959693219f4/1:1/w_160/b7a7e0bc.jpg,2015-04-28 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20346-if/,Temporary Residence,"The Books left the world just as quietly as they entered it. Guitarist and vocalist Nick Zammuto and cellist Paul de Jong seemed to appear from thin air with 2002's Thought for Food, a startlingly innovative album that exuded a strange ease. The dark humor they squeezed from thrift-store VHS tapes and home videos in the decade to follow was both unnerving and sedative, recalling bouts of nostalgia just vague enough to belong to anyone, spliced deftly on the three albums that followed. After uploading a 12-minute video detailing their farewell box set, A Dot In Time, they disbanded in 2012. Nick Zammuto quickly began his own endeavors under his last name. Paul de Jong, however, went into hiding. After the exhaustion of The Way Out, de Jong uses IF to return refreshed and willing to reveal sides previously overshadowed. The cello was merely an instrument in the Books’ work, for instance, but here it becomes its own character. He filters it through glitches on ""Debt Free"" and anxious whirring during ""Golden Gate"", but it truly comes into its own on ""Age of the Sea"". Moody chords resonate in an empty room, giving off a hollow tone before lo-fi field recordings from a beach enter. A seagull calls out as de Jong creates one of his most beautiful cello lines to date, leaning into the instrument and breathing life into what seems to be an uncovered personal memory sanded down by time. De Jong hasn't abandoned the duo’s trademark collage-pop absurdity, but he has refined it. Zammuto's last two albums, while farcical and energetic, had numerous throwaway tracks; IF is more calculated. At 51 years old, ten years Zammuto's elder, de Jong plays with his toys differently, and the tracks are always, no matter what, kept tidy. Slapstick number ""Snakes"" indulges in a man’s manic hallucinations of serpents for under a minute, as if de Jong seeks to prove he’s capable of matching Zammuto's colorful, campy energy.  Otherwise he evokes a grave solitude: a man standing in an open field, maybe, palms grazing over the tips of tall grass, muting his thoughts to let the sound of air fill his skull. De Jong dips into the shadows of jazz in album’s final moments, for the bleak solitude of ""Purpose"". Wind audibly brushes against the microphone as a piano traces some meandering chords, evoking a forlorn sense of resignation and acceptance. It is the sound of someone at the halfway point of their life, looking forward and backward. In that, it's a quiet return to 2003's The Lemon of Pink. IF is patient and spacious, suggesting that de Jong has found solitude, if not peace, between the strings of his cello.","Paul de Jong, former cellist for the Books, uses his debut solo album IF to return refreshed and willing to reveal sides previously overshadowed.

The Magic Whip,Blur,by: Craig Jenkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae1a5e6ef95969321bc5/1:1/w_160/bd67996a.jpg,2015-04-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20539-the-magic-whip/,Parlophone,"Early in the jarring opening pages of science fiction novelist Ray Bradbury’s 1953 masterpiece Fahrenheit 451, the author appears to catch a glimmer of the actual future. Protagonist Guy Montag comes home from work to find his wife limp and dying of an overdose on sleeping pills. Montag calls for assistance and hangs back helplessly as paramedics revive her, thinking to himself, ""There are too many of us. There are billions of us and that’s too many. Nobody knows anyone."" Could Bradbury have foreseen the quiet anomie of faces bathed in smartphone light, shuttling through overcrowded cities, alone together in only tangential acknowledgement of one other’s humanity? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Singer-songwriter Damon Albarn invokes Bradbury’s sentiment on ""There Are Too Many of Us"", the emotional centerpiece of The Magic Whip, the reunion album from his reconstituted flagship Blur, as he muses about an Australian hostage crisis he once spectated on television from a hotel room above it. ""For a moment I was dislocated by terror on the loop elsewhere,"" he admits in verse two—not horrified, just momentarily ""dislocated""—as if to call into question our dwindling concern for people in places outside our cubicles of convenience. Technology has made our world smaller, but it hasn’t made us less isolated. Ease of access doesn’t equal closeness. The Magic Whip is the first Blur album since 2003’s Think Tank, the first with guitarist Graham Coxon onboard since 1999’s 13 (Coxon was booted from the Think Tank sessions a week in and summarily quit), and the first with producer Stephen Street since 1997’s Blur. In 2013, a lucky twist of fate netted the group some downtime between festival dates in South China and Indonesia, and Blur holed up in a Hong Kong studio to workshop new material. Anyone who’s waited a decade and a half for Albarn and his songwriting foil to resume tussling over bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree’s lithe low end will find a lot to enjoy; something special happens when these four get in a room, and you can still hear some of it happening here. The distant traveler’s conflicting sense of wonder and alienation is the running theme here. ""New World Towers"" gazes at the web of neon signs overhead in awe of their glow, ""Go Out"" details nights alone at the bar and defeated late-night self-love. On ""Thought I Was a Spaceman"" Albarn recasts a longing for the comforting familiarity of London as a space-wrecked astronaut’s homesickness. The Magic Whip was conceived as Albarn wrapped work on his 2014 solo album Everyday Robots, and it’s tempting to see its disaffected tourism as a sister to Robots’ shattered workaday ennui back home. Sensibilities from Albarn’s extracurricular projects frequently bleed into the frame, especially the Gorillaz, which shows both in dubby, beat-oriented cuts like ""New World Towers"" and in the lyrics’ pervasive sense of Englishness-in-exile. ""Thought I Was a Spaceman"" could easily serve as a prequel to Demon Days’ post-apocalyptic opener ""Last Living Souls"" in sound and story, and ""Ghost Ship"" wouldn’t look out of place anchored off the shores of Plastic Beach. At times the sonic tug-of-war feels like Albarn clawing at the restrictions of a framework his ideas have outgrown. In the moments when The Magic Whip is most interested in sounding like a Blur album, it is perhaps too interested. There’s a nod to nearly every epoch, from the synth-accented Parklife alt-rockisms of ""I Broadcast"" to the busy Great Escape pop of ""Lonesome Street"", the Blur-ish guitar squall of ""Go Out"" and the winding 13-influenced electro-psych of ""Spaceman"". Whip functions as a career travelogue in that sense; one wonders whether the decision to have Street, the band’s Britpop-era producer, helm the sessions hasn’t aroused a certain sense of nostalgia. Restless innovators deserve a cycle back through the worlds they’ve crafted here and there (see: the last decade worth of Prince and Beck) but it’s disorienting for a band as keenly interested in artistic recombination as Blur. Sometimes the album veers into sleepy territory: The ambient washes and close mic’d, reverb-drenched strumming of ""Spaceman"" are welcome flourishes, as is the cluttered keyboard-and-acoustic bounce of ""Ice Cream Man"", but both are better showcases for production than song structure. There’s also sluggish, saccharine adult contemporary on ""My Terracotta Heart"" and closer ""Mirrorball"", though, momentum-killers in a back end that sometimes lags where it should lift. The tempo only picks up on ""Lonesome Street"", ""Go Out"", and ""I Broadcast""; the rest of the album bobs calmly adrift. It suits the album’s geographical fixation on Hong Kong, Indonesia, and especially the beaches and waters in between, but not the band’s own sweet spot. All these frustrations fall away when the quartet locks into its signature jangly strut, as it does on the late album highlight ""Ong Ong"", a chugging rocker outfitted with a chorus of lilting la-la’s. Its sunny soul is infectious, as Albarn, who once lamented he had ""no distance left to run,"" professes a love no measure of forbidding space could quell. Coxon’s in the wings playing hokey luau guitar, zeroing in on Damon’s seafaring yearning and playing it up for yaks until he storms center stage as the song draws to a noisy close. Blur’s always been puckish in spirit, its greatest gift the identification and gleeful subversion of listener expectations, and in moments like these it re-emerges, untarnished by the passage of time.","The Magic Whip is the first Blur album since 2003’s Think Tank, the first with guitarist Graham Coxon onboard since 1999’s 13 (Coxon was booted from the Think Tank sessions a week in and summarily quit), and the first with producer Stephen Street since 1997’s Blur.

For Sasha, money comes in bricks, and those she deigns to let go down will not stop—cannot stop—until she’s got hers. ""Getting hers"" is the thread which binds Nutty World 2 together, and while ""getting mine"" is hardly an original theme for a rapper, Sasha repurposes its cliches like a Chanel suit. This has been Sasha’s greatest strength from the beginning; think of her back in the ""What We Do"" video, flanked in an entryway by friends, in a blouse like strawberry taffy, white-belted jeans, and a crown of cherubic blonde curls before we see her reach into her bag and pull out a handgun roughly the size of her thigh. The most striking thing about Nutty World 2 is Sasha's palpable urgency; she normally raps with a measured flow, her poise and tempo turning the beat into a catwalk. Nutty World 2 finds her rapping with a nimble aggression she has simply not shown before. The motivation for this more dangerous version of Sasha is spelled out in opener ""Vision"": ""As long as I’m eating/ My daughter won’t starve/ She the main reason/ That I’m going hard."" That maternal ferocity is maintained throughout the record. Addressing her daughter first thing sets Nutty World 2’s pace and tone. Whether it's familial security, money, respect, or head, the message is the same. ""I pick today/ To have fun,"" she sings on the hook of ""Today"", and though the stakes on that proclamation feel slightly lower, the agency is still present. As if to balance her newfound power, the production—the majority of it handled by YoungHazOnTheBeat—is fairly standard, albeit well done, drill-esque fare, wide, dark and domineering. The few tracks which deviate the most—namely the John Carpenter-in-the-club ""All I See"" and ""Niggas Ain’t Shit"", which evokes pepto-Zoro Kellz and Cassidy in ""Hotel""—do so in a complementary manner; ""All I See"" in particular is just bizarre enough. When paired with Sasha's blunt-force rapping, the straightforward, unabashedly strong production seems defiant rather than dated. The good-but-not great beat selection is, in the end, less a hindrance than a strength. When taken with Nutty World 2’s deft sequencing—just enough songs flowing together, just the right amount of tags and ""This Chicago …""s and DJ promotion—it leaves the new, fiercer Sasha as the main attraction. In rapping over what she knows better than she ever has before, Nutty World 2 becomes equal part herald and warning shot; Sasha is getting hers, and she is coming for yours next.","The most striking thing about the new tape by Chicago rapper Sasha Go Hard is Sasha's palpable urgency; Nutty World 2 finds her rapping with a nimble aggression she has simply not shown before.

Begging Please,Samo Sound Boy,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad85c0084474cd0c172c/1:1/w_160/54aa2301.jpg,2015-04-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20431-samo-sound-boy-begging-please/,Body High,"Electronic music has thrived over the last decade in Los Angeles, with labels like Innovative Leisure, Friends of Friends and Body High mining the best of the city’s offerings. The least well-known of the three, Body High, was started in 2011 by Jerome Potter and Sam Griesemer. Performing together as DJ Dodger Stadium, and separately as Jerome LOL and Samo Sound Boy, the two producers have carved out a recognizable style in a handful of releases, using a small bag of tricks to unleash cascades of emotion and energy. Begging Please, Samo’s full-length debut, stays true to that style, while treading the most intimate territory the label has explored yet. Body High was founded with a focus on raw club music. As it has slowly built a catalogue, that focus has come to signify a feeling rather than a specific set of genres. DJ Dodger Stadium’s 2014 debut album Friend of Mine was for the most part functional, danceable music, indebted to house and techno. But its purpose drove deeper: It strove to summon the exhausted freedom that three hours of dancing can bring with the immediacy of a lightning-clap. Though many of the electro-soul tracks on Begging Please don’t have the momentum it takes to work in the club, they seek a similarly cathartic response from the listener. Guarded in his interviews, Samo has said several times that Begging Please is an album about the dissolution of a loving relationship (comparing it to Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear), but has given few other details. His more substantial thoughts and feelings about the break-up are channeled in the tracks here. Friend of Mine also built a functional narrative, even as each of its songs shuddered into uninhibited ecstasy. But Begging Please feels like a portrait as opposed to Friend of Mine’s landscape. Samo opts for more obvious variation within individual tracks, which reduces his album’s impact but also intensifies the feeling that you’re listening to something personal and specific. The power of a track like ""Feel Something"" doesn’t rest in the repetition of its operative vocal loop (""Make me feel…oh""). It appears when that loop is pushed aside for a brassy synth ascension that takes over the song about mid-way through. Gaudy, enormous synths, about as subtle as Web 1.0 graphics, are a staple of Begging Please, appearing on other standouts like ""The Only Thing"", and the seven-and-a-half-minute centerpiece and title track. They feed the album’s general sense of camp; this is big, glorious Shirley Bassey melodrama, as is most apparent on the soulful closer, where a powerful voice rides atop the record’s wildest, most expressive percussion. If Begging Please is a performance of heartbreak, it is a wry and self-aware one. Samo's light-fingered melodies go a long way toward balancing the boldness of his sound. That balance grants a sensitivity to most of the songs here. And it is quite obvious when absent, as on the album’s few misses, ""Baby Don’t Stop"" and ""What Can I Do"". Because the music is so finely tuned and relies so fleetingly on sampled lyrics, even the simplest words take on powerful meaning, Samo speaking to us as directly as is possible for him. One of the album’s tracks, ""Save Wait Time"", is made by its refrain, which adds an extra word to that gloomy triplet, either ""go"" or ""no."" By removing this terminal word from the track’s title, introverted Samo signals his wish to preserve the moment, to freeze time in a portrait of what he once had. But, inevitably, the sample cuts out, the music fades, and the album begins its descent into heartbreak.","Samo Sound Boy is one half of the duo DJ Dodger Stadium, and on his debut album he addresses the dissolution of a relationship.  Because the music is so finely tuned and relies so fleetingly on sampled lyrics, even the simplest words take on powerful meaning.

Who Is the Sender?,Bill Fay,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adc0ea9e61561daa617a/1:1/w_160/28cc2984.jpg,2015-04-27 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20475-bill-fay-who-is-the-sender/,Dead Oceans,"Of course Life Is People, Bill Fay’s 2012 LP, felt like a spectacle: It was his first proper record in more than 40 years. At the start of the '70s, the Englishman released two imaginative, mystifying folk-rock albums that were critically lauded but commercially stillborn. After low sales prompted his label dismissal, Fay decided not to press the issue. He retired to private life, started a family and recorded new tunes only for his own fulfillment. Still, his reputation steadily spread among singer-songwriter literati, and those early albums became collector’s items. Reissues followed, along with a plea from the young American producer Joshua Henry: Make another record with me. On the resulting 12 songs, choirs emboldened Fay’s humble mantras about self-fulfillment, miniature orchestras afforded his modest folk songs symphonic splendor, and Jeff Tweedy traded verses and shared choruses with one of his idols. Fay seemed like a singer who’d returned to reclaim the due he’d missed for an entire generation. Life Is People was his triumph over time. But the new and muted Who Is the Sender? finds Fay coming down from that high. He expresses frustration and consternation with the world, its wars and persecutions, and prays that some force bigger than a singer behind a piano will someday repair it all. Fay sighs as much as he sings here. The once-soaring strings turn doleful, and harmonies that felt like life-affirming proclamations just three years ago now seem like cries for survival. The album’s only celebrity guest, Spiritualized leader J. Spaceman, is relegated to near-anonymous background harmonies. Fay’s transition suggests a radically time-collapsed echo of Bob Dylan’s career between the early '80s and the late '90s, as he moved from religious exaltation to end-times anxiety. ""What on earth is happening? What have we done?"" Fay mutters over a somber piano stomp during ""Underneath the Sun"". The song is an observation in two parts: Fay first finds wonder in the nature around him, where trees climb skyward and squirrels scavenge for their refuse. When his gaze turns to people, though, he sees only the threat of bullets and bombs and the suspicion that society will ruin everything around it. That same resentment creeps into ""War Machine"", a smoldering excoriation of humanity’s animal instinct to kill by funding an army it doesn’t question. And the beautiful ballad ""The Freedom to Read"" tells the tale of the court-ordered immolation of a 16th-century Protestant labeled a heretic for translating the Bible into English. It’s as if, three years after promising universal redemption on ""The Healing Day"" or exploring the magic of miracles on ""Cosmic Concerto"", Fay has accepted that his songs have yet to make the world any less bitter or more benevolent. But Who Is the Sender? runs deeper than blind kvetching: Fay’s Christianity, and his cautious optimism in its power, uplifts him. The gently rising ""Order of the Day"" treats the Book of Revelation like a balm. The banjo-backed ""Bring It on Lord"" is a prayer for peace and healing. Perhaps all this sounds off-putting and naïve, but on Who Is the Sender?, Fay emerges as the rare religious songwriter who talks about his God without imploring the audience to make it their God, too. His beliefs seem too personal for him to proselytize on their behalf, too wrapped up in his survival for him to justify them. On ""Something Else Ahead"", he even confesses that his doubts about religion have never really vanished but that maintaining his faith is his tool of perseverance. ""Let’s just hope there’s something else ahead,"" he sings sweetly above circling strings, ""that a life on Earth don’t just end."" That sentiment resonates with the resurrection of Fay’s interrupted career. Who Is the Sender? effectively doubles his recorded output and moves him from the category of a curiosity who returned after a four-decade absence to make a third great album to someone perhaps capable of doing so in perpetuity. But Fay seems to have few regrets about the way things went, a question he addresses during the opener ""The Geese Are Flying Westward"". He follows the avian migration and wonders if he should have ventured far from home, too, if he would have been happier had he pursued his musical aspirations. But he concludes he’s grateful for the seasons and years he’s witnessed at home, the place that’s made the perspective of his late-life albums so very poignant.","Bill Fay’s 2012 LP Life Is People, his first proper record in more than 40 years, felt like a spectacle. Who Is the Sender? finds Fay coming down from that high, frustrated by humanity and praying that some force bigger than a singer behind a piano will someday intervene.

Never Were the Way She Was,Colin StetsonSarah Neufeld,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acb9b1335d7bf1699a8e/1:1/w_160/3790e299.jpg,2015-04-27 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20289-colin-stetson-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/,Constellation,"There’s something inscrutable and implacable about the music of the Montreal-based saxophonist Colin Stetson. His journey from the edges of the avant-garde to touring with Bon Iver and Arcade Fire has an inexorable feel to it, as if Stetson pushed his way to prominence wielding nothing but the mighty sound wrung from his chosen instrument. Sarah Neufeld, a violinist who has been a permanent member of Arcade Fire since their second album, is a kindred spirit: She brings a highly unconventional ear to her instrument and also seems to wander between genres without much fuss. The pair even share an avid interest in yoga—Neufeld has opened a studio, and Stetson has talked about the role yoga plays in his discipline, both in assisting with his demanding circular-breath style and in the mindfulness it cultivates. Neufeld and Stetson worked together on the score to the 2013 film Blue Caprice, and on Never were the way she was, they achieve a kind of ecstatic communion. The eight pieces on the album feel simultaneously contemplative and busy—the sound of active minds idling in a lower gear. The record is fantastic morning music, its tone and pace mirroring the moment in the day when your thoughts are murmuring, not yet speaking, and all you sense are their shades. It is too eventful, its surface too agitated, to be ambient, but it might help you think more clearly anyway. Neufeld and Stetson’s pieces start with something very simple and build layers that you can hear stack and slot into place. Stetson is a virtuoso, the sort of player whose technical feats change people’s perceptions of what his instrument can do.  But the pieces on Never were the way she was are laid out as simply and clearly as a children’s story. Each time, Neufeld and Stetson begin with an undulating pulse, their two instruments working busily to create the illusion of one massive one (some kind of amplified church organ, maybe, that hasn’t been created yet). Once they’ve hit this point, they hold there, letting the multifaceted sound soak in. Each piece on the album has a different pulse, with its own quality and clarity: Neufeld’s eerily smooth bowing on ""Won’t be a thing to become"" mirrors Stetson’s long-breathed, even tone, creating a glassy and impenetrable sonic surface. On ""In the vespers"", Stetson flutters his fingers over a few keys, making a wailing, high-pitched riff, and Neufeld bows sharp double stops beneath it. It’s an anxious sound, and listening to the jagged little peaks and valleys it hits is its own perversely pleasurable discomfort. The mood behind these pieces is amorphous, but there is a steely, elemental feel to the album that suggests pre-industrial times. On the unmistakably baleful ""With the dark hug of time"" Stetson’s hammering fingers on the keys make a ""CHUNK"" that suggests the sound of  a stomping kick drum, and he plays in the lowest ranges of his instrument, where the sub frequencies aren’t too far off from a drone-metal band. This kind of buzzing, physically upsetting drone is an inherently primordial sound, and the piece feels more than a little 2001-obelisk. The scrapes and thuds embedded in the otherwise smoothly rolling ""The rest of us"" send a similar message. Though the pieces are fleshed out with other small touches—other horns at the periphery, and uncanny wordless vocals—the foundation of the album rests on the power and warmth Stetson and Neufeld generate by themselves. Never were the way she was has a bracing air, an implicit reminder of the things that can be done with two instruments and two hands.","Virtuosic saxophonist Colin Stetson teams with Arcade Fire violinist Sarah Neufeld for an album of inspired minimalism. The eight pieces on the album feel simultaneously contemplative and busy—the sound of active minds idling in a lower gear.

Live at Carnegie Hall,Ryan Adams,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929add6c0084474cd0c17c9/1:1/w_160/22f77aee.jpg,2015-04-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20495-live-at-carnegie-hall/,Blue NotePax-Am,"After Ryan Adams finishes ""Come Pick Me Up"", his definitive song and the one which ends both performances captured on Live at Carnegie Hall, he leans into the mic and screams: ""THAT’S IT! YOU’RE SAD NOW!!! NOW YOU’RE SAD!!! EVERYBODY’S SAD NOW! YEAAAAHHH!!!!"" The thunderous applause lets you know that everyone in attendance on this first night is in on the joke: Adams is big enough to play Carnegie Hall now, because thousands of people have discovered that listening to Ryan Adams alone is akin to giving your sadness a spa day. But ""Come Pick Me Up"" actually transforms into something uplifting in a live setting these days. For both the performer and the audience, “Rescue Blues” and “Why Do They Leave” and “Amy” are bittersweet, nostalgic and a platform for wisecracks and anecdotes. The audience arrives with their dates and laugh at Ryan Adams, who gets to laugh at himself. The original ache is gone and everyone can just admit to each other, ""man, weren't those days something?"" Live at Carnegie Hall makes Adams’ impromptu comedy the main draw: somewhere within this three-and-a-half-hour package is one of the funniest standup records you’ll hear in 2015. And the subject of nearly all of Ryan Adams’ jokes is Ryan Adams. This is a career-spanning project, so ""Ryan Adams"" becomes a very, very broad topic. Adams offers countless punchlines about the prevalence of tears and rain in his music as well as his penchant for using this reputation to his advantage—""Probably like 86% of you are on Paxil, so you understand about depression. So... you're at a fucking Ryan Adams show,"" he cracks at one point. The most cutting material aims at Adams' most self-serious phase, also known as his ""New York"" phase. On records like Gold and Love Is Hell, Adams relied on New York City to grant his music instant gravitas and urbane legitimacy. It was literally personified on his biggest single (""New York, New York""), and his residence in the East Village felt like method acting. At one point on Carnegie Hall, he claims Love Is Hell highlight ""Please Do Not Let Me Go"" as one of his proudest moments and a song he wrote out on a pizza box while stoned as fuck and ruminating on the purpose of shoes. Live at Carnegie Hall is available as a 10-song sampler and a 216-minute 6xLP, though both versions have the casual Ryan Adams fan in mind. This isn’t for the hardcore Ryan Adams fan, the kind who will claim to have bootlegged B-side comps and shelved records that bests anything he’ll ever publicly release. This isn’t Ryan Adams’ Greatest Hits or the Definitive Ryan Adams either, something that will appeal to Whiskeytown and Heartbreaker fans who’ve begrudgingly stuck with him when he presumably lost his damn mind in 2003 and his edge on Easy Tiger. The setlists are thorough, but disappointingly conservative, writing out nearly all of his divisive records—nothing from Rock N Roll or 29, just a handful of B-sides and only the Love Is Hell tracks long-established as fan favorites. All of his selections here work beautifully with just an acoustic guitar as accompaniment, and it all manages to cast his recent work in a positive light. Since they’re all subject to the same arrangements and production, ""Am I Safe"" or ""Gimme Something Good"" can be judged on the same scale as ""Oh My Sweet Carolina"" and ""My Winding Wheel"". The performances themselves are flawless and the recording is as well; everything is so crisp and clear that Carnegie Hall might as well be your living room. But the later songs remain what they were on record: tuneful, workmanlike numbers that can’t possibly generate the emotional payload of Heartbreaker but aren’t really trying to. Ryan Adams' music often gets called ""effortless,"" which cuts both ways—it can sound elemental and eternal and also like something he dashed off in five minutes. He’s very much aware of this reputation as well—Adams ad libs a presumably impromptu funk number on piano based on a hypothetical text message exchange between Billy Ocean and Michael McDonald. It all highlights the various odd turns Ryan Adams' persona has taken over the past 20 years. After his blatant crossover bid Gold, Adams released two records in two months—one was too ""rock"", the other was too ""sad"" and both were considered career-killers. He rebounded in 2005 with three albums that were vastly superior but no more compromising—in half a year, he was a honky-tonk traditionalist, a Deadhead and Jeff Buckley. More recently, oddball vanity projects Orion and 1984 give glimmers of hope that they may one day not be the exception to the rule set by Ashes & Fire and Ryan Adams. But Live at Carnegie Hall is the Ryan Adams Ryan Adams, the one who redefined himself at 40 years old as three things no one thought he’d ever be: reliable, consistent and a consummate people pleaser.","Live at Carnegie Hall is drawn from Ryan Adams' recent two-night career-spanning residency. Available as a 10-song sampler or a 216-minute 6xLP, it keeps the casual Ryan Adams fan in mind in both versions. The performances themselves are flawless and the recording is as well; everything is so crisp and clear that Carnegie Hall might as well be your living room.

Your Good Fortune EP,Mavis Staples,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adda13d1975652139fd9/1:1/w_160/72e47e99.jpg,2015-04-24 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20498-your-good-fortune-ep/,Anti-,"Few singers of Mavis Staples' era have managed to stay as prolific or as relevant; Bettye LaVette comes in a close second, Aretha isn’t even in the race. A pop-gospel lifer who started singing in public when she was barely a teenager, she enjoyed massive success in the '60s and '70s as the mightiest voice in the Staple Singers and as an avatar of post-Civil Rights optimism. Even after a few decades in the wilderness (during which she made a string of fine, yet largely overlooked solo albums, including one produced by Prince), she experienced a resurgence in the new century with a string of albums that updated her message first to the Bush era and next to the age of Obama. She has recorded two (three if you count Pops Staples’ posthumous Don’t Lose This) excellent albums with Jeff Tweedy, one of which—2010’s *You Are Not Alone­—*won a Grammy for Best Americana Album. Decades into her storied career, she remains a force to be reckoned with. Her latest release is a four-song EP with Son Little: two originals and two new versions of songs long associated with the Staple Singers. The man born Aaron Livingston has only a single solo EP to his name, last year’s under-the-radar Things I Forgot, but he is better known for his collaborations with the Roots (that’s him singing on Undun) and RJD2 (the duo record under the name Icebird). Stylistically, he inhabits buffer zones between genres and traditions: a little bit of blues and old-school R&B, but with a strong grounding in hip-hop. Little produced Staples’ latest EP, wrote two of these four songs, and played most of the instruments, and he comes across like a man who can’t quite believe he’s working with someone of Staples’ stature. ""Why did you spend all your good fortune on me?"" Mavis sings on the opening track, drawing out that first syllable gravely and letting that final pronoun fade quickly and humbly. The song echoes the gospel sentiments she has been preaching all her life, and the melodic cadence of the verses are perfectly suited to her delivery. Little produces ""Your Good Fortune"" to gently update or at least comment on the Staples sound: His guitar playing obviously mimics Pops’ signature tone. It’s a powerful performance by both singer and producer, yet ultimately it doesn’t sound like Little wrote it for Mavis. Instead, it sounds like he wrote it to her. Little wisely keeps the arrangements straightforward, backing Staples with only a few instruments: guitar, bass, looped drums (or drums that sound looped), and a keyboard flourish every once in a while. Instead of spare, however, the songs occasionally sound crowded, as though the music is closing in on Staples. That can be intriguing on ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"", a cover of the Staple Singers’ cover of the Blind Lemon Jefferson tune, which conveys the song title's grim finality. ""Wish I Had Answered"", however, sounds a bit choked, never quite hitting the groove that handclaps and tambourine are meant to suggest. Pops wrote ""Wish I Had Answered"" in the 1960s, years before the Staples would reach the peak of their popularity, and Mavis sings his words as though threading a life’s worth of spiritual regret into three minutes. Not only has her voice gained power with age, but her sheer presence, as a living reminder of pop's social conscience, is commanding. She is a living reminder of the idea that musicians have a great responsibility to the world. That much comes through on Little’s second original, the righteous ""Fight"", on which Mavis surveys a range of social ills and invites us to help her solve them. She may not be talking specifically about RFRA, income inequality, or Black Lives Matter, but it’s impossible to hear the song in 2015 and not think of these and other pressing issues. ""Talking about Jesus but you treat people dead wrong,"" she declares in that voice that exudes moral authority and spiritual generosity. ""Freedom and justice, they ain’t your playthings."" Seldom has she sounded so accusing or so scolding, as though she can’t believe she has to keep telling us all to treat each other with respect and dignity. It takes her a bit outside her comfort zone, which is exciting for an artist of any age and makes the promise of a longer collaboration with Son Little sound particularly glorious.","Decades into Mavis Staples' storied career, she remains a force to be reckoned with. Her latest release is a four-song EP with Son Little: two originals and two new versions of songs long associated with the Staple Singers.

Beauty Pill Describes Things As They Are,Beauty Pill,by: Jason Heller,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adf213d197565213a009/1:1/w_160/b12bbb1a.jpg,2015-04-24 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20514-beauty-pill-beauty-pill-describes-things-as-they-are/,Butterscotch,"There are two tracks titled ""Ann the Word"" on Beauty Pill Describes Things as They Are, the first album by Beauty Pill in 11 years. The difference between the two speaks volumes. The first ""Ann the Word"" is an original composition by Beauty Pill’s creative leader and core member, singer/guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Chad Clark; it features Clark’s longtime Beauty Pill partner Jean Cook on ghostly lead vocals as a shamisen is plucked, jōruri-style, in the background, accompanied by prickly dissonant and haywire electronics. The second ""Ann the Word"" is a cover of a song by Lungfish, a group that was Clark’s labelmate back when he fronted the Dischord Records outfit Smart Went Crazy in the late '90s; here, the primordial dread of the original is scooped out, and the void is filled with sample-heavy layering. After Clark chants Daniel Higgs’ eschatological poetry, Cook comes in at the end and gets angelic, repeating, ""The world vanished in a gentle breeze."" In recent years, Clark himself almost met his end, and not so gently. In 2007 he was diagnosed with a viral heart ailment that he battled, off and on, for the next few years—up to and including multiple open-heart surgeries. For months on end, he didn’t have the strength to play the guitar. His struggles put the brakes on Beauty Pill, whose lone full-length for Dischord, 2004’s The Unsustainable Lifestyle, continued in the art-pop direction that Clark had established in Smart Went Crazy—with muddled results. But in 2006, Clark began exploring a new direction for Pill with a demo of ""Ann the Word"" (his song, not the cover), which broke from guitar-bass-drums to probe the freer domain of laptop arrangement, electro-acoustics, and samples. On D**escribes Things as They Are, he finally fulfills the promise of this direction, which proves fruitful and wise. The album is a smorgasbord of angles, melodies, loops, pockets, and fractal surfaces that nonetheless refuse to deviate from Clark’s longstanding bailiwick: the mythic power of the pop hook. He loves to unfold his songs as if they’re some kind of four-dimensional puzzle; ""Ain’t a Jury in the World Gon Convict You Baby"" launches on an almost industrially severe beat before the organic squish of drones and symphonic surges trickle in. It’s a big-screen anthem that addresses nationalism in a cultural climate of paranoia and recrimination, but it also packs scads of auditory information into a streamlined slither. Rather than milk his life-threatening illness for all of its lyrical worth, Clark uses it here more as a catalyst than source of raw material. In fact, in the few instances where he does address his illness—as on ""Near Miss Stories"", where he sings breezily over disembodied guitar, ""Stethoscope on my chest, he says we better do this fast/ One of these beats of your heart is gonna be the last""—he speaks through hints and distances, and even a punch line: ""The surgeon once practiced on a blood orange in an art class."" Clark performs his own kind of surgery all over Describes Things as They Are, which is filled with punchy, brassy scrambles of samples and skittering drums. *""*Drapetomania"" sounds like Art of Noise spliced with New Jack Swing. But for every manic experiment there is a pulsing, pretty, pop collage like ""Dog with Rabbit in Mouth Unharmed"". Clark’s postmodern pedigree shows on ""For Pretend"", a clatter of percussion and pinging guitar that also sports one of Clark’s most arresting melodies. If there is a drawback to Describes, it is that a few songs rely a little too heavily on Beauty Pill’s limited back of sonic tricks, whose impact dims slightly after prolonged exposure. ""Ann the Word"" isn’t the only cover song on Describes Things as They Are. Clark and crew also offer a rendition of Arto Lindsay’s ""The Prize""—only in this case, it’s highly faithful, right down to the muscular beat, lush strings, and faint brushes of Tropicália. Compare this reverent cover to his radically deconstructed take on Lungfish, the album's only visible link to Clark's past, and you can see where Clark's inclinations lie. In ""Exit Without Saving"", he sings, with taunting sweetness, ""You recognize that this is noise, right?/ You still want it?"" Clark had to wait over a decade to offer us his vision for what Beauty Pill could be, and he poses this question on Describes Things as They Are with delicacy and daring. The restless, breathless music makes clear that whatever the answer might be, he's not waiting around for it.","Beauty Pill Describes Things as They Are is the first Beauty Pilly album in 11 years, as creative leader Chad Clark battled with heart disease.

The Night Took Us in Like Family,Jeremiah JaeL'Orange,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ada6b1335d7bf1699c37/1:1/w_160/4ed5f8e5.jpg,2015-04-24 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20456-jeremiah-jae-lorange-the-night-took-us-in-like-family/,Mello Music Group,"The chemistry innate to a rapper-producer duo is something worthy of respect, whether the fruits of the dynamic are successful or not. It’s evidence of mirroring, an essential element of identity formation, relationship building, and confidence: I see something of myself in you/your work—let’s try a thing. Ultimately, the best collaboration is about ceding control, which is rare amongst the alpha personalities that dominate rap. But the truth is, most of the best rap isn’t made in a vacuum with just a Dropbox of raw, outsourced beats, but from a certain collaborative dance duet. Take Guru and DJ Premier, Dr. Dre and Eminem, Madlib and MF DOOM, Clipse and the Neptunes, DJ Mustard and YG, Killer Mike and El-P. What makes this dynamic even more interesting is when one of the partners is multi-talented. Like Madlib or Kanye West before him, on The Night Took Us in Like Family producer and rapper Jeremiah Jae relinquishes his own production know-how to focus on rapping. Jae’s production work on Flying Lotus’ hallucinatory Captain Murphy project and his own projects for Brainfeeder and Warp are often abrasive and off kilter; unlike his partner L’Orange’s production work on The Night, it is hardly ever obviously soulful. Even when Jae tweaks a classic it always sounds a little foreboding, like macerating the hot sugar of Aretha Franklin’s voice by boring into the downbeat and detuning her on his 2010 flip of her ""One Step Ahead"" (best known as the sample for Mos Def’s ""Ms. Fat Booty""). The ghost of that song can be heard on The Night in the smoky, soulful, sped-up swing of ""Part Two: God Complex"", which one of a handful of short instrumental interludes that helps set the album’s Bogart-soused, B&W tone. If the clips of film dialogue don’t give it away then the mid-century camp will, from jazz and lounge samples, down to the fingersnaps (""The Lineup""). This is an aesthetic concept record (billed, cringingly, as ""noir hop"") that teasingly ponders the idea of gangster rap from another era—pre-Scarface, for once. It’s an interesting approach, especially for illuminating the way popular culture has nefariously oversimplified the image of the ""gangster""—a phrase often used as a contemptuous shorthand for rappers in particular, and black men more broadly—throughout time. Like the swarthy-voiced Bogart, Jae’s distinctive mumble—mumblier, even, than Earl Sweatshirt—plays unreliable narrator over these 18 tracks. Call it method rapping. One minute he’s confident and smug (on the fast-slow bop of ""The Lineup"") and the next he lurks (""Invisible in a drop, invisible you cannot see me, don't let the cops see""). But he’s mostly paranoid, dogged by frauds and foes, and concerned with getting ""down like James Brown when them rounds go off."" L’Orange builds a gilded stage from a clutter of film, soul, and synth samples, refurbishing the worn 9th Wonder/early-Kanye warped soul template. It’s a pretty seamless pairing; these two have similar ideas about the completeness of a piece of music.","On The Night Took Us in Like Family, producer, rapper, and Flying Lotus collaborator Jeremiah Jae relinquishes his production know-how to L’Orange so he can focus on rapping.

II EP,Sheer Mag,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad67b1335d7bf1699bc5/1:1/w_160/32f18e33.jpg,2015-04-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20408-ii-ep/,Katorga WorksWilsuns RC,"Fuck yuppies, fuck slumlords, fuck cops and the rich—make no mistake, this is the message Sheer Mag wants you to hear. It's coded into their lyrics and built into the young Philadelphia band's blown-out grooves, which match swaggering soul force with a defiant punk spirit. Sheer Mag might reference 1970s classic rock every time they holler and shred, but their gnarled, whiskey-fueled pop-in-miniature is of a singular breed: There aren't many contemporary bands you could imagine unironically covering ""Sweet Home Alabama"" while some bloody-lipped fan stage-dives. Such is the essence of Sheer Mag's raw power. Four-fifths of Sheer Mag met at the arty New York state school SUNY Purchase, and this supremely catchy new four-song EP—the second from Sheer Mag since last fall—comes out with the support of Katorga Works, a small Brooklyn label that deals primarily in hardcore à la Lotus Fucker and Stoic Violence. Compact, handmade, and busy with ideas, the sound is akin to riff-rock on Adderall; lead guitarist Kyle Seely knows just when to reel in the epic, bedroom-recorded solos, which sound like they're blaring out a boombox plucked from a dumpster. As someone who is of the same age bracket as the members of this band, their music reminds me of the hits spilling from the '70s radios in the '90s teen movie Now and Then—Free, Stevie Wonder, the Jackson 5—if the TV was busted and staticy. On all fronts, Sheer Mag's salty-sweet music understands pop's pleasure center. They retain the architectural elements that punk seeks to ignore or unteach: the aerodynamic pull of a chiseled pre-chorus guitar melody or middle-eight before the inevitable fade-out. A slow thump and cascading riff pulls ""Fan the Flames"" open, echoing the major-key coils of ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" or any number of Lynyrd Skynyrd singles. Sheer Mag's aesthetic is scrappy, but not casual, and like their previous self-titled EP, these soda-pop rippers will soundtrack the foreseeable future of dance-parties for young people who can't dance. And there is Christina Halladay at the middle of it all, her gale-force voice full of grit and resilience. Formerly of Philly band the Shakes, you can find Halladay in the depths of YouTube, at a rowdy house show delivering covers of Aretha and Otis Redding and Smokey Robinson, whose collective influence is palpable. (Her early rock'n'roll charisma may recall Oakland garage-punk band, Shannon and the Clams.) Having grown up on Long Island, Halladay says her songs deal in ""[her] struggle of living in a city when [she] was raised in a small town—and sometimes wondering why [she's] there."" The debut EP's piercing ""Sit and Cry"" articulated this well, a wistful ode to the physical and psychological trap of big city life: ""All I do is sit and cry/ Living in the city and I don't know why/ Doing nothing but struggling to get by."" Thematically, II takes this conflicted pose as its starting point, carrying forth the us-versus-them story that has comprised the theater of punk rock for decades. II's lyrics are more explicitly politicized than Sheer Mag; these are fight songs with a folk sensibility, images of laced boots and raised fists and cross-sections of history (one is even called ""Whose Side Are You On""). ""When you see something that makes you sick/ Do you button up or do you bleed?"" Halladay shouts at the outset of ""Button Up""; as she sings the blues of city life, she protests injustices of class and gentrification. On rallying cry ""Fan the Flames"", she describes crooked landlords, trash-ridden streets, broken windows, vacant homes alongside pretty ones. ""When our neighbors burned/ It was only because of telephone cords,"" Halladay sings, adding, ""The realtors shook hands with their backs turned."" By pairing these ringing sentiments with Thin Lizzy and Skynyrd riffs, Sheer Mag subvert and repurpose the crude attitude of cock rock, not dissimilar to Sleater-Kinney's early cover of Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"", or more recently, Ex Hex on last year's Rips. Accordingly, anticonformist anthem ""Button Up"" is the best song here. Halladay spits fire, demolishing expectation—she won't bite her tongue or curtsy or take any of your shit. ""You don't know who you're tanglin' with/ I'm a bad bitch if I please,"" she threatens, ""I've done it before and I'll do it again/ I brought many a man to his knees."" You could picture this venom coming from Nicki Minaj. And yet, despite the arena-sized influences they wear on their sleeves, Sheer Mag are decidedly gruffer than anything you'd hear on the radio, then or now. And that humanizing dirt-under-the-nails is an essential repellant. The yuppies are always lurking.","Compact, handmade, and busy with ideas, the Philadelphia punk band Sheer Mag's sound is akin to riff-rock on Adderall. Lead singer Christina Halladay's gale-force, soulful vocals pair with the band's Thin Lizzy leads, subverting and repurposing cock rock for punk-rock ends.

Barter 6,Young Thug,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae0e13d197565213a03b/1:1/w_160/06f9da6e.jpg,2015-04-24 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20529-barter-6/,Atlantic300,"Young Thug is not into literalism. He thrives in gray areas, animated by the electricity generated by the tension of his own contradictions, and he never, ever offers a straightforward explanation. Look how he handled the most surreal rap beef of 2015 in a recent Instagram message to Lil Wayne. ""This is my idol. I won’t ever in my life swap words with him,"" Thug pledged—days away from releasing his imminent debut album, Carter 6, a title hijacked from Wayne, whose own Carter V languished in Cash Money purgatory. But then, in closing: ""Ha haaa,"" punctuated with a trollish tongue wag. Like most everything Thugger has done in the last year and a half, it made people confused: What kind of god-level shade was this? Is he taking any of this remotely seriously? And what in fuck’s sake is his endgame with this album, the name of which changed days before its release to Barter 6 after Wayne threatened to sue? Barter 6 was already the year’s most controversial rap album—or ""retail mixtape,"" as if the distinction really matters—before it even dropped. But Barter 6 has almost nothing to do with Lil Wayne, save its provocative title (which I’m saying is more Treachery of Images than aimless troll, anyway) and a handful of scattered lyrical shots. Idol or not, Thug hasn’t directly emulated Wayne since his debut tape, 2011’s I Came From Nothing. But he’s always seemed to delight in playful misdirection, quietly reveling in the chaos provoked by his mere existence, from the vaguely gender-bending fashions to the pet names for his friends. Thug seems to recognize the power of his own mystique, headline-grabbing yet somehow unknowable: ""Every time I dress myself, I go muhfucking viral,"" he crows, bemused, on ""Halftime"". And on Barter 6, Thug yet again dodges any easy narrative. Far from a public idol-killing, or zany sideshow, it’s composed, patient, even subtle—an album neither fans nor detractors saw coming. Over the course of his three-part I Came From Nothing tape series, Thug’s now-singular voice took shape. The projects often felt like extended stylistic experiments, ranging wildly in quality—but when inspiration struck, it sounded like nothing else coming out of his Atlanta hometown, from guileless outsider-pop ballads to completely unclassifiable vocal performance clinics. By 2013’s 1017 Thug, Thug’s ""weirdness"" had become an easy hook, a rapper who sang and hollered odes to lean and compared his jewelry to Pokémon. Early 2014 singles ""Stoner"" and ""Danny Glover"" plopped Thug on the threshold of the mainstream, and Rich Gang, the Birdman-conceived duo of Thug and kindred spirit Rich Homie Quan, spawned the radiant single ""Lifestyle"". There is no ""Lifestyle"" on Barter 6, nor is it particularly ""weird."" Opening track ""Constantly Hating"" unfurls gently, its impressionistic Wheezy beat leaving space between bass tremors for Thug to explore.  There are hardly any big-name collaborators here: ""Can’t Tell"", with its T.I. and Boosie appearances, is the least integral track, despite its star power. It reflects none of the clamor of Thugger’s dramatic 2015. Instead, Barter 6 argues that his greatest asset all along was not his wackiness, his ""outsider"" status, or his surprising inner hitmaker—it’s not even his voice, or at least, not entirely. It’s Thug’s uncanny and singular way of piecing a song together, a skill he has doubled down on with this release: a way with vocal technique, melody, and detail-oriented composition that makes the bizarre seem approachable and the familiar feel new. He plies those compositional talents here to the cohesive rap album, a format Thug had shown very little prior indication he was interested in at all. He treats the smallest compositional details with the care and craftsmanship of a chorus—everything here is a hook, from the ad-libs (a term that feels insufficient—Thug’s ""ad-libs"" are fully integrated into the song’s structure, to the point where we should probably just call them backing vocals) to the individual bars to the empty spaces. Barter 6 is not a world-conquering album; instead, it digs tunnels. More than anything, Barter 6 feels like a 50-minute performance of what rap, as a form, can do: rap that need not transcend itself, towards High Art on one hand or commercial art on the other, in order to succeed in 2015. Thug’s rapping itself, known for its unpredictability, is sharper than ever; his voice feels clarified, strengthened. Take ""Halftime"", the most thrilling technical display here, on which Thug seamlessly snaps into a dozen different flows: casually extending the second syllable of ""re-cy-cles"" so that it threatens to throw the song off track entirely, pausing a beat, unleashing a quick guffaw, snapping back on beat. It's an almost-reckless balance-beam routine. He pauses only for an ingenious vocoder breakdown that melts his cries of ""Havin’ the time of my muhfuckin’ liiiiiife"" into semiotic ooze, suddenly giving the blood-red backdrop of the cover art an almost Lynchian cast, like the velveteen Black Lodge interior. Every element exists for a reason, fitting like puzzle pieces into place over multiple listens: even the guest spots from presumable weed carriers like Duke (formerly MPA) and Yak Gotti put in work. Haunting, virtuosic final act ""Just Might Be"" gives Thug’s moments of silence the primacy of a hook: ""That’s called breathing, that’s how you let that bitch breathe,"" he sighs after a verse of rapid-fire double-time, leading into a cathartic exhale that spans a full eight bars. This is the anti-""Let the Beat Build"", on an album that’s the anti-Carter III. And as for Thug’s widely-touted unintelligibility, Barter 6 argues that all we need to do is listen a bit more carefully: what may not be legible at first glance reveals itself patiently over time. In this sense, you are doing it wrong by asking Young Thug his thoughts on Ferguson point-blank, as one reporter did last fall. Thug bristled then, responding with what looked like apathy. But there is no ambiguity on ""OD"" when he cries, ""RIP Mike Brown, fuck the cops"" (nor was there, for that matter, on his gut-wrenching 2013 Trayvon Martin tribute). He will speak when he’s ready, and on his own terms: abstracted, maybe, but ultimately loud and clear.","Far from a public idol-killing, or zany sideshow, Barter 6 is composed, patient, even subtle—an album neither fans nor detractors saw coming.

Transient,Chaos Echoes,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929add713d1975652139fd4/1:1/w_160/fee9e62d.jpg,2015-04-23 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20496-transient/,Nuclear War Now!,"Chaos Echoes, a French group formed by brothers Kalevi (guitars, vocals) and Ilmar (drums) Uibo of defunct death metal group Bloody Sign, take a freeform approach to death metal, looking to uproot it from its rigid soil. Metal, especially not death metal, has never been exactly improvisation-friendly, and the prospect of Chaos Echoes' mission is exciting. Despite their intentions, though, they wind up seeming too free, and their first full-length Transient, while an intriguing listen with moments of promise, suffers from a lack of direction that squanders their potential. Even the most outre metal groups have some sort of defined mission. Impetuous Ritual are committed to building seemingly endless oppressive walls of death-metal noise; post-Obscura Gorguts and Kayo Dot seek to bridge the gap between metal and modern classical; Mastery shows how utter chaos can be carefully spliced and reconfigured for maximum impact. Chaos Echoes' aims on Transient are more difficult to pin down. Opening track ""Senses of the Nonexistent"" thuds on and on for nine-plus minutes; cut in half, it would be twice as compelling. The song's length doesn't seem to serve any larger purpose; it just traps them (and us) in purgatory.  ""Interzone IV: Intoxicating Beauty"", the following track, contines in the same vein. It's not until two minutes into ""Advent of My Genesis"", the third track, that Chaos offer any catharsis. Their tone, on the breakdown, evokes the howling walls of the aforementioned Impetuous Ritual, or their sister band Grave Upheaval, forced screeching and wailing into sunlight. The brightness works, contrasting murk with airiness. ""Genesis"" shows, again, their map-burning working against them. Considering that drummer Ilmar is one of the founding members, one would expect the band to sync with him, but much of ""Genesis"" sounds as though he's going rogue, his rolls ignoring the tension being built by the guitars. (Considering how often they struggle with plodding on Transient, maybe they need to stop by Paris and visit experimental American ex-pat Stephen O'Malley.) There's a fine line between looseness and simply not knowing what the hell is going on, and ""Genesis"" communicates more of the latter than the former. Intriguingly, Chaos Echoes' more (relatively) conventional moments are, more often than not, their strongest. The black metal surge on the latter half of ""Genesis"" connects powerfully. ""Kyôrakushugi"" further expands on their black metal side, and it's one of their most defined tracks. Even when the rest of the band vaporizes into a mist of plucks and groans, Ilmar keeps on blasting, giving momentum they sorely need. ""Interzone VI: Realization”, meanwhile, combines drones too understated for their own good with an unfocused half-moan, half-growl vocal, like a bad Sunn O))) outtake. ""Soul Ruiner"" suggests a midpoint between their ambitions and their grasp. Staring out with frenzied picking with a slightly no-wave inflection, the band finally achieves that ""free death metal"" sound. Hallowed solos and ghostly runs sound disembodied while still leaning forward. Is this what they were wanting to go for the whole time? Transient takes too long to find any pulse, but ""Ruiner"" provides a molecule of closure for a confusing album. There should be more metal bands like Chaos Echoes, ones that challenge the notions of what metal is and what it can be. But even experiments need purpose and direction. On their Bandcamp page, there's a Wayne Shorter quote: ""To hell with the rules, I am going for the unknown."" Chaos Echoes heeded this advice and dove headfirst, but on Transient, they don't make it back. Who knows how they will expand, contract, or mutate in the future; for now, the idea of Chaos Echoes exceeds that of their execution.","Chaos Echos take a freeform approach to death metal, looking to uproot it from its rigid soil. They take elements from Impetuous Ritual and Grave Upheaval, among others, building massive walls of death-metal noise.

The Float,Roach Gigz,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae0dea9e61561daa61f1/1:1/w_160/096d1bc3.jpg,2015-04-23 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20528-the-float/,Goomba,"East Coast fans of West Coast rap, rejoice: a new Roach Gigz project has arrived in time for warmer weather. Anyone familiar with the Bay Area rapper’s work and has driven a car in summer with the windows down will appreciate the significance of this event. Roach’s track record with delivering effectively primordial, trunk-rattling post-hyphy rap music has been consistent since he first gained national attention with his mixtape Roachy Balboa in 2010. The title fit the music’s contentious charm: Roach’s hyperactive approach seemed to be a means of proving himself against naysayers, as well as a reflection of his influences, including noted hometown syllable-crammers from E-40 to Keak da Sneak. Like his first retail release—2012’s *Bugged Out—*Roach’s new studio album is centered around tight, single-ready songwriting and slicker, more flourish-filled production. But The Float is a much more significant stylistic departure, which finds the rapper venturing well outside of his comfort zone both lyrically and musically. Appropriately, the album is framed like a dream vacation, bookended by loudspeaker chatter on an airplane to Hawaii during ascent and descent. Roach’s writing is unusually introspective and tranquil: He dabbles in loose, pseudo-philosophical ruminations, ones that might surface while lounging (a bit faded) on a beach at sundown. One of the touchstones of a Roach release is the proverbial fire-spitting cut; tracks of this type constitute a large fraction of his output, sometimes leaving him breathless and ready for the James Brown cape-drape. But Roach cuts back on that overstuffed style on The Float—compartmentalizing his verses and maintaining an unflappable cool. Writing more painstakingly, however, steers him away from the jester role he’s played so well in the past; you have to wait four tracks for the first quintessential Roach-ism, and by that point it sticks out like a sore thumb: ""A couple likes don’t up amounts in your bank account/ And in this climate, I’m the Heimlich/ Don’t fuck with me, or you could choke on vomit."" Taunts and lecherous punchlines are frequently subbed out in favor of self-help truisms and some moments of wide-angle paranoia, the dark side of the high. Lyrically, there’s nothing cringe-worthy on this album (that’s not something Roach seems capable of), but it’s hard not to wish he’d incorporated a few more firebrand moments. But the much more noticeably atypical element of the album is its production. In the past, Roach’s songs have been grounded by bare, stuttering kick drums, handclaps, wobbly synth leads, and not much else. But on The Float, Roach’s producers (including long-time collaborator C-Loz) infuse that unmistakably West Coast architecture with gestures from rock, soul, and house. The impulse to diversify is reasonable considering how long Roach has stayed the course with that sound, but since it’s his first major step away, the results are variegated in quality. The most puzzling moment is a re-pitched interpolation of No Doubt’s ""Don’t Speak"" as minimalist techno; it’s made stranger by the fact that Roach raps for only 45 seconds of its three-and-a-half minutes. Other lukewarm moments include ""Hippy"", which employs an overdriven rock aesthetic, and the practiced DJ Mustard-esque swagger and come-on R&B hook of ""Drunk With You"". Unfortunately, Roach doesn’t pack enough lyrical punches in these songs to improve their replay value. The best tracks walk the line between the flashy, battle-rapping Roach of old and his more enlightened upgrade. Opener ""Mob Right Thru"" is one of his best singles to date, grounded by a glossy slide-guitar-like riff and spare beat which leaves Roach space to duck and weave. ""No End in Sight"" is equally understated, a piece of pleasantly harmonized underwater disco which features Roach’s best lines on the tape: He juxtaposes vaunting wisecracks with evocative autobiographical details, even a brief aside to his son. These postulate a future Roach capable of both embracing a more mature, restrained sound while still playing to his strengths. It’s never felt like Roach needed to change his formula. He has almost an excess of personality, and finds ways to vary his results and build excitement over anything he’s rapping over—if he tackled over the same beat four times on a tape, you might not be able to tell, and you probably wouldn’t care. But all good things must come to an end, even if it’s only for his sake. If The Float is not the crossover some fans might hope for (it always seemed like Roach should be more popular than he is), it at least provides evidence that Roach is thinking critically about his future, pulling parts of his sound apart and rebuilding them in creative ways. ""Even when I’m bad, I’m great,"" he raps on ""Bounce Back""; this rule, in some sense, has held for five years, and it seems unlikely that it will change anytime soon.","East Coast fans of West Coast rap, rejoice: a new Roach Gigz project has arrived in time for warmer weather. His writing is unusually introspective and tranquil, dabbling in loose ruminations that might surface while lounging (a bit faded) on a beach at sundown.

Makes a King,The Very Best,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae04b1335d7bf1699cdf/1:1/w_160/62cdb665.jpg,2015-04-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20523-makes-a-king/,Moshi Moshi,"In pop music years, 2008 feels like eons ago. That was the year that Radioclit—a duo of UK-based beat makers Etienne Tron and Johan Karlberg—and Malawian-born, London-based vocalist Esau Mwamwaya hopped on M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"". Sampling the Clash's ""Straight to Hell"", this British punk beat about Vietnamese bastard children of American GIs, as appropriated by a Sri Lankan refugee, and in turn recast by a Swede-French-African amalgam as ""Tengazako"" doubled as hip-pop utopia. But the world's turned plenty since then, from M.I.A.'s one-finger Super Bowl salute to a Kenyan-American presidency. And seven years on, the giddy pleasures of a Europop/African mash-up has become, if not exactly commonplace, then no longer the aural speedball it once was. The Very Best (now a duo of Karlberg and Mwamwaya) did euphoric, Afro dance pop with their 2009 debut and then widened their scope and Rolodex with 2012's MTMTMK. Their sleekest album to date, it shoehorned in the likes of Amadou & Miriam, Senegalese singer Baaba Maal, frequent David Guetta vocalist Taio Cruz, Somali-Canadian rapper K'naan, and even Bruno Mars, making them all heel to their African sun-bright sound. Guest credits on their third album, Makes a King, include another Vampire Weekend member (Chris Baio this time rather than Ezra Koenig, who contributed to their debut), the Vaccines's guitarist Freddie Cowan, and EDM newcomer Jutty Ranx, but it’s hard to pick out individual contributions. And for the most part, even the Very Best know that they can’t remain only at the ecstatic end of the musical spectrum. Much like its predecessor, Makes a King was rendered on Malawian soil, but now the Very Best are settled in the lakeside village of M’dala Chikowa rather than the country’s capital Lilongwe. And while MTMTMK at times had the odd feel of a superclub transposed to that impoverished African country, King rarely aims for the club stratosphere early on. Instead, it feels much closer to the earth and sounds most comfortable there: Low-key electronic buzzes around the opening call and response of ""Nkhondo"", a noticeable shift away from the explosive beats and bright glare of synths that previous albums made their trademark. That humble sound carries over to ""Hear Me"", Karlberg’s programmed beat and somber piano chords set somewhere between Boards of Canada’s Music Has the Right to Children and Portishead’s Dummy: slow, filtered, and at a shuffling pace. There’s the chant of a Malawian choir, some staticky voices lifted from the radio, and above it all, Mwamwaya’s strong yet controlled voice, elegant as a cloud drifting across the track. His voice interacts with that choir again on the unadorned chants of ""Bilimankhwe"", sounding like something Smithsonian-Folkways (or Hugh Tracey) might have captured to tape in the 1950s. The clean guitar that carries the ballad ""Mwana Wanga"" finds the group at its most hushed and appealing. From there though, that unassuming yet new wrinkle to the Very Best’s sound gets pushed to the side by more club-friendly fare, and the results are not nearly as charming as the first half. The break that comes three minutes into ""Sweka"" is an ambient oasis of wordless vocals and electronic trickles, but on either side is a generic chicken-scratch guitar and filtered thump. Where the duo’s ability to wed political African lyricism to production that might smuggle it into a DJ set once played to their strong suit, now when the chintzy synth chords and Ibiza-acceptable thump of ""Mariana"" lurch to the fore, it sounds like shameless pandering. There’s moments where the Very Best show that rather than merely parlay exuberance and global harmony, they can also manage the somber aspect of their music. But when Karlberg slows the beat to a crawl again on ""The Dead and the Dreaming"", he also sullies the clear timbre of Mwamwaya’s voice with distortion. In the process, what was once their most distinguished trait winds up sounding muddled.","The Very Best's third album features Vampire Weekend's Chris Baio, Vaccines guitarist Freddie Cowan, and EDM newcomer Jutty Ranx. Here, they often move away from the stratospheric Afro dance pop of their last effort for something that feels much closer to the earth.

N.E.W.,Death,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae10b1335d7bf1699cf4/1:1/w_160/c4a9de56.jpg,2015-04-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20530-new/,TryAngle,"A new Death album in 2015 is an odd thing to comprehend. The trio of brothers—Bobby, Dannis, and David Hackney—formed in Detroit in the 1970s, offering loud, fast, and heavy rock'n'roll inspired by bands like the Who and Alice Cooper. Occasionally, they ebbed toward more introspective spiritual music, but their legacy lies in their status as a lost proto-punk band: They came close to breaking through—the famous story is that Clive Davis said he’d sign them if they changed their name. David refused and they quietly broke up in 1977. Of course, that’s not the end of the story. When Drag City released their archival material, Bobby and Dannis, joined by Bobbie Duncan on guitar, started playing the old stuff to rapturous receptions. Their narrative in recent years, outlined well by the documentary A Band Called Death, goes roughly like this: ""Whoa, who are this band Death? Wait, they're still around? Holy shit, they’re playing in front of me right now! This is awesome!"" And it could’ve stayed that way, too. Thanks to the nature of their return, Death's very presence in this century is an exciting prospect. N.E.W. is their first collection of new stuff since they split in the 1970s (aside from one 1990s one-off that appeared on III) and quietly moved on to play in other bands (reggae and Christian rock outfits among them). It's also their first recorded output without the band's spiritual center and creative mastermind David, who died in 2000. Sure enough, it sounds like Death. They move along at a beefy rock'n'roll chug; they rip through impressive guitar solos; their rhythms are unpredictable. They scream and they growl. At their best, Death 2015 deliver the chest-beating, all-power proto-punk that made people flip when they heard ""Keep on Knocking"" and ""Politicians in My Eyes"" for the first time. And structurally speaking, ""Relief"" is one of their best songs ever—a muscular earworm with a shout-along chorus, screaming breakdowns, and some well-done (and understated) guitar work from Duncan. Unfortunately, that song also represents the biggest problem with N.E.W.: each theme and message is oversold. ""Detroit rocks,"" they shout, but decide that's probably too specific. ""East Coast rocks! West Coast rocks! The whole world rocks!"" At times, their lyrics are cornball and completely devoid of nuance. If we’ve learned anything from Death’s fellow Michigander Andrew W.K. (or other maximal carpe diem screamers like Junior Senior and Icona Pop), aggressively positive music works best when it’s pitched right over the top. Death rarely hit full boil. Their performances are technically impressive but feel tepid. Understandably, their journey is a central narrative on N.E.W. At this point, though, the band's biography has been well-documented. When they sing about existing in the underground, how they ""feel the love"" now that they've been brought to the light, and note that ""the fun has just begun"" on ""Resurrection"", the message feels superfluous. Watch Death perform in the closing scenes of A Band Called Death—every word of ""Resurrection"" is spelled out more eloquently and concisely in the Hackneys' earnest, smiling expressions. The themes of resurrection, return, and revival are implicit to the album's mere existence, and the Hackneys do a better job of navigating those concepts when they leave some room for subtext (""Who Am I""). Death were worthy of thinkpieces and a documentary because their very good, very heavy recordings predated and portended punk without actually influencing it. The rock'n'roll playing field is drastically different at this point in their careers—they're operating in a sprawling, endless landscape of heavy guitar music. Unlike ...For the Whole World to See, N.E.W. does not sound like a lost proto-punk classic; it's just a pretty good rock record made by guys who have been at it for a long time.

Sound & Color,Alabama Shakes,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad775e6ef95969321aa5/1:1/w_160/f61312e7.png,2015-04-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20420-sound-color/,ATO,"Two years ago, Alabama Shakes performed at the White House as the Obamas sat in the front row, just a few feet away. The Athens, Ala. band were part of a ""Memphis Soul"" revue celebrating that city’s groundbreaking '60s sounds, which famously featured black and white musicians working together to make lasting hits like ""Hold On, I'm Comin'"" in the thick of the civil rights era. The visual symbolism of the event was powerful, a historically rich triumph of the unity that soul music has often portended: As the nation’s first black president looked on, multiracial Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard led her band of white instrumentalists—along with Memphis greats Booker T. Jones and Steve Cropper—on the classic 1967 blues track ""Born Under a Bad Sign"". Barack and Michelle nodded their heads in respectful rhythm. Malia seemed mildly amused. Sasha, meanwhile, was bored. Like, remarkably bored. Her flat stare was the type usually reserved for dentist waiting rooms or Target customer service lineups. Her obligatory golf clap at the end of the song was wan to the point of noiselessness. Howard, for her part, could probably see where the youngest Obama was coming from. During the performance, the singer paced impatiently, seemingly humbled by the pageantry and also perhaps feeling a little constricted by the antiquity of it all. It wasn’t that Howard and her band didn’t know their blues; the working-class quartet came from a small town in the mythic South and cut their teeth on hours-long sets of covers. And when the frontwoman belted, ""Hard luck and trouble been my only friend/ I been on my own ever since I was 10,"" the lines held pointed meaning for Howard since she lost her older sister—and only sibling—to cancer when she was around that age. But for all their preternatural grit, sweat, and passion (along with every other age-old signifier of rock'n'roll authenticity known to man), Alabama Shakes were never quite comfortable with the retro-soul box many placed them into upon their arrival in 2012. To be fair, their debut, Boys & Girls, certainly deserved the tag, its vintage moves elevated mostly by Howard’s gale-force delivery, an instrument that could have blown Otis Redding back. The band’s effortless charm, instant familiarity, and Great Recession recovery anthem ""Hold On"" made them easy to root for, and the album went onto sell more than 700,000 copies. It felt as if they could be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at any moment. And yet, the idea taking on the mantle of '60s soul was never part of the plan for Alabama Shakes. In interviews, they casually distanced themselves from the pure revivalists of Daptone Records while repping for theatrical sensationalists like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and My Chemical Romance; their origin story had Howard noticing bassist Zac Cockrell because he was wearing an At the Drive-In shirt; when the band hit ""Saturday Night Live"" recently, Howard wore earrings emblazoned with Prince’s face. ""We just don’t wanna own the classic R&B title and let people down,"" guitarist Heath Fogg diplomatically stated around the release of Boys & Girls, ""because when we go electronic on the next record it might break some hearts."" Sound & Color is not an electronic record. But it is strange and mystical and unexpected—more Houses of the Holy than ""Holy Cow"". It’s got past lives and future people, traces of Curtis Mayfield, Erykah Badu, MC5, the Strokes. There’s a song called ""Shoegaze"" that could find a second home on the Rolling Stones’ Tattoo You. Bon Iver collaborator Rob Moose provides eerie string arrangements that slowly encroach on songs like ivy climbing up a fence while the band and co-producer Blake Mills tweak tones and rhythms to make guitars and drums and bass and keyboards sound genuinely exciting—fresh, even—in 2015. This is stadium soul with one eye peeking toward another galaxy while hands and feet and throats desperately try to suss out life here on Earth. Of course, Howard is at the center of it all. Over the course of the last three years, she’s managed to take complete control over her unbridled voice without losing a smidge of spontaneity. She’s no longer just building toward an ecstatic climax (though there are several of those here), but rather exploring the upper reaches of her register, cajoling instead of hollering, taking on operatic cadences. The singer, who took part in both raucous Baptist services as well as a cappella hymns in the Church of Christ growing up, layers her vocals on almost every track, offering harmonies and ghosts that can’t help but follow her around; on one bipolar love song, what sounds like ghoulish laughter echoes behind Howard as she pours her being into the words ""gimme all your love!"" Is she reveling in her desires? Sending up her larger-than-life voice? Smiling into the void of unrequited love? Yes, yes, and yes. As a lyricist, Howard excels at spinning down-home profundity that make her sound her age, 26, and years beyond. Along with her tales of haunted love, cautious optimism, and impassioned pacifism come more impressionistic songs that mean to find connections between epochs and space. She and her band travel through the blues back to a bad sign—or is it a good one?—on ""Gemini"", a six-and-a-half-minute excursion into zero-gravity funk. Whereas Alabama Shakes once seemed destined to relive the history of others, they invent their own genesis here, as weeds grow near the Tennessee River and eyes reveal dreams that eventually must wake up. And just as the song comes to a close, it keeps going for a little while longer.","Alabama Shakes escape their ""retro-soul"" box for good on Sound & Color, a strange, mystical and unexpected record with traces of Curtis Mayfield, Erykah Badu, MC5, and the Strokes.

Verde EP,Tei Shi,by: Minna Zhou,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ae0313d197565213a028/1:1/w_160/406d5eab.jpg,2015-04-22 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20522-verde-ep/,Mom + PopMermaid Avenue,"Verde begins in low light. A single bass frequency pulses for a full eight bars before a voice croons from the dark: ""I can’t be sure of it."" Its echo follows close behind, and then its echo’s echo, twinning around each other, filling the grotto (complete with dripping noises) like waves at high tide. The track, ""Can’t Be Sure"", is the embodiment of what Tei Shi calls ""mermaid music,"" and an intermittent heartbeat suggests that the ""it"" the voice sings of is likely a matter of the heart. The song, like the rest of the EP, explores the exposed, liminal spaces: between certainty and uncertainty, desire and apathy, wanting and needing. Tei Shi is the moniker of New York City-based singer/songwriter and producer Valerie Teicher. She released her first EP, Saudade, in 2013 with collaborator and producer Luca (who also helped produce Verde). The project introduced her to the world as a skilled and fluid vocalist, the kind who can create waves with nothing but her voice and loops. Born in Buenos Aires to Colombian parents, Teicher's family uprooted and moved to Canada and then she left for music school in Boston. ""When your environment changes so much around you, you have to make yourself the constant,"" she said in a 2014 interview with Rookie. Teicher's music shares some overlap with the dreamy, future soul/alt-R&B sphere of Kelela or Tinashe, and she also brings to mind the similarly water-obsessed Rahel, or an '80s-pop-leaning Shura. But while her voice can fit anywhere she flexes it, she's still finding the best context for it. Verde is in one sense a series of experiments exploring how an artist maintains an individual voice across genres. The EP’s first single and second track, ""Bassically"", for instance, takes the form of a synthy '80s pop ballad. While the lyrics themselves fall a bit flat, Teicher sells them with her delivery, and over the course of a couple verses, she builds into some serious siren-level wails. ""Go Slow"", the pop gem of the EP, is a sweet, if guarded, invitation to get closer, with a groove that is part boom bap, part trap-lite, but swathed in electropop. ""See Me"", meanwhile, is a more direct line to Teicher’s indie roots. Atmospherically, it's kind of like a cross between the lushness of Bat for Lashes and the minimalism of the xx. It works beautifully, but the xx guitars in particular sound a little too close to the original, and you sense that Teicher is still figuring out who she is as a producer. She may still be coming into her own in that regard, but Verde glows with unmistakable and appealing confidence. On record, Teicher radiates a quiet self-possession, someone conscious of her desires and unafraid of vulnerability. There are a few possible directions mapped out on this EP, and hopefully whichever one she takes next, she’ll bring the same kind of magnetism and musical responsiveness with her.","Tei Shi is the moniker of New York City-based singer/songwriter and producer Valerie Teicher.

Permanent Exile,Red Death,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929addcb1335d7bf1699c9d/1:1/w_160/4af7fac0.jpg,2015-04-22 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20500-permanent-exile/,Grave Mistake,"Because D.C.'s independent titan Dischord Records has released so many genre-defining records, it can be easy to gloss over the consistent and wide-ranging history of DIY in the nation’s capital. From post-punk to hardcore to metal and beyond, there have always been active, overlapping house show/small club scenes in D.C. that owe their basic ethos to punk. The bands on the recently released and truly exciting Red Line Comp, declaring themselves the ""New Wave of D.C. Hardcore,"" shift the spotlight from historical D.C. punk to what’s happening now, and so far, both the comp and the other releases of the bands it features have proven that you should, indeed, pay attention to what this crew is up to. They’re not releasing grab-you-by-the-collar records, they’re releasing grab-you-by-the-throat records. Red Death, one of the bands featured on The Red Line Comp, step up, demanding their place in this stellar still-forming legacy with Permanent Exile, their first full-length. Members who contributed to this album play in more traditional hardcore bands like Sectarian Violence, but Permanent Exile is a full-on crossover thrash record, less in the speedier L.A. tradition (think Cryptic Slaughter) than in the heavier New York tradition (think D.R.I.). The band roars, gnashes, howls, and divebombs its way through 16 minutes and 47 seconds, and when it’s over, the listener is left with the kind of bone-tired exhilaration that follows the best hardcore shows—if you’ve ever sat on the stoop with your friends after an incredible set, soaked in sweat with glowing cheeks, too tired to speak much but with new determination to start a band of your own, you know the feeling. Permanent Exile never feels relentless or too formulaic, two easy traps for hardcore and metal records to fall into. There are thousands of mundane releases out there that in under 20 minutes can cause a listener’s eyes to glaze over—what song is this one again? It sounds exactly the same as the last three. With taut, well-written songs that vary in tempo and even stray into noise-ambience in places (""Atomic Howl""), Red Death expertly avoid these pitfalls. The record blazes the whole way through, but the fire flickers in different patterns—the difference between a pretty good record and a great one. My one small quibble with Permanent Exile is the mix, and this is really a matter of taste; I tend to prefer a more layered hardcore-style mix in which the bass and guitar are slightly disentangled and the vocals just under the surface rather than a more metal-style mix in which the bass and guitar lay thick in the middle and the vocals sit directly on top. There are plenty of records from the original crossover thrash mini-boom of the mid-'80s that are mixed exactly like this one, so it’s not that it’s not the right sound for the subgenre. It’s just that crossover thrash is a continuum, and I tend to prefer recordings that lay closer to the set of hardcore production aesthetics than the metal ones. Whatever your particular sonic subgenre production style allegiance is, though, there’s no denying that this is an excellent record with enough crushing riffs, precise but powerful drumming, and spot-on vocals that are a perfect homage without being a parody, to make even the oldest, crabbiest scene vet sit up and take notice.","The bands on The Red Line Comp, who declare themselves the ""New Wave of D.C.

Edge of the Sun,Calexico,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad16b1335d7bf1699b38/1:1/w_160/96bb9ea4.jpg,2015-04-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20353-edge-of-the-sun/,Anti-City Slang,"A vintage synth belches out an insistent theme to open the noisy ""Cumbia de Donde"", a standout on Calexico’s new album. It’s one of the most striking moments on Edge of the Sun, a rusty tangle of staccato notes and syncopation atop a sinewy percussion groove. Not only does it chafe against the band’s default folk rock, but that central riff acts as a sort of code, as though the Tucson collective is offering coordinates for a northerly route connecting South and North, Sonora with San Francisco. It’s a song about origins (""¿De dónde eres?"") and destinations (""¿Adónde vas?""), punctuated by the dots and dashes of a conspiratorial horn section. ""I’m not from here, I’m not from there,"" Joey Burns sings, imbuing this itinerancy with power and possibility. Taking over vocals at the bridge, the Spanish vocalist Amparo Sánchez reveals the song’s true destination. ¿Adónde vas? ""A bailer cumbia."" In this as in so many of Calexico’s songs, the characters can go anywhere and do anything. Perhaps it’s a quaint notion, but there is a certain freedom in rootlessness and restlessness. This idea has been Calexico’s guiding principle since Burns and drummer Jon Convertino split from Giant Sand in the early 1990s and lit out for parts unknown. They have never stood still for long, working as a backing band for Neko Case and Amos Lee while expanding their drums-and-guitar soundtrack rock into something larger, more song-driven, and more cinematic. If the band have skirted accusations of cultural appropriation, that’s mainly due to the important fact that they do not deploy world music as a means to exoticize American folk rock. Rather, these various strains form the framework of their band’s songs, all the way down to the lyrics themselves. It wasn’t until 2012’s Algiers that they began to sound creatively staid, as though they had reached the ends of their inspiration in Latin American music, but Edge of the Sun sounds newly invigorated and inspired as Calexico reconsider their own past and find new music to explore. Burns and Convertino have always surrounded themselves with an eclectic set of collaborators, and Edge of the Sun is filled with cameos, most of them lending their songs a distinctive sound. Case sounds like a mirage on ""Tapping on the Line"", and Ben Bridwell, on loan from Band of Horses, adds some 2000s indie-rock drama to opener ""Falling from the Sky"", making that central question resonate powerfully throughout the rest of the album: ""Where do you go when you have nowhere to go?"" With Sam Beam singing and playing guitar, ""Bullets & Rocks"" inevitably recalls their joint EP from 2005, In the Reins, only bolder and more resourceful as they set a Tinariwen guitar lick rolling through the Mojave. As usual, however, the most compelling contributions come from artists less familiar to American ears. For this reason, Calexico place them prominently in the music, often building whole songs around their voices or instruments. Sánchez is as much a presence on ""Cumbia de Donde"" as frontman Burns is, and members of the Greek band Tikam lend ""World Undone"" its suspense, creating the impression of an unraveling groove. Mexican singer Carla Morrison dominates the dark reggae bump of ""Moon Never Rises"", ghosting Burns’ vocals before distorting her own delivery to make that central theme sound unsettling, uprooted, unplaceable. (Curious listeners should check out her excellent 2012 album, Déjenme Llorar.) It’s tempting to praise Calexico simply for its globetrotting spirit, but corralling so many styles and sounds onto one album should not be an end in itself. Fortunately, the album’s musical diversity is a reflection of its lyrical themes. Named for a city that straddles Mexico and America, Calexico make music that is almost inevitably about borders both musical and national: finding them, crossing them, blurring them. Burns’ songwriting keeps that idea anchored in very personal and specific perspectives, which lends human proportions to the ambitiously cinematic arrangements. His characters are transient by circumstance, always striving for something better: a sense of security, a feeling of freedom, a place to dance without danger, sometimes just a dip in the ocean. That’s the one wish of the main character in ""Miles from the Sea"", a landlocked laborer beaten down by ""years of searing heat."" He ""dreams about swimming, miles away from the sea,"" Burns sings, his voice reaching deep to hit the low notes. The horns billow gently, the violin eddies wistfully, and Guatemalan singer Gaby Moreno draws those syllables out on the chorus to reinforce the sense of longing. The song fades in a roll of thunder, hinting that this dream of escape will go unrealized, but the music takes him and us right out among the waves.","Joey Burns and Jon Convertino have always surrounded themselves with an eclectic set of collaborators, and Edge of the Sun is filled with cameos, including Ben Bridwell, Neko Case, Carla Morrison, Sam Beam, and Gaby Moreno.

"Sherwood at the Controls, Vol. 1: 1979-1984",Various Artists,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ac61c0084474cd0c1546/1:1/w_160/318e455b.jpg,2015-04-22 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20535-sherwood-at-the-controls-vol-1-1979-1984/,On-U Sound,"Now in his mid-50s, the London-born producer Adrian Sherwood is a sort of bass-music activist, fighting to keep the ""dub"" in dubstep with solo albums like 2012's Survival and Resistance and lecturing on studio-recording history and technique at Red Bull Music Academy. But Sherwood made his deepest mark 30-some years ago, working in the slipstream between post-punk, industrial and Jamaican music that ran between London and New York. Once you start picking at the threads of his CV, you'll discover an adventurous, refined musical talent whose singular sound helped generate momentum for a slew of edgy, iconic bands and ensured his own placement in the producers' pantheon. To stimulate the inevitable reassessment, Sherwood is releasing music from his back catalog on his On-U Sound label, which he originally founded in 1979 as a repository for the work he was doing with Jamaican musicians. Sherwood at the Controls, Vol. I: 1979-1984 explores a thrilling period in music history and makes a compelling point of entry for appreciating Sherwood's influence. Among its 14 selections, dub is a persistent thread. In the London music scene of the late '70s, the sonic touchstones of Jamaican music—oceanic bass, cavernous reverb, spacious syncopation, an overarching sense of studio-applied patience and distance—appeared in surprising places, applied to far-flung genres. By that stage in his career, young Sherwood had cultivated a reputation beyond his early association with Jamaican expats in London's reggae scene. He was known as a production auteur with a serious ear and bands like the Fall, the Slits and the Pop Group, all represented here in various incarnations, sought his signature touch. On the Fall's ""Middle Mass"", they sound like a more minimalist version of themselves, demonstrating both Sherwood's collaborative subtlety and Mark E. Smith's predilection for bubbling bass. The Pop Group frontman Mark Stewart's ""Learning to Cope with Cowardice"" is one of the more contemporary-sounding jams here, the kind of crunchy digi-dub that we associate from modern purveyors like Glasgow's Scotch Bonnet Records or Leipzig's Jahtari. Stewart wasn't the only Pop Group member to enlist Sherwood after the band's breakup: Guitarist John Waddington recorded with him as part of a group called Maximum Joy. ""Let It Take You There"" is one of the comp's highlights, six minutes of spaced-out and infectiously upbeat post-punk funk à la ESG. It follows album opener ""Hungry, So Angry"" by Medium Medium—another fantastic, dancefloor-oriented, sax-driven number, this one leaning toward Talking Heads-like jitter-pop. Several songs later, Sherwood and Shriekback—which consisted of Barry Andrews of XTC and Dave Allen of Gang of Four—push the limits of a LinnDrum machine on the proto-industrial ""Mistah Linn He Head"". If you sense a theme, that's not an accident: These songs and artists form a nexus of references for a slew of more recognizable early '80s bands. Sherwood was a physical link between the Jamaican underground to the white avant-garde, and collectively, over the course of years, they pushed unconventional musical ideas into the mainstream, where the likes of David Byrne and the Police made them popular. But Sherwood—and Sherwood at the Controls—remains unpopulist. The second half of the compilation is especially and deliciously weird. Here we meet Jamaican music luminaries like producer Prince Far I, whose Linton Kwesi Johnson-sampling ""Nuclear Weapon"" flows at a lava-like pace, and vocalist Bim Sherman, who performs ""Reaching the Bad Man"" as part of Sherwood's studio ensemble Singers and Players, unspooling an eight-minute foray into deep, skeletal dub. To this day, African Head Charge is one of On-U's flagship bands; their 1982 cut ""In a Trap"" sizzles with Nyabinghi-style percussion, rubbery bass and faraway guitar. The depth and breadth of Sherwood at the Controls stuns. These songs aren't just curious footnotes in one man's extensive discography—a bunch of them legitimately bang, and the ones that don't go full-bore into left field. Taken together, they give a sense of the indelible mark Sherwood has left, and hopefully there is more on the way to round out the picture.","The London-born Adrian Sherwood is an adventurous, refined musical talent whose singular sound helped generate momentum for a slew of edgy, iconic bands, including the Fall, the Slits, the Pop Group, and more.

Kindred,Passion Pit,by: Jamieson Cox,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ada413d1975652139f7e/1:1/w_160/b4f6510e.jpg,2015-04-22 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20454-kindred/,Columbia,"Keep your ears open, and you can hear Passion Pit everywhere around you: in fast food commercials and YouTube pre-roll ads you can’t wait to skip, the skewed pop maximalism of PC Music and its imitators, the glossy hybrid EDM-pop of Madeon and Zedd, even the clutter of Taylor Swift’s work with Jack Antonoff on 1989. It’s easy to take for granted now, but Michael Angelakos’ first two records shifted the pop paradigm in meaningful ways. Manners hooked up the '80s synth-pop of M83’s Saturdays=Youth to a glucose IV, piling on children’s choirs and waves of orchestration and Angelakos’ signature falsetto until it forced you into submission; three years later, Gossamer ramped up the density, scale, and emotional rawness of Angelakos’ writing, as he built glittering castles around love, death, and the redeeming power of joy. That rawness is what separates Passion Pit from its lesser contemporaries, and from bands who would seek to duplicate their success: Angelakos' songs dance on the line between sweet and saccharine, but they’re anchored by real stakes. They’re full of light because you can use a lot of it when you’re holding a candle to the darkness. Kindred is Angelakos’ first record after conducting an unflinching, very public self-examination of his mental health and its effects on his life and loved ones, a process that dominated both Gossamer and the press cycle around the record. Instead of doubling down on that kind of reflection, Angelakos shifts focus to the parts of his life that gave him strength as he endured personal and professional turmoil: his family, his faith, and the radiant love that springs from both. It’s also his most concise record to date, a far cry from the sprawl of both Manners and Gossamer: it’s only 10 songs, and the songs themselves are more interested in speed and economy. The best songs are the ones that really take that idea of efficiency to heart, stripping away fluff and frippery to focus on core melodic ideas or compositional concepts. This marks a major change in Angelakos’ songwriting: most listeners would agree that Gossamer’s best moments were its biggest, whether the frenzied Rustie-isms of ""I’ll Be Alright"" or the massive, starlit ""Hideaway"". That’s not the case here on Kindred, where the highlights hew closer to the soulful heartbreaker ""Constant Conversations"". There are a lot of moving parts on something like ""Whole Life Story"", a song-length apology to Angelakos’ wife for the scrutiny placed on their lives post-Gossamer, but each of them are clear and discernible rather than overwhelming, and lithe pop-funk jam ""Where the Sky Hangs"" sets a new record for ""audible space in a Passion Pit song."" When Angelakos opts for an arrangement that recalls the density of his older work, you find yourself wishing he had opted for a similarly pared down approach. ""All I Want"" is a good example. Its core message—being struck dizzy and dumb by your love for someone, and rejoicing in it with a simple, gorgeous melody—is compromised by the use of every tool in Angelakos’ toolbox: whirring dervishes spat out on guitar, vocal pieces whispering like ghosts in the background, glittering doodads glued on like rhinestones. On earlier albums, the tremendous scale and layering of his songs felt purposeful, like it was meant to reflect the buzzing hornets’ nest in Angelakos’ brain; when he tries to do the same thing on Kindred it feels aimless, a choice that doesn’t move songs forward or help to advance any ideas. This is also a very spiritual record, which shouldn't be a surprise if you've pored over Angelakos' lyric sheets before. (Consider Gossamer closer ""Where We Belong"", where after alluding to a suicide attempt Angelakos sings, ""Who says that God exists?/ We can't see icons or myths, but/ Well, I believe in you/ Do you believe in me, too?"") Opener ""Lifted Up (1985)"" is another glowing ode to Angelakos' wife, but it traffics in the language of apotheosis: Instead of being born, she descends from heaven, and when she threatens to float back Angelakos grounds her with the force of their love. The album is otherwise scattered with references to prayer and the exertion of subtle divine force, like the conspicuous cloud cover of ""Looks Like Rain"" and the baptism/savior imagery of ""My Brother Taught Me How to Swim"". This kind of writing isn't as obviously courageous as the work he did on Gossamer, but it still takes plenty of bravery to write frankly about faith in a medium where it's usually ignored or neglected. It takes guts to say, in effect, ""I had to work really hard to get better, and embracing something bigger than myself really helped me."" And while Angelakos has never been a particularly artful lyricist, he writes with a wide-eyed sincerity and frankness that makes you want to root for him. As the first document of Angelakos' shift towards a different songwriting approach, one more focused on efficiency and pop purity than complexity or breadth, Kindred is ultimately both a transitional moment and a mixed bag. Not every song on Manners and Gossamer worked, but at their very least they had something to keep your attention, some grippy sonic piece. Kindred lives and dies on the strength of its melodies, and some of those melodies are submarined by excess rather than enhanced by it. When the album's highlights click (""Whole Life Story"", ""Where the Sky Hangs"", ""Looks Like Rain"") they're as powerful and resonant as anything in the band's discography, but the chances of success feel a little lower than they were before. It turns out that the year's best Passion Pit song, and the one that realizes the full potential of Angelakos' new ambitions, isn't even on Kindred. ""Pay No Mind"", a single from Madeon's excellent March debut Adventure, is the kind of the song that couldn't exist without Passion Pit in the first place—a colorful fusion of pop, funk, and EDM featuring a typically chirpy vocal performance from Angelakos. His connection to the song's lyrics is obvious, a fraternal twin of ""Whole Life Story"" that finds Angelakos asking for forgiveness and encouraging his loved ones to ignore the external forces swirling around them. It's catchy without relying on gimmickry, undeniably personal, and totally piercing; it's the kind of song I'd love to find more often on Kindred.","On Kindred, Michael Angelakos shifts focus from the painful public self-examination of Gossamer to focus on the parts of his life that give him strength: his family, his faith, and the radiant love that springs from both. It is also his most concise effort, far from the sprawl of his first two albums.

Heretical Anatomy,Abyss,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adc6b1335d7bf1699c6e/1:1/w_160/ba491069.jpg,2015-04-21 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20480-heretical-anatomy/,20 Buck Spin,"More and more, it feels like the first thing a new death metal band decides is which older group to ape. Are you going to become a crusty Bolt Thrower clone? Dare you get as filthy as Autopsy? Do you set to write tributes to Obituary? These bands are all worth copying, but who says you have to choose just one? Canadian quintet Abyss, for one, don’t think you do. On their debut full-length, Heretical Anatomy, the group soaks in several styles of old-school death metal, overcoming the tyranny of influence to make an exciting tribute to the bands they love, while also offering up something of their own. The opening title track splits the difference between two modes of Carcass worship; Necroticism’s refinement comes head to head with the rawness of Symphonies of Sickness. The track showcases Abyss’ penchant for borrowing from death metal’s legends, creating faithful renditions packed with their own punk personality. Anatomy has plenty of Nordic riffs, taken from the likes of Entombed and Carnage and then dipped in dirtier, more American tar. The punk leanings really come through on the third track, ""Chained to Extinction"": a bulldozer bass segues into a palm-muted Swedish refrain so on-point you’ll envision waves of bobbing blonde hair before it all eventually explodes into thrashing catharsis. This release makes vocalist David Kristiansen exert himself more, going for an urgent hardcore yalp in line with the panicked rhythms. ""Flesh Cult"" is even more to the point, sounding like a death metal interpretation of Kristiansen’s main group, powerviolence band Column of Heaven. (It’s worth noting that he, along with CoH bassist Andrew Nolan and drummer Eric King, had a punky death metal group called Slaughter Strike between 2009 and 2011.) And, while it may seem like a strange quality for death metal, Abyss know when enough is enough. ""The Atonement"" flirts with Incantation-style dirge, but the affair ends there. To exploit it would take away from Anatomy’s energy. ""Thrall of the Elder Gods"" is their slowest and longest, but it’s also a lesson in conservation. They’re able to drive the same terror from a cliffhanger riff as they do a full-on blastbeat-ridden assault. Of all the influences, one is the most prominent: Flint, Michigan grindcore pioneers Repulsion. Beneath their macabre obsessions and noisy racket, there was a rock'n'roll heart beating at the center of their sound. Abyss could be likened to Repulsion with a cut and a shave: the presentation may be a little cleaner, but the hunger doesn’t subside. Much of Repulsion’s youthful stride is found in how Abyss execute their riffs; there’s no joking around, but they still swing like Paul Speckmann and Chris Reifert just brought fresh kegs to the best death metal house party ever. You can hear that in the intro to ""Atonement"", where leads scamper around frantically, while remaining in sync with the rest of the band. Closer ""Nightmares in Skin"" also bears a heavy Repulsion branding, while maintaining some Swedish sickness. While Abyss clearly bounce between styles, Anatomy resembles, in spirit, the formative days of death metal, where it hadn’t quite weaned itself off its thrash, Discharge, and Motörhead. Forms hadn’t jelled and folks hadn't gotten too serious just yet. Strange as it may sound, Anatomy is one of the most flat-out fun death metal records to come out in some time. It doesn’t strain and break its neck to be ""funny,"" it’s just an unpretentious but still interesting collection from a fresh new face.","On their debut full-length, the Toronto group Abyss soak in several styles of old-school death metal, while also offering up something of their own. The punked up, unpretentious collection is one of the most flat-out fun death metal records to come out in some time.

The Children of the Night,Tribulation,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acf55e6ef959693219d4/1:1/w_160/fb842ed9.jpg,2015-04-21 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20329-the-children-of-the-night/,Century Media,"The Children of the Night, the glorious third album from Swedish metal charmers Tribulation, begins with an invitation. A backdrop of cello, church organ and piano gives way to a midtempo full-band rumble, and then Johannes Andersson grunts like a mad old man curling a finger and commanding you to come along. ""Beckoning the children of the night, the spirits of the undead and the lesser lights,"" he sings on ""Strange Gateways Beckon"". These first two minutes suggest the beginning of some grand adventure—a Tolkien-like walk through the woods, a Dante-like descent into depravity. And they are: A heavy metal record that wanders beyond any comfort zone, the hour-long The Children of the Night is a sprawling, compulsory tale that doesn’t turn dull. Tribulation have never made an album quite like this: More than a decade ago, most of the band played adolescent, hair-whipping trash as Hazard. Five years after a name change, they re-emerged with The Horror, a claustrophobic mixture of death metal, black metal and thrash, intertwined by arty interludes that suggested major ambition. They pursued it unapologetically and even to excess on 2013’s The Formulas of Death, which began with a tambura drone and ended with a shape-shifting 13-minute mess called ""Apparitions"". On The Children of the Night, Tribulation push all those influences and ideas toward the center. It’s as if they’ve pondered the relatively populist successes of their fellow countrymen—Ghost B.C., In Flames, even Watain—and rediscovered the value of concision and motion. Psych rock and prog metal, thrash and classic rock commingle in three-to-seven-minute songs, bearing echoes of not just Mercyful Fate and At the Gates but Led Zeppelin and Hawkwind, the Doors and dub. Led by brilliant guitarists Jonathan Hultén and Adam Zaars, these ten incisive songs cut away tangents and bristle with urgency. “Holy Libations”  is heroic and surging, with one seeming crescendo and dashing solo piled atop another. The racing “Melancholia” powers through death metal before cresting with a rock-god solo that feels forever on the verge of falling apart. By and large, though, it’s the band that makes these songs so stunning, not Andersson. He sings in a perpetually gruff monotone, offering morose observations and dramatic revelations. During ""Holy Libations"", he delivers a dense verse about the solidarity of misery and then tries his best to break his typical pace with a sort of staccato half-rap. He stumbles around the beat, straining with effort. Tribulation, then, are a little like metal’s the Hold Steady—a righteous rock band burnished by high-flying guitars and big keyboards but led by a singer who seems to have shown up late for practice with a notebook full of quips and a belly full of booze. Tribulation let Andersson’s thorny vocals stand alone, backing him only occasionally with harmonies; for a band that composes with near-classical rigor, he remains the scratch that can’t be buffed. This tension becomes apparent when it disappears. Mid-album instrumental “Själaflykt” moves from doom-like dirge to mid-tempo boogie, like The Ventures penning a summertime special for the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. But by song’s end, the action feels bloated and defanged. When his growl bullies its way into “The Motherhood of God,” the friction is newly welcome. Metal critics sometimes snipe at each other for preferring extreme or arty metal to the sort of music to which actually raise beers and fists. There is no way to arrive at a consensus artist who will satisfy everyone, of course, but The Children of the Night comes close.  On one hand, the irascible Andersson sounds like the kind of bandleader who hopes to follow you into an alley with a lead pipe. But the organ-loaded, solo-bejeweled “Strains of Horror” is an anthem. The hook of “Strange Gateways Beckon” just begs to be shouted back at the band. Sure, Andersson is a bit too brusque for complete crossover success, but the exceptional The Children of the Nightextends an open invitation to a very wide audience.","The glorious third album from the Swedish metal band Tribulation is a sprawling, compulsory tale that doesn’t turn dull.

Lost River OST,Johnny Jewel,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adf09d034d5c69bf4459/1:1/w_160/f57c14a1.jpg,2015-04-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20513-lost-river-ost/,Italians Do It Better,"Lost River, a film directed by actor Ryan Gosling, was ritually savaged at its Cannes Film Fesival premiere and barely recovered on its official release. Reviews were almost comically awful. It could generously be described as a striking visual work that never really gels: Gosling’s time working with Nicolas Winding Refn on Drive clearly had a profound impact, as Christina Hendricks (who had a small role in Refn’s film) stars and the soundtrack is helmed by Italians Do It Better label boss Johnny Jewel, whose contributions to the Drive soundtrack helped establish the film's neon atmosphere. Cliff Martinez technically handed the composer duties for Drive, but on the Lost River OST, Jewel gets his first real score, writing a soundtrack that runs excess of 90 minutes. Jewel doesn’t really deal in concision, at least not in album form. His Themes For an Imaginary Film, released under the Symmetry guise, stretched to around two hours, while Chromatics’ acclaimed Kill for Love clocks in at a similar length to this score, indulging in multifarious impulses along the way. Jewel's ease with writing frosted, clipped pop songs (Chromatics' ""Yes"", from this album, is a great example) provides a fascinating contrast to the way he approaches bigger works. Jewel might be trying to make his own Tusk or Screamadelica, but he hasn't managed a consistent project yet, leaving behind a handful of works that sometimes fall on the wrong side of indulgence. He’s enviably talented, but with each passing album his lack of editing feels more like an Achilles heel. The material on Lost River falls into three categories. There’s Jewel's familiar, heavily opiated glassy pop, represented by Chromatics, Desire, and Glass Candy; a stretch of drifty, incidental film music; and moments culled directly from the cast of the film, including vocal turns by actors Red Kateb, Ben Mendelsohn (channeling his inner Nick Cave), and former Possum Dixon frontman Rob Zabrecky. Jewel sequences these contrasting bits to make it sound like the music is emerging from a dream. Even the '50s R&B of Billy Ward & his Dominoes, included here in a brief interlude, sounds like it’s floating in from an abstract plane. Jewel finds unlikely common ground between his contemporary work, music for the ages, and drone-y instrumental pieces. Again, though, Jewel's include-everything impulse works against him. Chromatics’ ""Yes"" is the standout, alternating between haunting and beautiful passages, perfectly strung across a tightrope of bliss and unease. But there’s no need for three versions of it to be included on the soundtrack, and the three versions of ""Deep Purple"" and two versions of ""Tell Me"" feel equally excessive. It’s a shame, because Saoirse Ronan's powerful version of ""Tell Me"" may have had more weight if it was just a standalone. Chromatics’ version of ""Blue Moon"", originally featured on the Running from the Sun outtakes compilation, works precisely because it emerges from the gloom, strikes a chord, and never returns. There’s a trove of solo Jewel compositions outside of the song-oriented tracks here, most of them leaning toward ambient and occasionally bringing to mind Tangerine Dream’s incidental film music. Shorn of context, there isn’t much to hold onto—a tough gap to bridge whenever film music is removed from its visual stimulus. The depth and breadth of this album makes it feel archival, as if someone excavated Jewel’s vaults for material long after the film was released—possibly an unfortunate downside of the exhaustive boom soundtracks have been undergoing in the past decade or so, where every last scrap of B-movie music warrants a $45 luxury vinyl release. This is a cut above the rest, but listening to it occasionally feels like sifting through a yard sale looking for gold.","Johnny Jewel's official soundtrack to the Ryan Gosling-directed film Lost River blends clipped, opiated pop from Chromatics, Desire, and Glass Candy, with contributions by the film's actors and ambient works by Jewel.

Wire,Wire,by: Ned Raggett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adbcc0084474cd0c1792/1:1/w_160/450f6bd9.jpg,2015-04-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20472-wire/,Pinkflag,"In the discography included with England’s Dreaming, Jon Savage’s 1991 study of UK punk’s origins, the entry for Wire simply reads, ""the jokers in the pack."" Nearly 40 years into their career, Wire remain unpredictable, going through aesthetic phases, reincarnations, breakups, and re-assemblings while dealing with final departures and new members. Yet in spite of it all, they’re still themselves, somehow. With no clear model for being elder statesman in rock, there’s room to do whatever one wants. Given Wire’s long history, it must be tempting for them to create ""just"" another album. But there’s never been ""just"" another Wire album, really—their career has always produced as much brow-furrowing and head-scratching as immediate love. Then all those inclined end up loving it anyway, and then, another album. Following 2013’s Change Becomes Us, which re-worked early 1980s song sketches into full songs, Wire feels at first almost strangely normal. Lewis is credited with most of the lyrics, Newman does most of the vocals in his gentler speak/sing mode, and the feeling generally is calmly inviting. Cryptic song titles have been replaced with more prosaic tags like ""In Manchester"", ""High"", ""Swallow""—even ""Blogging"", the name of the acoustic-led opener, at once moody, drily observational, and tense. Given that the term ""post-punk"" has reached a signifying-nothing-at-all stage (matching suits? a certain kind of haircut?), hearing a band who was actually there take their sound to a particular place few can truly reach is refreshing. As lyrics like ""fucking by proxy…selling on eBay"" from ""Blogging"" show, Wire remain situated in a timeless retrofuture, simultaneously engaged and removed, which has always been their unique gift. The unease with the self, with the band as a fixed organizational point, that sense of relentless questioning and observation, continues. ""In Manchester"", for instance, could almost sound like something from early Factory Records days, except that the lyrics are about a song called ""In Manchester"" that has nothing to do with the place aside from that title. And it’s still a lovely singalong. At points, you can hear Wire nodding to themselves, something not necessarily inevitable but still perfectly understandable—a guitar break on ""Shifting"" sounding like an echo from Chairs Missing, the brisk chug of ""Joust & Jostle"" and the even more thrilling ""Split Your Ends"" show once again how they can create a clean, brisk, stop-and-start energy. They’re not just nodding to themselves, either—the rumbling slow punch of the album’s centerpiece track, ""Sleep-Walking"", calls to mind the feeling of tense dread from the Comsat Angels’ ""Dark Parade"" off their early masterwork Sleep No More. But comparing Wire to another band never really works; nobody quite sounds like this. Wire, forever the jokers, still never quite got their deserved deal out of the deck, and it won’t happen in the current fragmented musical landscape. They could have just said ""FINE"" and done a 154 album tour or the like for a lot more money and attention. A song here like ""Swallow"", perhaps the album’s most accessible-as-such number, the closest track to the platonic ideal of Wire’s pop song form, won’t even get the chance to just miss out on today’s equivalent to ""Top of the Pops"", whatever that might be. For those new to the band, Wire’s pleasures lie waiting, ready for those who want to take a chance on a daunting discography and a heck of a backstory that still keeps being added to. ""There’s always someone who thinks they’ve got a plan,"" sings Newman here on ""Octopus""; thank goodness for a band that had no plan but continues, as they choose, to succeed far more than many who did.","Following 2013’s Change Becomes Us, which re-worked early 1980s song sketches into full songs, Wire feels at first almost strangely normal. Colin Newman does most of the vocals in his gentler speak/sing mode, and the feeling generally is calmly inviting.

Untethered Moon,Built to Spill,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad249d034d5c69bf42f9/1:1/w_160/bdbc19b3.png,2015-04-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20362-untethered-moon/,Warner Bros.,"Untethered Moon is the first Built to Spill record Doug Martsch has released in six years, and its existence alone is a mild surprise. His last LP, 2009’s There Is No Enemy, was quietly better and more focused than its two predecessors, but it didn’t get much attention from press or long-term fans. Martsch didn’t tour behind Enemy for three years, and when he spoke to Pitchfork in 2013 he admitted to feeling directionless. ""It’s hard getting older, thinking maybe I’ve run my course,"" he said. In between then and now, another record was recorded and scrapped. Built to Spill albums have themes, but they fit loosely, like the stretched-out tees and flannels Martsch wears onstage. Perfect from Now On was cosmic; Keep It Like a Secret explored miscommunication; There Is No Enemy seemed haunted by personal loss, unspecific but sharply painful. (""It doesn’t matter if you’re good or smart/ Goddamn it, things fall apart""). Untethered Moon also has a theme, and it’s one he spells out early: ""I found a place where I know I’ll always be tethered/ And I knew, when I woke up, rock and roll will be here forever,"" he sings on ""All Our Songs"". On the modest arc traced on Moon’s 10 songs, a diffident soul finds his faith restored and his soul lifted by the music he’s loved his whole life. This is the point to note that if you’ve loved Built to Spill’s music your whole life, Untethered Moon will have this same comforting, classic feel. In the mid-'90s, as his band and his vision took form, Martsch was a restless tinkerer, one who would throw together different versions of his band each time out, and for a while you never quite knew what shape or size or tone Built to Spill albums would take. There was something thrilling about that, and since the band settled into its current sound around the turn of the millennium, I’ve never quite stopped missing it. Still, the familiarity of Built to Spill is a balm, and hearing Martsch fiddle with his main melodic ideas is like visiting cousins: everyone’s older, no one’s much different, someone’s hair is longer or shorter, someone’s brought a different girlfriend. Martsch is still messing around with unexpected ways to fit together guitar rock songs—on ""All Our Songs"", everything drops out for him to play a little three-note figure surrounded by silence, and then he brings the band back in with a pedal stomp. ""Living Zoo"" works an extended lyrical metaphor (""Being a human/ Being an animal, too""), as the tempo quickens and drags, the guitars twirling overhead like multicolored kites. There are new moments and darker colors here if you listen closely for them. ""On the Way"" feels like a song form Martsch has never tried, with female backup singers, a walking bass line, and a cloudy sense of menace. The loosely dub-inflected ""C.R.E.B."" (Martsch was threatening a Built to Spill reggae album for a while last decade) is pained and even a little bleak, a welcome reminder that there are shadowy spots in the bright open spaces of his music. ""I never meant to forget you/ I always forget people I really love/ If I haven’t seen them for a long time/ And I haven’t seen you for a long time,"" he sings, a moment where you can hear and feel some internalized regrets and emotions surface. In general, the higher the emotional stakes, the better Martsch gets; you sense that he could jam out a passable Built to Spill album in a few weeks if he wanted to (and that’s exactly what it seemed like he did with 2001’s Ancient Melodies of the Future and 2005’s You In Reverse). There is even some audible self-deprecation creeping into his song titles: On There Is No Enemy, he offered us ""another nowhere lullaby"" (""Nowhere Lullaby"") and on Untethered Moon he gives us ""All Our Songs"" and the shruggingly titled ""Some Other Song"". On ""Another Day"", he frets over ""an obsolescence no one would plan."" It sounds like a world-beating talent recognizing his own limitations, deciding whether or not to make something good or something great. There will always be flickers of the latter on Built to Spill’s albums, and if there are only four or five them here, they are bright enough to reassure that Martsch is probably not going anywhere, and that he’ll continue to grace us, every once in a while, with his unassuming, inscrutable presence.","Untethered Moon is the first Built to Spill record Doug Martsch has released in six years, and its existence alone is a mild surprise. While the band has not altered its core sound, there are new moments and darker colors here if you listen closely for them.

Mars Is a Very Bad Place For Love,The Breathing Effect,by: Marcus J.

Tell that to the Breathing Effect—a self-described electronic group influenced by soul, rock and jazz—whose debut album, Mars Is a Very Bad Place for Love, toes a line between traditional and turn up. As a unit, producer/keyboardist Eli Goss and drummer/bassist Harry Terrell merge the standards of conventional jazz with modern bounce beats. By definition, it scans as ""jazz fusion,"" but the results conjure '70s R&B as well as the contemporary Los Angeles beat scene and hip-hop. Clearly, Goss and Terrell study Pink Floyd and the Soft Machine, but it seems they dig Thundercat and Stevie Wonder, too. The genesis of the Breathing Effect can be traced to its fascinating 2014 EP, on which Goss and Terrell spread aquatic rhythms over five tracks. From ""Layers of Thought"" to ""Losing My Mind"", the resulting mixture was equally soothing and mesmerizing; the EP as a whole worked just as well under clear or gray skies. Mars is more upbeat than its predecessor, though the opening tunes—""Forestial Things"" and ""Cloudy Afternoon""—continue the EP’s mellow ambience. Yet by the third song, the two-tiered ""Cold Meteor Showers"", Goss and Terrell hit a stride. In a way, Mars plays like musical theater: It’s driven by space travel, and follows the story of two lovers cruising the galaxy with no concept of time. Tracks like ""One for the Mountains By the Sea"" and ""Twenty Years Altogether"" recall spacious isolation, of couples escaping life’s hustle to be alone with each other. It’s a notion evoked on album standout, ""Weightless Reality"", where Goss, Terrell and guest vocalist Kalia Vandever sing of a fantasy world of waterfalls and underwater utopia. Whether or not they’re depicting planet Mars is anyone’s guess.  Still, the music conveys a very real narrative while using few words, which is usually a tough task for most instrumental albums. The vocals, sparing as they are, come from Goss, Terrell, Vandever and Michael Mayo, who tend to float along the periphery of the music, underlining the instrumentals. On ""Streetlights Out of Focus"", Mayo drifts softly, his wails a breezy compliment to Goss and Terrell’s composition. And of all the great things happening here—the Isley Brothers vibe on ""Fireflies"", the dense layers of ""Visions""—you can actually feel the melodies, which remain at the forefront even though the music drifts in all directions. The blend seeps into the background if you let it, but dominates your attention in headphones, played loudly. ""Rising Inside""__—the LP’s best song and one of the group’s finest to date—__uses swift percussion, bright synths and a Vocoder, working up a loud bounce that would fit comfortably within rap circles and jazz crowds, two sects that couldn’t be farther apart these days. It’s a grand culmination for the Breathing Effect: experimental jazz with the potential for huge resonance.","The Breathing Effect is a self-described electronic group influenced by soul, rock and jazz.

The Early Years EP,Girl Band,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad5213d1975652139f08/1:1/w_160/8d2c0ad2.jpg,2015-04-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20394-the-early-years-ep/,Rough Trade,"The obvious joke with Girl Band is that the Irish quartet features no girls (and not everyone’s laughing), but really, the bigger misdirection lies in calling themselves a band. Sure, their composition conforms to standard punk-rock parameters—yelping singer, fuzzbox-tweaking guitarist and bassist, pugilistic drummer—but even at its most ferocious, their music lacks the emotionally raw, primal catharsis we associate with post-hardcore acts. They come off more like steely lab technicians administering shock treatment for dubious purposes. You don’t so much listen to a Girl Band song as get strapped into it: militaristic drum stomps mimic the beat of your pounding heart; foreboding, unidentifiable noises emerge suddenly from unseen corners seemingly by the push of a button; and, as they pile on the punishment with sadistic glee, your convulsions effectively form a new dance move. It’s a drill that Girl Band have been gradually perfecting over the past two years, through a string of singles that have showcased their bone-crushing force, but through markedly different demonstrations, be it 25-second circle-pit blurts or updates of songs by everyone from Beat Happening to Blawan. While these tracks have been compiled by Rough Trade on The Early Years to introduce Girl Band to North American audiences, the EP is also a snapshot of a band still figuring out how to harness the nihilistic noise of punk and the architectural precision of dance music without conforming to the conventions of either. It’s no insult to say that Girl Band’s signature song at this point is a cover—because it's one that perfectly encapsulates both their antagonistic essence and unorthodox methodology. Their grueling distension of Blawan’s ""Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage""from 2013 not only betrayed a vision that looked far beyond punk for inspiration, but proved to be an ideal vehicle for frontman Dara Kiely to assert his split personality: part arch absurdist, part panic-attacked nervous wreck. The band’s hammering 2014 single ""Lawman"" further entrenched these sarcastic/spastic extremes, though, after the past year of awful police-related headlines, the satirical non sequitirs (""He starts every sentence with 'I know I’m not a racist, but…'"") and the song’s violent meltdown climax have acquired an accidental, uncomfortably topical resonance. Girl Band’s singular qualities are best appreciated in these longer tracks, which clear adequate space for Kiely's wild mood swings, while affording the band enough time to experiment and find just the right dissonant frequencies to power their apocalyptic finales. The more concentrated songs, naturally, give them less to do: the rumble through Beat Happening’s ""I Love You"" is ultimately more a reverential nod to Girl Band’s smart-ass indie ancestors than something they try to fully claim as their own, while the group were in such a rush to unleash half-minute no-fi thrasher ""The Cha Cha Cha"" that they seemingly neglected to master it properly. But ""De Bom Bom"" marks the point where Girl Band’s primordial aggression and burgeoning ambitions start to coalesce, packing all the textural disorientation and mounting intensity of their extended workouts into a taut, three-and-a-half-minute shot. Like the Girl Band name itself, the title of The Early Years is a silly joke—for one, the EP doesn’t even include the band’s earliest recordings (that would be 2012’s France 98 mini-album), and the period that it faux-nostalgically canonizes covers a mere 19-month span that ended just last summer. But the mercurial, combustible potential within suggests we may not be laughing at it for much longer—like patron saints Liars’ equally feral 2001 debut, The Early Years could one day seem like a mere baby step for a band that has evolved into something even more imposing.","Girl Band are an Irish punk quartet featuring no girls.

Jackrabbit,San Fermin,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929abf7c0084474cd0c147f/1:1/w_160/cd1bb2b9.jpg,2015-04-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20143-jackrabbit/,Downtown,"Ellis Ludwig-Leone, who records as San Fermin, studied composition at Yale University, served as a musical assistant under Nico Muhly and is a young, pop-classical fixture in New York City. It all sounds quite a lot like the backstory of Dave Longstreth, and his music sounds even more like Longstreth’s: San Fermin’s breakout single ""Sonsick"" was essentially the Broadway version of ""Stillness Is the Move"", and the resultant record followed suit with highbrow, heavily orchestrated chamber indie with literary aspirations. Ludwig-Leone remains the project’s primary songwriter, composer, arranger and lyricist, but he takes the focus off himself for Jackrabbit, presenting San Fermin as a legit, eight-person touring band. Once again, the experience is more likely to make you think of other indie A-listers rather than San Fermin. This was mostly true of San Fermin as well, though it had a debut’s charm. Ludwig-Leone had chops and taste; perhaps a distinct point of view would emerge with experience and time. And besides, its unwieldy ambitions were welcome at a time when the Decemberists, Dirty Projectors, Sufjan Stevens and others were laying low. But rather than building or expanding on his foundation, Ludwig-Leone just piles on and exaggerates: everything San Fermin did, Jackrabbit does twice as loud. The vocals are still split almost equally between Charlene Kaye and Allen Tate and alternate on a song-by-song basis. But San Fermin’s storyline has been exchanged for generic signifiers. Narrators ""run for the hills"" on the title track, aspire for ""The Glory"", enter ""The Cave"", get lost in ""The Woods"",  and fall ""down, down, down the rabbit hole"" without much further elaboration. Kaye’s features are more enjoyable, especially when they take after ""Sonsick"": even if the elements are familiar, at least they’re combined in a novel way, and they allow you to indulge in some circa-2005 indie rock fantasy booking: What if Sufjan Stevens got a hold of Amber Coffman and put her at the forefront of his most bombastic Illinois orchestrations? That’s pretty much the pitch for ""Jackrabbit"" and ""Philosopher"", songs where Ludwig-Leone’s bold melodies and gushing orchestration have a vocalist who can keep up. And at the very least, Kaye’s songs tend to evoke several bands at once. Allen Tate, however, has either never heard the National or has never listened to any band other than the National. There’s no other way to explain the staggering degree to which Allen Tate sounds exactly like Matt Berninger. Not Leonard Cohen, not Mark Kozelek, or anyone else in the lineage of dour, baritone barstool bards. Just Matt Berninger. His vocals are subject to the same exact cadences, the exact melodic contours, the same wink-and-nod affectations, the same grim humor, the same vocabulary. When Tate takes the lead, San Fermin becomes the equivalent of a shaky music biopic, completely compromised by the uncanny valley effect of having someone not quite be the person he constantly reminds you of. The script, the setting, the soundtrack—all of it is rendered moot. Worse yet, the melodramatic production on ""Emily"" and ""Woman in Red"" ensures they can't even pass as pleasant mimicry. The wearying volume of Jackrabbit is the most taxing aspect of a record that already arrives intentionally overstuffed. Ludwig-Leone has revealed himself to be a pop maximalist, as even the minute-long interludes are given to Backdraft-like bursts of horns and strings. Maybe the guy's heart is truly in theater, as Jackrabbit's overwrought spectacle unintentionally doubles as ""Indie Rock in the Aughts: The Musical.""","Ellis Ludwig-Leone remains San Fermin's primary songwriter, composer, arranger and lyricist, but on Jackrabbit he presents his ambitious, heavily orchestrated chamber-pop as the work of a dynamic full band.

Damogen Furies,Squarepusher,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929add1b1335d7bf1699c87/1:1/w_160/aec76051.jpg,2015-04-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20487-damogen-furies/,Warp,"Composer and producer Squarepusher (nee Tom Jenkinson) is almost always up to something. I mean this not in the sense that he is prolific (though he is), but that with each new release, he tweaks his sound, experimenting with new textures, technologies or conceptual limitations. Fairweather fans who lose track of his movements for awhile are usually surprised, in one way or another, when they return to sample whatever he’s working on. A new Squarepusher album is usually repelling, intriguing (possibly more in theory than practice) or captivating; more often, it's a little of all three. On Damogen Furies, his first solo LP in three years, Jenkinson is in (the Squarepusher version of) pop mode. He grounds his unrelentingly brittle, electronic compositions with catchy synth melodies. Though his customary warp-speed drum loops still run off the rails, he relegates them to the role of accompaniment. Dynamics are largely dispensed with—the range is loud to extremely loud. It’s an approach he prototyped on his last album, Ufabulum. For live shows around that time, he adopted a new, flashy stage act, donning a Boba Fett-like LED helmet, and incorporating a complex light show of blinding flashing matrices dancing around his podium. Suddenly, like the great masked dance music connoisseurs of today, he became no longer just a guy with a laptop— he was suddenly, perhaps, someone capable of bigger, more zeitgeist-riding things. Damogen Furies is less subtle and funky than Ufabulum, but it’s more focused. Here, Jenkinson commits to one primary thematic idea per song, and develops and interrupts it within the bounds of a clear larger structure. Tracks like opener ""Stor Eiglass"" and ""Exjag Nives"" introduce pleasant, portamento synth melodies that develop cleverly, spaced out with breakbeat and boiled wah-bass interludes. Tracks like these are the closest Squarepusher has gotten to festival-ready EDM. But he pushes against these sometimes-generic breakbeats, in his perverse way, tossing in conflicting elements and then rending everything apart into errant bits of space trash, like a child building a LEGO castle and then hurling his blocks in the air. ""Rayc Fire 2"" is a good (and non-anxiety-inducing) example: Beginning with a mechanistic, mid-tempo groove and pointillistic melody, it becomes increasingly fragmented and fitful, interrupted by jazz fusion-informed flights of fancy. The similarly restless ""Kontenjaz"" breaks down into rhythmic semi-choas, its meter deteriorating in a way that has more to do with Ornette Coleman & Prime Time than The Richard D. James Album. Moments like these get at what is most interesting about Squarepusher’s work. Even on an album as wholly electronic-sounding as Damogen Furies, Jenkinson's musicality remains organic and responsive. Rather than using technology to surpass the limitations of live acoustic instruments, he creates moments of human flexibility with it (see also his music for robot performers from last year). It is this exploratory drive which has always made him notable, the the face behind his many musical masks.","On Damogen Furies, his first solo LP in three years, Tom Jenkinson is in (the Squarepusher version of) pop mode, veering surprisingly close to festival-ready EDM before rending everything apart, like a child building a LEGO castle and then hurling his blocks in the air.

Foil Deer,Speedy Ortiz,by: Jillian Mapes,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad135e6ef95969321a01/1:1/w_160/c00de6da.jpg,2015-04-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20351-foil-deer/,Carpark,"On Speedy Ortiz’s 2013 debut Major Arcana, Sadie Dupuis crafted her barbed-wire wordplay into wounded callouts of those who had hurt her. Now, she's wielding it like a weapon. Foil Deer, the Massachusetts indie rock traditionalists' sophomore full-length, opens with Dupuis noting on ""Good Neck"" that she's good with a knife and she knows when to use it. She takes a lap around the block to cool down—like all good bosses should—before coming back with a world-beating declaration of autonomy on “Raising the Skate”: “I'm chief, not the overthrown/ Captain, not a crony/So if you wanna row, you better have an awfully big boat.” With Foil Deer, Dupuis doesn't scold; she warns. The album is ferocious and visceral, the lyrics gleaming with threats involving sharp blades both literal and figurative (""Don't ever touch my blade, you fool/ You'll be cursed for a lifetime,"" she taunts knowingly on ""Dot X""). As Dupuis grows more self-possessed, she and her bandmates veer into their most ambitious compositions to date. Knotty melodies shift gears in an instant, giving Foil Deer a jumpy, enthralling energy. God bless ‘em, Speedy believe that every song ideally should have three or four musical ideas. For its first 47 seconds, ""Zig"" scans like vintage folk-pop until the song abruptly steers into a thorny chunk of dissonance led by Dupuis’ contrasting falsetto. A minute passes and it sounds like yet another song—a much more melodic thing this time—before a nightmarish jumble of riffs and cymbals grinds the pace to a halt. A defeated Dupuis wonders aloud ""How many laps does it take to decide you’re back at the start?"" as she and her bandmates double back on the the song’s original theme. It’s a clever construction, representing just how much thought went into crafting each of these songs. In Speedy Ortiz, both the music and lyrics work overtime, bringing a surplus of conflicting ideas to the table that they somehow manage to cram into tight spaces. The magic is that they never sound overworked, and in fact when they go more straighforward—""Puffer"", for instance, in which they try the pleather sleaze of '90s industrial rock on for size—it feels like not quite enough by comparison. Despite its clever kiss-offs (""Take me off your list or elect a lobotomy""), the chipper pop-punk of ""Swell Content"" would have sufficed on last year’s Real Hair EP, but here it feels like filler. It goes to show that the members of Speedy Ortiz can barely keep up with their own progress. Dupuis, a recent MFA candidate in poetry at UMass Amherst, is among the most talented lyricists of her musical class. She writes vivid-yet-mysterious scenes that require interpretive work on the listeners' behalf—such as ""My Dead Girl"", a cryptic tale about living fast and risking becoming a missing face on a milk carton. But Dupuis’ greatest strength as a lyricist is her ability to turn her sour experiences into anthems about clawing back from self-doubt. On Foil Deer, Dupuis makes standing up for yourself—in the face of double standards, struggles with addiction, and the general carelessness of youth—sound like a no-brainer, but she also never tries to hide how complicated everything can be. As the band continues to evolve around and with her, Speedy Ortiz’s music finally sounds as complex as its leader dares to be.","The sophomore album from indie-rock traditionalists Speedy Ortiz is more ferocious and visceral than their debut, with leader Sadie Dupuis honing her talent for turning her sour experiences into anthems about clawing your way out of self-doubt.

A Forest of Arms,Great Lake Swimmers,by: Joel Oliphint,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad61c0084474cd0c16f3/1:1/w_160/3d2cb14f.jpg,2015-04-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20403-a-forest-of-arms/,Nettwerk,"It’s been more than 10 years since Great Lake Swimmers released their self-titled debut. Recorded in an empty Ontario grain silo, it was mostly Tony Dekker’s acoustic guitar and honeyed voice singing about silent films and the natural world. The album seemed at first like an ideal sedative—its hushed reverberating folk songs are enhanced with the sound of actual crickets chirping. But the songs were too engaging and eventful to be lullabies. On A Forest of Arms, their sixth album, Great Lake Swimmers continue to experiment with recording locations, this time tracking some of the vocals and guitar in Ontario’s Tyendinaga Cavern and Caves. But while Dekker is still trying to push his band into new territory with bigger arrangements and peppier tempos, he runs into problems. First among the latter is Dekker’s voice. His gentle cooing is perfect for quiet, contemplative ballads but becomes listless in songs like the the New Pornographers-style rave-up ""I Must Have Someone Else’s Blues"" and the bouncy ""A Bird Flew Inside the House"". Still, he remains economical and fairly straightforward with his words, and it suits him. Lead-off track ""Something Like a Storm"", for example, sweetly describes a father embracing the calm before the storm of childbirth. But the album's sequence trips him up—for some reason the band includes an alternative version, reprising nearly the same lyrics in closing track ""Expecting You"". Once was nice, twice is overkill. It’s probably no coincidence this album’s best tracks are the ones where Dekker is singing in a cave with only subtle accompaniment. ""Don’t Leave Me Hanging"" is gorgeous—simple and direct. ""You had different hair when I saw you last,"" Dekker sings, delicately fingerpicking amid the violins, before pleading for his lover (and/or a bird) not to leave him hanging and ""drowning in shallow water."" The natural world consistently elicits a contagious sense of awe from Dekker. The album takes its title from a line in ""The Great Bear"", another song in this vein. ""You won’t believe what’s out there,"" he sings, and and he's convincing. These moments are as absorbing as those old grain-silo songs, with the same sort of hypnotic pull, as you picture the winding streams and forests Dekker traces. But too often, he strays from the hushed mode he's mastered and ends up supplanting the band’s strengths with its weaknesses.","It’s been more than 10 years since Great Lake Swimmers released their self-titled debut, recorded in an empty Ontario grain silo.

The Alchemist and Oh No Present: Welcome to Los Santos,Various Artists,by: Clayton Purdom,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adab9d034d5c69bf43f0/1:1/w_160/25ccccba.jpg,2015-04-17 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20460-the-alchemist-and-oh-no-present-welcome-to-los-santos/,RockstarMass Appeal,"The beaches and deserts of Los Santos, one of the settings for the Grand Theft Auto franchise, sometimes felt as if designed by, or at least for, their soundtrack. While Grand Theft Auto V's radio stations followed in the tradition of all GTA soundtracks—disc after disc of meticulously curated mood music, organized by genre—it felt more essentially of the game-world than its predecessors. It was also much larger. Where once there was a rap station, here there were three; where once there was a half-dozen opera songs, here were 40 chillwave tracks. An expanded re-release exacerbated the sprawl, begging the question of how ""Moves Like Jagger"" wasn’t on the pop station in the first place. There wasn’t a bad station among the fifteen, a technical accomplishment on par with the game’s startling evocation of the Pacific southwest sky. But if GTAV was a digital space meant to evoke and satirize a real-world one, Welcome to Los Santos is engineered to do the opposite. It is a real-world product meant to inspire memories of your time in a digital world. Compiled by Oh No and the Alchemist, it repurposes errant bits of the score they created for the game along with Tangerine Dream and composer Woody Jackson. Music that originally played as the backing track for a neon-lit shootout now forms the backing track for context-free tracks by Wavves, Phantogram, Vybz Kartel, and many more. (Also Freddie Gibbs three times, because he is Freddie Gibbs.) Further complicating things, the newest versions of the game will also feature a radio station with these reworked bits of score, now playing as in-world music. This is an album with a uniquely tenuous relationship with reality. Perhaps the most unlikely aspect of it is that it is good, or at least immensely likable, in the same way that, say, the first Iron Man movie was. It breezes by, bright and pricy. These intentions are made clear from the outset. Opener ""Play It Cool"" couches Gangrene’s hard-knock psych-rock in hummingbird flute flourishes and Sam Herring’s butt-chin baritone; the next track, ""Trouble"", has Aloe Blacc doing his best Dan Auerbach bellow and Ab-Soul riding a harp-laden instrumental. The emcees perform admirably, but as guest stars, not features; if you don’t like a style, the album says, wait 90 seconds. TV on the Radio’s Tunde Adebimpe skids in next, another ripple of variety in an album that will also eventually encompass dancehall, clothing-store-tronica, and yearning synth-pop. From the choice of collaborators to the sequencing to the endless evocations of speed and opulence, the album seems engineered to ingratiate, and to dazzle. It is the music blooming out of a club you are supposed to want to go into. If there is a throughline between this summery mix and Oh No and Alchemist’s other collaborative work as Gangrene, it is this absolute devotion to a concept. Oh No, in particular, has found his muse through an endless sequence of themed projects, from Exodus into Unheard Rhythms’ Galt MacDermont fixation through last year’s Prince Po resuscitation project, but all felt distinctly punched out of the same post-Dilla MPC. Welcome to Los Santos holds no such signature stamp. Its panoply of guests and tones suggests not the well-curated sampling of a film soundtrack or the ambient pulse of the best video game soundtracks but the high-quality ephemerality of a Gorillaz record. It is unified not so much by concept but by character. But who (or what) is that character? The album ends with Danny Brown and Action Bronson lacing an ominous beat, but if you were looking for a centerpiece, they do not provide it. Despite a murderer’s row of talent here, nobody does. Perhaps that's because it’s not their album; they’re all guest stars, on-screen appearing as themselves. The video essay Los Angeles Plays Itself, which examines filmic portrayals of the city, is built around director Thom Andersen's suggestion that, ""If we can appreciate documentaries for their dramatic qualities, perhaps we can appreciate fiction films for their documentary revelations."" Welcome to Los Santos suggests a similarly conversational relationship: that games might act as both products of IRL culture and sources of it. At the very least, it gave Freddie Gibbs an outlet for a few more verses. That guy can’t turn it off.","Welcome to Los Santos, a collection of new material from the Alchemist and Oh No inspired by Grand Theft Auto V, is a curious thing: A real-world product meant to inspire memories of your time in a digital world.

Froot,Marina and the Diamonds,by: Safy-Hallan Farah,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad2d5e6ef95969321a2b/1:1/w_160/13c12bdd.jpg,2015-04-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20368-froot/,AtlanticNeon GoldNew Elektra,"""She is a Polish girl in America!"" Marina Diamandis sang in 2010 on ""Hollywood"", a song from her debut album The Family Jewels. She went on, ""Oh my god, you look just like Shakira, no, no, you’re Catherine Zeta— actually, my name’s Marina!"" In one verse, she mimicks the voices of those grouping her with other crossover celebrity women who scan simultaneously as ""White"" and ""Other"" to American audiences and answering them, at once. It was a smooth performance, demonstrating her place within American’s white spatial imaginary (Diamandis is Greek and Welsh)— a dream-like double consciousness acknowledged with nary a nod or a wink. It is within the space of disacknowledgement that Diamandis created the character Electra for her 2012 followup Electra Heart, an album produced and co-written with American hit makers like Diplo, Dr. Luke, and StarGate. Electra was a ""cold, ruthless character who wasn’t vulnerable"" she told The Daily Mail—a personification of the American Dream. On her third album, Froot, she ditches the mega-star collaborators and writes not only by herself, but about herself. The strength of Diamandis’ work, historically, has been her lack of subtlety, her playful Technicolor self-presentation. And yet on Froot, her focus is inward and free of peacocking. The hushed, bare-bones opener ""Happy"", built on a piano-ballad core, is a meditation on inner contentedness that seeks self-realization over companionship. ""From the concrete to the coast, I was looking for a holy ghost,"" she sings. On Froot, she's found God, and pop music, within herself. She is an artist who knows who she is, and Froot luxuriates in the confidence that we do, too, relaxing in the space and power that Diamandis has claimed. Part of her art has always been to pack the emotional punch of confession while denying over-the-head admission, an approach with a political tinge—""the impersonal is political,"" in her case. Her flamboyance and theatrics have served to both deflect and detach—some songs on Electra Heart and The Family Jewels alluded to an eating disorder without explicitly saying so, while other songs feature second-person lyrics—an implied ""I."" Sharing—thoughts, emotions, information (where you live, what your plans are, take your pick)—is always a risky act for women, opening them up to potential violence, and this is the violence Marina explores. In ""Savages"", Marina sings, ""I’m not afraid of God, I’m afraid of Man."" ""Underneath it all, we’re just savages hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages,"" she posits. ""Solitaire"", which opens with the lyric, ""Don’t wanna talk anymore, I’m obsessed with silence,"" doesn’t land quite as well as its antithesis, the final track ""Immortal"", does. ""Immortal"" is about a deep longing to ""reserve a space"" in history, to be remembered by others. Almost every song on Froot plays with memory and sensory imagery—""Gold""; ""Blue""; ""Forget""; ""Froot""—thematically, lyrically or otherwise. But it’s the tucked-in songs—in the ""Weeds"", so to speak—where Marina shines colorfully: ""Happy"", ""I’m a Ruin"" and ""Can’t Pin Me Down"" are stand-out tracks, speaking most directly to the album’s core. They’re also the most sonically interesting songs. The bare piano accompaniment of ""Happy"" makes it a somber and sweet track. Her production is more understated than the lush, orgasmic pulse of Electra Heart, making Froot a more elastic and dynamic work, with Everestian highs and darker depths. In ""I'm a Ruin"" the drums carry the song, thumping into climax and ecstasy.  The other percussion-heavy tracks, like ""Can’t Pin Me Down"", give the album power and drive. Others, like ""Gold"", go at the tempo of a slow soul clap, taking you to a quiet church. There’s cognitive dissonance between Diamandis' flamboyant posturing and her subtlety. She performs feeling. She no longer hides behind shaky, furtive archetypes and characters as she did on Electra Heart, an album created explicitly for American consumers—she’s untangled herself and trusts us to understand a record that is internal, and rich in nuance. Froot traces her career arc: with The Family Jewels she is mistaken (by record companies) for a ""foreign cross-over success"" like Shakira, and with Electra Heart she tries on this identity and finds that it doesn’t actually fit her. With Froot she’s refuting the myth that female artists are forever the first, the only, that they can only exist if they fit within the shape of whatever cultural precedent exists for them. Mind the bold corrective: ""Actually, my name's Marina!"" As if we could forget, now.","The strength of Marina Diamandis’ work, historically, has been her lack of subtlety and her playful Technicolor self-presentation. And yet on Froot, her focus is inward.

Black Bastards,KMD,by: kris ex,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad3fc0084474cd0c16bd/1:1/w_160/6596a805.jpg,2015-04-17 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20382-black-bastards/,MetalfaceMetalface,"KMD's Black Bastards (sometimes stylized as Bl_ck B_st_rds) has become one of the more storied albums in hip-hop, and with good reason—its route to consumer ears was at first barred, then clandestine, then piecemeal and underground. But before the album was even semi-properly released, it, by all accounts, birthed MF DOOM, who is perhaps the most revered, enigmatic popular underground rapper of the past twenty years. It's not conjecture or a stretch to say that the Black Bastards story is DOOM's origin story, and without it there's no Madvillainy, no Special Herbs, no reason for Mos Def to make seven cover videos, no metal-faced Villain getting barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel. Originally scheduled for a 1994 release, Black Bastards was shelved by Elektra Records—ostensibly due to the album's incendiary and controversial artwork—less than a month before it was set to be in stores. The shuttling itself was reportedly low on ceremony and dialogue, but the conversation around the album was not. Billboard columnists Terri Rossi and Havelock Nelson had taken offense to the Black Bastards project in separate columns; The Source magazine editor Jon Shecter, meanwhile, rebutted with an editorial titled ""Corporate Hysteria"", writing, ""[A]s we've seen over the years, it doesn't take much for the bottom-line bigwigs of big business to flip on hip-hop. It seems inevitable that the raw honesty of many rap records would offend enough of mainstream America to put the product at odds with the company selling it."" Elektra's decision was based in both fiscal and political realities. Much like Epic Records has abandoned Bobby Shmurda in wake of their sister company Sony Pictures Entertainment's email hack, Elektra washed their hands of KMD in no small part because of their sister label and distributor's troubles. Warner Bros. had already suffered a stinging blow in 1992, when shareholders voted to remove Ice-T's ""Cop Killer"" from his metal side-project Body Count after protracted finger-pointing and naysaying from then-President George H. W. Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, and co-founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (and future Second Lady) Tipper Gore. This was the struggle that birthed the current version of the black-and-white Parental Advisory label; one that included Dan Quayle pressuring Time Warner to pull 2Pacalypse Now off shelves. The shelving was the second blow that the group would suffer. A year before, KMD—which had whittled down to a duo, losing Onyx The Birthstone Kid, who performed on their masterful 1991 debut, Mr. Hood—had effectively ceased to exist as a group when Dingilizwe Dumile, aka DJ Subroc, was struck by a car and killed while crossing the Long Island Expressway. Subroc's brother, Daniel Dumile—then known as Zev Love X, now known as MF DOOM—was left to finish the album. It was these twin tragedies that led to Daniel becoming the man in the iron mask; and it's the legend that defines Black Bastards, which is now getting its most glamorous re-release yet, some twenty-one years later. Given the backstory, it's no wonder that Black Bastards is being treated like a plot device from the Star Wars reboot. This latest reissue fetishizes the album to the extreme—it's a children's pop-up book. (Rare advance copies and copies of copies have existed since the '90s; in 2001 and 2008, it was made available, respectively by Sub Verse and DOOM's own Metalface Records, the latter who is also responsible for this version.) Black Bastards is often hailed as the best rap album that you've never heard, and this newest reintroduction is not likely to change that: It's targeted exclusively towards collectors and archivists—most of whom would already have the music. Still, it's apropos, given KMD's tone—they released their first album as teenagers and it featured wide-eyed gazes on heady topics, all delivered with the help of excerpts from foreign language tapes, children's audios, Malcolm X and ""Sesame Street"" characters. * Mr. Hood* was whimsical and pointed and prescient—""Bananapeel Blues"" hosted a spoken-word mediation on race with a sped-up Gil Scott-Heron sample (from ""H2Ogate Blues"": ""How much more evidence do the citizens need?"") that is still embarrassingly poignant today when the cultural spectacle of Black men being murdered by police has become social media snuff porn. But Black Bastards was so much more and less than its predecessor. It was always a very good record, a promising one—but not a great one. Musically, it sounds like a mid-'90s rap record—copious samples of jazz and R&B over big, dirty drums. It's more angry and less fun that what came before it, but also more intimate and less expansive. Where Mr. Hood focused on the big themes out there, Black Bastards turned inward, dealing with the personal coming-of-age revelations. It's largely the story of two devout followers of Dr. York's Nuwaubianism struggling with the vices of the carnal world. ""Sweet Premium Wine"" is about their newfound love of alcohol—""I don't drink, I guzzle 'til I'm distorted."" On ""Contact Blitt"", they treat smoking weed the way ""Game of Thrones"" treats magic— something wondrous but common, like dragons. At the time of Black Bastards, corporate rap was still in its infancy, and the music industry was deeply entrenched as a trickle-down gerontocracy, one where the voices of power were largely disconnected from the street-level youth that it fed upon. Harder songs on the album, like ""Get-U-Now"" and ""Gimme!"", can be seen not only as a response to self and label expectations, but also a document of rap's darkening tone and the rites of passage that both entail. When the album deals with women on ""Plumskinzz"", it's deeply lascivious: ""Damned, I wouldn't want my plum to turn prune/ Unless it be all that, be all that/ It won't matter 'cause black sweet ones come fatter/ I'm kinda, kinda picky with my fruit mix."" It's a far cry from the jingly innocence of Mr. Hood's ""Peach Fuzz"" and as genuinely awkward as burgeoning sexual awareness. Despite the album's title and artwork, Black Bastards is much less direct about racial politics than Mr. Hood. Where Mr. Hood was incisive and righteous, Black Bastards is searching and confused. None of this makes it any less worthy of a listen—there's something that's still very real and new about hearing the group move through their emotional spaces. Moreso than listening to the birth of MF DOOM, it's the death of KMD, not just the group, but of both of the guys who made Mr. Hood. And for all of its darkness, there's the unbridled brightness of growing artists still exploring the limits of their medium and textures of their own voices. There's a glee in Subroc's voice when he begins rapping on ""It Sounded Like a Roc!"": ""It's my thing/ Yo, it's my thing/ The way I swing, not even an orangutan can hang/ On my ding! ding!/ Saved by the bell rang/ I talk, yell, whisper, mumble street slang."" It's like wacky Nicki Minaj meets To Pimp a Butterfly and it's the kind of rap that just couldn't be released today. Or rather it can. But only in a pop-up book.","Shelved by Elektra Records—ostensibly due to the album's incendiary artwork—less than a month before it was set to be in stores, KMD's Black Bastards is essentially MF DOOM's origin story. It is often hailed as the best rap album that you've never heard.

Cherry Bomb,"Tyler, the Creator",by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929add313d1975652139fcc/1:1/w_160/eadbaa73.jpg,2015-04-17 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20493-cherry-bomb/,Odd Future,"In a recent appearance on ""Tavis Smiley"", Smiley asked the now-24-year-old Tyler, the Creator to describe himself. He replied with a candid, perhaps-practiced monologue: ""I’m very bright. I’m smart. I’m annoying and obnoxious. I’m very creative and borderline genius, and I think other people are starting to see that, too."" Cherry Bomb, Tyler’s fourth long-player and third official album, complements his self-professed characteristics to a T, in ways both good and bad. His greatest strength has always been world-building, using a synth-heavy blitz of candy-colored jazz chords taken straight (sometimes blatantly so) from the Pharrell handbook. Cherry Bomb isn’t exactly a hard left turn from this lane, but it is a quick swerve. He’s still occasionally obnoxious and shockingly adolescent for someone almost a quarter-century old (on ""Smuckers"" he defiantly raps, ""Fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat"" with the gusto of Ian MacKaye declaring his devotion to straight edge). His idea of a joke is making the lead single to his rap album a Stevie Wonder-inspired bop about an underage relationship. What makes the joke ""land,"" of course, is that the song is really good, a warm-sounding piece of pop music complete with an appearance from the ineffable Charlie Wilson. It’s a smart, annoying, obnoxious, creative, and borderline genius tactic from someone still working on reaching his final form. The best thing Cherry Bomb has going for it is relative brevity. Goblin and Wolf were notoriously long, which felt like a betrayal of one of Tyler’s biggest strengths—shotgun blasts of creativity and anguish as opposed to woozy, multi-part dirges that bordered on self-parody. Cherry Bomb still features three songs that are longer than six minutes, but the songs transform within themselves, like the jazz Tyler admires, so that they almost feel like three songs in one. There's still nothing ""minimalist"" about what Tyler does; this tweet just about sums up his approach to this album. Opener ""Deathcamp"" was allegedly inspired by the Stooges, and it sounds like what would happen if you put Tyler's idea of the Stooges on top of Glassjaw on top of Trash Talk, and, it should go without saying, on top a vintage N.E.R.D. production. Your mileage may vary, but I find it thrilling—the influence of rock music, while always present in Tyler’s music, is overwhelming here, which creates a Rebirth-ian wrinkle to an album that, to its strength and detriment, mostly recycles three or four similar ideas. ""Pilot"" and the title track to me recall none other than Big Black—drum machine-led walls of sound that break down and start up again as Tyler struggles to be heard over the noise. He is friends with Toro Y Moi’s Chaz Bundick (who makes an anonymous appearance on filler track ""Run""), and ""Find Your Wings"" is Tyler’s gentlest song to date, an interlude that’s part quiet storm, part Toro, and completely without pretense or sarcasm. Kanye and Wayne have verses on ""Smuckers"", the album’s best song. All three artists are auteurs in their own right, and with Tyler’s verses bookending and sandwiching the track and a beat switch thrown in the middle, it’s as if he’s playing hot potato with rap’s most singular voices and inserting himself in their world, a vandal placing his imprimatur on a piece in a gallery. The thrilling part is how at home Kanye and Wayne sound having fun in this playground (Kanye’s ""Richer than white people with black kids/ Scarier than black people with ideas"" is an instant classic, while Wayne slides into a comfortable vintage flow). There will be a lot of talk about how unfocused or chaotic this album is, but I’ve always taken that as par for the course with any Tyler music. Tyler is still gonna do Tyler things, and it’s refreshing when an artist creates exactly the kind of art they want to create. A quick glance at the announced five alternate covers to the album was revealing—there’s a real aesthetic consistency to them. I’m reminded of the work of Marilyn Minter, an artist with a similar panache for creating intentionally ugly and tacky art, with the knowing observation, ""Yes, this is ugly, but I can’t stop looking at it."" That may be old hat at this point, but the idea is still such a seductive one: I know it's a mess, I put a lot of work into creating this mess, and it's your problem if you can't handle it. A funhouse mirror doesn’t make sense without knowledge of how a regular mirror works. Tyler, the Creator only creates as the sum of his exhaustive, trying, kaleidoscope self—and I keep looking at him.","Cherry Bomb, Tyler’s fourth long-player and third official album, bears all the hallmarks of his personality, for good and for ill. Smart, annoying, obnoxious, and creative, it's a reminder that Tyler, the Creator only creates as the sum of his exhaustive, trying, kaleidoscopic self.

Kathryn Calder,Kathryn Calder,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adb5ea9e61561daa616b/1:1/w_160/5b34ed99.jpg,2015-04-16 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20467-kathryn-calder/,File Under: Music,"A late addition to an already crowded cast, Kathryn Calder joined the New Pornographers in 2005 as a fill-in for Neko Case, who at the time rarely toured with the group. At the time Calder seemed like a mismatch for a group defined by outsized presences: She’s not a born star like Case, nor is she an enigma like Dan Bejar, or a pop savant like A.C. Newman. Her defining characteristic is her ordinariness, but ultimately that’s what has made her such a welcome foil to her colorful bandmates. She grounds the group, and while she may not be a marquee attraction, over their last few albums, her spotlight turns have become reliable standouts. As with most of her co-leads in the Pornographers, the music Calder releases on her own shares little relation to that band’s escapist pop. For one thing, nobody ever dies on a New Pornographers record. Though its cover promised precious twee, Calder’s 2010 solo debut Are You My Mother? was an emotionally heavy listen shaped by her mother’s battle with ALS. The shadow of death also hung over her more assertive and synth-driven follow-up Bright and Vivid, which added her father to her list of loved ones to grieve. Death has been such a constant on her solo albums that by now its presence is just assumed. Even though she seldom addresses it directly on her self-titled third album, it’s always there. It’s present in the opener ""Slow Burning"", when she pleads for help coping with the nightmares that wake her, and it lingers to the very end of ""Remembering"", when she shares an afternoon in the sun with her lover and sings, ""Time will smoke us out but it’s really good to be here just like this."" The album is filled with anecdotes like that, peaceful moments interrupted by reminders of life’s impermanence. It’s as if every time Calder set out to write a love song, she emerged instead with a portrait of survivor's guilt. But even at their most melancholy, Calder’s songs are less concerned with mourning than with living. To judge by these songs, her losses have reshaped her view or the world, leaving her with a Zen-like sense of acceptance. On the jaunty ""Take a Little Time"", the closest the album comes to New Pornographers-style hookiness, she assures her lover she’s not interested in holding grudges. Even the prospect of romantic failure doesn’t faze her. ""If we fall, then we fall,"" she sings on ""Song in Cm"". Like Calder’s previous solo albums, this one was produced with the man she ostensibly wrote many of these songs about, her husband Colin Stewart. But this effort feels distinct from its predecessors, more intimate but also more considered. It does more while calling less attention to itself. Calder often sings in little more than a murmur, as if retreating from the world, and Stewart’s production matches her voice. The understated mix disguises just how much instrumental and textural variation runs through these songs. Save for a few moments when the guitars boil over, the record plays as if covered by a blanket of snow. Apparently it took some trial and error to capture that delicate mode. In interviews, Calder has described the album as a second attempt, following an LP’s worth of material she recorded then scrapped. That do-over involved writing new songs and rewriting others, but it’s easy to imagine her just re-recording the same album, only quieter. In Calder's songs solace proves elusive and fleeting, but when she finds it, it's always during moments of calm.","Kathryn Calder, who joined the New Pornographers in 2005, has become a grounding presence for that group, but her solo material shares little relation to that band’s escapist pop: Her records are heavy with grief and balanced with a Zen-like sense of acceptance.

Sewing Machine,Low Jack,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad755e6ef95969321aa2/1:1/w_160/b4ae0436.jpg,2015-04-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20418-sewing-machine/,In Paradisum,"Low Jack (aka Philippe Hallais) is one of the more exciting producers to emerge from the experimental techno community clustered around Parisian labels like In Paradisum and L.I.E.S., a New York transplant. To take rudimentary machine beats and attack them with scouring pads is neither new nor even particularly interesting in and of itself, but what distinguishes Low Jack's work is the way he seems to be groping his way towards his own musical language, one beyond the limits of either noise or techno as conventionally rendered. On his debut album, last year's Garifuna Variations, he twisted archival recordings of Central America's Garifuna people into grimy knots as part of a commission from Paris' Quai Branley Museum. Cut loose from the conceptual framework and institutional ties, Sewing Machine is a far freer album, and a lot more fun. Most of the tracks here play out pretty much the same way: fire up the drum machine, run it through a mazelike signal path, and twist at the knobs until the air itself seems to bleed. Of all the people making distorted techno right now (Kyle Hall, Delroy Edwards, Florian Kupfer), few make their noise sing quite as expressively as Low Jack. It's impressive how much mileage he gets from a simple distorted bass drum. On each track, it's treated in a slightly different way, so that it has a different color and shape—round here, lumpy there, and over there, pocked with metal studs. In the turgid ""Fubu Knight"", through some arcane feat of audio sculpting, the snare drum sounds almost like a drawn-out scream. On the headbanging ""Sweatpants Chick"", probably the most unabashedly lunkheaded thing here right down to the title, he plays his filter's resonance knob like an instrument, wringing the approximation of a melody out of its swoops and shrieks. The filter also takes center stage on ""Zaltan's Jackets""; this time it quacks like Donald Duck, strutting and squelching in between medicine-ball-sized kick drums. Not a lot of daylight typically makes it onto a Low Jack production, and that's particularly true of Sewing Machine; he might just as well have called it 50 Words for Coal. ""Pocket Pussy"" begins with a squall of sooty white noise that's even uglier than the introductory track, which is an 87-second blast that sounds like a gurgle from the bowels of hell. But stick with it, and Hallais begins to show his handiwork. A minute in, kick drums come bursting through the murk followed by blotchy bass frequencies, and then the high-end chatter descends, alien and insistent. Fading out over a rhythm that might be sharpening knives, the six-minute track has the dramatic arc of a radio play—not bad for something made with little more than a drum machine and fuzzbox. Sewing Machine certainly isn't for everyone, but for listeners who like their noise as expressive as it is brutal, this slim album speaks volumes.","Of all the people making distorted techno right now, few make their noise sing quite as expressively as Low Jack.

Bashed Out,This Is the Kit,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad7313d1975652139f3c/1:1/w_160/f6b825d5.jpg,2015-04-16 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20417-this-is-the-kit-bashed-out/,Brassland,"This Is the Kit wasn’t the most popular name to appear on Folk Off, the 2006 state-of-freak-folk compilation that pitted US artists (Sufjan Stevens, Animal Collective) against their UK counterparts (Vashti Bunyan, Tunng). At the time Kit captain Kate Stables hadn’t even released a debut single, let alone a full album, but that made her an ideal inclusion: a less established artist who could benefit from proximity to more popular names while demonstrating the depth and breadth of the scene. Built around a deftly picked guitar theme and showcasing her earthy vocals, ""2 Wooden Spoons"" held its own against Stables’ contemporaries. But nearly a decade later—when folk has fully embedded itself in the indie mainstream such that we’ve dropped the ""freak"" appendage altogether—the song carries very few of the signifiers that might anchor it to that long-past trend. Stables wears her eccentricities comfortably, whether she's bending an old word into new shapes or displaying a curious sense of professional timing. Sunday Best, the label that released Folk Off, quickly issued her debut 7'', with a full-length debut, Krulle Bol, released a year later. Wriggle Out the Restless followed in 2010, and the folksy austerity of her music caught the ear of Aaron Dessner, who not only signed her to his Brassland label but secured an opening slot for This Is the Kit when the National played New York in 2011. Four years later, Stables is releasing her third album, Bashed Out, which Dessner inevitably produced. This is Slow Music: patiently and carefully handcrafted, as though the process were just as important as the result, and released on her own whim rather than by industry dictate. These new songs don’t sound terribly different from Stables’ first recordings nearly a decade ago, but the music is bolder and more purposeful, with a broader, richer palette of sounds. Dessner works in a minimalist vein, placing a handful of instruments at various levels in the mix but never locking them into place. A barely audible bassline rocks softly against Stables’ plaintive guitar theme on opener ""Misunderstanding"". ""Silver John"" blossoms into a swell of synths (courtesy of Thomas Bartlett a.k.a. Doveman) and builds to a chorus of odd siren vocal calls. There’s a parallax quality to the music, an immersive sense of depth that makes the songs sound larger with each listen. Even as he expands her range and emphasizes her idiosyncrasies, Dessner wisely stays out of Stables’ way, and she emerges easily as the dominant force on Bashed Out. Her guitar work is nimble but not fussy, and she conjures a sense of nameless menace on closer ""Cold and Got Colder"". On ""Spores All Settling"" her banjo playing is almost pointedly rudimentary, emphasizing the present moment rather than the perfect performance. She’s a complex and compelling personality, spiking her folksy whimsy (there’s a song about the smell of mushrooms) with shots of prickly wisdom. ""And so the outside, it bashes us in, bashes us about a bit,"" she sings on the title track, one of the album’s weightiest moments. For Stables, creating music—or making art of any kind—means bashing right back at life, matching it blow for blow. Yet, this resilient album is less concerned with enduring immense tribulations than it is with enjoying life’s simple pleasures. Stables’ concerns are microcosmically personal, trading in minute details and small observations that provide immense contentment. ""Vitamins"" is an ode to fresh greens, while ""Nits"" describes sheep on a hillside as ""happy little fatties."" Both songs land just this side of unbearably precious, but Stables doesn’t seem to care how such moments strike the listener. After almost a decade presenting herself as This Is the Kit, she has learned to root her music firmly in her own quirks rather than in the demands of any particular genre or trend.","The songs on This is the Kit's new album, Bashed Out, sound like songwriter Kate Stable's first recordings nearly a decade ago.

Little Earthquakes / Under the Pink,Tori Amos,by: Barry Walters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad42b1335d7bf1699b7d/1:1/w_160/f6114432.jpg,2015-04-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20384-little-earthquakes-under-the-pink/,RhinoRhino,"Myra Ellen Amos got used to dazzling and perplexing adults early on. At age 5 she became the youngest-ever student to enroll at Johns Hopkins University’s Peabody Institute. At 11, she was thrown out due to her inability to sight-read as well as she could play by ear. At 13, she started performing at Washington, D.C.’s piano bars, some of them gay, where—chaperoned by her pastor dad in his clerical collar—she’d take requests and try out her own material. And by 24, she tasted failure when her band Y Kant Tori Read released one Pat Benatar-esque 1988 album that instantly flopped as though it had never even existed. Being misrepresented on its cover as a sword-wielding, flame-haired metal vixen forced Amos to take control of her image while struggling to satisfy expectations that her prodigious genius generated.  (""I had come from child prodigy to 'vapid bimbo,' "" she told Rolling Stone in 2009.) Still contracted to Atlantic Records, she paired with former singer-songwriter Davitt Sigerson, and then with paramour Eric Rosse, but the label nixed both batches of results. So Amos kept on writing and recording, streamlining her music until a tearful viewing of Thelma & Louise prompted a song that didn’t need any accompaniment whatsoever. After ""Me and a Gun"", no suit dared argue that her album wasn’t finished. Whereas nearly all of her songs invite interpretation, this one is unquestionably about Amos getting raped. She changed a few details: Her real-life attacker wielded not a gun but a knife, and demanded that his victim sing hymns while he violated her. In the song, Amos mimics simple regimented intervals learned from psalms. Abruptly she breaks free from this steady keel as if mirroring how her psyche detaches from her body in order to deal with what’s happening to her. ""Do you know Carolina where the biscuits are soft and sweet?"" she suddenly wails with startling force before returning to the song's melodic core to explain, ""These things go through your head when there’s a man on your back and you’re pushed flat on your stomach."" This snapped Atlantic to its senses. Drawn almost exclusively from the initial reject pile, Little Earthquakes finally appeared in early 1992, right when Nirvana’s Nevermind topped the charts. Amos’ solo debut, though it was rarely talked about this way, was similarly radical—an alternately flirty and harrowing work that juxtaposed barbed truths against symphonic flights of fancy. It was lyrically nuanced and harmonically sophisticated exactly when grunge moved rock in a raw and brutish direction, which made her achievement even more striking. Amos was early Queen, early Elton John, and early Kate Bush with Rachmaninoff chops. Decades after prog-rock’s peak, her technical perfection was particularly shocking in the virtuoso-renouncing '90s: Not even Elton could tear into a song both vocally and instrumentally while staring down attendees with a Cheshire Cat grin. She did (and still does) this by straddling her piano bench like a lover with one foot pumping pedals and the other beating time, as if sending out long-suppressed erotic urges directly through her music, right at her audience. Listen to the live B-sides sequenced together at the end of each bonus disc that joins these reverently remastered editions of Little Earthquakes and Under the Pink, and you’ll hear this carnal communion evolve: At first her delivery is slightly mannered, and the crowd’s dead silent. But by the second disc, she’s flowing freely, and her following screams ecstatically in kind. *Earthquakes *chronicles a woman coming to terms with post-traumatic stress disorder. As she’d much later explore on 2007’s American Doll Posse, Amos had split her psyche into separate personas so she could deal with the pressure of being a both a minister’s daughter and prodigy. On this album, Amos finds her truest primary voice, no more so than on her inaugural U.S. single, ""Silent All These Years"", which chronicles that discovery in real time. It was here that she discovered how to obey her compositional muse: Establish a theme, wander from it, and then return via pop’s reassuring verse/chorus/verse structure. Amos would soon drift much, much further from her motifs, but here she’s uncommonly focused: The song’s circling introduction references her conservatory roots by evoking practice exercises, yet it’s catchy, and the bluntest moments in the melody fall exactly when Amos sings the title, a reliable songwriter’s trick. Yet even in the singer’s most accessible song, idiosyncrasies abound: From intro to opening verse, the tempo slows drastically, and remains irregular. Her right hand on the piano doesn’t always sync with what her left is doing and often accentuates different beats, while her lyric references Satan and menstruation amidst soothing classical filigree. ""Sometimes, I said, sometimes I hear my voice,"" she sings in a tone occasionally irked but ultimately joyful: Her real self, muted since childhood, finally comes out to play. For the outsider women and gay men who initially propelled Amos’ success, this hard-won message served as a clarion call, and they embraced her as if uncovering the challenging and most vulnerable parts of themselves. Tracy Chapman, Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, k.d. lang, Sinéad O'Connor, and the Indigo Girls had already begun to reach the same flock, but Amos—by virtue of her sexual intensity and subject matter—instantly commanded a bond only rivaled by Madonna, whose eroticism peaked just as Amos arrived. ""Look, I’m standing naked before you/ Don’t you want more than my sex,"" she teased in ""Leather"" over strutting chords that recall Queen’s ""Killer Queen"". Like Madonna, Amos put earthly passions on display not necessarily to seduce her congregation, but to empower herself—and, by extension—her fans. The difference between '94’s Under the Pink and its predecessor was that by this time Amos had sold enough to keep Atlantic execs at bay. In their absence, she and Rosse accentuated the orchestral pomp on some tracks while shrewdly deviating from it on others. Whereas she’d flatly rejected previous requests to replace Little Earthquakes’ pianos with guitars, here she fits in a few fleetingly noisy ones and bolsters the beat until it grooves. These adjustments transformed Amos from rising singer-songwriter to major alt-rock upstart: ""Cornflake Girl""—the cartwheeling UK hit that preceded the album and showcases one of her spunkiest solos—helped Pink enter the UK chart at #1, while ""God""—the grousing, gnarly U.S. single—topped modern rock playlists. It’s nice that Sam Smith and Hozier subvert the religious overtones of their churchy presentations with orthodoxy-slamming videos, but both lack the clarity and courage of Amos chanting, ""God sometimes you just don’t come through."" The rest wasn’t as pointed as that, but Pink’s extroverted arrangements worked as hard as Earthquakes’ lyrics and melodies. Amidst other overseas hits like ""Pretty Good Year"", Amos dug deeper, particularly on ""Bells for Her"", which suggests a ghost pirouetting across John Cage’s prepared piano. The pitch on certain keys is way off, like an old upright in your grandparents’ basement, but the effect is finessed the way Jimi Hendrix bent notes from music to cacophony and back again. ""Can’t stop what’s coming,"" she moans repeatedly while refusing to name her subject. Adulthood? The rupture of a childhood friendship? Orgasm? Amos’ mysteriousness sometimes subsequently got the best of her, but here she masters it. Before, during, and immediately after these breakthroughs, Amos generated enough outtakes, covers, remixes, and live tracks to fill several UK and U.S. variations on each album’s many singles and EPs, all of them designed to generate enough sales from devotees to force radio’s hand. Here, on generous bonus discs, they flow like autonomous albums; the Earthquakes addendum favors tracks Amos and Atlantic dropped in search of an ideal launch, while the Pink supplement emphasizes the singer’s knack for reinventing her material on the fly. Leading with a disc-long alternate version of Earthquakes, Amos’ 2006 box set A Piano: The Collectio**n already argued that ""Upside Down"" and ""Flying Dutchman""—both Sigerson-produced, string-wrapped efforts—equaled most everything that made the cut. Here, those fan favorites better complement Amos’ impulsive material, like ""Sweet Dreams"", which rewrites David Bowie’s ""Panic in Detroit"" as a Gallic jig, and ""The Pool"", an eerie excursion in extended overdubbed vocal tones that proved Amos boasted the harmonic chops to become a credible avant-garde classical composer. As her many cover versions attest, Amos honed discerning interpretive skills in her piano-bar adolescence: Her eerily funereal 1992 treatment of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" gently accentuates Kurt Cobain’s desperation while showcasing her exquisite phrasing. Check her timing and dynamics, the way she estranges his melody by pulling buried notes from chords while riding her sustain pedal and then releasing it as if drawing a breath. Even when she holds back, as she does here, Amos seethes. Pink’s outtakes aren’t generally as memorable as Earthquakes’: Aside from her ominous ""Honey"", an eleventh-hour omission she’s said she regrets, the Pink B-sides explore the same mesmeric side of Amos’ songbook as the album’s long and winding ballads. The seven live tracks, however, affirm that Amos could pull more drama from one acoustic piano than ordinary bands draw from several amplified instruments, and not just on the hits. ""Here. In My Head"", a feather-light flip she also admits should’ve been on Pink, gets the knockout climax its studio incarnation denies, while ""Winter""—her disciplined and devastating invocation of childhood’s paradise lost—gets elevated to the level of ""Me and a Gun"", as Amos emotionally amplifies and musically fleshes out every quietly anguished second. It’s astounding. Tori Amos arrived in an era when an unconventional, confrontational artist could also be commercial. Both Earthquakes and Pink went double-platinum in the U.S., and although American Top 40 radio never accommodated her, Amos managed to generate modern rock, adult contemporary, and dance club hits for 10 solid years before settling into cult-heroine status. Naturally, others came to wear her crown of anomalies and thorns: Lana Del Rey remains the sole mainstream act to adroitly juxtapose and underplay personal trauma with classical finery, yet the legacy of these milestones linger over today’s underground: Sufjan Stevens, Bat for Lashes, John Grant, Lykke Li, Owen Pallett, St. Vincent, Perfume Genius, FKA twigs, Antony Hegarty, and others all wear their sensitivities as strengths as she did. Effervescent, but at this peak still grounded by adversity, Amos taught her strange children well.","These reverently remastered editions of Little Earthquakes and Under the Pink, the first two solo records by Tori Amos, show the singer-songwriter discovering how to obey her compositional muse and harness her prodigious gifts into a singular voice.

Commissions II,Oneohtrix Point Never,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad76c0084474cd0c171a/1:1/w_160/4cf4d70b.jpg,2015-04-16 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20419-commissions-ii/,Warp,"Since 2010, Daniel Lopatin's Oneohtrix Point Never project has never remained in one place for long. Returnal melded the analog synth tapestries of his earliest output to extreme noise, while the very next year Replica ditched the keys almost entirely to delve into mesmeric loop songs. But by 2013’s masterful R Plus Seven, Lopatin was exploring the plasticity of synthesized computer sound: shape-shifting church organs into marimbas, rave anthem tropes into synthesized tropicalia, majestic choirs into intimate female coos. Following on the heels of last year's Commissions I, this Record Store Day EP documents Lopatin's most recent series of commissions, from two projects situated in Japan. For an artist who overhauls his aesthetic with almost every full-length release, suggesting someone whose identity is as reliable as Mystique, such stop gaps become a necessity for keeping track of his discography. Commissioned by Red Bull Music Academy in Tokyo last November, the first half of the EP, ""Bullet Hell Abstraction"", serves as homage to the popular danmaku (sometimes translated as ""bullet curtain"" or ""bullet hell"") scrolling shooter video games popular in the late '90s, a sensory overload of firepower, swarming enemies and explosions. The opening volley of ""Bullet Hell Abstraction I"" suggests that Lopatin can mimic thrash metal guitars and make sawed metal dissonance with the best of them (additionally, he also throws in some drill'n'bass delirium worthy of his Warp labelmates). But such a racket barely lasts past the minute mark before dissolving into shrapnel shards, the elegant ambient drift that was the hallmark of early OPN. From there the track moves in spurts and stops. ""Bullet Hell Abstraction III"" (""BHA II"" and ""IV"" were exclusive to the live concert, according to the label) meanwhile opens with some of the wonky fusion-funk that Lopatin likes to reference with side gigs like Ford & Lopatin and Chuck Person. The piece begins with a shiny, overblown theme that’s soon pulled apart like taffy, knotting together high frequencies, white noise, and shimmering keys in a scrambled manner last heard on Returnal’s ""‡ Nil Admirari"" and rarely revisited since. The highlight of Commissions II comes on the 19-minute opus ""Suite from Magnetic Rose"". Commissioned by Abandon Normal Devices and performed as a live accompaniment in Manchester to Koji Morimoto’s 1995 anime film Magnetic Rose (itself part of a trilogy of short anime from multiple animators entitled Memories), it’s perhaps Lopatin’s most sumptuous and satisfying long-form piece of music to date. ""Magnetic Rose"" feels like the summation of Seven's explorations, quicksilver in its changes in some regards, yet also taking time to fully revel in some of its most exquisite moments. Electrified water drips turn into weightless drones, Japanese koto plucks melt into bell-like tones. And while parts of R Plus Seven flashed mere glimpses of hallucinatory chorale passages, the latter half of ""Magnetic Rose"" expands these sounds to majestic proportions, evoking those haunting György Ligeti-scored moments of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, be it the black monolith or eerie deep space drift. With a forthcoming collaboration with Antony Hegarty announced as well as a new studio album in the works, one wonders if this might be our last glimpse at this particular side of Lopatin’s polygonal sound. If so, it makes for a satisfying souvenir.","Following on the heels of last year's Commissions I, this Record Store Day EP documents Lopatin's most recent series of commissions, from two projects situated in Japan.

Trickfinger,Trickfinger,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adc45e6ef95969321b30/1:1/w_160/440ec2c7.jpg,2015-04-15 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20478-trickfinger/,Acid Test,"Alongside his famous stints playing boisterous, stadium-sized guitar in Red Hot Chili Peppers, John Frusciante has quietly developed a reputation as an experimentalist. The wildly disparate and disjointed solo albums he's released over the last decade-plus have been generally engaging, though occasionally laborious, explorations of the outer-bounds of guitar-based pop music. They've showcased, first and foremost, an inclination to use more abstract elements to push beyond the straightforward riffery he put forth in his more famous gig. His new project Trickfinger, a tribute to the clatter of acid house, puts Frusciante in ostensibly unfamiliar territory. But as he's included more electronic flourishes on his solo efforts, it was only a matter of time before he decided to embrace the mechanized whirr of a host of synthesizers and drum machines en masse. Frusciante's self-titled full-length debut under the moniker demonstrates his grasp of the intricacies of the form. As he's proven over time with his guitar work, he has a knack for capably conjuring not just the sound, but the feeling of long-past musical eras. From even the first judders of opener ""After Below"", he taps into the stark, subdued rattle of the earliest Warp Records releases. Digitalist melodies become percussive and pummeling in their mechanistic repetition, locked-groove drum programming putters along for minutes at a time. Jittery snare work and rigidly interlocking synth lines populate both that track and the record as a whole, rendering it foreboding and overcast, and affecting at times. Tracks like ""Exlam"" and ""Phurip"" are able to channel the fidgety nervousness of this Autechre-indebted gridlike construction into something uniquely unsettling. If you can give yourself over to Frusciante's aural panic attacks they can be as transcendent as those of his acid house forefathers. But the less overwhelming moments of Trickfinger suffer from a surprising anonymity. Even when his seasick Sebadoh-like exercises under his own name turned obtuse and atonal, they were still immediately identifiable as products of his warped perspective. The flatulent bass runs on ""85h"" and ""Sain"" make them recognizable as acid house tracks, but there's not much more of interest going on than capable pastiche. Without the dynamic play and overstimulation that rules elsewhere, the endless repetition of these tracks starts to cut both ways. Trickfinger often provokes an engaging anxiety, but when Frusciante's not pushing at the edges of the form it can lack the magic of his otherwise unapologetically experimental solo work. That could have something to do with the fact that this is only Frusciante's first album-length foray into the field. When looking back on the gradual shift toward synth programming, Frusciante talks about these efforts as an attempt to learn the ""language"" of legendary electronic acts like Aphex Twin and Venetian Snares. Trickfinger is, if nothing else, proof that he's finally fluent in that language. But it's also a reminder that Frusciante is at his best when he's jabbering away in a tongue of his own invention.","Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante's Trickfinger project is a tribute to the clatter of acid house.

There are traces of genres they’ve already spent some time exploring: British post-punk, '70s soul and funk, late '60s krautrock. The band recorded Infinite House in wildly different environments—Benton, Mississippi and Brooklyn—which serve as central and opposing life forces for the album. One minute murmuring, echoed vocals imitate spirits in a Southern forest, and the next frontman Carlos Hernandez is texting a lover and bemoaning the cost of living. It’s a scatterbrained trip, one that invites you to nestle into its grooves and get comfy before it rudely catapults you out again. Take, for example, opener ""Company"". A muted bass line thumps through the first minute, joined by some leisurely strumming and a faint hi-hat. Drummer Julian Fader abruptly cues the rest of the band in for an outburst of noise and distortion as Hernandez hollers in sheer desperation, ""Do you appreciate my company?"" This is a group that basks in these kinds of bipolar switches, slinking away to a new mood just as they’d gotten grips on the one preceding it. Nonsense is intrinsic to Ava Luna, and either of its two backup singers (Felicia Douglass and Becca Kauffman) is prone to breaking out into gibberish at any given moment. But they take this tendency to a new level on ""Tenderize"" when Kauffman breathily scats between Hernandez’s anxious yelps like a jazz club singer. Douglass’ shadowy harmonies counteracts them both, closing in the gaps at exactly the right points. When the group builds on each other this way, the result is eerily mystical. This layering works similarly on ""Coat of Shellac"", blending the slickness of R&B with the harshness of post-punk and unpredictability of no wave. The album has a loose, playful energy, and always seems to be ready to pounce on you. Skittish guitar improvisations tangle with neo-soul percussion on ""Steve Polyester"", while Kauffman alternates between speaking and sliding into song sporadically, as if by accident. ""Black Dog"" starts off with Hernandez telling a seductive, drowsy tale over a few simple guitar chords, allowing for a much-needed moment of respite. Of course, that too gives way to the dissonance, accompanied by haunting, gospel choir gang vocals. He often riffs on freewheeling blues-rock in the style of Captain Beefheart, most prominently during the serrated rhythms of ""Best Hexagon"". The most bizarre track—if forced to pick one—is ""Victoria"". Primal utterances dance circles around distorted, intergalactic synth beats. Kauffman takes a beguiling taunt (""You’re no good, baby!""), deconstructs it, then pieces it back together repeatedly. It’s a disorienting thrill that draws out the band’s innate ingenuity. There are plenty of other high points on the album—the aching chorus of ""Billz"" is arguably Hernandez’s most addictive yet—but listening to Ava Luna play off of each others’ quirks here is intoxicating. Minimalism has never been their strong suit, and they wrestle with controlling their lawless tendencies, yet Infinite House doesn’t compromise the group’s hyperactive curiosity. Keeping up with it requires careful attention, though unpacking it hardly feels laborious. Just don’t expect Ava Luna to do any hand-holding for you throughout the process.","On their latest LP, Ava Luna are, as always, toying with a collection of ideas that should not work together in theory. The album has a loose, playful energy, and always seems to be ready to pounce on you.

The Past We Leave Behind,Pale Blue,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acc4ea9e61561daa5fc0/1:1/w_160/5063af0b.jpg,2015-04-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20297-the-past-we-leave-behind/,Captured Tracks2MR,"Mike Simonetti has never sat still. Troubleman Unlimited, the label he founded in 1993, started from a foundation of noisy hardcore—bands like Rorschach, Unwound, and Rye Coalition—and expanded to include a staggering range of music, from danceable post-punk (Erase Errata, Tussle) to noise and power electronics (Hair Police, John Wiese) to new-school goth (Zola Jesus, Pocahaunted). When the rock world could no longer contain his ambitions, the obsessive record collector and one-time club promoter—at 17, he had flyered for New York’s Mars nightclub, where Vin Diesel worked the door and Bobby Konders spun house and dancehall—teamed up with the Chromatics and Glass Candy producer Johnny Jewel to create Italians Do It Better. The label became a platform for disco and synth-pop, as well as more esoteric beatmakers like Professor Genius and Invisible Conga People. Pale Blue is Simonetti’s latest project. A new alias on a new label (2MR, or Two Mikes Records, a collaboration with Captured Tracks’ Mike Sniper), it is nominally a solo affair, though a singer named Elizabeth Wight, of the San Francisco duo Silver Hands, plays a key role, and Lower Dens’ Jana Hunter shows up on one of the key cuts. The title tells you something about its emotional register—wistful, elegiac, bittersweet— and the Field and M83 both offer clear antecedents for Pale Blue’s billowing synthesizers and yearning vocals. But for all the grandeur Simonetti wants to summon, Pale Blue’s sound is also modest, making the most of Wight's voice, layering and looping her to create an airy background wash that casts a rosy sunset glow over everything. Simonetti’s approach to structure, meanwhile, resembles a zoned-out road worker painting stripes on a lonely stretch of desert highway: Not a lot changes, but then, it’s not supposed to. The intensity rises and falls with the rolling hills, but the vistas remain the same, and the horizon never gets any closer. Despite the uniformity, there are clear highlights. The title track is a big, bold, feel-good bummer of a tune that finds Wight testing the lower limits of her register, sounding a little like Siouxsie amidst a gleaming array of contrapuntal synths. ""Dusk in Parts"", the other obvious single, makes the most of Jana Hunter’s desolate wail, while the monotone bassline offers a sullen deadweight counterpoint to sentimental Rhodes melodies and chimes that glint like tear-stained cheeks. ""The Math"" could actually be mistaken for a Kompakt release—if the recent ""Blurred Lines"" verdict actually counted as legal precedent, Heiko Voss and DJ Koze might conceivably take Simonetti to court for so skillfully replicating the vibe of Voss’ Kompakt Pop classic ""I Think About You (DJ Koze Mix)"", and I say that in the most complimentary way possible. From the strings to the horn stabs to the buoyant background vocals, it’s a triumphant example of Simonetti at his extroverted best. The Bruce Springsteen cover ""Tougher"", on the other hand, represents the other end of the spectrum: it plays its cards close to the vest, with a trim arpeggio opening up only as much as necessary while Wight mutters come-ons. Her spoken-word vocals never quite synch with the beat, either, and as a result, it yanks us out of the production’s hypnotic swirl. Some of the album’s more middling tracks—""Distance to the Waves"", ""Myself"", ""The Eye""—feel only halfway there. Simonetti has no issue letting a track that consists only of a single wavering chord and some ethereal background vocals drag on for seven-and-a-half minutes (""The Rain""). But if this 67-minute album is not without filler, even those airy expanses are perfectly pleasant. This unwillingness to edit himself was also an issue on Simonetti’s solo EP Capricorn Rising, in which one song appeared in three different versions, comprising nearly half of the record’s running time. This tendency is ironic, because it moves in the opposite of Simonetti’s approach as a label head. It speaks, perhaps, to the perfectionist’s desire to come up with the best possible version of a particular sketch—unable to pick a favorite, he simply presents all its iterations, at unabridged lengths. But maybe that has to do with a desire to wring the most out of a given idea—the most pleasure, the most yearning, the most eyes-closed, lost-in-a-dream intensity beneath a slowly twirling disco ball.","Mike Simonetti, formerly of Italians Do It Better, has a moody new electro-pop project with singer Elizabeth Wight. The Past We Leave Behind is wistful, elegiac, and bittersweet, and the Field and M83 both offer clear antecedents for Pale Blue’s billowing synthesizers and yearning vocals.

"Batu Malablab: Suite for Prepared Piano, Flute and Electronics",M.C. Schmidt,by: Raymond Cummings,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad83ea9e61561daa6114/1:1/w_160/c72d7079.jpg,2015-04-15 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20430-batu-malablab-suite-for-prepared-piano-flute-and-electronics/,MegaphoneKnock 'Em Dead,"According to musician/author Michael Tenzer in Balinese Gamelan Music, the term ""Batu Malablab"" is a Balinese pejorative that’s ""typically hurled at unprepared musicians."" Tenzer goes on to break down the etymology: ""Batu means rock or stone, and malablab is the active form of the incisively onamonopedic verb ‘to boil.’ A gamelan deserving of the sobriquet ‘boiling rock’ is likely going nowhere fast."" It’s tempting to assume that by adopting this phrase as the title of his debut solo LP, M.C. Schmidt is essentially taking the piss, making an esoteric jibe at himself. Yet there’s precedent: while an intellectual rigor informs Matmos, the Baltimore-based electronic duo Schmidt operates with bandmate/partner Drew Daniel, a playfully self-deprecating streak runs through the group’s public and recorded personas. Recorded live at a series of locations by Schmidt, Due Process’ Thomas Dimuzio, Jon ""Wobbly"" Leidecker, and others, Batu Malablab has a ""magic eye"" quality, in the sense that initially listening to it is like watching a stranger empty her junk drawer. There are so many sonic odds and ends present, unleashed with what seems like such a gleeful disdain for compositional Western structure, that the impulse is to throw up one’s hands and surrender. Surrender often enough, though, and patterns emerge, seams begin to show. There’s a loose, off-the-cuff vibe to these proceedings that’s worlds apart from Matmos’ sample-pasted, referent-laden grooves, or the metal and punk covers Daniel retools in his Soft Pink Truth guise. A tangle of gong- and chime-like sounds inaugurates ""Lowland Side"", giving way to bass tones and re-emerging later among scurrying flutes. Prepared piano figures and mysterious scraps of percussion peek out of the humid gloom, then disappear into it, punctuated by occasional bird call samples. Somewhere along the line, the players glide into a peculiar species of out music, with a bass solo accompanying sounds that resemble a mechanic rummaging furtively through tools, bolts, and screws, eventually supplanted by a spine-tingling choir. It’s a fascinating, almost mystic pile-up: elements of Eastern and American Indian music mingling for cocktails, then taking in a musique concrète set. Less plainly predetermined than thrillingly accidental, Batu Malablab seems, at times, comprised of desperate misadventures.  Even when the recording does find its footing, the clamor retains a hint of streamlined anarchy that is, in its odd way, downright meditative: a rattling, seething ambience that quotes a number of genres—New Age, opera, world music, assorted species of avant-garde that Sonic Youth celebrated on Goodbye 20th Century—without being fully in thrall to any of them. Think a more omnivorous, porous take on The Carl Stalling Project. Over the 39 minutes, segues and splashes accrue, evoking a din that is either felt or heard depending on the listener’s attention level at the time. Either way, when those final notes sound and the record cuts out, the resulting silence seems emptier than when it began. That’s no small feat, and Batu Malablab announces Schmidt as a collagist force in his own right.","The debut solo LP from M.C.

Bad Moon Rising,Sonic Youth,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad8113d1975652139f52/1:1/w_160/2714721f.jpg,2015-04-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20428-bad-moon-rising/,Goofin'Goofin',"On their first LP Confusion Is Sex, Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, and Lee Ranaldo established their reputation—noise-obsessed, acerbic, in thrall to subversion and half in love with nihilism. So it came as a surprise that they followed it up with a pitch-black, punishing take on Americana titled after, of all things, a Creedence Clearwater Revival song. Its timing was ripe, arriving amidst the culture wars of the Reagan era: Gordon and Moore cast a shadowy portrait slicked in sweat and blood, not unlike the nightmarish caricatures of American institutions you often saw on the cover art for hardcore bands. But the band’s fury ran deeper than that. As Gordon recalls in her recent memoir Girl in a Band: ""I ... preferred to sing about the darkness shimmering beneath the shiny quilt of American pop culture""—more specifically, ""the westward pull, the American romance with death,"" as well as the collision of this all-American death-drive with the hopeful ecstasies of the hippie generation. Where Time Life Books was busy commemorating and canonizing Woodstock, Gordon and Moore raised up the leering specter of Charles Manson, highlighting the thin lines separating free love from violent sexual anarchy, and how such spaces are often exploited to attain power. Bad Moon Rising is obsessed with sex and power, specifically with how one informs the other. It is the band’s most explicitly sexual album, and among its darkest. ""I Love Her All the Time"", ""I’m Insane"", and ""Halloween"" (a bonus track that’s since become standard on all CD versions of the album) develop female subjects as supplicants to male authority figures, ceding their bodies (and therefore, their identities) to them as if there’s no other choice. ""She’s on my side,"" Moore coolly says of his strung-out paramour on ""I Love Her All the Time"", repeating the song’s title with the unsavory enthusiasm of a cult leader who’s finally cracked the code. On ""Halloween"", Gordon struggles to identify just what it is that makes her succumb to a man’s wiles, finally theorizing ""it’s the devil in me"": the female sex drive, corrupted. Bad Moon Rising is not so much a collection of songs as it is an extended, unending uproar, seamless in sound and theme.  This is partially due to the band’s recording strategy, which translated the ebb-and-flow of their live show at the time into a singular composition. At this point in their career, Sonic Youth didn’t have guitar techs to assist during shows, and long stretches of feedback between songs allowed them time to tune. On the album, this approach lends itself well to a constantly shifting tableau of American nightmares, beginning with the primordial fury of ""Brave Men Run (In My Family)"" and barreling towards its final destination: Manson’s Death Valley and the terror of Helter Skelter. In Bad Moon Rising’s world, the country’s loss of innocence—and its sexual corruption—began with an assault, chronicled in the terrifying ""Ghost Bitch"". Moore sounds possessed on the following, mournful track, ""I’m Insane"", a sinister piece assembled entirely of fragments from pulp novels like ""a steaming swamp,"" ""murdered angels,"" and the head-scratching ""inside my head my dog’s a bear."" It’s less a song and more the no wave aural equivalent of refrigerator magnet poetry, but it functions remarkably well within the album’s overarching narrative. But what happens when women reclaim their bodies and fight back? Years before riot grrrl, ""Flower"" (a bonus track released after Bad Moon Rising alongside ""Halloween"" on 12” and added to the album in subsequent reissues) encapsulated the sex-positive sentiments, as well as the noise, of the forthcoming movement. Gordon's chanted manifesto, delivered over a paranoid, unstable rumble, urges us to ""support the power of women"" by ""us[ing] the power of man."" The nature of this power, of course, is sex, but Gordon’s vision encompasses more than the act itself; her culminating directive of ""Use the word/ FUCK!"" commands a recognition of women as carnal, sexual beings. ""The word is love,"" she adds, completing a circular logic proof of sorts: Power is sex, but sex is love; love is universal, so universal recognition of sex has the ability to empower all. Granted, ""Flower"" might scan as slightly hippie-dippy next to Kathleen Hanna’s acerbic prose, but its mangled punk instrumentation and feminist politics set a precedent. Bad Moon Rising reaches both its climax and conclusion with the Manson-inspired madness of ""Death Valley ’69"", Moore’s infamous duet with Lydia Lunch, and the closest the album comes to producing a viable single. A tortured yell drags the record out of the doldrums of the preceding ""Justice Is Might"" and into a busted-up Chevy parked in Death Valley on some dead night, in the Summer of Love. Moore and Lunch don’t try to harmonize or sing on key, because their minds aren’t on the melody; they wail over and under one another like coyotes in heat. A single glance over the lyrics suggests another instance of male-on-female violence (""She started to holler/ I didn't wanna/ But she started to holler/ So I had to hit it""). And yet, the ecstasy with which Lunch vocalizes all but says ""This is a game, I’m trying to get you, and I’m winning."" The balance of power shifts once more as Lunch unleashes that orgasmic shriek at song's end: a brilliant imitation of the whimpering guitars, a final paean to chaos before the fade to black. Despite its compelling aesthetic, Bad Moon Rising suffers from a few technical shortcomings which become more evident in this remastering, specifically Bob Bert’s tom-heavy approach to the drums. They play a critical role in conveying the primal energy coursing through ""Brave Men Run (In My Family)"" and ""Society Is a Hole"", but the atmospheric boost quickly wears thin: not just because he sounds like he’s drumming with crab mallets, but because he can’t be bothered to beef up his fills or do little more than the bare minimum. One can’t help but long for the frenzied kit work of Steve Shelley, the hardcore-schooled, improvisatory percussionist who succeeded Bert. Additionally, your mileage may vary where vocal melodies, particularly Moore’s, are concerned; his grating refrains on ""Society Is a Hole"" and ""I Love Her All the Time"" show he hadn’t yet developed the tightness and control he would exhibit later. That said, this dissonance is a defining aspect of early Sonic Youth albums, and some might find it refreshing compared to the straitlaced sound of, say, ""Incinerate"". Since its release, Bad Moon Rising has left behind many legacies. Thanks to the mangled mass of the guitars, as well as the lack of anthemic verse-chorus-verses structure that dominated Daydream Nation and Goo, the LP is regarded by many as Sonic Youth's most ""difficult"" album. Fans of contemporary acts like Swans (who Sonic Youth toured with prior to the Bad Moon Rising sessions) might find in the record’s structure a source of catharsis and narrative strength. Those who became fans post Daydream Nation, meanwhile, will need to re-acclimate themselves to the pitch-black soundscapes. And while the task may seem imposing, it’s also immediate and engrossing; after being immersed in this album's world, it’s jarring to return to the real one—and perhaps, by extension, Sonic Youth’s subsequent catalog, which never quite revisited the sheer alienation of Bad Moon Rising.","Sonic Youth followed their first full LP, Confusion Is Sex, with a pitch-black, punishing take on Americana titled after, of all things, a Creedence Clearwater Revival song.

Cool It,Sam Cohen,by: Joel Oliphint,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad5c5e6ef95969321a74/1:1/w_160/fc379721.jpg,2015-04-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20401-cool-it/,Easy Sound,"After Apollo Sunshine called it quits in 2009, it looked like Yellowbirds would become Sam Cohen’s solo outlet. But after that project became a real band and then similarly dispersed last year, Cohen decided to release music under his given name for the first time. Though he plays just about all the instruments on Cool It, the sound is right in line with those two Yellowbirds releases. Gone are vestiges of the rootsiness Apollo Sunshine incorporated in early albums and the kitchen-sink aesthetic the band explored on parting shot Shall Noise Upon. With Yellowbirds and now this solo release, Cohen has settled comfortably into vintage, sunny psychedelia. Cohen frequently lends his guitar skills to other artists (Bob Weir, Cee-Lo), so it’s not surprising that his six-string work steals the show here. Subtle synth washes provide atmosphere, but it’s the guitars—whether chiming, fuzzy, or processed to sound like a synthesizer—that supply the hooks and textures. Meanwhile, Cohen’s steady voice—like an American Lennon with some Dylan affectations—keeps it all casual. He’s content to let his music float by breezily, radiating warm and pleasant vibes. There’s always been a certain nonchalance to Cohen’s presence on record, and the chill-out feelings here are as chill as ever. That comfy passivity lines up with Cohen’s songwriting. A song about mountains becomes less about climbing and more of an ode to inaction on leadoff track, ""Let the Mountain Come to You"". And ""Midnight Conqueror"", despite the emboldened title, is actually about how it’s OK to go to bed angry or worried or indecisive. ""Sleep on it, baby,"" Cohen sings. ""Wait for the morning, let the night decide."" Even when he’s down and out, Cohen takes it all in stride. ""Right now I feel lonely… but pretty soon I’ll be in love again,"" he sings on ""Last Dream"". Not that there’s no struggle. The songs convey a sense of yearning for some alternate reality or paradisiacal afterlife—a place where ""trees don’t shake their heads in sorrow and nobody shakes in fear when they think about tomorrow."" That longing is key to the record. It’s what makes you realize Cohen cares about what he’s singing and that he wants something more, even if, on the surface, it doesn’t look like much is going on. On closing track ""El Dorado"", the sky turns red and rains for 100 years, but in Cohen’s mind, this is no Michael Bay movie. ""No one’s saying shit, it’s quieted down,"" he sings, ""and the gate’s wide open."" While there’s rarely an inopportune time to put on a record that can transport you to a hazy weekend afternoon in the summer, Cohen’s consistency veers into predictability. Cool It is psychedelic, but it lacks the trippy surprises that the signifier implies. The most unexpected and memorable moments come from ""The Garden"", a bass-led groove that begins with Cohen standing in a garden, waiting for the rain. It’s a Friday, and he’s drinking a few beers (""beeeeeeers,"" his most Dylan-esque moment) while his band rehearses for a Sunday gig, the same one they’ve played for the past six years: ""We practice in a two-car garage, smoke around the kids."" Cohen sings of the children inhaling the adults’ fumes (""They’re gonna learn it someday""), then follows it up with the ultimate Sam Cohen existential shrug: ""If someday ever is.""","Sam Cohen, formerly of Apollo Sunshine and Yellowbirds, steps out with his first solo album under his own name. Continuing what he started with the latter band, Cohen has settled comfortably into vintage, sunny psychedelia.

Zoy Zoy,Tal National,by: Minna Zhou,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad4fb1335d7bf1699b93/1:1/w_160/aa0a4426.jpg,2015-04-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20392-zoy-zoy/,Fat Cat,"Since forming in 2000, Tal National have been on a quest to make it known to the world that Niger is not in fact Nigeria. Besides everything else, musically, the land-locked Sahelian nation never went through the same kind of cosmopolitan musical explosion that many other West African nations did in the 1960s post-independence era. Only around the turn of the century have some Nigerien artists broken into the international market, including Mamar Kassey and Tuareg groups like Etran Finatawa or Bombino. And now, of course, Tal National. While Tal National’s 2008 sophomore album A Na Waya made them the most popular group in Niger, their following album and first international release Kaani officially established them outside the continent. Led by band leader Hamadal Issoufou Moumine and produced by Chicago-based engineer Jamie Carter, Kaani was a joyful barrage of traditional Hausa and Zarma vocals, soukous guitars, reggae synths, and percussion, all rolled up into a decidedly rock aesthetic. Then as now, Tal National took great pride in representing the ethnic diversity of Niger in their music and in their large rotating cast of band members. On their second-ever international release, Zoy Zoy, they build on Kaani and amplify everything to the nth degree. Zoy Zoy's themes are as diverse as the traditions it pulls from. On ""Sey Wata Gaya"", for example, Tal National sing about refuting ongoing Islamist denouncements of their secular music. The bed of the track comprises a melismatic guitar riff repeating over and over against a Mandingue kora motif. In ""Tenere"", they sing about the violent ouragan (windstorm) of the Ténéré desert, a region frequented by the Tuareg. Fittingly, they cycle through a Tuareg assouf riff, which ripples mirage-like over hissy, subdividing hi-hats and a steady kick drum beat. The Hausa and Zarma vocals—mainly male lead vocal and female backing vocals—bound and echo across these arrangements. Altogether, these threads form a sort of tangled maze of melodic lines and jagged edges, interlocking motifs that repeat themselves like squares in a kaleidoscope. The music is colorful and bright and dizzying. It recalls the energy and wall-of-sound quality of Konono No 1, except more frenzied and texturally varied. Tal National are masters of lightning-speed time changes too, able to lock into a slower bluesy guitar solo as easily as an impromptu mbalax dance break (see ""Farila""). In spots, the group even tap into some old school Ethiopian tizita vibes, but sped-up and with a hypnotic psych rock edge. That hypnotic effect is nowhere more evident than in the last two tracks. ""Kodaje"" and ""Saraounia"" are dances of possession. The tracks’ namesakes are spirits (genie in French*)*, the former Zarma and the latter Hausa, and both can speak through those they possess. The lead vocalist sings himself into a fever pitch, chanting and grunting and careening—this is the distilled version of the energy that propels the entire album. And it’s this energy that holds Zoy Zoy together, whether they be singing about fundamentalist pushback, the desert, or women. Tal National’s ability to weave together all these thematic and musical elements with unflagging speed and energy is breathtaking. But it can also feel claustrophobic at times, especially when listening the whole way through and with headphones on. The two or three different polyrhythmic guitar lines present on every track are more or less split between the left and right channels. So to those raised on Western music, it can feel like getting caught between multiple conversations—albeit interesting ones. Listening through speakers, on the other hand, opens up another dimension of the album—you can visualize where the artists are positioned as they play. The artists’ emerge spatially before the listener, as if performing live, and Tal National are, first and foremost, a live band. They are the ouragan that they sing of—a thing hardly containable in the space of mere megabytes.","Tal National are among the most popular groups in Niger, and they take great pride in representing the ethnic diversity of their home country.

New Glow,Matt & Kim,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adb7c0084474cd0c1784/1:1/w_160/6407d439.jpg,2015-04-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20468-new-glow/,Harvest,"Nine years after their first album, Matt & Kim have never strayed from their initial elevator pitch: they’re still a pop band in indie clothing, re-imagining contemporary party music with a punky, DIY spin. In 2015, however, the concept of scrappy outsiders engaging with pop and dance music doesn’t carry the quixotic novelty it once did. As the boundaries between pop, indie, and alternative have blurred or disappeared over the last decade, Top 40 has become a less exclusive club. With re-tailored punk bands like Fall Out Boy and Paramore scoring pop radio play and Karmin trading their shticky YouTube covers of pop hits for hits of their own, the thought that a cheery, skateboarding keyboard-and-drums duo could play in the mainstream no longer seems at all farfetched. On New Glow, Matt & Kim meet Top 40 more than halfway. Considerably flashier than 2012’s self-recorded Lightning, the album was brought to a sheen by several outside producers, including Kanye West’s longtime engineer Andrew Dawson and Jesse Shatkin, who co-wrote Sia’s rafters-rattler ""Chandelier"" and assisted Tegan and Sara’s own pop makeover on Heartthrob. As always, Matt & Kim cartwheel through their hyper little songs with Kidz Bop levels of enthusiasm, and like a Kidz Bop compilation, New Glow is fixated on the sounds of now. The group’s once-chintzy canvas now includes grandiose hip-hop beats, whimsical trap appropriations, and candied dubstep drops, with occasional Auto-Tune and an air horn thrown in for color. If at times these songs sound like funhouse mirror versions of contemporary pop music, so have some of the biggest Top 40 hits of the last couple of years. ""Hey Now"" opens the album with a nod to the swing-rap circus of Baz Luhrmann’s Great Gatsby soundtrack, while the frolicking ""Can You Blame Me"" feels as if it could give way to a Flo Rida verse at any moment. Even with the top-dollar production, there’s still no mistaking New Glow for anything other than a Matt & Kim album. Matt Johnson’s voice makes sure of that. He’s always sung in a dweeby, nasal whine, and here that voice feels more than ever like a dog whistle, a signal to the group’s core audience that, despite New Glow’s Top 40 flirtations, his heart still belongs to pop-punk. The same way that country stars play up their drawls when they sing crossover pop songs, lest their rural fanbase think they’ve forsaken their roots, New Glow’s contemporary aesthetic pushes Johnson to lean extra hard on his old, dopey vocal affectations. In the album’s most cartoonish display of overcompensation, he squawks the line ""We were too turned up!"" as if he’s snapping a pair of suspenders against his chest. None of this is to say that Matt & Kim don’t hold genuine affection for the pop and dance sounds they volley on New Glow. But if there’s cynicism in the album, it’s in the presumption that any old schmuck can toss off a great pop song with the right producer. From ""Get It"", a dance track that’s all drop and no sentiment, to ""Hoodie On"", a thin sartorial pride anthem for the Urban Outfitters set, every song here serves as evidence to the contrary. Even on the selfie-culture critique ""World Is Ending"", a rare attempt at profundity from a group that doesn’t often concern itself with deep thoughts, the lyrics feel about as considered as a homework assignment scribbled in the minutes before class. New Glow may be Matt & Kim’s most polished album, but their songwriting has never been more amateurish.","New Glow is considerably flashier than 2012’s self-recorded Lightning.

Not only is it a suddenly ubiquitous fixture in dance music (so much so that the classical pianist Franceso Tristano was tapped to mix the latest installment of Get Physical's Body Language series); it occupies center stage on Chilly Gonzales' new neo-classical work, Chambers, and Nils Frahm's free album of prepared-piano miniatures, Solo. Frahm feels so strongly about the instrument that he recently declared March 29—the 88th day of the year, matching the instrument's 88 keys—Piano Day, a celebration of not just the instrument but also its builders, tuners, and, of course, players and fans. Delia Gonzalez's new album is the latest addition to this small bumper crop. It's largely conceptual, not particularly virtuosic, but it's effective for its own purposes, which, in this case, amount to inducing hypnotic focus and transmitting vague melancholy. Its main attraction is a suite of four meditative pieces for multi-tracked piano with subtle post-processing (there is also a second disc of remixes). The four pieces were originally written for a 2010 solo show at Naples' Galleria Fonti, where Gonzalez presented four short 16mm films of ballerinas dancing in front of mirrors. (The 2LP edition of the album includes all four films on a bonus DVD.) That piece, says Gonzalez, was inspired in part by a maxim from the Russian composer and spiritual teacher George Gurdjieff: ""To play scales is to become more in tune with your inner self."" That lone adage says more about the intentions of the project than any of the rest of its backstory. It's not hard to draw a line from Gonzalez's new album back to The Days of Mars, her 2005 album with Gavin Russom, and their assorted singles, despite the shift from synthesizers to coiled steel strings. Like that body of work, In Remembrance is fundamentally about lines and ways to braid them. ""I"" begins with a lonely descending figure that's vaguely reminiscent of the theme from Halloween—until it softens and turns inward, tangling up in a ball of contrapuntal phrases. The song, like the pieces that follow it, feels less composed than sculpted, a multi-track collage of piled-on arpeggios and cadenzas and trills. In ""II"", the left hand initially takes the lead, and the effect feels both more somber and more determined. ""III"" is the most lyrical of the set, and it's also the most obviously treated with delay; in ""IV"", she pounds away at bold, declarative chords, her foot firmly pressed down on the sustain pedal. Given her emphasis on repetition, it's tempting to invoke the influence of American minimalists like Philip Glass, but In Remembrance doesn't have his rhythmic or tonal complexity. By design, I think, it's meant to sound unpolished; it's less about formal brilliance than the attainment of a kind of trance state. The occasional jarring dissonance recalls alternate-tuning buffs like Michael Harrison, though it's unclear whether they're intentional, the product of an unconventional tuning system, or simply the happy accident of an intemperate concert grand, astringent as a Sour Patch Kid. A closer comparison might be Grouper's Ruins, which evinced a similarly idiosyncratic approach to the instrument. But the closest precedent might be a wonderful 1996 album called While by the Chicago musician Thymme Jones, of Brise-Glace and Yona-Kit, made with a lone piano and a four-track cassette recorder. Like In Remembrance, While weaves together contrapuntal phrases into dense nests and thickets of sound. The four remixes, one per piece, come from the Brooklyn producer Bryce Hackford. In keeping with the simplicity of the music, he hasn't overcomplicated his interventions. ""Remix I"" takes an eraser to the percussive side of the piano—the moment that each note is struck—and leaves only the sustain and the decay; the result is like a game of ping-pong played with dandelion tufts. ""Remix II"", with its looming kick drum and washed-out keys, recalls the heavier recordings in Wolfgang Voigt's Gas catalog, and the lumpy sample stabs of ""Remix IV"" faintly suggest Kompakt's Dettinger. The best of the bunch is ""Remix III"", which stretches out a right-hand trill over a spring-loaded rhythm and atonal synth bleats on loan from minimal techno innovator Robert Hood. Like Carl Craig's now-classic remix of Gonzalez and Russom's ""Relevee"", it uses the original—just a scrap of it, but enough—as the springboard for a 10-minute-plus foray into techno at its most psychedelic. It's a testament to the strength of Gonzalez's work that she can provide the foundations for something so wild with such humble materials.","The main attraction of Delia Gonzalez's new album—the latest addition in a small bumper crop of piano-centric dance records—is a suite of four meditative pieces for multi-tracked piano.

Crown EP,The-Dream,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad3d9d034d5c69bf4328/1:1/w_160/6174e458.jpg,2015-04-14 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20380-crown-ep/,Def Jam,"The-Dream's first three albums—in particular, his 2007 debut Love/Hate—relied upon a delicate balance of songcraft with the singer/songwriter's foibles and quirks. There was a playfulness to his best songs which never undercut their sincere emotional power; if anything, the tossed-off lyrics enhanced that power, his irreverence contrasting starkly with the song's overwhelming emotional intensity. This was a skill he channeled from R. Kelly, executed in a more modern style; by the time R. Kelly released the obviously The-Dream-inspired ""Echo"" in 2010, the snake was eating his own tail, a tribute to The-Dream's ability to adapt an established dynamic to create something genuinely new. But The-Dream spent the past five years slipping from that sweet spot of effortless transcendence: there's a sharp divide between The-Dream songs which work, and those that don't, and the latter category stacked some substantial gains over the course of the 2010s. Perhaps buying into the hype around his steadily growing stanbase and critical acclaim, he abandoned the high-pressure lottery of hits-first craftsmanship and tilted autobiographical, personal. But The-Dream is not a charismatic personality, and after he was caught cheating on his then-wife Christina Milian, he wasn't a sympathetic one either. As cruel as it sounds, perhaps it wasn't Terius his fans loved; it was his work, his melodic sense, his intuitive sensibilities and unpretentious workmanship. Chastened, The-Dream's deft ""That's My Shit"" is a return to that just-right poise of the serious and silly. The beat is understated, a two-tone stop-start organ tiptoeing forward on synthesized finger snaps, his protagonist's confidence underlined by the ""Yup!"" vocal interjections in the background. For the dancer, its use of space allows for a freer range of motion. The melody is equally relaxed, a barely-there nursery rhyme that taunts his target until the reassuring piano tones anchor his certainty at the chorus. But what makes ""That's My Shit"" so singular is the way The-Dream conveys an unconventional theme with emotional precision. The conviction with which he sings ""I know how to push that button, trust me y'all just fuckin'"" is funny, yet he is unafraid to let his heart show—boldly ""catching feelings."" The rest of The Crown EP does not thread the needle quite so gracefully. ""Prime"" is an example of one such failure: The-Dream is at his best when he isolates and emphasizes the familiar. But where ""That's My Shit"" epitomizes the bulletproof swagger of romantic confidence, ""Prime"" feels distant: Convincing a future lover of your value typically requires a bit more show-don't-tell than ""I know you think you're out of my league/ But I'm trying to tell you girl, I'm in my prime."" Even if interpreted as internal monologue, ""Prime"" suggests uncertainty and insecurity—relatable emotions, maybe, but not ones you'd sing about with pride. In part, the misses might be a product of the format: ""All I Need"" links to ""Fruition"" like the infamous ""Yamaha""-""Nikki Part 2""-""Abyss"" triptych of Love King, but on a 6-track record, it feels forced, his old ambitions with R&B form reduced to mannerism. There's always been a certain degree of generosity to The-Dream's work, a feeling that one hook wasn't enough, that Tricky Stewart's production would be lusher and more ornamental, each record a compact snow globe of ideas and emotions. Yet closer ""Cedes Benz"" feels like a product of pressure. Each of its disparate parts—the grinding aggro opener, the menacing second act, the sensuous slow jam—feel undercooked, repetitious, combined in the hopes that no one would recognize the reheated elements interspersed throughout. It's not entirely empty of ideas, but the good ones are buried. ""Fruition"" feels like the rare middleweight The-Dream track: held together entirely by a perfect guitar loop repeated as if it were a memory, an average song is redeemed by a single melody. ""All I Need"", however, almost lives up to our memory of The-Dream's earliest peaks, compelling and grandiose: it is unafraid to fail, to overreach. And in that ambition, it wrings more from the formula The-Dream approached on records like Love vs. Money's ""Fancy"". It points to a key strength of The-Dream's songwriting. While we may never have really understood him, it was that yearning to be understood that his music so evocatively conveys: a willingness to risk embarrassment in an effort to convey human emotion through the boldest possible gestures.","The Crown EP does not bring The-Dream back up to the peak of his first three studio albums, but it does remind us, at points, of the key strength of his songwriting—a willingness to risk embarrassment in an effort to convey human emotions through the boldest possible gestures.

Darling Arithmetic,Villagers,by: T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad505e6ef95969321a64/1:1/w_160/4953d00d.jpg,2015-04-13 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20393-darling-arithmetic/,Domino,"""It took a little time to get where I wanted/ It took a little time to get free/ It took a little time to be honest/ It took a little time to be me,"" sings Conor O’Brien on the first track to Villagers’ new album. As opening lines go, it’s hard to get more direct than that. It’s fitting then that the song itself is called ""Courage""—a phenomenon that the Villagers’ frontman describes as ""a feeling like no other, let me tell you."" The song is a kind of pat on the back for O’Brien but also a way of steeling himself to open up and reveal what the album’s remaining songs have yet to say—namely, that romance is the pits no matter who you happen to fall in love with, but romantic love is not nearly as hard as coming to terms with your own mysterious and complicated self. Previous Villagers records—2010’s Becoming a Jackal and 2013’s *{Awayland}—*were much busier affairs, each Mercury Prize nominees in which O’Brien’s grandly orchestral and electronic-infused folk music is supported by a full band and a preponderance of big ideas. Darling Arithmetic, by contrast, is a radically subdued affair—nine mostly acoustic-based tracks that O’Brien recorded at home alone, playing every instrument and mixing the record on his own. It makes sense then that the record is also the most strikingly personal he’s ever made—an emotional missive about love and relationships—in which the notoriously shy Dubliner finally opens up in a more direct way about his own sexuality. Earlier this year O’Brien spoke to the Irish Times about the motivations for his new record by saying, ""It’s not a news story: ‘Man is gay.’ I don’t want that to be the main focus. I wanted the album to be a human love album because everyone in the world feels those emotions at some stage. I really wanted to make sure that anyone who was listening could relate to the songs. I didn’t want to cut anyone off or make it seem as if I was only singing to my younger self."" While O’Brien’s goal of speaking to the universal experience—rather than simply making what could be ostensibly pigeonholed as a specifically ""coming out"" record—is understandable, his lingering reticence leaves some of the material wanting. Tracks like ""Dawning on Me"" and ""No One to Blame"" are undeniably pretty—understated bits of finely distilled yearning—but they suffer from an intentional vagueness, the genderless and pronoun-free lyrics occasionally treading a fine line between charmingly sweet and frustratingly precious (""Excuse me while I die/ A million times before I meet your eyes with mine""). For an album of mostly acoustic singer/songwriter fare released only weeks after Sufjan Stevens’ stunning Carrie & Lowell, the simple loveliness of Darling Arithmetic doesn’t always feel like quite enough. O'Brien is a deft songwriter with a wonderfully emotive voice, but it’s only when his lyrics become more pointed—as they do on ""Little Bigot""—that the record soars. Addressing a sort of of everyman asshole, O’Brien advises his would-be hater by singing that ""It’s okay to be tired/ So take the blame, little bigot/ And throw that hatred onto the fire."" Elsewhere, on ""Hot Scary Summer"", he charmingly recollects a lost love—""Remember kissing on the cobblestone/ In the heat of the night/ And all the pretty young homophobes/ Looking out for a fight""—before getting to the real heart of the matter: ""We got good at pretending/ Then pretending got us good."" For anyone who might have spent years grappling with their own idenity—or logged countless hours loving the one who didn't quite love them back the right way—the song hits every perfect bittersweet note. The need to stop pretending—to admitting one’s deepest insecurities and wants—seems central to Darling Arithmetic, an album that delivers a gorgeous, if somewhat restrained, step forward. It’s a document of quiet, if not necessarily earth-shattering, revelations. ""In the darkness and the light/ I give you every side,"" O’Brien sings at one point, in what seems as much a promise to a lover as to the listener. Regardless of whether or not O’Brien chooses to go further down the troubadour path of working solo or will fall back into a full band scenario, one can only hope that making this record has proven to be a kind of emotional throat-clearing, a way of moving into potentially murkier and possibly even more personal waters. ""How did I get here?/ Am I ever gonna get back?"" he asks on the album-closing ""So Naïve"" as if revealing oneself so fully has stranded him in uncharted territory. That needn’t be a bad thing though. Previous Villagers records too often felt like puzzles—layers of densely-packed metaphors that, when unraveled, didn’t always add up to much. If Darling Arithmetic is the sound of someone dipping their toes into the waters and finding it to their liking, then perhaps the next Villagers record will be the sound of O’Brien diving in headfirst—even more fearlessly himself.","Following two grandly orchestral and electronic-infused folk albums, both Mercury Prize nominees, Villagers' frontman Conor O’Brien offers a radically subdued collection that finds the shy Dubliner opening up in a more direct way about his sexuality.

loloU,Rome FortuneCEEJ,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad65c0084474cd0c16f9/1:1/w_160/a693255e.jpg,2015-04-13 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20406-lolou/,self-released,"Compared to viral successes like iLoveMakonnen and OG Maco, Atlanta-based rapper Rome Fortune has taken a more traditional approach, releasing a handful of tapes that produced a slow-building buzz. Elsewhere in the local scene, occupying a similar musical space, is CEEJ. The sample-heavy local producer is one half of the duo Retro Su$h! and a member of the alt rap collective Two-9, which has been bubbling in the underground scene for the last few years. The latter make trap music with nuance, but CEEJ has always been the most eclectic of the bunch, warping and chopping samples into genre-bending artifacts. As a pair, Rome Fortune and CEEJ are a perfect stylistic marriage unified by similar interests and tendencies. The duo’s latest joint mixtape, loloU, is the sequel to 2012’s LOLO; when comparing the two tapes, it's clear that Fortune has come a long way over three years. He's grown into a dextrous rapper, one no longer restricted by monotonous cadence, with a voice and flow that fit the nooks and crannies of productions across the musical spectrum. And he's moved from trap beats by Dun Deal and Childish Major to more impressionistic productions from Suicideyear and Bassnectar without a hitch—the wider his range gets, the more comfortable he becomes filling the pockets. On loloU, his role is to keep the unchanging CEEJ productions from getting repetitive, but sometimes he ends up drawing attention to himself for the wrong reasons. For every nimble flow there’s a bar like ""like soda, shake it up, I’ll spray it on ya."" At times, CEEJ’s lush, meticulously-selected productions work almost in spite of Fortune—the samples themselves do much of the communicating, and CEEJ is a master at presenting them. Sometimes (""lolo blUez"", ""cocaine fUtUre""), he lays out elements like strips on a spool of film, cutting and pasting them back together at the seams, and sometimes he chops them finely, allowing the ends to bleed into one another. When at his best, CEEJ finds the uninhabited space where genres meet. ""trials and tribUlations"", which draws from Tortured Soul’s ""Fall in Love"", reinterprets the original intro and distorts its vocals into a soulful epilogue. When CEEJ's best overlaps with Fortune's best, you get ""take me away"", a rap ballad in a minor key that features a chorus with some of Makonnen’s richest falsetto. The dark, thundering chords leave space for Fortune's choppy flow to roll through, bridging the gaps. The pair meshes well in other instances, too, like ""blacktop"", where CEEJ and co-producer Kye Ricks flip a sample twice with contrasting tones and the rapper matches each mood. On ""blacktop"", also assisted by Makonnen, Fortune plays the placeholder perfectly, delivering brief verses that are closer to bridges over a gorgeous arrangement that carries most of the weight. ""Chances"", a song about Fortune's willingness to push boundaries, serves as a sort of mission statement: ""Head down, work hard, get your damn crown."" But keeping your head down and being willing to take chances are conflicting ideals, and Fortune sometimes has trouble navigating that gap.","Compared to viral successes like iLoveMakonnen and OG Maco, Atlanta-based rapper Rome Fortune has taken a more traditional approach, releasing a handful of tapes that produced a slow-building buzz.

Know America,Obnox,by: Jes Skolnik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad5d9d034d5c69bf4360/1:1/w_160/50213e8b.jpg,2015-04-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20402-know-america/,Ever/Never,"It’s hard not to be a little bit awed by Cleveland’s veteran underground rock juggernaut Lamont Thomas. Know America is his fifth LP in four years as Obnox (not to mention the bounty of singles he has in his catalog). Hot on the heels of January's excellent Boogalou Reed, Know America prents another stunning collection of blown-out, catchy, soulful garage rock. It is hardly a departure for Thomas, but it also shows growth – with each release Thomas’ stature and legend grows. Lamont has said that Know America is a punk rock concept album about taking over a record station and playing his friends' records, and the album boasts an appropriately joyous, ferocious energy. The pleasure of belonging to a community where your friends are your competition, your inspiration, and your favorite musicians is one of the best things about being part of any kind of DIY music scene, and Know America crackles with that communal glee. Under all the noise, he’s never forgotten the value of hooks or honesty: “Menocause”, the album’s first single, is a gospel-psych plea that rambles through heartache, not seeking salvation or resolution but simply honoring feelings that can’t be shoved down any longer. Contrast that with “Freaky”, a delightful, uncompromisingly sexual trashpile that sounds like the brash punk son of Funkadelic’s noisiest moments. They are part and parcel of the same human experience – desire, longing – and Thomas handles the whole range with a pop songwriter's ease. Thomas has sat in the drummer’s seat for years for Cleveland outfits like Bassholes and This Moment in Black History, and he is also an excellent guitarist who knows when to pull out a short, searing solo and when to lean back. The constant, menacing guitar fuzz that runs throughout, occasionally swelling up and nearly overwhelming a song, is the glue welding together the disparate styles that make up Thomas’ distinct voice. He’s a singer with a lovely tone first made evident by Louder Space, his first record as Obnox in a proper studio, but he still knows how to manipulate and highlight rhythm. “Loudpack”, at the center of the track list, is a monster of a percussive noise track. The goofiest moment on the record – “Hillbilly Intervention”, where Thomas pretends to be an ignorant bumpkin calling into the radio station to protest “Obnox and that whole n****r-ish punk movement” – is also the most serious. There is a  a tendency both within rock subgenre scenes and within criticism to cast rock as by and for white people, an ahistorical erasure Thomas refuses. His blackness is, of course, part of who he is, and he refuses to compromise any aspect of himself. If you somehow haven’t been paying attention to Thomas before this, hopefully Know America will rectify that situation. (If you get a chance to see him live, take it – he puts himself into his performance in a way that is exhilarating, exhausting and always worthwhile.) His music is alive in a way few records are these days – complex, emotional, and political in a way that resists sloganeering and cuts to the quick of what matters.","Know America is Lamont Thomas's fifth LP in four years as Obnox, and it is another stunning collection of blown-out, catchy, soulful garage rock.

Non-Believers,Mac McCaughan,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adbf5e6ef95969321b26/1:1/w_160/e34bca66.jpg,2015-04-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20474-non-believers/,Merge,"This year marks the 20th anniversary of Superchunk’s Here’s Where the Strings Come In, an album that contains no actual strings, but nonetheless found the Chapel Hill indie rockers ready to embrace what they signify: maturation, sophistication, evolution. When Mac McCaughan declared, ""I think I’m hyper enough as it is"" on the album’s opening salvo, the statement functioned as both a readymade bumper-sticker slogan for Superchunk’s patented pogo-pop, and an admission of fatigue, signalling the refinement process that would play out over the band’s subsequent, pre-hiatus discography. Not coincidentally, around the same time, McCaughan promoted his solo project Portastatic from scrappy, sporadic pursuit to an equally prolific going concern, allowing him to not just quiet down, but branch out and explore sounds—easy-listening pop, Tropicalia, jazz, incidental soundtrack music, Prefab Sprout covers—that even a mellowing Superchunk wouldn’t accommodate. Just as Superchunk sat out the 2000s—partly because their Merge Records imprint had transformed from beloved indie label to job-generating local-economy savior—Portastatic would likewise fall silent after 2006’s Be Still Please, its transformation from home-recording free-for-all to dignified, studio-smoothed art-pop outfit seemingly complete. But now that Superchunk have re-emerged this decade with two well-received, return-to-form albums, McCaughan finds himself in the same position as he was 20 years ago—eager to assert his lyrical voice without the risk of being overpowered by his primary band’s guitar roar. But this time, he’s not hiding behind a self-deprecating alias—with Non-Believers, he taps into a deeply personal, wistfully reflective mode of storytelling that demands putting his own name on the marquee for the first time in his 25-year career. This album could have easily been titled Here’s Where the Synths Come In: though McCaughan is no stranger to keyboards, their use here is more dramatically purposeful than the textural shading they provided throughout the Portastatic catalogue, and inextricably intertwined with Non-Believers’ thematic framework. This is an album about growing up in and out of punk, its small-scaled but vigorous sound emblematic of the music’s transition into mechanistic New Wave at the dawn of the '80s (when synths essentially became the punk equivalent of hiring a string section). But while the bright, buzzy, fuzzy tones are redolent of a bygone era when these machines really sounded like the future, McCaughan’s vivid lyrical vignettes ground us in the sobering everyday scenes—as the celestial ballad ""Mystery Flu"" blossoms, he’s pondering ""the stripe of paint on pavement, the seam in cement, an easement to our coming loss"" like someone’s who’s spent far too many late nights on the interstate en route to another $50 gig. Throughout McCaughan’s career, the lines separating his artistic, professional, and personal lives have been routinely blurred, so it’s fitting that the songs on Non-Believers double as pledges of romantic commitment and DIY self-sufficiency: The exultant chorus of ""Only Do""—""there is no try/ there is only do""—is both an invitation to elope and an epitaph-worthy summation of McCaughan’s work ethic. Lyrically, McCaughan’s following in the footsteps of elders who aged gracefully out of punk before him, whether channelling the rich observational detail of the Go-Betweens on the high-school house-party reminiscences of ""Your Hologram"" or the hard-scrabble wisdom of latter-day Paul Westerberg on ""Our Way Free"" (a galloping, gently ascendent anthem that Arcade Fire should really select as their local-hero cover-song tribute the next time they roll through Durham). Like those forebears, McCaughan has a gift for capturing simple, affecting moments without tipping the scales to sentimentality. Even the sleek dream-pop R&B groove and smooth harmony hooks of ""Real Darkness"" are undercut by a despairing account of locked-in-the-bathroom teenage depression; ""family friends and strangers lift your chin and go, ‘smile kid’,"" McCaughan sings, but the ache radiating from his falsetto suggests such well-meaning platitudes only hasten the downward spiral. But as much as Non-Believers mines memories of McCaughan’s formative years—be it the blown-out ghetto-blaster-fetishism of ""Box Batteries"" or the sight of ""an '82 Honda getting its tapes stolen"" on ""Your Hologram""—it’s ultimately a portrait of his current condition, and how all those young-punk passions and problems made him the confident, principled, and industrious man he is today. On the latter song, he says, ""I’ll be down in the basement/ I’ll be winding up wires,"" like an indie-rock lifer who’s got a permanent burn mark above his elbow from decades of spooling guitar cables around his arm at load-out. It’s a line he could’ve written when he was 15—and it sounds just as meaningful and virtuous on the cusp of 50.","After sitting out the start of the 2000s, Superchunk re-emerged this decade with two return-to-form albums.

Drink More Water 5,iLoveMakonnen,by: Jamieson Cox,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adbd5e6ef95969321b21/1:1/w_160/2a8a929d.jpg,2015-04-13 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20473-drink-more-water-5/,self-released,"""Millennial"" is one of those terms whose definition was nebulous even before it reached a supersaturation point in the culture—feel free to file it alongside ""indie"" and ""hipster"" in that regard—but if there’s any one artist who grasps its spirit, it’s Makonnen Sheran, the singer and rapper who records as iLoveMakonnen. His label boss Drake is more successful and more readily meme-able, and there are plenty of rappers who are younger and/or more stereotypically ""youthful,"" but no one can match Makonnen’s omnivorousness, his openness, his sense of possibility. He’s a product of the Internet and incredible tragedy: A witness to the accidental death of his best friend at age 18, he spent seven years bouncing between jail, house arrest, and probationary purgatory. The online world served as a safe haven, a place for therapy and creative expression. He posted songs on Myspace, interviewed musicians and businesspeople on his personal blog, wrote and sang and drew and designed. His probation finally ended in May 2014; three months later, the most popular rapper in the world had hopped onto one of his songs. Perhaps it’s easy for young people to see themselves in Makonnen because many of them grew up spending their nights the same way: devouring every bit of culture in sight whether it’s the Killers’ greatest hits or old episodes of ""Dragon Ball Z"", drowning themselves in tabs they never get around to reading. A few clicks away from some kind of fame, whether it’s 15 minutes on Twitter or a top 15 hit on the Billboard charts: that’s life if you came of age on the Internet, and Makonnen’s no different. That’s not to suggest that ""Tuesday"" was a fluke, or a product of sheer coincidence rather than talent or hard work. It became a hit because of Makonnen’s genial nature, his oddball charisma, and his ability to craft a perfect, simple hook, something that stood out even when he was churning out Bandcamp tapes of basement pop that sounded more like Ariel Pink than anything out of OVO’s shadowy, hyper-lean catalogue. You can hear it in the early versions of songs like ""I Don’t Sell Molly No More"" and ""Whip It"", in arrangements that are raw but ooze melody. Self-produced until 2013, his work took an immediate leap forward when he began working with outside producers on 2014 mixtape Drink More Water 4. Played against strange, vaguely gothic beats with real momentum and heft rather than the plinky, tinny sounds of his keyboard, Makonnen's own strangeness and versatility was amplified: his workmanlike relationship with drugs and alcohol, his wobbly vocal takes, the way he doodles arrhythmically like a kid coloring with the wrong hand. The iLoveMakonnen EP, released later that year (and again, with a slightly adjusted tracklist, a little later still), took that new formula and refined it further. Drink More Water 5 is the first tape he's released since ""Tuesday"" rocketed him to minor fame, and so it's unsurprising that it's starrier and more polished than anything else in the series. But it also serves to illustrate a point you could've made at any point in the last few years: Makonnen songs are inherently risky propositions, destined to become impossibly sticky earworms or blatant failures with no intermediate outcomes in sight. Put another way, he's not interested in hitting singles or doubles: every swing is either a home run or a flagrant, wild strikeout. In ""Tuesday"" and ""I Don't Sell Molly No More""—and his verse on Father's louche breakout single ""Look at Wrist"", a sing-song transmission from another dimension—he managed the former, and DMW5 has a few of its own, particularly the songs that feature other, more conventional rappers. In the same way Makonnen took a step forward when he emerged from his DIY cocoon to work with other producers, he's a powerful complementary force, whether he's singing hooks or delivering verses alongside rappers who are tonally different. On the remixed version of ""Whip It"", he's a welcome burst of color against the hyperkinetic human fireworks of Migos; on ""No Ma'am"" and the remix of his earlier ""Dodging 12"", his melancholy spills over the edges of harder-edged, more aggressive drug rapping. Songs like this are exceptions to the rule on DMW5. Much of the tape's remainder—and the solo Makonnen tracks in particular—are almost tuneless, sketches that are shroomy and distant rather than focused and catchy. Some, like the dewy ""Super Clean"" or ""Other Guys"", sound like they bubbled up from the minds of producers like James Ferraro or Daniel Lopatin c. Replica; others still, like stark confessional ""Get Loose With Me"", are an inch away from the blue, piano-pounding work of Spencer Krug's Moonface. Makonnen is not a particularly skillful singer or lyricist, so these songs are dependent on qualities that are a little more unpredictable or intangible: emotional rawness, amateurish intimacy, a stray line or melodic phrase happening to click into place. Beyond its value as a standalone release, DMW5 invites larger questions about Makonnen's future as a mainstream star and the cap on his commercial potential. He's planning to release his major label debut later this year, and as the first member of OVO to come from outside of Drake's Toronto cabal, there's a lot of hope being placed on his ability to keep cobbling hooks together, like someone taking handfuls of spare parts and building capable sedans out of them. Can he crack down and deliver an album chock-full of heat rocks like ""Tuesday""? It's within the realm of possibility. But it seems much more likely that he'll follow in the footsteps of his greatest influence, the BasedGod: operating from the periphery, prolific and defiant, largely unconcerned with structure or melody or convention, opening doors for contemporaries who are more focused and/or traditionally skilled. (These doors don't have to be musical, either; consider Makonnen's fluid, nuanced response to questions about his sexuality in this New York Times profile.) In the meantime we're left with tapes like this, floating in the ether, being asked to accomplish things their creator doesn't seem all that interested in pursuing.","Drink More Water 5 is the first tape iLoveMakonnen has released since ""Tuesday"" rocketed him to minor fame, and so it's unsurprising that it's starrier and more polished than anything else in the series. He's a powerful complementary force, whether he's singing hooks or delivering verses alongside rappers who are tonally different.

Culture of Volume,East India Youth,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acb4c0084474cd0c15df/1:1/w_160/804835dd.jpg,2015-04-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20286-culture-of-volume/,XL,"William Doyle has an unassuming presence. His voice has a crystalline, choirboy quality, a projection of pure light, and on the cover of Culture of Volume, he's wearing a navy blazer with a tie clip and a tousled haircut; it could be ripped from his prep school yearbook. He performs alone, standing behind a standard setup of MacBooks, samplers and holding a bass guitar. And yet, his East India Youth project has a distinctly intimidating air. Here is an incomplete list of the bulletproof influences he's namedropped for C**ulture of Volume: Brian Eno, Pet Shop Boys, Cluster, Andy Warhol, David Bowie, Yellow Magic Orchestra. The album title is taken from a poem written by Eno collaborator Rick Holland. Music critics started a label for the sole purpose of releasing his first 12” and of course, he was nominated for a Mercury Prize a year later. Coming on the heels of the idea-packed but unfocused Total Strife Forever, Culture of Volume is poised for a presumable ""pop"" breakout, but it still comes off as an academic pursuit, a veritable thesis on the legends of avant-garde art-pop. Culture of Volume doesn't just want to impress you; it wants you to behold it with chin-stroking, head-nodding awe. At times this is the only pose even Doyle can muster towards his work. In the credits, he refers to the making of Culture of Volume as The Process and the first vocal track details the process of creating The Process. ""The end result is not what was in mind/ The end result is always hard to find,"" Doyle sings during ""End Result"", treating inspiration like a forensics expert. It’s preceded by a lengthy Station to Station homage of daunting electronic noise called ""The Juddering"". The guy likes definitive articles. And so Culture of Volume presents itself as a record of Big Ideas and Big Statements and it sure as hell sounds big. ""Beaming White"" is the third track here, and that title about sums up the production's hyperclarity. Every drum pattern, every synth pad, every orchestral frill is a tool used to build gleaming edifices to house his spotless vocals. It sounds fantastic, which is to be expected of a record mixed by Graham Sutton. The Bark Psychosis frontman has also worked with These New Puritans and British Sea Power and very few others; he’s not getting involved if the artist doesn’t aspire for a certain museum-ready quality. But those bands also understand the idea of art as entertainment; they’re showmen, whereas Doyle is a curator. ""Don’t Look Backwards"" toys with the idea of Balearic, but it's a picture of Ibiza without the partygoers, presenting a ""vague horizon set ablaze."" To convey a heightened emotional state, Doyle will say, ""At the point of passion/ I am inflamed""; it’s a rather chilly way of saying you’ve got the hots for someone. ""Entirety"" and ""Hearts That Never"" are futuristic electro-pop for dance clubs that always meet sanitation codes. And even if they are highbrow pop songs, they’re still pop songs all the same—Doyle needs to sell them. He could one day evolve into a Patrick Wolf or Owen Pallett-style auteur, but he currently lacks their capacity for theatrics, for personal revelation, for a vocal mode that conveys something other than bathos, for melodies that actually pop. If he’s going to try for a show-stopping, six-minute ballad, like he does on ""Carousel"", there has to be a show to stop in the first place; here, ""Carousel"" is a confession to an empty arena. The same applies to ""A Manner of Words""; Doyle asks, ""Turn this dull roar down"", and then the song goes on to serve as the record's 10-minute anticlimax. For a record so bent on impressing the listener, Culture of Volume somehow never manages to leave a mark.","Coming on the heels of the idea-packed but unfocused Total Strife Forever, Culture of Volume is poised for a presumable ""pop"" breakout, but it still comes off as an academic pursuit, a veritable thesis on the legends of avant-garde art-pop. Culture of Volume doesn't just want to impress you; it wants you to behold it with chin-stroking, head-nodding awe.

Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart,Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad0e9d034d5c69bf42d6/1:1/w_160/3f96ba98.jpg,2015-04-10 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20348-suuns-and-jerusalem-in-my-heart/,Secretly Canadian,"Judging from their respective recorded output to date, Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart don’t seem to share anything beyond Montreal postal codes. The former is an archetypal indie rock band—four white guys in standard guitar/bass/synth/drums formation, belonging to a distinctly Western tradition of dystopian art-punk. The latter is the multimedia recording project of Radwan Ghazi Moumneh, a producer of Lebanese descent refracting traditional Middle Eastern music through a modernist, avant-garde lens (right down to the numerically dense song titles that reflect Arabic text-speak for sounds not represented by English characters). Suuns release albums through populist indie labels like Secret City (in Canada) and Secretly Canadian (in the United States) and have reached the ""what the fuck, we’ll do a Nike commercial"" stage of their careers. Moumneh records for the defiantly non-conformist Constellation label, and works as a sound engineer, producer and co-owner at the Godspeed-affiliated Hotel2Tango studio. Suuns thrive on structural linearity and rhythmic precision; Jerusalem in My Heart demonstrates what you can do when you completely disavow both. But for a city of millions of people, Montreal is a small town when it comes to Anglophone musicians with experimental leanings, and in the case of Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart, there exists not just a mutual-admiration society but a full-blown recording collaboration. The seven pieces on their jointly billed eponymous debut were actually recorded during a week-long session back in November 2012, but put on the backburner as both principals prepped their respective 2013 albums (Suuns’ Images Du Futur and Jerusalem in My Heart’s debut, Mo7it Al-Mo7it). However, the extended gestation period between conception and delivery proves immaterial, because Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart sounds very little like the music either was making on their own at the time of its recording. The album’s success is contingent on the very fact that it never feels like a forced collision of two opposing musical approaches, but rather a natural cultivation of a shared underlying philosophy. What Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart ultimately do have in common is a desired end goal of transcendence—the former’s two albums to date attempt it through lock-step grooves, synth-throbbed hypnosis, and Ben Shemie’s smeared vocalese; on Mo7it Al-Mo7it, the latter opted for free-form acoustic meditations, analog-electronic oscillations, and equilibrium-upsetting chants. On Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart, the collaborators unite Western rock convention with their ancient old-world antecedents: The appropriately clanging instrumental ""Metal"" plays like a call-and-response between a distorted Arabic melody—a distant echo of the Syrian wedding-singer boombox bootlegs that are foundational to the JIMH sound—and a mimicking fuzz-toned guitar that effectively turns it into a '60s surf riff. The glitchy and twitchy ""Seif"" relocates Panda Bear to Beirut; the exhilarating closer ""3attam Babey"" hits pause on its whirring, motorik, synth-punk drive to accommodate Moumneh’s meditative vocal breaks, before an extended outro fuses them into the same third-eye-prying frequency. Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart does leave you wondering what more the two entities could have accomplished had they worked on this for more than a week: the ominously intensifying clatter of ""Gazelles in Flight"" fades out just as the track seems ready to truly take off, while the incongruously off-the-cuff lullaby ""Leyla"" feels like a rough Suuns song sketch that lacks any of the collaborative frisson heard elsewhere on the record. But for both parties, the benefits of this recording experiment are obvious: For Suuns, it’s an opportunity to break out of their hermetic aesthetic and explore more open-ended modes of composition; for Moumneh, it’s a chance to forsake meticulously crafted soundscapes to indulge his love of raw punk and thumping techno. And whether they’re channeling the serene spirit of '70s krautrock or the corrosive croon of a Damascus busker, the implicit message is the same: for these two, there’s no place like drone.","The art-punk band Suuns and Radwan Ghazi Moumneh's Godspeed-affiliated multimedia recording project Jerusalem in My Heart don’t seem to share anything beyond Montreal postal codes. On this collaborative album it's clear that what they have in common is a desired end goal of transcendence.

Solo,Nils Frahm,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adbbc0084474cd0c178f/1:1/w_160/dc28abce.jpg,2015-04-10 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20471-solo/,Erased Tapes,"For many music obsessives, a first close listen to Erik Satie’s Trois Gymnopédies changes everything. The French composer’s three 19th-century piano works serve as an introduction to one kind of minimalism—maximum emotion created with the fewest ingredients—and they show what can happen when you have the right note in the right place at the right time. The formal elegance of the pieces, along with the underlying sense of yearning and clear surface beauty, have made them a natural fit for advertising and film, and the Gymnopédies long ago became ubiquitous, their structure a sort of auditory cliché. But even with the overexposure, the power of Satie’s pieces are still there inside of us, guiding how we respond to simple piano music that leaves a lot of space. Whenever contemporary composers—from Chilly Gonzales to Eluvium to Jandek to Grouper to Aphex Twin—use a piano in this way, they tap into these buried associations. German composer and producer Nils Frahm’s most recent full-length, his fine 2013 album Spaces, featured plenty of piano but found him putting the instrument into a number of different contexts and adding electronics (the set also included live tracks). But among the earliest works of his career were two albums of solo piano work, and he returns here with a third, an album he gave away free on Twitter two weeks ago. Solo is almost exactly what you might expect from a record like this one; it’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough. Sometimes solo piano albums can get too sentimental, and can begin to sound like bad TV cues; sometimes they can be a little dry and academic, and can come over like an instrumental exercise. This one mostly fits into ""just right"" territory, balancing general loveliness with space and suggestion. Frahm's piano is creaky and there's a percussive tone coursing through some of these tracks, an extra ""pling"" that marks time with every keystroke. That extra texture gives a piece like ""Merry"" a tiny bit of grit to offset a gorgeous melody that might otherwise be overbearing, and gives the more downcast ""Some"" an extra ounce of dark weight. During its best moments Solo brings to mind some of the lower-stakes work of Harold Budd, where melody and mood become two sides of the same coin. The album’s second half finds Frahm playing more with form, but oddly the variety, rather than being welcome, actually breaks the spell of the album’s first half. ""Wall"" is a loud, pulsing piece that is interesting enough on its own but derails the album’s gentle mood, while ""Immerse!"" leans toward meandering abstraction, foregoing melody and in no way justifying its almost 11-minute length. Still, for a free album that sounds very nice in a room, Solo mostly delivers, tapping into that very specific identification with the solo piano as an expression of wistful sadness.","Nils Frahm released a record of solo piano music for free recently, and it is almost exactly what you might expect from a record like this one; it’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty.

Pilot Talk III,Curren$y,by: Julian Kimble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adb4b1335d7bf1699c4d/1:1/w_160/890e087e.jpg,2015-04-10 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20466-pilot-talk-iii/,Jet Life,"Curren$y is such a niche artist that he can seemingly vanish into the air like the weed smoke he so lovingly describes even when he's still active. The New Orleans native tours regularly and continues to release quality projects like last year’s The Drive In Theater, 2013’s New Jet City, and 2011’s Alchemist joint-effort, Covert Coup, but hasn’t been able to duplicate the bite of his 2010 breakthroughs, Pilot Talk and Pilot Talk II. News of the third installation’s arrival sparked more interest than he'd enjoyed in awhile, as those outside of his core fanbase were curious to see if the next volume would do the series justice. Curren$y is a bit of a cinephile, and treats each individual work like a grand production; it’s evident in the titles of his projects (see his 2012 tribute, Priest Andretti), and Pilot Talk III begins with ""Opening Credits"", where he strolls over an authoritative soul sample like Max Julien in The Mack. For just over two minutes, he reflects on his career’s trajectory: ""It was right around the time/ I thought I’d have to move back with my mom/ I had to sell my first low-rider/ Halfway to the top went to sleep, woke up at the bottom."" The hopscotch path Curren$y has taken to success (from No Limit, to Cash Money, to independent juggernaut) is well-documented, but he rarely deviates from his cool-guy persona to reflect on his struggles. Curren$y remains as irreverent as always, but he sounds more focused on Pilot Talk III than he has in awhile. The ominous ""Cargo Planes"", produced by Joey Fatts, sounds like the opening of a cinematic crime saga, but in this case it's a typical Spitta infraction: the theft of someone else’s girlfriend. ""Never displaying affection when we out in public/ 'Cause mufuckas lookin', and shit could get ugly/ So walk right past me homegirl, and don’t say nothin'"" he advises a female acquaintance. On ""Froze"", eccentric jester RiFF RAFF appears like the ghastly clown from Spawn to exchange swank over Harry Fraud’s slow-burn production, and Curren$y keeps his cool. Although Spitta's range is limited, it’s never been a disadvantage; he’s a purveyor of lifestyle rap. His song titles, often named after random, inanimate objects or people (in the past we've gotten ""Chandelier"", ""Breakfast"", and ""Scottie Pippen"", and here we have ""Pot Jar,"" ""Briefcase"", ""Lemonade Mimosas"") testify his ability to find something worthy of appreciation in the seemingly ordinary. On ""Long as the Lord Say"", he sketches familiar imagery: ""Plottin’ like always/ Marble floor hallways/ Smoked out all day/ Tryin’ to get more paid."" His lyrics are like an ad from a men’s magazine targeting the 18 to 25 age demographic in real time. Because Curren$y himself is a control variable, production typically influences the quality of his output. Ski Beatz, who produced the bulk of the original Pilot Talk and its sequel, has left his imprint on everything from Jay Z’s Reasonable Doubt to Camp Lo’s Uptown Saturday Night. Noticeably absent from Curren$y’s discography following Pilot Talk II, it’s Ski's presence that makes Pilot Talk III so strong. The shimmering crash of the cymbals and pop of the drums on ""Alert"" are vintage Ski and very welcome. Curren$y may not do ""new,"" but he is very good at what he does: riffing on cars, money, women, weed, and obscure moments from television shows. It’s difficult for the third version of something to truly reign supreme, especially when there’s little variation differentiating them. ""Audio Dope 5"" is solid, but nowhere near as experimental as the intoxicated stumble of ""Audio Dope II"". Regardless, Curren$y’s sharp wit, the smooth chop of the Sylvers’ ""How Love Hurts"" heard on ""All I Know"", and the return of Ski make Pilot Talk III more than worth it. He's never bad company, even if you forget he's there from time to time.","Curren$y has continued to release quality projects, but the announcement of his third installment in the beloved Pilot Talk series stirred renewed interest.

The Best of the Best Show,Scharpling & Wurster,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ac459d034d5c69bf4171/1:1/w_160/967f2675.jpg,2015-04-10 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20203-scharpling-and-wurster-the-best-of-the-best-show/,Numero Group,"Newbridge, the fictional New Jersey suburb invented by Tom Scharpling and Jon Wurster, is a town run on hubris and populated by people who either don't know or refuse to believe that they're deluded failures. That blend of reliable comedy tropes can drive inspiration for a long time, and when Tom Scharpling announced in 2013 that ""The Best Show on WFMU"" was coming to an end, the general consensus was that it was going out on top. Scharpling's alternately cranky and enthusiastic rapport with his callers and the inspired regular-Joe insight of the monologues woven in with them demonstrated his mastery of the radio comedy format, while the extended bits Scharpling did with Superchunk drummer and top-flight weirdo Jon Wurster made it the stuff of legend. This was the kind of phenomenon that sustained a more-or-less-weekly show over 12-plus years, which means their ""greatest hits"" collection is a sixteen-disc, 20-plus hour box set—with a bonus USB stick that includes another 4 ¾-hours' worth of material—that still could be described as ""scraping the surface."" That's a lot of mileage to get out of just two people, though the trick is that these people actually represent multitudes. Wurster's weirdly sympathetic call-in characters, co-created and co-written with Scharpling, are exercises in gradual-reveal lunacy that ramp up a conversation until both Scharpling and the listener are left repeating Wurster's ludicrous claims (""you are two inches tall"") and malaprops (""laser beans"") with a bewildered disbelief. Over the course of a call that can stretch past the 20- or 30-minute mark, a friendly conversation mutates into a series of escalating threats, an arrogant display of untouchability that eventually crumbles to reveal the hapless loser beneath, or, as the origin-point ""Rock, Rot & Rule"" perfectly revealed, a self-proclaimed expert revealing just how arbitrary and flimsy his knowledge really is. It's comedy that breaks down just how funny it can be to hear somebody with way too much self-confidence obliviously dig his own grave. It's a cult phenomenon, but nothing about The Best of the Best Show feels closed off or for-fans-only, even given an overstuffed deluxe-package treatment that feels aimed directly at the diehards. The diehards might even find an excuse or two to gripe about omissions (where's ""The Chippert Report"" and its daring exposé of Davenport, Iowa's ""toilet rock"" scene?), but what's included is definitive and varied enough to draw in both entry-level listeners and longtime fans who snapped up all their previous collections on Stereolaffs. Of course there are usual suspects and recurring characters. New Jersey-defaming hoagie enthusiast Philly Boy Roy details his family's felonious Memorial Day exploits, battles post-Eagles playoff loss depression, and gets his wife to call in to reveal just how obsessed he is with Scharpling. The aimless, low-energy Pudge gets a few laughs as the call-in regular who has literally nothing to say short of ""I'unno."" And even with his central conceit basically being ""hippie Deadhead who takes bong rips mid-call,"" Wurster's giggly, wheezy-falsetto performances as Bryce and his rapport with the aggravated-yet patient Scharpling elevate a concept that other comedy acts would make into a one-dimensional caricature. Couple these regulars with a few of the show's most notorious calls, including the first appearance by Fonzie inspiration/violent elderly sociopath Roland ""The Gorch"" Gorchnik and the introduction of splatter-flick auteur Trent L. Strauss (famed for The Tool Belt Killer, The Hacksawist, and Art School Arson), and you've got a strong cross-section of what makes the ""Best Show"" canon so beloved. When Wurster gathers more than a dozen of his most popular characters together in an hour-and-a-half panel discussion for Newbridge's highest office during 2008's ""Mayubinatorial Debate"", hearing him inhabit all these different characters in close quarters—Roy, Pudge, monstrously obese barbershop singer Zachary Brimstead, legendary drummer/erotic fiction author Marky Ramone—is pretty astounding. It's worldbuilding of a kind you don't often get from two people in any medium—and they did it pretty much pro bono. A lot of Scharpling and Wurster's appeal rides on a certain sort of deep-knowledge obsession with the absurd minutiae of popular music and the people that take it extra-seriously. ""Rock, Rot & Rule"" came in the middle of one of Scharpling's pre-""Best Show"" airings and provoked angry fans to call in to object to the rankings of Wurster's know-it-some musicologist Ronald Thomas Clontle. Wannabe rock stars who have unrealistic dreams of making it (""Count Rockula"", whose own box-set vision is trashed by notable music website shovel.com) share space with rock stars who have unrealistic ideas of what ""making it"" entitles them to (Wurster's version of Gene Simmons has a grand old time arrogantly auditioning the actual, in-studio Ted Leo and Carl Newman to be replacement members of KISS). The ""Best Show"" fandom in indie rock is well-documented, and has roped in everyone from Michael Azerrad (briefly interrogated by Wurster on the air as to why Wire Train weren't included in Our Band Could Be Your Life) to Damian Abraham (who became an evangelical enthusiast of the show and broke the ice on tour with Kurt Vile by swapping Philly Boy Roy anecdotes). You get a ridiculous amount of stuff with this box set, sure: all that audio content, plus a book featuring some great essays by the aforementioned Abraham, comedian Julie Klausner, and call screener A.P. Mike, an extensive interview on the show's origins and developments with Jake Fogelnest, photos of archival material (including crib sheets Wurster used for some of the calls); and illustrations by longtime show-associated cartoonists Neil Numberman and Casey Burns. But what you're really buying, whether you're new to the world of Scharpling and Wurster or a Friend of Tom from back in the day, is an acknowledgement of a hard-won, rightly-earned cult. It's an in-group that always has more room for anyone willing to forge a deep connection with the town that's comin' to get ya. And it can't be stopped—even Scharpling's 2013 farewell turned out to be a hiatus instead, and ""The Best Show"" continues to this day as an Internet show delving deep into the one of the biggest, strangest, best worlds in comedy. There's more—way more—where this box set came from, and this collection is a prime reminder of why we're lucky that it's not slowing down anytime soon.","""The Best Show on WFMU"" is a cult phenomenon, but nothing about The Best of the Best Show feels closed off or for-fans-only, even given an overstuffed deluxe-package treatment that feels aimed directly at the diehards.

Glitterbug,The Wombats,by: Pat Healy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad09ea9e61561daa6048/1:1/w_160/fb8f372d.jpg,2015-04-09 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20345-glitterbug/,Bright Antenna,"When the Wombats first suggested ""Let’s Dance to Joy Division"" on A Guide to Love, Loss & Desperation, their 2007 debut, they came on strong with a blend of jumpy indie rock and lovable goof personas. Their follow-up, 2011’s This Modern Glitch, followed suit. But in the four years between their second and third albums, the sweet silliness has dissipated. With Glitterbug, the Wombats have repositioned themselves as more pained, serious characters, longing to get away from the life of excessive parties and settle into a meaningful relationship. At their worst, they degenerate into sleaze, delivering lines like ""There‘s no greater sight than you in your underwear removing mine."" Many of the synth-tinged songs on Glitterbug would sound right at home on a John Hughes soundtrack, and the album itself plays like a rom-com concept album, chronicling singer and guitarist Matthew Murphy’s long-distance romantic relationship with a girl he began dating in L.A. while he was still based in London (""My head is aching in GMT,"" he sings in a polite Robert Smith-style pout on ""Give Me a Try""). It’s ironic that a band whose singer once sang ""if this is a rom-com, kill the director"" would be putting forth something like this. But there’s more drama here than in previous works: Maybe Murphy is killing the director himself. The number of drug references within the lyrics would seem like teenage exaggeration were it not for Murphy’s matter-of-fact delivery. There’s no ""The Wombats Proudly Present"" as a subtitle to Glitterbug, as there was for the first two releases. Perhaps because the Wombats as you knew them aren’t present, and they don’t always seem proud. Glitterbug mostly seems like it was born of a frustration of not having made it in the States yet. The defining moment of the album comes when all the instruments drop out of ""Give Me a Try"" and Murphy proclaims, ""We could be gigantic!"" If you asked him, he'd probably say it was the girl in L.A., but he seems to also be not-so-covertly courting potential American fans. You can hear the same beseeching subtext in the single, ""Your Body Is a Weapon"", where Murphy sings ""Is it such fantasy that I should think someone like you could love a creep like me?"" And the Wombats are seemingly pulling out all the stops to be gigantic. Instead of using a number of producers, as they did with their previous two releases, the Wombats recorded most of the tracks at the studio of Mark Crew, who can be credited with fast-tracking Bastille into U.S. arenas. And as with Bastille and other short-haired Euro rockers like Coldplay, Keane and Snow Patrol, there’s a very palatable poppy sheen on all of these tracks: Glitterbug is packed with anthemic hooks and synth pulses that sound like they were composed solely to lure Lexus. But what sets the Wombats apart from those acts is the lechery and squalor just beneath the surface. And when a car company inevitably co-opts one of the songs for a commercial, those in the know can quietly laugh at the wild disconnect with the subject matter.","On their first two albums, the Wombats offered a blend of jumpy indie rock and lovable goof personas, but on their latest, Glitterbug, the sweet silliness has dissipated.

The Air Conditioned Nightmare,Doldrums,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad25b1335d7bf1699b57/1:1/w_160/33759bb6.jpg,2015-04-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20363-the-air-conditioned-nightmare/,Sub Pop,"Airick Woodhead has been in the right place at the right time more than once. The son of Canadian folk artist David Woodhead, he grew up surrounded by live music and studio equipment, and discovered production while tweaking his father's tracks into a noisy mess. As a teenager, he ambled around Europe and was invited to live at Toronto DIY space House of Everlasting Super Joy, which eventually brought him into the famed Montreal scene responsible for birthing Purity Ring, Grimes, Majical Cloudz, Blue Hawaii, Arbutus Records, et al. Hell, Woodhead's first song released as Doldrums was an official remix for Portishead, an obvious and important inspiration to the '90s baby's synthy, sample-based avant-pop. It all reads like a young, independent artist's fantasy, and a more advantageous backdrop for Doldrums' first LP couldn't be dreamed up. Lesser Evil made good on that promise in 2013, revealing that Woodhead's frenzied melodic sensibilities and nasally squeak could transcend the cresting wave of Merriweather Post Pavilion devotees. Lesser Evil was also fortunate enough to be wedged between the ascending stars of Grimes' Visions and Majical Cloudz's Impersonator: It was a good time to be an arty millennial with a laptop, and better still to be an information-hungry sound collagist with a distinctive voice. But where Visions embraced fluttering digitalia and Impersonator took a more direct, humanist approach, Doldrums' first LP burrowed into the uncanny valley, forging its identity from the schizophrenic clutter of online media and the hallucinatory states readily available in everyday life. Sleep, lucid dreaming, technology, ancient mysticism, prescription drugs, obscure YouTube clips, popular music, obsession, anxiety, love, death—Lesser Evil somehow made it all fit inside a puzzling logic that was more intriguing for its inscrutable delirium. So it makes sense that Woodhead would continue his train of thought on album two, The Air Conditioned Nightmare. But if Lesser Evil took a macro view of that mania through a greased fisheye lens, then Nightmare examines it with a magnifying glass under harsh fluorescent light. And that can be just as unflattering as it sounds. The elements and production methods haven't been replaced so much as they've been reassessed and recalibrated. No longer is Woodhead's Yorke-ian tenor awash in whirlpools of clipped audio and choppy beat fragments; now the underlying synths have taken a forceful lead next to polished and pronounced drum machines. Doldrums has effectively cleaned up his act, and in the process he's rendered his music's least remarkable parts the loudest and most integral. A bonkers track like ""HOTFOOT"", or the elegiac splendor of ""Funeral for Lightning"", works best in this new setting, largely because the energy and songwriting are powerful enough to wheedle some emotional magic out of the machines. More often than not, though, Nightmare buries the details in favor of a generic synth hook or noodly freakout. The saccharine bassline in ""Loops"", itself a trite tale of feuding lovers, seems to be gunning for a 2008 Urban Outfitters compilation—that is, when the song doesn't digress into a beatless murk of pitchy vocals and awkward sample juggling. On ""Industry City"", Doldrums attempts to balance aggressive electro, slippery machine funk, aerial singalongs, and noisy rave approximations. It might go over well at a midday festival performance, but on record it sounds like tracklist filler. There are good ideas somewhere inside The Air Conditioned Nightmare, and anyone determined enough to look might get something out of them. Lyrics ranging from naively clichéd to slyly astute—often within the same verse—sketch a rough picture of Woodhead coming to grips with routine, non-transitory life. He fears the impending threat of mundane domestic relationships (""Blown Away""), condemns technological dependence (""My Friend Simjen"", ""Industry City""), illustrates the throes of romance (""We Awake"", ""Loops""), and ponders the loss of art and artists (""Funeral for Lightning""). The themes here are vaguely linked to a collection of Henry Miller essays on America's growing disconnection from nature and mankind, but no one would fault you for not catching any similarities outside of their shared title. Not even the singer himself can find a clear through line for his scattered coming-of-age musings. Some might call it simply ""growing up."" Of all the songs, ""Video Hostage"" is the most significant. It also happens to be Nightmare's unrivaled highlight. Over a rhythmic sample set that billows and sways like something off Oneohtrix Point Never's Replica, Woodhead waxes analytical while in a trauma-induced existential trance. He's said it's loosely about desensitization, but the song also touches on questions of personal background, identity, artistic motivation, and nature. Woodhead seems to shed the world around him, examining finer aspects of his inner self. He's looking for the devil in the details, so to speak, and the music's effortless, unassuming composition mirrors his effort. You could say it's a rare sign of growth on the capricious Nightmare, but maybe it's just Doldrums finding himself right where he needs to be.","Airick Woodhead's first LP as Doldrums forged its identity from the schizophrenic clutter of online media and the hallucinatory states readily available in everyday life. His second cleans up the sound and focuses on a rough picture of Woodhead coming to grips with routine, non-transitory life. Some might call it ""growing up.""

No Pier Pressure,Brian Wilson,by: Stacey Anderson,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad2c13d1975652139ec3/1:1/w_160/7517d231.png,2015-04-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20367-brian-wilson-no-pier-pressure/,Capitol,"It’s very possible that we’ve heard the last of Brian Wilson. Not because the opulent pop of the Beach Boys, or his rich and tortured personal mythology, are showing any fade in ubiquity—a movie about both, with Paul Dano and John Cusack playing younger and current-day versions of him, respectively, comes out this summer—but because the man himself is speaking bluntly of his possible retirement from music this year. So for anyone who grew up with a reverence for Wilson’s brilliant work—which, especially if you’re from California, can veer into a fanatic sort of transposed paternal empathy—his new and eleventh solo album No Pier Pressure carries the burden of serving as his gold watch. Yet the record largely cedes the floor to duets with trendy young singers (Kacey Musgraves, Nate Ruess of fun., Zooey Deschanel, all audibly rhapsodic), a foreign and not entirely flattering experiment for Wilson. The album’s clearest predecessor is Santana’s Supernatural (1999), from which sprang the malevolent radio hydra ""Smooth"", and other forays into May-September duet hinterland. (There’s been an upswing of the latter in the past year, from Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga fluttering their jazz hands all hither and thither to Barry Manilow’s gauche, grave-digging extreme of shoving his voice into dusty audio of Whitney Houston and Marilyn Monroe.) Unlike Carlos Santana, though, who could just wedge in a noodling guitar break and shuffle back to his inexplicable stiletto empire, Wilson’s chipper duets never reach equilibrium. Either his presence feels underutilized—the syrupy ""On the Island"" with She & Him, in which his vocals are scant—or the guests feel shoehorned into musty production that undermines their own charisma. It’s apparent throughout that this album was originally intended as a reunited Beach Boys effort, as their songwriting staples are faithfully represented: the orchestrations are lush and swooning, the lyrics set in beatific seaside tableaus and brimming with sepia wistfulness. Wilson sounds most confident with his former band cohorts; several tracks feature amiable turns from Al Jardine and David Marks. Of the whippersnapper duets, Wilson’s coziest harmonizing with Ruess, whose high, earnest keening could’ve been plucked from the Beach Boys’ Sunflower era. In listening to No Pier Pressure, uneasy questions rise about base motives. Wilson freely admits that he doesn’t listen to modern music, and was so surprised to hear Frank Ocean rap that he dismissed him from the album. That likely means that these duet artists were pitched to him for the project, with the hopes that some of those younger fanbases would follow along. It’s a pretty farfetched expectation: are Zooey Deschanel’s fans now really going to stampede en masse to the nearest Urban Outfitters and demand Orange Crate Art? But to speculate this project was foisted whole on Wilson would infantilize him, a casual disservice done all too readily in the press (what other 72-year-old Grammy winner’s collaborations would prompt the caveat ""whether he’s aware of it or not,"" despite his ability to still deliver an incisive interview?). And there’s a warm timbre to all these artists’ voices that could surely appeal to Wilson. Whatever the cause, this is new territory for him: He’s sat in with young bucks here and there (Mini Mansions, Emile Haynie, the adulatory Brian Fest concert last month in Los Angeles) but he’s never been gregarious with his own material. His most recent album collaborators have been old friends returned to the fold, from a reunion with Smile lyricist Van Dyke Parks to the global Beach Boys reunion of 2012. There’s a happy accident in disunion, though: the closing track ""The Last Song"", which was originally intended for Lana Del Rey before she sulked off into the sunset. It’s the autonomous note Wilson deserves to end on, a lovely, bittersweet swath of the elegiac strings and gilded harmonies he perfected in his youth with ""The Warmth of the Sun"" and ""Caroline, No"". Wilson sighs, ""Don’t be sad/ There was a time and place for what we had/ If there was just another chance for me to sing to you."" It’s a worthy, prideful summation of a gorgeous life’s work, both innocent and wizened at once. And he didn’t need any young blood to get there.","Brian Wilson has spoken bluntly about his retirement, which means his new solo album No Pier Pressure may be his last. It largely cedes the floor to duets with young singers like Kacey Musgraves, Nate Ruess of fun., and Zooey Deschanel, a foreign and not entirely flattering experiment for Wilson.

All Are Saved,Fred Thomas,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad1c13d1975652139ea9/1:1/w_160/8a8c51f9.jpg,2015-04-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20357-all-are-saved/,Polyvinyl,"Talk to anyone who’s seen an indie rock show in Michigan during the 21st century and you’ll probably get a Fred Thomas story within the first thirty minutes or so. Maybe it was the time their band played with one of Thomas' 156 (give or take) musical projects at a warehouse in Ypsilanti. Or maybe they crossed paths at a demonstration in Detroit. To quote a colleague, ""Fred Thomas is always standing right behind you at a basement show in Ann Arbor."" Which is to say that Thomas is a ""lifer"", that mainstay of the local scene usually viewed with some combination of admiration and concern. Their commitment is cool even if they’re pushing 40 and clearly not in it for the money, but what are their alternatives? Do they have any marketable job skills? Thomas' most well-known project, the lo-fi throwback pop troupe Saturday Looks Good to Me, developed a cult following, but was always on the verge of a mainstream-indie breakthrough that never happened. He's also released eight albums under his own name, but All Are Saved is the first to see widespread release. From the sound of things, Fred Thomas would be at peace if it was his last. It's in the tradition of a very specific kind of record, including Father John Misty’s Fear Fun, Sun Kil Moon’s Among the Leaves and the Wrens’ The Meadowlands—artists reinventing themselves as their actual self, lifers tired of watching their life pass by, tired of public indifference. With nothing to lose, Thomas ditches any pretense of metaphor to speak on every embarrassment and sleep-depriving doubt. And the results are devastating and funny in ways that previous releases barely even considered, a biographical work of art capable of leveling people who have never heard of Fred Thomas until the previous paragraph. This is a record of epiphany, but there are no easy resolutions and false triumph. Despite its title, All Are Saved does not wrestle with mortality and arise with The Truth About What it All Means. It does not glorify the preciousness of our short existence. Most of it is derived from the realization that life, as it’s keenly described on ""Cops Don’t Care Pt. II"", ""is so incredibly long/ Like a kiss on a bridge between two nervous ass kids/ Terrified of doing everything wrong."" The image of teenage lip-locking pops up on two different songs: on ""When They Built the Schools"", Thomas recognizes the ""jelly legs and awkward elbows"" of first-timers who have no time for the ""burden of nostalgia"" that clings to him like a wetsuit and essentially translates to ""regret"". Most of the memories Thomas processes on All Are Saved aren’t even good ones, and yet they’re revived with piercing clarity—drunkenly smashing his flip phone in a Baltimore basement in 2003; watching a girl get embarrassed by her dad’s use of slang on an airplane; the role reversal of going to a free dental clinic and having his dentist turn out to be a drummer he produced eight years ago. These are the types of situations that fill up an impossibly long life, so when Thomas opens the album asking his dog in its dying days whether trading 13 years of ""walking in a clear straight line"" for a human’s eight potential decades of fumbling is a ""shitty deal"", well... the answer is obvious, right? The album at least sounds uplifting, adding layer after layer while Thomas spins desperately in place. The aesthetic reflects the two cities in which this album was created, honoring Athens' indie rock lineage by its Elephant 6-style thrift shop orchestration. If you’ve followed Thomas over the past two decades, this is a culminating work: the contrast of peppy horn blasts and foul-mouthed misanthropy on ""Expo '87"" recall Saturday Looks Good to Me; the spindly arpeggios of ""When They Built the Schools"" nod towards his emo-ish offshoot Lovesick; and the aquatic gurgling and electronic interludes make a case for reappreciation of his Type Records outlier City Center (namechecked in ""Unfading Flower""). But otherwise, this is an idiosyncratic ""singer-songwriter"" record, filled with surprises and unorthodox percussion choices—a soupy tabla sample on ""Unfading Flower"", an erratic pound of a floor tom guiding the drunken amble of ""When They Built the Schools"". Vocally, Thomas largely abandons conventional song structure and melodies, taking on a quasi spoken-word approach that allows him the maximum word count and lends a sarcastic edge to his sly note on""Bedbugs"": ""If I seem too entertaining, I’m not singing, I’m just talking to you."" The most entertaining songs on All Are Saved are generally the cruelest: Both ""Bedbugs"" and ""Bad Blood"" speak in a language simultaneously more truthful and cutting than most of us allow ourselves. These rambling, bilious one-sided conversations might be mislabeled as ""rants""; more accurately, they’re the kind of righteously angry emails you spend all night honing to a fine point, and then sleep on, waking up relieved you never hit ""Send."" Thomas provides us vicarious catharsis, but during the toxic airing of grievances of ""Bedbugs"", he makes the risks of such an approach perfectly clear—""You can’t tell everybody to fuck off forever.../ And be mortified when they finally do."" Thomas trudges through difficult relationships like most of us, being ""so stilted and silent, not awkward, just angry."" That’s how he describes his presumable run-in with a more successful artist on ""Bad Blood"", whose music he likens to ""a pile of brown sweaters."" All at once, he wishes he could go beyond their brief exchange and express his envy and resentments, that it could be Thomas on TV in 2015 had things worked out just a little bit differently for Saturday Looks Good to Me. Instead, he blasts through the fourth wall, summarizing the futility of his past decade with a gut punch—""This ‘first day of school’ shit just seems to keep happening...the smiles are so big and there’s no one at the gig."" The most painful lines are Thomas quoting other people—""Hey I gotta go, but I’ll see you at the show!"", ""Man, it’s so cool, we’re glad you’re doing your own thing."" It's the sound of Thomas realizing that most of his interactions are compromised by his own self-pity and dishonesty. And yet, this realization is the strange source of hope in All Are Saved: Thomas seems inspired, even moved, by the possibility that the sharp, overwhelming and temporary pain of being forthright with someone can be a breakthrough after years and years of silence and half-truths.  It ties back to that line about those kids on the bridge and how Thomas sets an example throughout *All Are Saved—*life is incredibly long when you’re terrified of doing anything wrong, and in the process of connecting with another person, it’s best to just go for it as directly as possible.","Fred Thomas is a Michigan indie rock lifer best known for his time in the throwback pop troupe Saturday Looks Good To Me. He's also released eight solo albums, and his latest, All Are Saved, is devastating and funny in ways that previous releases barely even considered, a biographical work of art capable of leveling people who have never heard of him.

White Men Are Black Men Too,Young Fathers,by: Jia Tolentino,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad4d9d034d5c69bf4348/1:1/w_160/c44f4eaf.jpg,2015-04-09 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20391-white-men-are-black-men-too/,Big Dada,"The Edinburgh trio Young Fathers have always confounded categories—Tape One and Tape Two, the EPs they released in 2011 and 2013, were often called rap, but always trailing qualifiers—""alt-,"" ""art-,"" ""psych-"". Then, as their Shabazz-on-uppers verses (""I Heard"") and grimy Yeezus shrieks (""Effigy"") faded, they shifted again: their Mercury Prize-winning debut full-length Dead landed somewhere close to what people thought of as ""hip-hop,"" if similarly prefaced—""experimental,"" ""alternative,"" or just ""Scottish."" You don’t call your record White Men Are Black Men Too unless you’re looking to stir up some questions about classification, and with their new album, Young Fathers double down on the confusion they inspired with their earliest releases. Their label bio even leads with the statement that the group has ""no ancestors,"" which is a funny thing to say about three men calling themselves Young Fathers because they all inherited their dads’ names. But their lineage is important, and audible: Graham ""G"" Hastings was born in Edinburgh; Alloysious Massaquoi hails from Liberia via Ghana, and Kayus Bankole was raised in the US by Nigerian parents. Young Fathers not only have ancestors but draw an enormous amount of energy from them, as White Men Are Black Men Too makes obvious: The record is a direct descendent of TV on the Radio, a grandson of krautrock, a distant relative of the earnest Streets, a grungy nephew of Arcade Fire. And, though it might change by the next time around, they’ve hit an unqualified category, for the first time: this is a rock record, almost a pop record. It’s raucous, messy, marked by a profound sense of urgency, intended to uplift and discomfit. Remarkably, White Men Are Black Men Too also addresses the questions posed by its name. The lyrics begin the conversation, but only get so far:  ""Old Rock N Roll"" starts with ""I’m tired of playing the good black/ I’m tired of having to hold back/ I’m tired of wearing this hallmark for some evils that happened way back."" Then, the speaker flips his loyalty—""I’m tired of blaming the white men/ His indiscretion don’t betray him""-—and reverses the album title: ""A black man can play him."" Then it flips back: ""Some white men are black men too, nigga to them, a gentleman to you."" The idea is jumbled, a little hollow, mostly a venting of frustration. More to the point is this simple line on ""Rain or Shine"": ""I ain’t strange enough."" And the most honest moment on the album, the moment where Young Fathers delineate their worldview the most clearly, is on the album’s standout (and most overtly TV on the Radio-soundalike) single ""Shame"", which begins with a dusty, drum-machine twinkle and rises up into a big, ragged, radio-ready melody. The chorus, self-flagellating and triumphant, switches between cries of ""It ain’t right, baby"" and ""What you do to feel better! What you do to feel good!"" But at any rate, the words are just the address on the envelope; the music is the letter itself. There is an appealing coherence in the album’s composition. Most of the tracks are built on juxtaposition between the low and high register: a vamping bass riff against a shrill glockenspiel, a dark guitar loop beneath a top cacophony of horns, synths, vocal wails. It’s a simple framework and a strong mirror to Young Fathers’ submerged cultural project: delineating a foundational reality (race, genre) and then mounting a tantrum against it. And, in the midst of this dissonance, the album’s sound is all tied together by shreds of surefooted, strong pop melody: ""27"" sounds almost like pitch-warped Passion Pit by way of the Avalanches, and ""Dare Me"" seems like a sweet little organ-backed ballad until it throws up a middle finger and breaks into an atonal, menacing shuffle. It’s not all coherent or wholly successful. Young Fathers’ people’s-mic earnestness can combine with their penchant for major-chord toplines to produce a funky but unmistakable cheese, as in ""Sirens"". Their fractious energy slants unfocused at times, too, and though the group does answer the question provoked by their album title, they do so by throwing their hands up—compacting the past like so much garbage and charging ahead. The sound of White Men Are Black Men Too is telling enough. It’s triumphant music for the hyperactive, plural city; it’s confrontational as a means to achieving communality, with no particular loyalties except to an anonymous, shifting collective of people who all want the same thing as Young Fathers—to be one thing, then the next, then the next.","The unconventional rap group Young Fathers have always counfounded categories, and their newest effort is a rock record, almost a pop record. It’s raucous, messy, and marked by a profound sense of urgency, intended to uplift and discomfit.

Sintetizzatrice,Anna Caragnano & Donato Dozzy,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad485e6ef95969321a59/1:1/w_160/e4107d9e.jpg,2015-04-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20387-sintetizzatrice/,Spectrum Spools,"One might be forgiven for anticipating that this collaboration between Italy’s ambient techno demiurge Donato Dozzy and Rome-based vocalist Anna Caragnano would be equal parts Dozzy and Caragnano, with his productions coursing beneath garlands of her voice. But Sintetizzatrice thrills in inverting such expectations. Imagine if Andy Stott’s Faith in Strangers drew upon only Alison Skidmore’s voice and you have an idea of what Dozzy and Caragnano are up to here. There’s not a throb, kick or ambient wash to be heard, no hardware to spot. Caragnano’s effervescent and honed voice is the only instrument at work, providing stratospheric highs and low end, with Dozzy deploying an array of strategies and processing to mirror, multiply, and fracture Caragnano’s flexible voice across these nine tracks. ""Introduzione"" begins with Caragnano surrounded by multitudes of herself, a solo performer on a subway car soon crammed with chattering commuters jostling for space. While it sets the stage for what will follow, it’s one of Sintetizzatrice’s least interesting moments. But once Caragnano’s utterance ""rain"" on ""Starcloud"" begins to sound through the space, soon surrounded with innumerable echoes of herself, we enter two-and-a-half minutes of rarefied space, Caragnano’s every hum and sigh transmogrified into a heavenly body. Dozzy finds myriad ways to recast Caragnano. ""Luci"" brings to mind the likes of Grouper, Julia Holter and Julianna Barwick. Dozzy takes the gossamer thread of a single breath at the start of ""Fraledune"", loops it until it becomes as expansive as a choir and then once that mass of sound is built, teases an even high sonority out of it. He moves Caragnano to the other end of the register for ""Parallelo"", favoring deep resonant tones, as if she is sounding from the bottom of a well. Another small mouth sound is used to approximate a thump on ""Parola"", which leads into the traditional Italian folk of ""Festa (A Mottola)"". Myself, I prefer Caragnano when she’s less tangible and earthly, more cloudy and ineffable, as she is uttering ""love without sound."" About the only complaint to level at Sintetizzatrice is its brevity. The body-erasing moments collected here don't even break the half-hour mark, which is a shame, because the sound of Caragnano’s brief sighs stretched towards infinity is a wonderful sound in which to luxuriate.","This collaboration between Italy’s ambient techno artist Donato Dozzy and Rome-based vocalist Anna Caragnano focuses on the sound of Caragnano's effervescent and honed voice, which is thie only instrument on display.

Wrought,Broken Water,by: Liz Pelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad72b1335d7bf1699bdc/1:1/w_160/71609ea8.jpg,2015-04-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20416-wrought/,Night People,"""We will find ways to terminate unwanted pregnancies even if your laws try and stop us,"" says singer/drummer Kanako Pooknyw mid-way through ""Choice"". Her words are plainspoken and upfront, a PSA amidst otherwise-abstract swatches of explosive guitar noise, psychedelic circling drums, and muffled vocals. Pooknyw has said she spent 180 hours mixing Broken Water’s third full-length, Wrought, with Steve Fisk (the late-'80s producer of Nirvana and Beat Happening). Which is to say, the moments when you can and cannot hear her statements are presumably very intentional. This attention to detail is a progression for the Olympia trio, who formed in 2008, specializing in a weary yet cathartic sort of dream punk. The sound mixes ebbing shoegaze guitars and fast pings of aggression, with vocals split between Pooknyw’s indie-pop lilt and guitarist Jon Hanna’s scraping, unapologetically grunge twang. Broken Water are a politics-upfront kind of band, the kind whose drummer would take her clothes off at a hardcore festival to deconstruct ideas about materialism, punk, and image; scream ""MALE FREEDOM"" at men taking up too much space at shows; who had a song on their first demo called ""Feminism"" which plainly (and literally) spelled out the word in the lyrics. At the same time, they’ve also routinely drawn inspiration from improvisational psych-punk and drone jams. Before Wrought, Broken Water’s last release was a wordless EP of two 15-minute songs, Seaside & Sedmikrasky, with string arrangements by Lori Goldston of Earth. It is appropriate, then, that Broken Water’s string of three LPs and two EPs have slipped between explicitly radical and introspective. And that Wrought opens with questions rather than answers. ""Am I right or am I wrong? All I know is I do not know,"" goes the beginning of ""High-Lo"". It’s a simple but poignant sentiment, tapping into the tension that comes from a life spent deliberating values and questioning everything. ""Scapegoats for the police state over petty theft/ Yet we trust the dollar bill and uniforms with guns?"" she asks on ""Love and Poverty"". Wrought searches for beauty in monotony and interrogates everyday oppressions, often in the same track. ""1984"" is a sprawling meditation on surveillance culture, where Pooknyw sings atop layers of slow-moving guitars about the NSA’s collect-it-all program of location-based metadata and turns it into something more poetic. ""Are you aware you are observed?"" she sings, her voice cool and even, almost drab. Other punk bands might pry open these ideas with palpable urgency, but Broken Water capture a central sadness and a numbness, tapping into the surreality of the surveillance state. ""Close"" is Pooknyw’s take on a soul-crushing service industry job, with images of broken glass, mopping the floor, counting the till, locking the door. At the end of the night she tells herself over tired-sounding, behind-the-beat drums: ""More… need something more… than my wages garnished for a war."" On the page, Pooknyw’s punk poetry outlines a relatable, simple-enough narrative, but its wise and weathered feeling is made palpable in her deadpan vocal inflection and screeching walls of guitar noise. Broken Water’s strength is in this multi-layered approach; they seem to understand intuitively how to underline and deepen their words with their playing, giving Wrought an almost-cinematic feel. It seems fitting that Pooknyw is also a filmmaker. The album finishes with ""Beach"", one of their lengthy stretches of meandering guitars, wordless vocals, and looming cello from Lori Goldston. This one clocks in at 12 minutes; it’s a testament to the fact that for all the broad strokes of politics, Broken Water are ultimately concerned with what they can evoke on an emotional level. By the time you flip the record over and start again, the same words that opened the record suddenly sound more charged, heavier, heartbreaking. ""Life … oh life.""","The Olympia trio Broken Water, who formed in 2008, specialize in a weary yet cathartic sort of dream punk.

Crooked Doors,Royal Thunder,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad18ea9e61561daa605f/1:1/w_160/da89932a.jpg,2015-04-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20354-crooked-doors/,Relapse,"The backstory of the Atlanta hard rock band Royal Thunder is Southern Gothic epic. Bassist and vocalist Mlny Parsonz left her home in New Jersey for the Peach State, where she linked up with guitarist/songwriter Josh Weaver, whom she eventually married (they have since split as a couple, but not as bandmates). Weaver belonged to a non-traditional church that appealed to some local artists and musicians, and when they introduced Parsonz, then an addict, to their religion, she saw a chance at redemption. ""I ended up quitting a lot—I was like, man, I'm gonna stop doing drugs and all this stuff as a way to clean up my life,"" she recalled in a recent MetalSucks podcast, ""So in my early twenties, I had started going to this church, got kind of locked into it."" Parsonz and the other women in the church attended conferences where they were brainwashed to recall ""visions"" of their youth in detail for three days. Unsurprisingly, she lost her mind. With a reluctant Weaver by her side, the singer told the pastor she’d be back in two Sundays, got in the car, and never returned. The days of the cult are over, but the guilt and the lingering doubts remain to haunt Royal Thunder's cavernous jams like ghosts in a manor. By the same token, the band's repulsion towards the structures (religious, cultural, or otherwise) that controlled them in the past reinforces a fierce impetus to innovate and impress, making them not entirely dissimilar from similarly strident acts around the state, such as Mastodon, Kylesa, and Baroness. It may have sported some uneven mixing and a few too many loose ends, but Royal Thunder's promising 2012 debut CVI offered an emotional, self-assured, and diverse take on heavy psych viewed through a swampy lens. On their sophomore effort Crooked Doors, the quartet expand upon the anthemic aims of their debut, bolstered by a new guitarist and a proggier palette. Contrasted with the traditional hard rock arrangements of CVI, Crooked Doors offers an expansive array of styles and textures across its 11 tracks, from understated folk to surging blues to labyrynthine instrumentals. Given the generous runtime of the tracks (most run over five minutes), it’s not uncommon for several of these elements to surface within a single song. Opener ""Time Machine"" rises up with a sturdy, tambourine-driven groove reminiscent of Heart, but before long Weaver’s short, choppy passages elongate, creating a bridge that appears to operate in zero gravity before the entire thing comes crashing back down to Earth for the finale. They employ a similarly bifold strategy on the heavier ""Glow"", making bedfellows of slide guitars and grungy choruses before gauzy strumming ushers in a period of calm. The aforementioned tracks are long-winded, but they’re grounded in robust choruses, which in turn derive their strength from Parsonz’s impassioned vocals. Show-offy and sinister, her multi-tracked soprano recalls Janis Joplin by way of Joan Jett, and the melodic cadences she employs on ""Glow"" and the Middle Eastern-tinged ""Forgive Me, Karma"" run the gamut from hymnal to hellbent. As the tempos stagnate towards the album’s back end, though, the affective force of her vocals loses potency—particularly on the pedestrian ballad ""One Day""—and all the runs in the world can't distract from the sameness. Admittedly, it feels strange to apply that sort of pejorative to an album that juggles opium-den mysticism (""Forgive Me, Karma""), dissociative psych (""Wake Up""), and reflections on brainwashing (""Floor""), but the main paradigms of CVI remain largely unchanged: On the aforementioned songs and more, drummer Evan Diprima and Parsonz start things off low and slow, tethering a cathartic buildup to a hook that subsequently pops its head out from prettier psychedelic scenery. It gets formulaic, to say the least. An intriguing, though ultimately unsuccessful exception arrives with closing two-fer ""The Bear I"" and ""The Bear II"", an exercise in stylistic restraint that frames Parsonz’s heart-wrought singing in pianos and violins, rather than guitars.

Super Saiyan Vol. 2,Sicko Mobb,by: Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929adba9d034d5c69bf4402/1:1/w_160/aa41439d.png,2015-04-08 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20470-super-saiyan-vol-2/,self-released,"Since the super-posi Chicago rap strain bop bubbled up from the West Side in 2013 in tandem with its own dance style, its most promising proponents have been responsible for its most divisive music. Stumbling on my first video from Sicko Mobb, the duo of North Lawndale natives Lil Trav and Lil Ceno, at the bottom of a deep YouTube rabbit hole that summer, I was enthralled. ""Fiesta"", Sicko Mobb’s first song ever, had a finger-plucked beat that mimicked the rickety jostle of a go-kart track in need of repairs, brought to life by the duo’s barreling sing-raps. The individual components of Sicko’s sound were familiar, cherry-picked from Atlanta trap, Chicago footwork, and drill—even radio bubblegum—but the composite was unlike anything else out. The video looked like most every other Chicago rap video of its moment, except that everyone in it was smiling. Sicko Mobb’s debut mixtape, Super Saiyan Vol. 1, was released in the last days of 2013, following the announcement that they’d signed a publishing deal with Stellar Songs/Water Music Publishing, Norwegian pop production duo Stargate's imprint for Sony. It was clear they were evolving quickly. Their skeletal, unmastered early tracks began to give way to glossy, more-is-more confections, with well-placed features from local heroes like Twista and Lil Durk. The duo’s latent pop instincts were developing in real time, but they’d been in existence for less than a year, and still had some kinks to work out. The tape’s production quality was so sketchy that a remastered version was released months later—also swapping A$AP Ferg’s ""Fiesta"" remix for the original, a hint at Sicko’s then-undisclosed deal with Polo Grounds, home of the A$AP Mob. You had to wonder if Trav and Ceno had enough ideas to sustain a career past the initial endorphin rush. Sicko’s sophomore project, Super Saiyan Vol. 2, proves the two have more tricks up their sleeves, and have clearly put the year-plus between releases to good use. Not only have Trav and Ceno sustained the momentum for a subgenre many wrote off as a passing phase, but they’ve also cleared out a previously nonexistent bop middle ground. SSV2 is the most approachable manifestation of the bop sound yet, thanks to the duo’s increasing aptitude for crisp songwriting. The tape’s initially intimidating 23 tracks (not to worry: many are brief skits, and unexpectedly hilarious ones at that) are loaded with euphoric hooks and melodic twists and turns, embellished lavishly with crystalline synths and soaring skrrrtpeggios. Sicko have slowed down the tempo without sacrificing too much of the energy, giving Trav and Ceno’s heavily stylized flows room to breathe. They’ve tightened up the lyrics, too—for starters, they’re actually legible this time around. But where SSV1’s lyrics functioned as a mood board of lituations meant for quick scanning, on SSV2, their bars are worth a closer read. ""Kool Aid"", the tape’s lead single, doubles as the best example of Sicko 2.0. It’s the duo’s most leisurely song to date, significantly slower-paced than their usual fare but as sticky-sweet as its namesake beverage. Nobody is looking to Sicko Mobb lyrics for debate team fodder, but over the twinkling beat by the Blue Ranger, Trav and Ceno have honed in on a lyrical mode that perfectly suits them. Sicko’s music is often described in synesthetic terms—drippy candy-paint hues and high-fructose teeth-buzz—which they’ve cleverly repurposed here. ""Black coupes, bitch, we got the juice/ Orange Porsches, flavor orange juice/ Apple Benz, Bentley color blue/ Purple in my cup and rose, too,"" Trav coos like it’s the world’s most PG-13 nursery rhyme, with sensory details so vivid they’d make  Young Dro jealous. Along with a generous handful of tracks including ""Penny HardAway"", ""Own Lane"", and the anthemic ""Rolling Stone"", it’s not out of the question to picture it crossing over with the right push. SSV1 dropped in late December, the worst time of year for new music, especially given the duo’s summer-hued block party sounds. They’ve strategized this time, releasing SSV2 just in time for the warm weather it channels. The timing feels right considering the rap landscape more broadly, too. When Sicko first emerged, mainstream rap was transitioning between moody phases, gradually edging out of Mike WiLL’s brooding reign. Future was spiraling away from Pluto’s romanticism towards hoarse, punishing trap like ""Sh!t"", and drill remained relevant even as the spotlight shifted away; Drake and Kanye were rolling out their most sullen albums yet. Sicko’s relentlessly cheery aesthetic wasn’t particularly cool, or marketable. But SSV2 arrives in the wake of Rae Sremmurd’s debut, an album stuffed with hits that have brought unabashed exuberance back to the rap charts, along with poignant, earnest 2014 smashes from iLoveMakonnen and Rich Gang. Even Kanye’s seemed to lighten up in recent months. Joy is cool again, and nobody does joy quite like Sicko Mobb.","The individual components of this Chicago bop outfit's sound are familiar, cherry-picked from Atlanta trap, Chicago footwork, and drill, but their particular fusion is unique. On their second full-length, the songs are loaded with euphoric hooks and melodic twists and turns.

Ivy Tripp,Waxahatchee,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad8cc0084474cd0c173f/1:1/w_160/5be2dee9.jpg,2015-04-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20437-ivy-tripp/,MergeWichita,"Katie Crutchfield is important to a lot of people. She's just 26, but with more than a dozen releases to her name courtesy of projects like P.S. Eliot, collaborations like Great Thunder, and assorted guest spots here and there, she comes off like the leader of a DIY folk-inflected indie rock/punk scene, a spokesperson for a realm usually against spokespeople. Crutchfield grew up in Alabama, naming her project after Waxahatchee Creek, where her parents have a house on a lake and where she's made a lot of her music. She's in Philadelphia now, an East Coast city that's cheaper than New York and that allows for more time to make music and just live. It follows, then, that there's a thriving scene there, too, with groups like Radiator Hospital (featuring one-time Waxahatchee member Sam Cook-Parrott) and members of her twin sister (and ex-P.S. Eliot bandmate) Allison's band Swearin', among others. Ivy Tripp, her third album as Waxahatchee, finds her fronting a band featuring multi-instrumentalists Kyle Gilbride and Keith Spencer (both from Swearin') and still coming off very much like she did on 2012's lo-fi solo effort, American Weekend. She's managed to bring in contributors and a greater range of instrumentation without losing that approachable intimacy. 2013's Cerulean Salt technically had more people playing on it, but Ivy Tripp just feels bigger, in part because Crutchfield is growing steadily more confident. The songs are more cohesive and accomplished—polished isn't the right word, but now and then, there is a kind of shine. Cerulean came off like an extension of American Weekend: it surfaced just as many people were discovering the earlier record, and some listeners were confused by the timeline and which came first. Ivy Tripp, her first album for Merge, feels more like a next step, something that exists on its own, and a move toward something else entirely. In a statement about the album, Crutchfield said the title of the record is ""just a term I made up for directionless-ness, specifically of the 20-something, 30-something, 40-something of today, lacking regard for the complacent life path of our parents and grandparents."" She added: ""I have thought of it like this: Cerulean Salt is a solid and Ivy Tripp is a gas."" This make sense. Cerulean was an album about growing up and losing your innocence and Ivy seems to be about knowing yourself as a grown up, being in the middle of that, and figuring out what comes next. The past is definable and relatively solid; the future is more amorphous and trickier to capture or pin down. You get that sense, of searching, of grasping at something you don't entirely understand, in the album's lyrics and overall narrative. The exact ""Ivy Tripp"" line on the record is ""Travel the world ivy tripping/ With no spotlight,"" and it's interesting to see where she's at now, as the spotlight finds its focus. On ""Grey Hair"" she sings: ""You might, wait and see me become/ A candle, precarious psychically among/ The ill at ease, the summer breeze/ But sugar soda pop songs play on the radio."" And, as she noted about the record, ""I think a running theme [of Ivy Tripp] is steadying yourself on shaky ground and reminding yourself that you have control in situations that seem overwhelming."" She doesn't deny the ambition either: ""I get short of breath because I can’t slow down,"" she sings (""Grey Hair""). Many of Ivy Tripp's song titles—""The Dirt"", ""Half Moon"", ""Bonfire""—are dusky and colored like earth tones, and that's the setting of the songs as well: moments in transition, the realm between night and day and relationships that have that same kind of momentary feeling. The lyrics feature many maybes and more than a few temporary situations (""You can lean on me for now"" in ""La Loose""), unread books, and things that may or may not have already ended. ""I’ll try to preserve the routine/ And I don’t want to discuss what it means,"" Crutchfield sings on ""La Loose"". People ""pretend to be strangers/ Lamenting a means to an end"" (""Air"") and ""imitate some kind of love"" (""Stale By Noon"") instead of just being in love. Music's an ""imperfect escape"" (""Half Moon""). A low-level anxiety pervades, and on a song simply titled ""<"" she offers an update on the Blank Generation: ""You’re less than me and I am nothing,"" goes the chorus. Earlier, in ""The Dirt"", she sings ""I’m a basement brimming with nothing great."" In ""Summer of Love"", a photo of people, and not the actual people, are the subject: ""The colors allure me but I can’t make out/ A face in the picture of palm trees/ The summer of love is a photo of us."" ""Sugar"" comes up a lot—a sweet thing without a lot of substance, but that tastes good. There's a penchant for finding beauty in small gestures and situations like sleeping or refusing to leave the beach. As well as bigger ones: ""You’ll deliver a fable I could live/ And I’ll throw it off the nearest cliff,"" she sings in ""The Dirt"". The one thing that can drag Ivy Tripp down a little is that the lyrics are at times a bit vague or interchangeable. It turns out discussing emptiness can maybe feel a bit empty, and the words here don't always hit as hard as some of her prior work. That said, the way the words are delivered is essential, and with a voice like Crutchfield's—both rough and clear with a slight Southern twang—a lot gets said simply in how these things are enunciated. That, and the album features a few of Crutchfield's best and catchiest songs. She's mentioned an interest in the New Zealand lo-fi pop band Tall Dwarfs; Ivy Tripp has the feel of classic indie rock. You'll be reminded of other groups here and there: ""The Dirt"" sounds a lot like the Vaselines, at least compositionally, and much of it would fit in very well at the original International Pop Underground Convention, on Simple Machines, or with '90s Merge acts like Butterglory or Bricks (the fact that she did sign to Merge makes perfect sense—Crutchfield and her cohorts carry the same torch as  Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance). She's mentioned Joni Mitchell time again, as well as Cat Stevens, though on Ivy, you may think more about Cat Power's What Would the Community Think. Maybe as a result of the cross-pollination and familiarity, there's a casual feel to Ivy Tripp, something about it that's unhurried and relaxed. Which doesn't mean it isn't ambitious or accomplished. This is one way it's most reminiscent of the best '90s indie rock: it never feels forced or like she's making some kind of push. It's unhurried and natural and real. You also get a feeling listening to these songs that Crutchfield is just getting started, and it's exciting to hear a young voice rising so assuredly above the fray, one you can imagine inspiring kids years from now, and inspiring them to pick up guitars and sing and take control of their direction, too.","Ivy Tripp, Waxahatchee's first album for Merge, shares an unhurried and natural mood with the best '90s indie rock. Though 2012's breakthrough Cerulean Salt had more people playing on it, Ivy Tripp feels bigger, in part because Katie Crutchfield is growing increasingly confident.

Dark Red,Shlohmo,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad9bc0084474cd0c1755/1:1/w_160/87770118.jpeg,2015-04-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20447-dark-red/,True PantherWedidit,"Last year was a hard one for Henry Laufer. The Los Angeles native, who records and performs as Shlohmo, saw a collaborative EP with Jeremih delayed for months by mismanagement at Def Jam. In July, the two artists gave up and released the record for free, only to receive lukewarm reviews. Laufer also suffered through some personal losses, ones that he’s done his best to keep private. He’s spoken of hospital visits and funerals, of partying too hard and feeling like shit whenever he took the time to make music. His second full-length, Dark Red, channels that heavy energy. The album is jarringly different from Laufer’s past work and a difficult, oft-deafening listen. The emotional anguish contained in many of these tracks was hinted at on his 2013 solo EP, Laid Out, but some internal dial has spun from ""ennui"" to ""cold rage."" The album’s third track, ""Buried"", is most representative, a near seven-minute piece of what could be called abyss-core. Its engine is a yearning sample, distorted into fragments and underscored with menacing guitar progressions. Shlohmo has always been a fan of distortion, but on Dark Red he’s beating his synths to hell, from the opening chords of ""Meet Ur Maker"", which contains a recognizable Shlohmo melody ripped to shreds, to the steel-drum-like plinks of  ""Remains"". Shlohmo has testified many times recently that he is looking to avoid the trappings of his more pop-leaning projects. Once, he made an avant-garde R&B that resembled the production of mainstream foils like Drake and the Weeknd. Now he’s dabbling in ambient noise and prog with dashes of drum’n’bass and allusions to footwork. Vocals are gone, samples chopped and buried. Collaborations have largely been nixed: ""I just want to do my own fucking thing,"" Laufer said in a recent profile. Fans of the producer’s older work may blanche at the aggression of the first three tracks here, which function as an aural ""Beware of Dog"" sign, warning the faint of heart away. Yet after repeated listens, the front trio reveals some of the best moments on the album, demanding attention but also meriting it. Those who want the old Shlohmo will have to wait for the final two tracks, ""Fading"" and ""Beams"", which concede to fans, and constitute a kind of middle ground between the producer’s past work and the new album. If Dark Red were another EP, all that fury boiled down to a manageable five or six tracks might make an impressive statement. At an hour run-time, Shlohmo’s change in tenor loses its shock value and becomes a slog. The four tracks that make up the album’s mid-section are unmemorable, a fact that their names—""Apathy"", ""Relentless"", ""Ditch"", ""Remains""—seem to acknowledge explicitly. When the album’s rhythm finally picks up again on the drum and bass influenced ""Fading"", it comes as a major relief. Los Angeles’s Low End Theory club was an early site of the alchemical process that has melded hip-hop kids and beatheads together into a formidable coalition. Laufer was a frequent attendee and in response he formed the Wedidit collective, a group of producers including RL Grime, Groundislava, Salva, and Ryan Hemsworth. All of these artists were early in working with modern electronic dance genres that share the musical vocabulary and dynamism of hip-hop. But the rest of the world has caught up with this style of music-making, so on Dark Red, Laufer is scrawling furiously outside the lines. Early in his career, before he dropped out of art school, he talked about music as a diversion, something that was less serious and less restrictive than learning how to paint the right way. His experiences with the mainstream and the colonization of his own genre seem to have had a similar effect. With Dark Red, he’s taken another turn, slipping out of the pop-shadowing path he was on in exchange for something darker and bolder, but compromised by its own disorder.","Henry Laufer, the Los Angeles producer who records and performs electronic music as Shlohmo, has always been a fan of distortion, but on his second full-length he’s beating his synths to hell.

Lucid Dreaming,Say Lou Lou,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929abe95e6ef9596932182b/1:1/w_160/31a5733f.jpg,2015-04-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20132-lucid-dreaming/,á Deux,"Lately it seems like 1980s revivalism won’t subside. But there’s something wistful about the latest variety. The synths have the sculpted plastic bigness of Aquanet coifs, the rhythms sway like prom dances, and the lyrics seem tailored toward movie makeouts (or at least heavy stares). It’s become the default sound for a certain rising artist: think small-pop as mall-pop. Even the world of mainstream pop is there: see ""Doing It"", Charli XCX’s moon-eyed pastiche of ""Lucky Star"" and ""Crazy For You"", or Taylor Swift’s record named after and sounding just like 1989, or Carly Rae Jepsen abandoning her prior tween squees for the Dev Hynes-produced prom slow dance ""All That"". Listening to the revivalists, one would be forgiven for thinking the entire decade took place entirely inside roller rinks, at night, during one long, teary last dance. As the twin daughters of Steve Kilbey of the Church, Elektra and Miranda Kilbey have a better connection to this side of the '80s than most. Their father's band is best known for the dreamily acoustic ""Under the Milky Way"", but is also responsible between its members for a small pantheon of side projects, most somewhere in the folk/dream pop realm. And the Kilbey sisters aren't new to the form either: they've trod the pop boards as Say Lou Lou (formerly Saint Lou Lou) since 2012, and at this point, their sound’s crystallized into a formula. The setting will be night, or at least dark: one early track was titled ""Better in the Dark"", and the sentiment’s repeated at least twice on Lucid Dreaming. Their voices will keen plaintively over the beat. The reverb will sound reverbed. Enough gold and glitter will flow through photography and lyrics to put Tinkerbell, El Dorado, and Kesha out of commission. Listen to more than a few of their songs, and these start seeming less like running motifs and more like a drinking game. Whether this comes off as heady atmosphere or anemic samey blur depends mostly on how many tracks have passed in succession—their first label, Kitsuné, is best known as a singles label—but there are some highs amid the fog. Opener ""Everything We Touch"" is as good a condensation of the Say Lou Lou sound as any: a midtempo track that sparkles like an ice palace, full of poetaster plaints (""there’s a ghost in the machine and there’s a glowing light"") that do indeed sound better in the dark. ""Glitter"" is among the more substantial cuts, a lite disco throb reminiscent of the highlights of Little Boots’ Nocturnes. Elsewhere, sonic departures are so few that they’re almost welcome merely for existing. Lindstrøm collaboration ""Games For Girls"" uses the twins’ breathy blankness to taunting effect: ""I never tell you what I’m thinking about/ I don’t do anything at all,"" they coo over Lindstrøm’s politely louche disco strut, and the effect is provocative if a bit obvious. Liam Howe-penned ""Peppermint"" churns the atmosphere into a storm swell: the foregrounded piano, strings, and whispers conjure enough heaving melodrama that the twins get across a truly silly central metaphor. This isn’t necessarily a given. Early track ""Julian"" tries for plot, namely that of a young-adult dystopia—""I’ll get us through the checkpoint, I know we’ll be alright""—a Sarah Cracknellian conceit undermined by the Kilbey twins singing it as if the car’s pumping out soma. The entire back half of the album is undeniably pretty in patches—some Eurythmics arpeggiation here, Robert Miles piano there, an obvious hook more or less—but otherwise an indistinguishable haze, put over neither by the bleary-pretty instrumentation or the twins’ somewhat thin voices. Lucid Dreaming arrives after a succession of delays: debut single ""Maybe You"" dates back to 2012, they made the BBC Sound of 2014 longlist for tracks that emerged in early 2013, and the new material on Lucid Dreaming isn’t much of a departure from those. For an act so consistent in their sound, it’s hard to get a bead on their ambitions. The chanted hook and big drums of ""Nothing But a Heartbeat"" suggest Top 40 hopes, but that ground’s been trod often and better. Say Lou Lou’s place would be something like Tove Lo without the biting lyrical voice, or maybe Tegan and Sara’s Heartthrob without the rush of feelings or huge legacy fanbase. They could go full-on dance—a promising option, if not always as starmaking for female vocalists than the usually-men behind the boards. Or they could remain in their current blog-pop lane—a slow, steady path with devotees to be found along the way. After all, nocturnal melancholia sounds glorious during the night. It's just that something’s got to happen once the lights come up.","As the twin daughters of the Church's Steve Kilbey, Elektra and Miranda Kilbey have a better connection to 1980s revivalism than most. They've trod the pop boards as Say Lou Lou since 2012, and on Lucid Dreaming, which features production from Lindstrøm and Richard X, their dusky, romantic sound is crystallized into a formula.

Captain of None,Colleen,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad5bea9e61561daa60d2/1:1/w_160/ea788f62.jpg,2015-04-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20400-captain-of-none/,Thrill Jockey,"Captain of None, the sixth solo album from Colleen (née French multi-instrumentalist Cécile Schott), is the product of an unusual series of creative decisions. Her primary instrument is once again a Renaissance-era treble viola da gamba, and she does all she can to extend its conventional range of sounds, drawing direct inspiration from the studio techniques of dub masters Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and King Tubby for English-language songs featuring her own vocals. The gut-string viola da gamba first appeared in the mid-15th century and it's seldom heard these days outside of early music ensembles. This general lack of use and natural versatility make the instrument difficult for modern ears to easily identify. When bowed, it can sound like a cello or a modern viola; when plucked or strummed, it can sound like a harp or lute; and when tapped or thumped, it can even sound something like a hammered dulcimer. Schott has made use of all of these techniques at various points, but on earlier albums such as 2007’s Les Ondes Silencieuses, her playing style was more traditional and her compositions more closely centered on post-Baroque chamber music. On Captain of None, however, Schott casts tradition aside and frequently uses her viola da gamba as a percussion instrument to create impressively rich, dub-inflected basslines. In live performance and on past records, she has used various samples, loops, and delay pedals to layer her voice and instruments back upon themselves. Here, on such tracks as ""This Hammer Breaks"" she pushes these techniques to a new level of invention, with the strings of her viola refracted beyond all recognition. In fact, there are times on Captain of None where the album’s architecture is so compelling it's easy to miss the resonance of the songs themselves. But pieces like ""I’m Kin"" and the title track positively vibrate with melodic ideas, their lyrics filled with oblique little koans (""I’m kin to two stones making fire, I’m kin to melted ice giving water""). The album’s dub influence is felt most strongly on the bass-heavy ""Eclipse"" or ""Salina Stars"", which is laced with an Augustus Pablo-style melodica. It’s tricky to make a true dub album without the benefit of an actual rhythm section, but Schott's hands-on production effects of delay and echo slip in and out through these songs like apparitions, projecting a sort of dub silhouette across the armature of the album. It is an impressive feat of reverse engineering, and the way Colleen uses classical acoustic instruments to reconfigure modern idioms recalls Arthur Russell’s cello-driven World of Echo or Hauschka’s house music variations on Salon des Amateurs. Somehow, Schott is able to make these disparate elements feel organic and effortless.","Captain of None is the sixth solo album from French multi-instrumentalist Cécile Schott. She's still working with her Renaissance-era instrument treble viola da gamba, but is now using it in particularly inventive ways.

Sympathy,GABI,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad69b1335d7bf1699bc8/1:1/w_160/eea3d327.jpg,2015-04-07 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20409-sympathy/,Software,"What if the voice weren’t the original instrument? What if it all began with breath? That’s one question at the heart of Gabrielle Herbst’s debut album as GABI, in which the singer and composer takes gorgeous, gossamer songs—songs that feel all but a cappella, even when they rest upon a spongy cushion of chamber instruments—and blows them out until they pull apart. Sympathy is a vision of music as free-flowing as air. Pop records written with this kind of academic rigor are rare. Herbst studied composition at Bard with new-music heavyweights like Zeena Parkins and Marina Rosenfeld; later, she was an artist-in-residence at Robert Wilson’s Watermill Center, and she has written a short opera. At the same time, she’s identified as someone who ""loves listening to loud, simple, unabashed, healing pop music."" Sympathy gets its meadowy textures from violin and viola, undistorted electric guitar, steadying piano, and vibraphone; loosely woven background vocals evoke both the pointillist harmonies of '60s girl groups and the contrapuntal clockworks of Meredith Monk. But it’s not always so dulcet. Major- and minor-key passages pivot into dissonant drones and unstable frequencies. The album resembles the quieter moments of Julia Holter’s Ekstasis and Loud City Song, and it also brings to mind Julianna Barwick’s Nepenthe. But Herbst’s adventurous arrangements and occasionally white-knuckled sonics set it apart from Barwick’s more genial sound, and Herbst is less influenced by the pop standards and densely imagistic narratives that drive Holter’s music. Ultimately, Herbst’s voice is the main attraction. It is the first sound you hear, in fact, a clear soprano wreathed in natural reverb: ""I wait for you."" Embodied with the language of romantic yearning, her voice provides the through-line that holds the record together, whether foregrounded in soaring cadenzas or multi-tracked into dazzling, kaleidoscopic arrays. Thematically, Sympathy follows an arc so faint it might as well be traced in sand, one that takes us from desire to fullness, from ""I wait for you"" to ""Hallelujah."" Her images are both hyper-specific and deeply symbolic, overdetermined by centuries of song: wilting willows, stardust, a golden fleece. The haunting ""Love Song"" offers only nonsense syllables punctuated by a few concrete phrases: ""blue zero,"" ""electricity,"" ""I am yours."" It feels like a snapshot of the mind/body divide: blood pumping through the veins, current zapping through the central nervous system, the occasional flash of language. Herbst’s lyrics frequently take the shape of mantras or koans, but she seems aware that language has its expressive limitations. The text of ""Home"" is just five words long (""Stay with him/ I’m home"") and the closing ""Hymn"" even shorter: ""Hallelujah! Blood and water."" But words on the page are hardly the point. The magic is in the way she embodies them—in the idea of breath incarnate. In repetition, they take on the weight of ritual, and as she extemporizes, she frees the voice from the shackles of speech. The bulk of ""Home"" is an extended, wordless cadenza that loops in the air like a bird, only to finally alight on the phrase, ""I’m home."" ""I have recently been trying to build rhythms by imitating the way that light reflects on walls or leaves reflect on the ground,"" Herbst told an interviewer in 2012; ""constant fluctuation, random but with a sense of purpose and believability. I seek to make organic rhythms with an internal logic even if that logic is not obvious or straightforward."" In Sympathy, that takes the form of tidal forces: phrases imperceptibly speeding and slowing, and glassy depths turning roiled and opaque. ""Over to the sea!"" she cries in ""Fleece"", and in ""Falling"", she points to ""phosphorescence floating… love as debris."" In ""Da Void"", she addresses the sea and her lover as one being: ""Your eyes/ Your tides/ Breathing/ You still/ Water I want to hear you breathing."" Strings swell, and a fingerpicked guitar sends ripples across the surface. It’s so beautiful it’s almost frightening, a sneakily sweet treatise upon the sublime. There’s nothing to do but sigh.","Gabrielle Herbst studied composition at Bard with new-music heavyweights like Zeena Parkins and Marina Rosenfeld, and she also has an unabashed love of pop.

What For?,Toro y Moi,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad45ea9e61561daa60ab/1:1/w_160/aa0c2b6e.png,2015-04-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20385-what-for/,Carpark,"Calling What For? a return to Chaz Bundick’s roots is accurate and also fairly misleading. The guitar-driven giddiness of ""Empty Nesters"" was a surprise whether or not you’ve heard June 2009, a collection of early Toro Y Moi recordings given a quiet, proper release in 2012. But at the very least, it provides precedent: before ""Blessa"", Bundick was sorting out what he wanted Toro Y Moi to be, and he wrote a number of classicist, lo-fi indie rock songs. Some of them kinda sounded like Weezer. (No, really.) That said, the past five years have seen Toro Y Moi change from a bedroom project to a tight, adventurous and successful touring band, so if What For? is Bundick revisiting his awkward phase, he’s doing so like a late bloomer confidently showing up to his high school reunion knowing just how well he’s aged. Every Toro Y Moi release finds the band in transition, and so What For? might be seen as a regression in some ways; ditching guitar rock for electronics has become a sign of maturity for both listeners and artists, inverting the typical rockist trajectory. However, Bundick has always been canny about switching lanes: at the time, 2013’s Anything in Return felt like Toro Y Moi hitting its stride, making liquid and limber electro-acoustic dance-pop. Or, he sounded like a cuddly, plush Caribou, a role easier to accept in the absence of new Caribou music and the mutual artistic appreciation between Bundick and Dan Snaith. But then, Our Love threatened to make Toro Y Moi redundant and while Bundick’s Les Sins has run concurrent to his main gig, it's proven him to be an enthusiastic, earnest, and ultimately functional dance producer. What For? then serves as further evidence that Toro Y Moi’s malleability is the project's most endearing quality. That and Bundick is something of a post-grad role model, having the ability to be flexible, amenable to change, and ultimately successful in all ventures without showing much struggle. There are a handful of new modes here: the Woods-y rusticity on ""Ratcliff"" and ""Run Baby Run""’s pinwheel-eyed pop-rock would’ve been out of place on any prior release. But throughout, there’s revelation in the aesthetic familiarity Bundick has established: in particular, the globular harmonies, cushy production, and a pervasive dampness that either recalls the fog of his new home Berkeley or the humidity of his native South Carolina. So if this is called Toro Y Moi’s ""indie rock album,"" the ""rock"" part is a vestigial appendage: yes, the basis for pretty much everything here is a trad power trio set up and the synthesizers use tones that predate the '80s and will thus be called ""organic."" But this is guitar music without abrasion or yearning, and it’ll play just as well in the venues in which Underneath the Pine and An**ything in Return were suited for—rooftop parties, barbecues, apartment get-togethers. And after his first three LPs were given counterintuitive deep winter release dates, What For? admits to Toro Y Moi’s music sounding best when the weather’s making you feel a bit more irresponsible than usual. So, even when the band shows vigor during the liftoff of ""Empty Nesters"", the quick pivots of ""Buffalo"", and the uptempo funk of ""Spell It Out"", nothing seems particularly pressing. Even as Bundick appears to have moved on from post-collegiate concerns to straight-up adult problems, What For? most oftens advocates tabling discussion until emotions have settled. Which is to say that the pleasantry of Toro Y Moi might not be its most endearing quality, but it’s certainly the most enduring. The conversation should not end there—they’re pleasant, but so is Real Estate. So is Mac DeMarco. So is the War on Drugs. So is the vast majority of popular indie rock. And though these are Toro Y Moi’s peers, putting Bundick against them might seem unfair: he does not deal with Big Emotional Issues as directly as the aforementioned. The bigger problem is that What For? doesn’t address much of anything directly, and that’s an issue on a record which appears to make Bundick’s chops as a songwriter and a lyricist a focal point. Befitting a guy best known for crafting a vibe, one can sense these songs are emotive and heartfelt. But close reading for confirmation shows thoughts that may have once conveyed relatable feelings forced against their will to become lyrics, i.e., ""Let’s awaken and turn on our minds/ No one is waiting for you in this line."" Either that or the persistent indifference tipped by the title of What For? becomes maddening whenever Bundick soft-sells waffles like, ""It’s whatever you want to do"" or, subsequently, ""What is it you want to do?"" So when he pleads, ""do I need to spell it out,"" the answer is actually, ""well, yes."" Without any kind of emotional or sonic grain to grip, what were well-constructed, well-meaning songs minutes prior are reduced to placeholders in your memory—""the one with the clavinet,"" ""the lead single,"" ""the six-minute closer."" The problem isn't that Bundick avoids confrontation or confession—most people do. But What For? is so passive it leaves your system the moment you’re done with it.","Toro Y Moi’s new album serves as further evidence that malleability is the project's most endearing quality. If What For? is Chaz Bundick’s ""indie rock album,"" the ""rock"" part is a vestigial appendage: This is guitar music without abrasion or yearning.

This World Is Not Enough,Marching Church,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad8bc0084474cd0c173a/1:1/w_160/e5e84144.jpg,2015-04-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20436-this-world-is-not-enough/,Sacred Bones,"Describing the motivation for his project Marching Church, Elias Bender Rønnenfelt wrote, ""I had a picture in my head of me in a comfortable chair, adorned in a golden robe, leading a band while a girl kept pouring me champagne. ‘What would this picture sound like?’ was the question."" Judging from that image, you wouldn't be faulted for assuming the band's debut, This World Is Not Enough, may end up being the unintentional comedy album of the year, but looking at Rønnenfelt’s track record, it's worth indulging him for a quick minute. As the frontman for Iceage, he’s carried the Danish punk firebrands across three good-to-great albums, from the wild-eyed pummel of New Brigade through last year’s curveball Plowing Into the Field of Love, which offered country-informed punk rave-ups as well as desperately drunken ballads, all with uncommonly successful results. Now with Marching Church, which has been around in some capacity since 2010, Rønnenfelt seems to be doubling down on Field of Love’s risk-taking, enlisting members of Lower, Puce Mary, and others for an improvisational avant-garde LP that stretches the boundaries of the soul recordings (James Brown, Sam Cooke) that inspired it. How you approach This World Is Not Enough, and how patient a listener you consider yourself to be, will factor heavily in your enjoyment of it. ""Well I’m still being convinced that I contain some kind of godlike charm,"" Rønnenfelt croaks over the rapture-heralding drums and slashing guitars of opener ""Living In Doubt"", and it's often hard to disagree with him. As on Field of Love, he cuts a striking figure, a confident but conflicted young man who rambles like a junior year philosophy major in the throes of a fever dream. And while his rakish sexuality and winking sense of humor are on display once again, this time he seems to have crawled a little too far into his own head. He holds off for approximately two songs—including the great, sax-laden ""King of Song"", which kind of sounds like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" as performed by people who’ve never actually heard ""Sympathy for the Devil""—before going off-the-rails. So, just as quickly as things seem to be shaping up for This World Is Not Enough, ""Hungry for Love""—a seven minute panic attack of clattering cymbals, strained strings, and Rønnenfelt's trademark mad spouting—rears its head. It’s fascinating but also purposefully repellent, a moment when the idea of self-indulgence threatens to mutate into a wildly pretentious guilty pleasure. From here on, the record follows ""Hungry for Love""’s lead, and it never quite finds its way back. And yet, This World Is Not Enough displays little moments of greatness amid the chaos and confusion. You’ll have to wade through almost five soupy minutes of rusty bells, anguished moaning, and hovering guitars on ""Your Father’s Eyes"" before being rewarded with a soulful, horn-assisted death waltz, though it’s a nice reward anyway. But, all said, there’s just too much wide open space to fill here, and especially on the album’s draggy back half, it’s fairly clear that Rønnenfelt and company have absolutely no idea what to fill it with, but decide to try anyways. This usually means more shapeless, frequently unpleasantly calamitous dicking around from the players, and more moaning from Rønnenfelt. (It can also mean a painfully dull cover of the eternal ""The Dark End of the Street"".) And while he is often quite good at conjuring up vividly disquieting imagery, it’s rarely enough to keep your attention. But somehow, This World Is Not Enough is too cluelessly conceived and sloppily executed to get very mad about it. What is frustrating are the infrequent but genuinely interesting moments of creativity and cohesion, which suggest that if Marching Church had taken their time and laid off the improv a little, there might have been something special here.","As the frontman for Iceage, Elias Bender Rønnenfelt has carried the Danish punks across three good-to-great albums.

Lustmore,Lapalux,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acf8ea9e61561daa6027/1:1/w_160/87e66a2e.jpg,2015-04-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20331-lustmore/,Brainfeeder,"On his debut album, 2013's Nostalchic, producer Stuart Howard (aka Lapalux) showed a strong affection for 1990s R&B. He sifted the era's body-rolling sensuality through computerized filters, piecing the threads into cryptic slow jams and bastardized dance tracks. His music, across Nostalchic and several EPs, thrives on a patchwork approach, a mismatched blend of glued-together tape strands, heavy drums, and warped vocals. It's wonky enough to fit alongside that of Brainfeeder label mates Daedelus and Gaslamp Killer, but it's distinguished by a cosmopolitan sophistication, conjuring images of pretty people in dark clubs, sipping mixed drinks in trendy clothes. The producer establishes a more aquatic vibe throughout sophomore album Lustmore. The compositions are more straightforward than those on Nostalchic, merging saxophones and billowing synths with results resting somewhere between James Blake's sparsity and early 2000s neo-soul. ""We Lost"", in particular, resembles a Musiq Soulchild track—the instrumental is decidedly Soulquarian; the vocals are mostly indecipherable. ""Whenever I think about the album I think about the bar scene in The Shining,"" Howard told FACT in January, speaking of Lustmore. ""There's something about that strange, hallucinatory psychological madness that relates to the music."" To that end, Lustmore doesn't really move; it lingers like dense fog until it slowly dissolves. In a way, the disoriented mood better aligns with another Kubrick flick—1999's Eyes Wide Shut.  But Lustmore suffers from a lack of coherence. Its various feint and detours feel purposeful, but the album buckles under the weight of Howard's ambition, leading to a leading to a disjointed listen. Sultry numbers like ""U Never Know"" and ""Closure"" fit into Howard's overall aesthetic, but the mix of straight-ahead singing and woozy ambience feels outdated and timid alongside the more fluid, strange ""Sum Body"" and ""Midnight Peelers"". The guest singers aren’t filtered so heavily, which makes for an easier listen, yet the output feels staid compared with his previous offerings, where he achieved the right mix of airy and bizarre.Nostalchic was tough to get into, but there was a certain charm to Howard’s esoteric style that set him apart. Lustmore doesn’t feel honed in; it sounds like a vast collection of songs that never quite go anywhere. Much like The Shining, there’s no telling what you’ll get from one scene to the next on Lustmore, but it ultimately ends with a thud. Howard shows flashes of ingenuity on Lustmore's ""Don't Mean a Thing"", the album's most realized offering. Here, Howard finds a nice groove and stays put, looping the vocals into sporadic bursts while forgoing the stilted patterns of other songs—namely ""Push N' Spun"" and ""Make Money"". On ""1004"", Howard builds a nice shape-shifting atmosphere; the track smoothly transitions into a spacey upbeat gem that punctuates the LP. Ultimately, though, it's tough to discern just what Lustmore aims to be. It's dubbed as a hypnagogic release, but in Howard's quest to explore the void between sleep and alertness, the album frequently veers off the path, leaving me to wonder if there were clear directions to begin with. Instead of a full movie, Lustmore is a collection of half-edited scenes that don't quite gel.","On his second LP, Lapalux forgoes the patchwork approach of his debut, merging saxophones and billowing synths with results resting somewhere between James Blake's sparsity and early 2000s neo-soul.

American Wrestlers,American Wrestlers,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acb35e6ef95969321977/1:1/w_160/98a4fc3d.jpg,2015-04-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20285-american-wrestlers/,Fat Possum,"Using a drum machine to replicate a live backing band tends to have the opposite effect, making solo home recorders sound even more isolated. Case in point, American Wrestlers’ self-titled debut. As of now, it’s Gary McClure’s project and his alone, but the songs won’t require a lot of maintenance to be ready for the road: guitars, bass, piano and vocals are layered about the same way they would have if American Wrestlers were just four guys in a cheap studio. But there’s always that rigid, so on-the-beat-it’s-actually-off thwack of a snare, a bass drum that sounds like a blown subwoofer and the occasional hint of McClure hitting the power switch on the thing—all reminders that American Wrestlers is McClure starting a rock band with his imaginary friends. Until about a month ago, American Wrestlers was in fact a pointedly anonymous project, an attention-seeking tactic that went out of fashion right about the time Burial went public.  The music feels a few steps behind the times as well, but that's a major component of its charm. Perhaps coincidentally, the album shares some of the best qualities of Fat Possum's major 2011 releases: the dog-eared alt-rock melodies of Yuck’s debut; the lo-fi, low-end thump of Youth Lagoon’s The Year of Hibernation; the (also formerly incognito) Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s oddball psych odysseys. Regardless of the promo-cycle theatrics, the songs themselves tend to make strong first impressions. McClure leads songs off with breezy guitar leads, memorable titles become indelible lyrics, choruses make satisfying, expected leaps. And despite its disheveled exterior, McClure’s lyrics generate positive energy out of bad vibes: ""There’s No One Crying Over Me Either"" and ""I Can Do No Wrong"" respectively turn self-pity and a lack of introspection into superpowers. There’s no simple genre tag for American Wrestlers, though singles ""Kelly"" and ""I Can Do No Wrong"" imagine an alternate history where Phoenix started their career as Tascam 4-trackers. The grubby production appears to be a product of necessity, the natural result of McClure’s rudimentary equipment and skills rather than an allegiance to lo-fi aesthetics, but it still lends American Wrestlers a distinct character: The 12-string sparkle of ""I Can Do No Wrong"" gets toned down just enough to not be blinding. And had the singles been given a properly sync-ready production, you might already be tired of hearing them from a commercial for macrobrews or luxury sedans. The highlights of American Wrestlers reveal themselves immediately, but elsewhere on the record McClure demonstrates a curious ability to bury concise hooks in otherwise-doughy or unfinished songs. The contrast between the southern rock lead of ""Holy"" and its passages of National-esque piano is intriguing on first exposure; it is not enough intrigue to sustain a six-minute song on its own. ""Wild Yonder"" evokes the ear-turning pitter-patter of Sparklehorse’s balladry and would’ve served as a nice shift in tone had it been three minutes, but it goes on for nearly twice that long. This pattern repeats itself on the album's Side B, when ""Kelly"" is followed by ""Left"" and ""Cheapshot"", 18 minutes of music that you can hear straining for ""epic"" but fail to generate any real volume dynamics or textural motion. These shots at a bigger sound only end up fully demonstrating the limitations of McClure’s compositional methods. It's in these moments where it occurs to you that the biggest problem with a solo project is that there's no one there to tell you ""no."" At some point during the ponderous stretches of ""Wild Yonder"" or ""Cheapshot"" or ""Left"", perhaps McClure would've noticed someone else in the band starting to drift off or suggested that maybe he should get to the chorus more quickly. ""I Can Do No Wrong"" may be a highlight on American Wrestlers, but the title sentiment is his project's Achilles heel.","American Wrestlers is the home-recorded project of Gary McClure, and his album boasts some of the virtues of his circa-2011 Fat Possum labelmates: the dog-eared alt-rock melodies of Yuck; the lo-fi, low-end thump of Youth Lagoon; the oddball psych odysseys of Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

"Next Stop Soweto Vol. 4: Zulu Rock, Afro-Disco & Mbaqanga 1975-1985",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acd413d1975652139e28/1:1/w_160/fbe47cc7.jpg,2015-04-06 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20309-next-stop-soweto-vol-4-zulu-rock-afro-disco-mbaqanga-1975-1985/,Strut,"It’s hard to capture the complexity of a cultural scene in something as brief and necessarily cherry-picked as a CD-length compilation of music. And Strut hasn’t done that with the fourth volume of their Next Stop Soweto series. But in adding a fourth volume to the original three, the label has inched a step closer to focusing the musical kaleidoscope of 1960s and '70s South Africa into a coherent image. Perhaps 10 volumes from now, they’ll complete the trick. The first three sets focused, respectively, on mbaqanga and other township sounds, psychedelia and soul, and jazz. This one picks up most clearly where Vol. 2 left off, following the march of underground psych and soul into the disco era. In the process, it gives us a glimpse at the South Africa that grooved under apartheid’s heel; there aren’t attention-grabbing headlines in it, but people find a way to live and have a good time in even the most oppressive circumstances. In spite of the series title, not all of the music was made in Soweto, the sprawling city that grew organically on the edge of officially white Johannesburg. Likewise, while economic stratification in South Africa during this period was severe, don’t come expecting something too gritty—this is hi-fi music recorded on good gear. It’s also almost entirely unknown outside of the communities it was made for; most of these bands don’t yield much information when you look them up online. The pop music of South Africa, for whatever reason, hasn’t received as much attention from Western reissue labels as West and East Africa, so most listeners will find themselves getting acquainted with a whole lot of artists they’ve never heard of before. Almost all of them had something hot to offer, though. The Drive’s ""Ain’t Sittin’ Down Doin’ Nothing"" is a crunching funk instrumental with dive-bombing Moog and a slow-burning horn section, Abafana Bama Soul offers funk underpinned by the four-on-the-floor thump and bouncing basslines of mbaqanga, and the Movers’ ""Soweto Disco"" sounds like an Earth, Wind & Fire on-stage jam. Saitana’s group backing vocals on ""1,2,3"" cloak a pointed political message (""One, two, three, your turn is over/ ...our turn has started"") in disco glitter, and the song builds tension and release with odd key changes and unexpected melodic shifts that mirror the message. During this period South Africans were steeped in American sounds, and the English-descended white population, which tended to be more anti-apartheid and more likely to associate with the black population than the Boer-descended Afrikaners, was well-connected to the British music scene, a connection that sometimes bled over sonically into the townships. Kabasa’s ""Unga Pfula a Chi Pfalo"" is charging heavy funk, but the guitar seems to be on loan from some British hard rock band, and it gives the song a nasty, ass-kicking edge. The cold synths of Damara’s ""Mmamakhabtha"" have an affinity with new romantic synth-pop and sound oddly up-to-date in a post-chillwave world. The excitement of hearing all these tracks for the first time is bolstered somewhat by knowing that this is just a first pass at South Africa’s disco era; there is a lot more to unearth and reassess. If there’s a chink in the armor here, it’s that the sheer amount of music there is to uncover from this place and time suggests that a generalist compilation may ultimately be a less effective way to explore it than to go deeper into the individual scenes and recording companies to find the stories that underlie the music. Nevertheless, Next Stop Soweto Vol. 4 is another well-assembled look at lesser-known music from a very complicated time and place.","This Strut compilation follows the march of underground psych and soul into the disco era. In the process, it gives us a glimpse at the South Africa that grooved under oppression of apartheid.

Beat the Champ,The Mountain Goats,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad3eea9e61561daa609b/1:1/w_160/c73306d0.jpg,2015-04-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20381-beat-the-champ/,Merge,"Take it from French philosopher Roland Barthes, who summarized the appeal of professional wrestling thusly in his landmark essay collection, Mythologies*.* ""What wrestling is above all meant to portray is a purely moral concept: that of justice,"" he wrote. Elemental forces faced off in the form of nearly naked men and women hustling and tussling with each other in the squared circle. There was a good guy and a bad guy, and you cheered for one of them. Since Barthes’ time, professional wrestling has developed in more complex—and some purists would say less satisfying—ways. But John Darnielle, leader of the Mountain Goats, grew up with the old wrestling. ""These were comic-book heroes who existed in physical space,"" he writes of his formative fandom in the promotional copy for Beat the Champ, the band’s new album. ""I was a child. I needed them, and, every week, they came through for me."" Darnielle rooted for the heroes. His stepfather, who he’s memorialized as a troublesome if not frequently terrifying presence in many Mountain Goats songs, rooted for the villains. Beat the Champ is not about Darnielle’s relationship with his stepfather. Instead, it’s about those men and women who were the wrestlers of his childhood, and what they went through while bringing him and children like him their weekly entertainment. These wrestlers don’t make appearances on ""Today"". Like the hero of ""Southwestern Territory"", they suffer long drives between sleepy towns for the promise of a few bucks and a patchy broadcast on black-and-white TV. Darnielle crawls inside their heads, his voice switching between his recognizably nasal drill and a tender lower register as he chronicles their camaraderie and willingness to hurl their bodies into each other. The Mountain Goats have been a proper band for more than a decade, and Darnielle is once again backed by the sturdy rhythm section of Peter Hughes and Jon Wurster, who push him forward without getting in his way. The horns from 2012’s Transcendental Youth return on ""Foreign Object"", in which Darnielle acts out a promo—those speeches where wrestlers shout threats and taunts at each other—by vowing that he ""personally will stab you in the eye"" with an improvised shiv made from tape. The rest of the record isn’t as brassy as ""Foreign Object"", an obvious crowd-pleaser, but it’s occasionally as bold. Darnielle’s exhortations on ""Choked Out"" channel the bloodlust of a wrestler ready to risk it all for fame. The down-tuned, menacing ""Werewolf Gimmick"" echoes ""Psalms 40:2"" from 2009’s The Life of the World to Come as it eulogizes those ""nameless bodies in unremembered rooms,"" the arrangement rumbling like a car coming apart at the screws. ""Stabbed to Death Outside San Juan"", which loosely tells the story of real-life wrestler Bruiser Brody (who, yes, was stabbed to death outside San Juan) unfolds like a radio play, as Darnielle’s speak-song delivery is intermittently interrupted by a tremendous crash of strings and organs. These songs describe the psychological states of the wrestlers (""I try to remember what life was like long ago/ But it’s gone, you know?"", from ""Southwestern Territory"") but they also find ways to fit into the mythology of Darnielle’s life. That tyrannical stepfather does pop up on lead single ""The Legend of Chavo Guerrero"", which narrates the title character's life from Darnielle's young eyes. The case for Chavo as Darnielle’s personal hero is as earnest as it is heart-tugging, and it explains why he made this record: ""You let me down, but Chavo never once did/ You called him names to try to get beneath my skin/ Now your ashes are scattered on the wind."" One of Darnielle’s premier talents as a musician is his ability to cast personal mantras as singalong anthems. At his best, his songs feel as essential as water. Mountain Goats fans will testify to the healing powers of standing arm-to-arm with hundreds of people while shouting ""I am going to make it through this year if it kills me."" Beat the Champ, however, eschews universality by coming from such a specific point of view. You don't necessarily need to know what a heel turn is in order to connect with ""Heel Turn 2"", but it doesn't hurt. There’s a noble simplicity to these songs, though, reflecting Darnielle’s warm memories of his wrestling fandom. The respect he has for these men and women, and what they must have been through, is obvious. On ""Unmasked!"", a wrestler sings to his costumed opponent, whom he's about to defeat and subsequently unmask before the world. For wrestlers who choose to perform with a mask, hiding their real face is everything. To reveal it is an incredibly serious act. But the pressure of maintaining this illusion for the dwindling crowds has gotten to this anonymous masked man, who is ready to move on. ""By way of honoring the things we once both held dear, I will reveal you,"" his opponent sings. When you’re a kid, what’s happening on TV isn’t very complicated. Then, you grow up and learn the truth.","The Mountain Goats' new LP is dedicated to John Darnielle's childhood pro-wrestling heroes, using the particulars of their lives to explore his own personal mythology.

Living Daylight,Michael Rault,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad0c5e6ef959693219f7/1:1/w_160/dd7d0f9a.jpg,2015-04-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20347-living-daylight/,Burger,"When Michael Rault first emerged out of Edmonton, Alberta five years ago, he resembled the sort of matinee-idol rock star his country doesn’t really produce anymore, with a stylish, Ray-Ban-wrapped look and preference for retro album-cover design that blatantly advertised his allegiance to early rock ‘n’ roll pioneers like Buddy Holly and The Everly Brothers.  His initial ascent was guided through established industry channels by Pirates Blend, the Sony Canada-affiliated imprint founded by reggae-pop hitmakers Bedouin Soundclash (aka the proto-Magic! of the mid-2000s). But since relocating to Toronto in 2012, Rault has been acting more like the high-school heartthrob with straight-A grades and football-scholarship potential who ditched class to drop acid with the freaks beneath the bleachers. After sharing bills and making friends with local eccentrics like Slim Twig, U.S. Girls, Actual Water, and Young Guv, it's probably no coincidence that Rault’s hair has gotten longer and greasier, his clothes more torn, and his face more razor-resistant. But most importantly, his traditionalism has been corrupted into wonderfully woozy, glitter-speckled power pop. Rault’s recently Tuffened-up sound makes him a natural fit on the roster of California’s Burger Records, a veritable Disneyland for retro-gazing rough-cat rockers. While Living Daylight was initially released last year in Canada on Pirates Blend in seven-song EP form, this enlarged 10-song version is being promoted by Burger as Rault’s proper introduction to the world. (His current website noticeably downplays his earlier discography.) Rault belongs to a growing legion of modern-day garage-spawned rockers—The Smith Westerns and Foxygen among them—who seem less interested in mining the standard British Invasion/Nuggets/CBGB continuum than the phenomena that sprung up between those movements: bubblegum, glam, Rundgrenian soft-rock, solo-Beatle solipsism. Recorded partially at home and in an Edmonton studio with Rault’s cousin Renny Wilson, Living Daylight strikes a playfully wobbly balance between in-the-room rawness and cerebral strangeness. And when Rault pounces on the fuzz pedal—like on the T. Rex boogie of “Real Love (Yeah)” or the Plastic Ono blues of “Hiding From a Heartache”—the ensuing distortion feels less decorative than rhythmic, like the subliminal rev of a car motor. Rault’s simple lyrics sound as if they belong to a more innocent era, but while he may stick to tried ‘n’ true themes of looking for love and/or losing it, he’s as adept at conveying the hormonal frustration of the former (the taut, soul-stompin’ “All Alone (On My Own)”) as the crestfallen pathos of the latter (the lush, candlelit ballad “Lovers Lie”). The three additional tracks on this new edition are dropped right into the middle of the original tracklisting, and they reinforce the perception that the record’s strongest songs are still its original ones. The expanded format is more of an opportunity for Rault to retrofit some of his back catalogue with his new sound: “I Wanna Love You” toughens up a sock-hop romp from Rault’s 2010 debut Ma-Me-O, while the sneering  ""Suckcess"" is thrust into a “Jeepster” drag race. But Rault’s experimentation never tips over into excess: with songs kept to a tight three-minute average, and the singer’s winsome way with melody anchoring each, Living Daylight shows that it’ll take more than unkempt hair and production trickery to obscure Rault’s essential charms.","Michael Rault trades in his earlier persona, which telegraphed a devotion to early rock ‘n’ roll, for wonderfully woozy, glitter-speckled power pop. Living Daylight was initially released last year in Canada on Pirates Blend in seven-song EP form, this enlarged 10-song version is being promoted by Burger as Rault’s proper introduction to the world.

The Tacoma band’s new release This Is the Sonics is their first studio album of all-new material in 49 years, and that fact alone is staggering. What’s even more remarkable, though, is how one of garage rock’s most legendary bands has dared to test their legend by making a record that spits, snarls, drools, honks, wails, and screams as if it were 1966 all over again. Granted, recording with Jim Diamond doesn’t hurt. The former Dirtbombs bassist and famed producer of the White Stripes’ self-titled debut spares no grime or fuzz. The album was recorded mono, live in the studio. “Bad Betty”, the most powerful original composition on the album, hints at the rock-appropriated folklore of Black Betty in its title while remaining gleefully ignorant of anything except how to pound a riff into the ground in execution. Vocalist/keyboardist Jerry Roslie sings of the wild, leather-clad woman who puts his own savagery to shame, the septeguenarian whooping and screeching like a tomcat in heat. Roslie is joined by fellow founding members Larry Parypa on guitar and vocals and Rob Lind on saxophone and vocals; the lineup is rounded out by bassist Freddie Dennis (a veteran of the Kingsmen, one of the Sonics’ Pacific Northwest garage-rock brethren in the ’60s) and drummer Dusty Watson. Together they lock into a single-minded, almost monomaniacal unit, pulverizing numbers like “Be a Woman” and “Spend the Night” into lumps of distorted, house-wrecking lust. Roslie’s voice, though, is the star. Still steeped in the R&B of his youth, his corroded pipes—which produced godlike shrieks on ’60s Sonics classics like “Strychnine”, “The Witch”, and “Have Love Will Travel”—sound somehow rawer. R&B informed the Sonics’ unhinged passion from the get-go, and This Is the Sonics pays proper homage to the group’s roots. Willie Dixon’s “You Can’t Judge a Book by the Cover”—by way of Bo Diddley’s iconic version—is given a giddy workout, with Lind’s sax squawking nauseously over a jackhammer backbeat. Eddie Holland’s “Leaving Here” gets similar treatment; the fact that it’s one of garage rock’s most threadbare standards doesn’t keep the Sonics from putting a fresh coat of paint on it. The best cover on the album, though, is of Hank Ballard and the Midnighters’ “Look at Little Sister”, whose hoot-and-holler horniness is rendered simultaneously sleazy and boyish. Less successful is a rendition of The Kinks' “The Hard Way”, which the Sonics rip through a little too quickly for the melody to survive intact. No song on This Is the Sonics summarizes the band’s grizzled, miraculous resurrection like “Save the Planet”. In it, they thumb their noses at the hippie platitudes that helped render garage rock (briefly) extinct in the ’60s; Parypa’s bluesy, sneering riff is more of a taunt than a hook, and Roslie makes it crystal clear why he believes Earth should be preserved: “We have to save the planet / It’s the only one with beer!” King Khan, one of the Sonics’ most faithful spiritual offspring, couldn’t have put it better himself. The Sonics’ children are legion, and every generation of garage rockers owes them. Roslie and crew surely know this, but from the timeless sound of This Is the Sonics, they might just as well be oblivious to their legacy. Legacies are for the dead. The Sonics are alive and viciously well.","This Is the Sonics is their first studio album of all-new material by the garage-rock pioneers in 49 years, but what’s even more remarkable is how one of garage rock’s most legendary bands has dared to test their legend by making a record that spits, snarls, drools, honks, wails, and screams as if it were 1966 all over again.

Ludaversal,Ludacris,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad345e6ef95969321a36/1:1/w_160/a0e58819.jpg,2015-04-03 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20373-ludaversal/,EMIDef Jam,"At the Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber, Kevin Hart introduced Ludacris as “one of the most successful rappers of 2001.” It was a joke premised on a few things: Luda's age, maybe, or his drift from the rap world as he moves deeper into his acting career. (He is now a two-time Fast & Furious franchise cast member.) Regardless, it was an accurate, if incomplete, descriptor: In the early-’00s glory days of throwback jerseys and meticulous cornrows, Ludacris led a wave of Atlanta-helmed rap into crossover success, transforming dancefloors around the world into microcosms of the city’s sound. Without staunchly regionalist classics like the libidinous Shawnna-starring “What’s Your Fantasy” and instant mosh pit starter “Southern Hospitality”, there would likely be no so-called New Atlanta, the catchall term for the landscape of boundlessly engaging rappers like Future, Migos, and Father’s Awful Records crew. Ludacris’ ninth album, Ludaversal, is his first in five years, and it’s a not-very-subtle attempt at testing his staying power against this backdrop. “They say Luda don't want it no mo’ / Nah, nigga, I'm as hungry as the first day,” he raps on the album’s opener, over a double-time beat courtesy of David Banner. I’m still here, seems to be the 37-year-old’s cri de coeur on Ludaversal, as he meditates on the music industry and his place within it. Luda is one of the most technically inventive rappers of his era, with lithe, adaptable flows, but he emerges on Ludaversal as an unlikely hip-hop traditionalist, at times sounding like an ""Empire"" approximation of himself. Despite production from current-day heavy hitters like Da Internz and Mike WiLL Made It, he still comes off like a relic from the past, the class clown who never quite grew up. When they don’t land, the jokes and double-entendres are egregious, landing with a practically audible Amirite? Notable example: “I leave rappers confused like Will.i.am’s barber” on “Beast Mode.” Sandwiched in the album’s first half, apropos of nothing, is a skit called “Viagra”, a recording of a 911 phone call placed by a man with an ostensibly never-ending erection. There are some high points, though: In interviews Luda has described the project as his most personal yet—that’s often a marketing phrase bandied about too generously, but it rings true in this case. On songs like “Grass Is Always Greener” and “Charge It to the Rap Game,” he grapples with the downsides of fame; for every luxury he can afford, he has to contend with a money-grubbing family member or a vicious press mechanism that feeds on celebrity gossip. “Ocean Skies,” a song about his father’s fatal alcoholism and his own struggles with substance abuse, is the album's centerpiece, but, like much of Ludaversal, the value is in his emotional honesty, not his execution. Rap fans with memories of the early ‘00s will always have a fondness for Ludacris, and it’s hard not to want to root for him. It’s never a bad thing, exactly, to hear his voice on a track, even a silly one. But on Ludaversal, I can’t help but think of Young Thug’s casual yet searing critique of Jay Z in a recent GQ interview: ""If you're 30, 40 years old, you're not getting listened to by minors.”","Ludaversal, Ludacris' first album in five years, is a not-very-subtle attempt at testing his staying power against the current crop of boundlessly engaging Atlanta rappers.  Despite production from current-day heavy hitters like Da Internz and Mike WiLL Made It, he still comes off like a relic from the past, the class clown who never quite grew up.

Deeper,The Soft Moon,by: T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad6bc0084474cd0c1709/1:1/w_160/247c79b6.jpg,2015-04-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20411-deeper/,Captured Tracks,"Because there will always be miserable teenagers and because nihilism and disaffection are just as much a part of the human condition as falling in love, there will always be a place—and a market—for explorations of abject darkness set to music. Since 2010, Luis Vasquez of the Soft Moon has twisted his personal demons into songs, quietly breathing new life into gothy post-punk. On his new album, Deeper, he pushes his foreboding synth-pop even further. Given the nature of Vasquez’s music, it’s almost too perfect that Deeper was recorded in seclusion in the mountains of Italy at a studio simply called Hate. Even though the Soft Moon has always essentially been a one-man show, the tracks on Deeper are light years beyond the fuzzy bedroom recordings on the project’s 2010 debut. Working alongside producer Maurizio Baggio, Vasquez has married his old school goth pop sensibilities (imagine a dalliance between NIN’s The Downward Spiral, Depeche Mode’s Black Celebration, and Chris & Cosey’s Songs of Love and Lust) with production that positions the album firmly in the now. He still lays a thick sonic fog over these tracks but the songs operate with a kind of icy precision, leading to a record is both unrelentingly dark and amazingly fastidious. Like its predecessors, Deeper leans more heavily on overall mood than it does on obvious hooks, but there are catchy moments. “Far” is the kind of hyper-morose electro pop that wouldn’t have been out of place making kids pogo at the Batcave back in the early ’80s, while “Wrong” has the kind of jackhammering synths and stuttering beats that could have dropped off an old Nitzer Ebb single. But Deeper is more than a collection of cleverly assembled references. It splits the difference between the more glacial dirges (“Without”, “Wasting”) and intricately-layered synth tracks (“Feel”, “Black”) without feeling too turgid or weighed down by the record’s decidedly bleak subject matter. Vasquez himself remains a kind of cipher—a detached vocal presence too often content to float along the periphery of the songs. When he abandons the processed vocals or the Reznor-esque sing/speak and let’s his voice come through, the results are often surprising. On “Wasting” when he ominously intones “You’ve gotta take life by the hand/ Let the substance close you in/ Hope to one day come alive,” it provides what is one of the album’s few moments of emotional reprieve. And the record occasionally suffers a fate common to aggressively “dark” music—the lyrics, though undoubtedly deeply personal, tread a fine line between effectively bracing and the stuff of bad teenage poetry. Occasional goth clichés aside, Deeper is a thing of beauty. Few contemporary artists have managed such a clever reimagining of post-punk and spooky new wave in a way that sounds both familiar and somehow fresh. Nowhere on Deeper is this more evident than on the album’s closing track, “Being”, a six-minute stunner that builds from bits of collaged tape loops and whispers before evolving into a pulsing industrial track and ultimately exploding into a wall of white noise as Vasquez screams “I can’t see my face/ I don’t know where I am.” For an artist who seems hell-bent on finding new ways to take listeners somewhere both beautiful and frightening, the song’s final three minutes of hiss and roiling noise seems like a perfectly appropriate place to end up.","Since 2010, Louis Vasquez of the Soft Moon has twisted his personal demons into songs, quietly breathing new life into gothy post-punk. New album Deeper finds him with his most assured production yet.

Escape From Evil,Lower Dens,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ac5313d1975652139d55/1:1/w_160/76d67361.jpg,2015-04-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20213-escape-from-evil/,Ribbon Music,"Lower Dens have toyed with the raw pleasure of pop music in the past, but they’ve never embraced it like this. Three years ago, the Baltimore band’s standout single ""Brains"" shone as a melodic gem inside the largely experimental Nootropics; now, on the band’s third album, core songwriter Jana Hunter embraces open, ringing melodies. Like a lot of current music, Escape From Evil siphons its aesthetic from the storied pop of the '80s, but it’s not content to stop at homage. Lower Dens use the past—its clichés and its innocence—as a lens through which to imagine a queer and open future. As an aesthetic reservoir, the '80s continue to feed an abundance of nostalgia, from the American highway fantasies of the War on Drugs to Twin Shadow’s boy-meets-girl melodramas. Inhabiting characters from the past can lend a singer a certain gravitas; unburdened by modern irony, big emotions play bigger on a decades-old frame. But few artists have seized that retrospection as an opportunity to flip the power dynamics that governed pop culture 30 years ago. For Lower Dens, a neon palette serves as fertile ground for subversion. Hunter absorbs the range of gendered feeling from Billy Idol to Bonnie Tyler, emerging as a bandleader capable of flipping effortlessly between extremes of masculine aggression and feminine yearning. The word ""genderfluid"" didn’t exist 30 years ago, but it’s a useful term for gripping the edges of this new work. The video for the album’s lead single ""To Die in L.A."" works almost as a queer retelling of William Friedkin’s 1985 drama To Live and Die in L.A., complete with characters that aren’t cast based on their actors’ birth-assigned gender. Hunter appears as a masculine presence in a buzz cut and suit to glower at the video’s lead femme, who’s vying for movie stardom; in the clip’s last image, the main character sets fire to a painting of herself, then she and Hunter gaze into the flames as it burns away. The video is full of ambiguous, evocative imagery, and Escape From Evil also runs thick with powerful, slippery emotions. While Hunter seems more enamored of radio hits by the likes of Gary Numan and Flock of Seagulls here, Lower Dens never quite settle into an easy genre hook. A krautrock chug left over from 2012’s Nootropics powers ""Company"", where Hunter assumes the role of anonymous authority figure with lines like ""you look really uncomfortable if I might be honest"" and ""we just want to help."" You can hear the same smirk that Mike Patton wore on Faith No More’s ""Land of Sunshine"", the same glee in inhabiting a vague malice disguised as aid. Hunter is a charismatic singer willing to deal in grand, sweeping gestures and also idiosyncratic specifics. Escape From Evil is a vivid world of queer retrofuturism, a wide open space that offers access the emotionality of the recent past without subscribing to its violence. Hunter embraces retro-pop as a channel of escape from the power that routes us in our mundane outer lives. In the world of this album, no one will tell you who to be or where to go; it’s all yours to become.","Lower Dens' Escape From Evil siphons its aesthetic from the storied pop of the '80s, but it's not content to stop at homage. The Baltimore band uses the past, its clichés and its innocence, as a lens through which to imagine a queer and open future.

Director,Yonatan Gat,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad32ea9e61561daa6088/1:1/w_160/8e9411e1.jpg,2015-04-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20372-director/,Joyful Noise,"In the much-missed Monotonix, guitarist Yonatan Gat was the anchor, the guy gamely riffing away while his bandmates hoisted themselves aloft in garbage pails or stuffed microphones into their pants. But being the straight man in a band like Monotonix still makes you the wildest guy in most any other room, and Gat's post-Monotonix music is clearly the product of a frenzied, restless spirit. Director, the second record from Gat's eponymous trio, was recorded over three marathon 12-hour sessions with engineer Chris Woodhouse, best known for his work with one-take wonders Thee Oh Sees and Ty Segall. A series of freewheeling jams were eventually whittled down to a lean 29 minutes and change, then mingled with field recordings the well-traveled Gat collected over the years. The results are all over the place in every sense of the phrase, a frequently dazzling display of the trio's impressively far-flung influences. To listen to Director is to feel yourself barreling forward; riffs don't so much unfurl as fly by and songs seem to vanish almost as soon as they appear. Director's constant motion makes it a particularly tough record to pin down for more than a few seconds at a time; in less than half an hour, Gat and company touch on everything from bossa nova to soukous, Tortoise-style jazz-rock to the head-swimming spazz-outs of Ponytail. Director is conversant not just in many styles, but many languages; centerpiece ""North to South"", for instance, features lyrics in Hebrew, Portuguese, and English. The Israeli-born Gat and Gal Lazer and the Brazilian Sergio Sayeg bring a remarkably vast number of styles to the table here, gleefully recombining them as they go. And you need not know how to suss out a Phyrgian scale or tell your son from your samba to dig into Director; this is a world party, respectful of tradition but unafraid to throw everything in a blender and gulp. Gat has technical prowess to spare, but he's less concerned about getting things exactly right; there's a seat-of-their-pants feel to the whole of Director, the occasional near-flub a product of their refusal to slow down for any length of time. While Sayeg stays deep in the pocket, Lazer's drums—with cues from Gene Krupa, John Bonham and Tony Allen—and Gat's guitar either tussle like dogs and crackle like flint. Vocals, used sparingly, are often sunk low in the mix. This, combined with Gat's conversational field recordings, gives Director the feel of driving past a bustling street scene with the windows down; you can feel the radiance in the air, even if you're moving just a little too quickly to quite put your finger on it. Despite its sitcom-length runtime, Director manages to feel maybe 10 minutes shorter, so rarely does it pause to fully soak in the scenery. For all its energy, Director ends not with a bang, but with a floorward collapse. The brief, diffuse ""Underwater Prelude"" seems designed to provide a respite from the calamity that precedes it, but it only ends up sapping the built-up momentum. The skronky ""L'Atlantis"" sounds like the intro to a Sonic Youth song that never fully gets itself off the ground. And closer ""Tanto Que Nem Tem"", with a lovely, mournful vocal turn from Sayeg, is punctuated by bursts of noise that distract where they're meant to disorient. Still, the wildness of the ride Director takes you on more than makes up for this rocky landing.","In the much-missed Monotonix, guitarist Yonatan Gat was the anchor, but his music since is clearly the product of a frenzied, restless spirit.

The Iron Way,T-Pain,by: Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad8eb1335d7bf1699c09/1:1/w_160/a13c9e47.jpg,2015-04-02 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20438-the-iron-way/,self-released,"T-Pain has always been misunderstood, from the moment he crooned his way onto America’s airwaves with the sweet, surprising ""I’m Sprung"" a decade ago. The misunderstandings may have stemmed from his association with Auto-Tune, a program misunderstood by nearly everyone. Some complained and covered their ears, while helpful rockists pointed out that Peter Frampton had a talking guitar in the '70s. Everyone else—almost literally everyone else, at least on the radio—began sounding like him. Through it all T-Pain remained steadfast—a guy who was singing and rapping before marrying the two was something you had to do to be relevant, and whose primary instrument made him a target. But far from being a doormat, he made the best joke about himself with the Lonely Island, and then made devastating observation that the ""mockery"" of his type of music was nominated for a Grammy, but not his actual music. And then there was ""D.O.A."" And then there was The-Dream, the Weeknd, and most importantly, Future and a new wave of Atlanta rap. And you know who wasn’t there? Mr. Tallahassee Pain. He disappeared. He started dressing like a steampunk villain around 2011. A few mixtapes a few years ago didn’t move the needle. There was ""Up Down (Do This All Day)"", a fantastic collaboration with B.o.B that appeared and disappeared just as quickly. There was Tiny Desk T-Pain, aka, ""oh he can really sing!"" T-Pain, which despite pandering to the lowest form of pop authenticity-baiting, accomplished the feat of momentarily reminding us: Hey, this is a real human, and this human can sing. It was endearing and impressive. There was sad T-Pain, regaling us with truly heartbreaking stories about his taking all his negative press and industry guff to heart. Finally, there is new T-Pain. T-Pain is back! For a guy with this career trajectory, the results on The Iron Way, his first slab of new music in a little over two years, are unsurprising. He remains somewhat anonymous in spite of his sound’s ubiquity, and his mixtape is essentially straight down the middle half-killer, half-filler. Where all the weirder, more free-thinking Auto-Tune visionaries in his wake took the sound and spun it into new directions, T-Pain is content to still warble T-Pain songs. The best ones are cavernous slaps about drinking, strip clubs, and heartbreak, and the second best ones are the more upbeat and sprightly slaps about drinking, strip clubs, and heartbreak. Which is to say: T-Pain is not, and has never really been, a person I want to hear rap. The weakest songs on The Iron Way push that rapping to the forefront, to often-awkward and clumsy results. This includes all the songs with features from Young Cash, Sean Jay, Bun B and Big K.R.I.T., Yo Gotti and Snootie Wild, OG Maco, Migos and K Camp. There is a song called ""The King"", and it features Bun B and Big K.R.I.T.: Don’t you already know exactly how it sounds? The best songs on The Iron Way are the ones that establish an appropriate vibe for the subject matter. The sunny weed ode ""Need to Be Smokin"", the straight up power romance ballad ""Heartbeat"". T-Pain soars on ""Let Ya Hair Down"", a seductive track featuring The-Dream, a long-overdue collaboration that is the perfect union between two guys with great voices who love to twist and turn those voices into new shapes. And usually they sing about sex: On ""Booty Butt Ass"",  T-Pain manages to quote ""Oh my God Becky"" in a chorus that doesn’t feel corny, and then in the outro, he morphs the mood of the song from ""strip club turn up"" to ""crying in the champagne room."" It’s a mesmerizing two minutes, partly because it’s the most outre moment on a pretty straightforward tape. If everyone else is getting emotional in the club, why not the guy who arguably started the trend over a decade ago? This isn’t to paint T-Pain into a corner, just to say that maybe the reason he's battled anonymity over his long career is because he gave us everything we needed on ""I’m Sprung"" (and two years later, ""Buy U A Drank""). Other guys took his ""thing"" and made it weirder or sexier or more avant garde. But he’s been content, behind a sheepish smile and many features over the years, to continue to do his thing. The world is currently run by dudes Auto-Tuning their emotions into weird new places. T-Pain did it first. And when he’s playing to his strengths, he’s arguably doing it better than anyone else.","Rap and R&B is currently run by artists Auto-Tuning their emotions into weird new places.

The Album About Nothing,Wale,by: Claire Lobenfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad7dea9e61561daa6107/1:1/w_160/3bf75029.jpg,2015-04-02 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20425-the-album-about-nothing/,AtlanticMaybach,"Wale’s alignment with the Top 40 rap crowd never felt like a healthy fit. Since his 2011 alliance with Rick Ross’ Maybach Music, the D.C. rapper has found success but has never seemed comfortable with it. And the critical failure of his last album, 2013’s The Gifted, must have shaken him to his core, because at first blush, his latest effort, The Album About Nothing, screams ""return-to-form."" Its title nods to his 2008 ""Seinfeld""-referencing breakout The Mixtape About Nothing, a freebie hosted by Fool’s Gold impresario Nick Catchdubs. This was around the time when the first wave of ""weirdo"" nerd guys like himself, Charles Hamilton, a pre-pop B.o.B and Kid Cudi were springing forward—emotional, obsessed with melody, ambitious, accessible. Wale promptly eschewed that sensibility for guest verses on songs like Waka Flocka Flame’s strip club paean ""No Hands"" and Ross’ my-cum-tastes-good commercial ""Diced Pineapples"". Through it all, he struggled to exude palpable confidence. So what does it mean that after all of this push-and-pull, his fourth studio album finds him gazing back towards his origins? The Album About Nothing begins by holding a mirror to Wale’s past, which reflects some of the trappings of his more-famous present. The intro is informed by go-go, D.C.’s signature reworking of funk, and a sound he used frequently early in his career. And once again, the voice of Jerry Seinfeld acts as commentary, stitching the tracks together thematically.  But Wale doesn’t have to rely on audio clips from ""Seinfeld"" anymore: He has Jerry, himself (the two are friends, and Jerry even name-dropped him as one of his ""top five"" in Top Five) providing the sound bites. On ""The Helium Balloon"", one of the more interesting songs on the album, he laments his reception as an artist, adding ""Still know what my core needs/ So fuck who ignores me."" What follows isn’t so much the diligent fan service all this promises, though, so much as a muddied collage of attempts at current trends and a lot of sour disaffection. In other words: a Wale album. Wale clearly remains frustrated with his inability to ascend to the top tier, and on Nothing he presents himself as a rap-industry antagonist. He burrows into the background of ""The Middle Finger"", revealing his discomfort around other rappers and making a hook out of ""Fuck you, leave me alone."" On ""The Glass Egg"", he opts for cleverness over anger, upending Groove Theory’s ""Tell Me"" and flipping its lyrics (""I’ve been doing my own thing""; ""Tell me if you are for real"") from their original incredulous-about-a-crush context into the cry of an outsider. It works so well that it’s almost surprising no one has done it before. Nothing is a long album, with one cut coming in over the six-minute mark, and when it is sludgy, it is exhausting. The most unfortunate moment is ""The One Time in Houston"", an amateurish attempt at the city’s signature syrupy screw sound. ""The Girls on Drugs"" cleverly samples Janet Jackson’s house party celebration ""Go Deep"", but isn’t packed with enough of Wale’s dour thoughts to sound like he’s doing anything more than cribbing Drake’s If You’re Reading This, It’s Too Late flow. For someone who spends so much time decrying other rappers’ lifestyles, it’s a wonder why he is pantomiming at all. Interpolation is one of the constants of Nothing. ""Balloon"" concludes with a pseudo-dancehall coda loosely riffing on Ini Komoze’s crossover ""Here Comes the Hotstepper"". ""The Success"" borrows from the Eurythmics’ ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"". ""The Body"" fully rips ""You Remind Me of Something"" by R. Kelly, who might not be the best guy to pay homage to in 2015, but when you have Jeremih, an heir to the Chicago R&B throne, on the hook, it’s a little easier to take. ""The Body"" is the last of five romantic songs on the album, most of which fail to captivate: Only on his Usher collaboration ""The Matrimony"", and on the tender ""The Bloom (AG3)"", where he reminds us how good he sounds rapping over a live band, does he sound alive. Wale remains intent on dismantling the public’s sour perception of him, but he doesn’t seem to know how. He wants us to know he’s ""Lil Wayne meets Wayne Perry/ Bad Brains from the go-go"" (""The God Smile"") but he’s loaded his album with the opposite: There are no lyrical acrobatics à la Weezy in his prime, and his reference to Wayne Perry is a head-scratcher because Wale has never purported to be a gangster. He waxes political on the J. Cole-featuring ""The Pessimist"" about the negative perceptions of black America, through the lens of police brutality or ""Love & Hip-Hop"", but is missing the punk fervor of the Bad Brains he namechecks. While there are clear themes throughout the record (love, black experience, a rapper’s malaise), The Album About Nothing is mostly about fear. Fear of becoming an outsider projecting a false hatred of the inside, fear of pushing musical boundaries to nurture one’s own creativity, fear of being vulnerable and, thusly, denying his listeners access to himself. If Wale could only shatter those walls and deliver an album where he no longer sounds like a caricature of himself—it’s no wonder he loves ""Seinfeld""—he might finally get back the amnesty he has been so desperately grasping at for the past five years. All he has now is Nothing to lose.","After the push-and-pull of his MMG years, Wale gazes back towards his past on his fourth album, nodding to his 2008 ""Seinfeld""-referencing breakout The Mixtape About Nothing and attempting to recast his audience's perception of him.

His nuanced craftsmanship served as a buffer against Ben Gibbard’s increasingly broad and bland songwriting on recent LPs Narrow Stairs and Codes & Keys, but Walla ""long[ed] for the unknown"" and Gibbard felt the band was becoming stagnant and ""self-referential"". Though Walla contributes guitar and electronic collage to the band's eighth LP Kintsugi, he abdicates the producer’s role for the first time in the band’s history—in his stead is a proper big-budget pop guy, the preposterously and perfectly named Rich Costey (Muse, Foster the People, Chvrches). But it wouldn’t have mattered if DJ Mustard or Steve Albini produced Kintsugi: as with Codes & Keys, Gibbard promises reinvention and continues to play against his strengths without developing new ones. Gibbard’s desire to write from a less personal standpoint is understandable, considering the widespread misunderstanding that any song in the first-person has to be autobiographical—his private life is a matter of public record these days, and surely he’s grown tired of having to clarify that wasn’t him eating Thanksgiving dinner in a suburban Denver Catholic church after dad bounced or treating that girl from Silver Lake like complete shit. But even when Gibbard was clearly writing in character, the sketches were personalized, and therein lay the genius of his work—he had an uncanny ability to see things as others might, penning deeply felt and detailed lyrics, willing to risk certain sentiments and awkward phrasings to reward the listener with a richer, more complex and relatable experience. They were someone’s stories. This is why Death Cab for Cutie played the KeyArena in Seattle and not, say, Matt Pond PA or Rogue Wave or any of their other peers from the ""O.C. indie"" era. But Gibbard's change in approach hasn't coincided with a change of subject; Death Cab for Cutie has not developed a political conscience, nor is Gibbard suddenly experimenting with tone poems. The same relationship breakdowns and travelogues captured on The Photo Album have gone big screen as Gibbard strives for universal, one-feel-fits-all songs meant to be shared but not owned. Take ""Little Wanderer"", where the narrator (not Gibbard, y’all) is stuck at home and the girl is showing him pictures of her very commonplace vacation spots (Tokyo and Paris) through Messenger. Gibbard knows how to wring pathos out of long-distance relationships; he invented a damn word for it. He can also tease out how technological improvements in communication can leave even more unsaid. And yet, here’s the chorus: ""You’re my wanderer, little wanderer/ Off across the sea/ You’re my wanderer, little wanderer/ Won’t you wander back to me?"" It’s startling, almost amusing, to hear a hackneyed line like that cutting against the stonefaced sobriety of his delivery and plangent reverbed guitars—every pejorative stereotype of Death Cab becomes true for four minutes. And yet Gibbard also indulges some explicit nostalgia for older Death Cab—during the climactic kiss in the baggage claim, the song reveals itself as basically fan-fic to the video for ""A Movie Script Ending"". This spark of recognition happens far too often on Kintsugi, resulting in songs that just sound like an impersonal reading of better ones from the past. Solo acoustic centerpiece ""Hold No Guns"" wants badly to be Kintsugi’s ""I Will Follow You Into the Dark"", but the narrator pleads harmlessness rather than ""til death do us part and then some"" devotion. ""Binary Sea"" makes a blatant metaphorical callback to the planetary myth-making of  ""Transatlanticism"" and a number of previous weepy closers (""Stable Song"", ""A Lack of Color""). The lightly chiding tone and basic structure of  ""Your Heart Is an Empty Room"" is reprised for ""Everything’s a Ceiling""—little of Kintsugi gives the impression that Gibbard’s motivation to reboot Death Cab is matched by legitimate inspiration. The newly luxurious production sets Costey up as a convenient scapegoat; ""Everything’s a Ceiling"" and ""Good Help (Is So Hard to Find)"" are the newest sounds here, and they recall the pop-funk Silly Putty of the 1975 or the Neighbourhood, both of whom are currently competing with Death Cab for KROQ spins. Otherwise, Kintsug**i sounds not altogether different than Plans, with Costey's chromed-out glossiness subbed in for Walla's fragile glassiness. Costey keeps Gibbard’s voice as high as possible in the mix, just as Walla would have; the sole exception is the distorted cloak on late-album highlight ""Ingenue"", which is the one track that makes good on Death Cab’s hope to integrate electronic influences like Flying Lotus and Jon Hopkins without just sounding like the Postal Service. In the context of the full album, this just feels like their latest well-meaning, but ultimately empty promise of a cred infusion (see also: Can, Brian Eno). ""Kintsugi"" actually refers to a Japanese style of art where broken ceramics are fused together with gold, an apt metaphor but a weirdly honest one. And yet, when Kintsugi gets broken into individual pieces, there are heirlooms worth treasuring. Advance singles ""No Room in Frame"" and ""The Ghosts of Beverly Drive"" are where Gibbard remembers to write great Death Cab for Cutie songs the way he knows how—zooming on important specifics that speak on a larger idea, trying to make sense of newly formed concepts as he’s explaining them to someone else, rather than starting with the most broad, market-tested metaphors. Maybe it’s not Gibbard driving down I-5 through Fresno Valley, maybe it’s not him doomed to live with regrets in a city he still harbors resentments towards. It probably is, but at least Gibbard is willing to share some of himself while leaving plenty to the imagination. It also helps that these songs deliver Death Cab’s proprietary chorus melodies, winding, thrilling and sunlit like the Pacific Coast Highway of which Gibbard sings so fondly. But I get it: Death Cab for Cutie have gone platinum, they’ve hit #1 on Billboard, they’ve been nominated for a Grammy and lost to ""My Humps"", they’ve played the former NBA arena in the city where they started and now they’ll play the Hollywood Bowl in Gibbard’s new home. If he’s straining to go against his instincts by writing self-explanatory songs like ""Good Help (Is So Hard to Find)"" and ""You’ve Haunted Me All My Life"" with equally pat arrangements and melodies, well, he’s got cheap seats to reach now. But after 12 years of hearing him repeat ""I need you so much closer"" ad infinitum, that line never hurt more than it does now.","Kintsugi is Death Cab's first album without Chris Walla. It was produced by Rich Costey, who has worked with Muse and Foster the People, and though it has been framed as a new beginning, little of Kintsugi gives the impression that Gibbard’s motivation to reboot Death Cab is matched by legitimate inspiration.

Dark Energy,Jlin,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad9eb1335d7bf1699c29/1:1/w_160/5d22f88f.jpg,2015-04-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20450-dark-energy/,Planet Mu,"Menace is a sensation endemic to footwork, the Chicago-borne genre of heart-racing house music that is predicated on going harder and better than anyone else on the floor. Dark Energy, the first album from Gary, Ind. producer Jlin, hints at this idea of combativeness, bending all matter of percussion, vocal clips and pre-existing ideas about footwork into submission. Jlin’s talked about the mediocrity that can result from working from a happy place, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t some joy at work in her music—it’s found in the process of creating and, for listeners, in the release of the dancefloor. That sly flip—the thrill and release in activating anger—is the emotional ingenuity in Jlin’s music. It’s a certain mindfulness she has in common with Rick Owens, who used her music—and that of pioneering footworker RP Boo—for his FW 2014/15 Paris Fashion Week show. Grim, monochrome upper; mind-altering interior. Dark Energy has all the hallmarks of footwork—its frenzied pacing, arrhythmic kick drums, a graphic command of blank space—executed with clear-eyed self-determination. This gives the album an opaque, thoughtful quality. It's Jlin’s first release, centered around a track that first went live in 2010 (""Erotic Heart""), which means she’s had time to think about what she’s doing and, more importantly, what she is not doing. While working shifts at one of Gary’s many large steel mills, Jlin spent months perfecting the music, including songs like ""Guantanamo"",  which cleaves hair-raising dialogue from The Ring with a grip of pin-sharp synths. Her tenacity feels even more significant when you consider that she’s a woman working in the man-saturated field of electronic production, and footwork in particular. For women, producer’s anonymity is both gift and curse. A bunch of these song titles also invite loose contemplation on narratives of blackness, and/or racialized peoples. ""Black Diamond"" and “Black Ballet” scan more literally, whereas songs like “Guantanamo,” “Ra” and “Mansa Musa” prompt ideas about history, mythology, imprisonment, culture wars and a clash of civilizations. Jlin doesn’t editorialize, and this record isn’t specifically about identity politics. But she’s from Gary, a blue collar, black-majority city, making a record within a genre created for and by African-Americans at a time when the non-white citizenry is growing increasingly restless and hella loud about owning its art and likeness, its safety and life expectancy. Dark Energy has absorbed some of the shock. It has knowledge of self. Throw it onto the list of recent albums, like Heems’ Eat Pray Thug and Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp A Butterfly, that take personal, political and temporal stock of our lives and refuse to be one-dimensional in chronicling these experiences. This sense of brooding becomes music that feels venomous. ""Mansa Musa""—the name of a prominent ruler and cultural benefactor of the Mali Empire—clarifies Dark Energy’s happy-scary tension best. Halfway through the album, its fizzy, midtempo gait feels like a break from the intensity. But it’s a feint. Effervescent synths and skeletal drums lift the song up only to have a descending bassline and stiff snares prick its rise, sending it flopping to its death like a deflated balloon. With the exception of vocal snippets, which appear frequently, Jlin doesn’t bother with traditional sampling. She’s generated her own instrumentation: from the winding, symphonic piano loop that opens the album on ""Black Ballet"" and the atonal moan of a Chinese erhu violin on ""Unknown Tongues"" to the guttural synths that skim the bottom of ""Ra"". Like Jlin it’s unconventional, particularly within footwork. Her homespun mutation of the genre feels like she’s staging an interrogation, and there’s the sense of threat: What do you feel when you hear the hollowed-out militant stomp and shiver of ""Black Diamond""? What physical realm does this song slip into and out of as pinched, tweaked-out synths whirr ecstatically to life then stop? Are you having fun yet?","Dark Energy, the first release from the Indiana footwork producer Jlin, contains all the hallmarks of the heart-racing house music subgenre—frenzied pacing, arrhythmic kick drums, a graphic command of blank space—but executed with a clear-eyed self-determination. The music's happy/scary tension taps into the thrill and release in activating anger.

It Follows OST,Disasterpeace,by: Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad8013d1975652139f50/1:1/w_160/9f92ceef.jpg,2015-04-01 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20427-it-follows-ost/,Milan,"It Follows is a classic boy-meet-girls story, only the boy is using a fake name, the girl doesn’t know, and after they sleep together it turns out he’s passed more than fluids—specifically, a curse that makes her the target of an unstoppable, unmerciful demon. The demon takes human form; it can’t be seen by anyone but the cursed, and those who’ve previously borne the curse. (It only targets one person at a time.) It doesn’t run—it walks, stopping only when it’s in range for a vicious attack that leaves the victim’s limbs snapped, and their pelvises crushed by coital rage. It can’t open doors, but it knows how to knock. It’s the dark presence behind one of the more gripping horror movies of recent memory, as well as a fantastic argument for abstinence. The soundtrack is handled by Disasterpeace, aka Rich Vreeland, an electronic artist who’s best known for a series of video game soundtracks. It Follows is his first film score, and he’s worked diligently to build a cohesive world of ominous moods. There are several recurring motifs: a booming percussion that comes like the monster pounding on the door; a shrill klaxon signaling when danger is near; a pattern of corrupted synths chugging into motion like some futuristic train on its way to the junkyard. A window shatters. A cluster of digital hornets buzz and whine. A jet turbine spins into motion, the air supercharging to an agonizing din, only to die down and leave the room sapped of tension. It’s a score that announces when something is about to happen, only to suddenly upend expectations and leave the room on edge. It Follows wouldn’t exist without John Carpenter’s movies, and neither would the score. ""Title"" sounds like an update of Carpenter’s Halloween theme, as a lonely piano line is slowly enveloped by gothic dread. The melody is echoed on ""Detroit"", the arpeggiated tones brushing up against the sublime as the synthesizers drone from underneath. This is where you’d maybe dock Vreeland and the filmmakers a point for originality, except It Follows comes at a precarious moment for the American horror movie. Everything is either point-of-view or torture porn, and frankly, if someone wants mine a source as fertile as Halloween, they should go right ahead. Like all OSTs, It Follows makes the most sense when you’ve seen the movie it’s made for—and you should see it, especially if you can watch horror movies in genuine terror of what’s about to happen. But it can work in other contexts, and a quick scan of Vreeland’s work shows he isn’t a one-trick composer leaning on his Casio. I’m most familiar with his score for ""Fez"", a video game that’s ""Super Mario"" meets M.C. Escher, in which a pixellated alien explores a slowly decaying cartoon world. ""Fez"" is a playful, adventurous game in which a sense of whimsy is frequently juxtaposed with the solitude of the unknown. Vreeland’s score conveyed those moods, just as his work for It Follows captures the paranoid fervor aroused by finding your normally comfortable surroundings transformed into a danger zone. Is it your friend you’re looking at, or the monster? How about now?","It Follows is a horror movie with a compelling score by Disasterpeace, aka Rich Vreeland, an electronic artist who’s best known for a series of video game soundtracks.

Cosmic Troubles,Faith Healer,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad315e6ef95969321a30/1:1/w_160/246ab96f.jpg,2015-04-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20371-cosmic-troubles/,Mint,"On 2011’s Brother Loyola, Jessica Jalbert asserted that ""I’m not the records that I own, and I’m not the things I’m good at."" That those points needed making says plenty about the Edmonton songwriter, who’s since refined her '60s-styled indie-pop under the Faith Healer alias. Jalbert, who seems both assured and self-scrutinizing, sidelines in the kind of record-collecting, plainclothes punk bands who covet the Troggs over the Pistols, which frees up her solo work to dive into her daydreamy subconscious. On Cosmic Troubles, her second solo album, she shares private epiphanies and stares at her bedroom ceiling as the universe unravels. Recorded with longtime collaborator Renny Wilson in his parents’ makeshift basement studio, Cosmic Troubles sounds every bit as excitable and debut-fresh as Brother Loyola. It meanders calmly from in thrall to enthralling, and enjoys the trip—by the chorus of ""Canonized"", Jalbert and Wilson are playfully excavating White Album-era Beatles via the shambling exuberance of the Raincoats, and it sounds fantastic. If there’s little impetus to write great songs that don’t sound like other great songs—usually, it transpires, songs by the Velvet Underground—the references rarely grate; it’s a record that keeps its influences close, like childhood toys under the bed, in a way that’s reassuring rather than cumbersome. For much of the album Jalbert sings in a calmly vacated tone. Her demeanor is neither ingenuous nor jaded, and she has the dreamy air of somebody who’d spend therapy sessions psychoanalyzing her shrink. Despite the record’s rigorous self-analysis, Jalbert owns her self-consciousness, and applies it on her own terms. Sometimes it becomes a principle ingredient. ""Fools Rush In"" embodies the narrator’s hypercritical subconscious in a taunting Beach Boys harmony: ""I'm so stupid, ba-ba-ba."" ""Again"" taps into the goldmine of whimsy that links neuroses and laundry—""It’s a pain to stretch yourself out after being through the wash""—while ""Angel Eyes"", conventional but no less enchanting, opens its heart with the unrelenting steadiness of Leonard Cohen and Angel Olsen. For all its stylistic play, the record’s tenor is uniformly self-certain. So it’s all the more alarming when it cracks. The title track, for one, is musically on-point, with haunting echoes of Jefferson Airplane. But its words depict a domestic dispute in stark terms: ""I was out of my mind with my hands around my neck/ You raised yours to slap them off, and I raised mine out to protect."" After the heavenly ""Infinite Return"", ""No Car"" kicks up a heavy riff, before describing a recent breakup from which the partner’s fingers are ""bruised into my flesh."" In these fragments Jalbert’s songwriting seems to crystallise, her gentle dredging a way to send you fathoms deep into her mind without having to follow all the way. At times it sounds like, having grown out of nihilism, Jalbert is reaching for the nearest tune to get lost in, her stories a psychic sojourn on the route home to oblivion. By the time you return to ""Fools Rush In"", where she slides from lackadaisical soul-searching into idle contemplations of suicide-by-drowning, Cosmic Troubles sounds a sadder, vaster album than before, but one whose meditations can soothe your bones like an inviting stream.","Cosmic Troubles sounds every bit as excitable and debut-fresh as Faith Healer's Brother Loyola.

Sonnet,Benoît Pioulard,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acccb1335d7bf1699ab5/1:1/w_160/f213a04f.jpg,2015-04-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20304-sonnet/,Kranky,"Sonnet feels like a regeneration for Benoît Pioulard, the alias of Seattle-based Michigan transplant Thomas Meluch. The album contains elements of his prior work under the name—particularly its general tone of melancholy and disrepair—but he chooses to zone in on the drifty and (mostly) instrumental side of his music for this album. It’s a subtle shift but not an insignificant one—he sounds more confident and in control than on Hymnal, which veered closer to a grab-bag aesthetic. As is often the case when artists reinvent what they’re doing, Meluch had to go backward to move forward, forgoing digital tools to work in an analog environment. The results are more otherworldly, with tiny drones and banks of noise and blocks of tape hiss all coiling around one another, locked tight in an uneasy embrace that only Meluch can connect or disconnect. What Sonnet gains over other albums Meluch has made is a more acute sense of direction. The tone varies in shades throughout, sounding like a lost radio broadcast fighting through static, or music humming quietly out of a dysfunctional intercom in a broken down hospital. At some points it reaches such a level of atrophy that it feels like the instruments are disintegrating in Meluch's hands as he records with them. It’s an album that will get slotted into the ambient category, but it’s not ambient in the sense of being something to relax to or to have on in the background. It’s more arresting than that, as ideas crystallize in short, ever-repeating loops. Meluch's method here is to take field recordings of industrial equipment and nature and attempt to replicate them on guitar. But Sonnet isn’t an album that benefits from being broken down into parts—it’s best consumed whole, in a single sitting, where Meluch’s sense of exploration can truly unfold. At times, he’s knee-deep in sludge, making tar-like guitar lines sound like something you wade through. At others, he’s up in the stratosphere, channeling the mesh between krautrock and shoegaze that Flying Saucer Attack were practicing circa Further. Vocals come rarely on Sonnet—Meluch removed most of them while paring down the album to its core emotions. When they do appear, they're just another element ghosting into the murk. The result is often reminiscent of the space Leyland Kirby works in when he records as the Caretaker, all haunted mirrors and nearly forgotten memories, constructed at the very point where those things feel like they’re about to permanently slip into oblivion. Sonnet positions Meluch somewhere beyond the insular place he occupied before.","Sonnet feels like a regeneration for Benoît Pioulard, the alias of Seattle-based Michigan transplant Thomas Meluch.

"The Past, the Present, the Future",Jodeci,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad7f9d034d5c69bf43a1/1:1/w_160/51037a18.jpg,2015-04-01 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20426-the-past-the-present-the-future/,Epic,"It’s not always fun to watch storied musicians prepare a comeback after years, or even decades, out of the limelight. In the case of Jodeci, the news was more encouraging: more than just a nostalgia act, the groundbreaking '90s R&B group were one of the original purveyors of male ratchet. There would be no Chris Brown or PARTYNEXTDOOR if DeVante Swing, K-Ci, JoJo and Mr. Dalvin hadn’t stomped and writhed all over R&B, opening up a new, sex-positive lane for male rappers and singers. Until Jodeci unlocked the swag, R&B singers were often blazer-and-sweater wearing singers, rarely approaching the energy and aesthetic of a rapper. (The foursome was truly a marquee act on this front—check out this safe sex PSA from 1995.) Twenty years on from their third album The Show, the After Party, the Hotel, Jodeci’s returned to a hip-hop and R&B landscape that’s more sexually liberated than ever before. So, what’s on the agenda for The Past, the Present, the Future? In some ways, the 'Bad Boys of R&B' tagline was just a foil: Jodeci, led by producer/singer DeVante Swing, remains a group of soul classicists, thematically inspired by the intimacy and lewdness of sex and buttressed by the aesthetic and energy of hip-hop. So, like the second single ""Every Moment"" hinted, this is another record of silky, pro-forma bedroom soul; a classic, if slightly tame Jodeci record, with no real aesthetic challenges or age-inappropriate shifts in style. It’s a fans-first album that certainly won’t be played outside of urban radio formats—but then, it's rare to hear anything as assuredly black as Jodeci’s pristine, four-part harmonies and celestial new jack swing outside those formats anymore anyway. ""Those Things"", one of The Past’s best tracks, begins in that classic territory before rapid-fire kick drums and snares and a warped synth offer a genius update: New jack swing for a post-trap world, courtesy of former protégé Timbaland, who produces the track as well as ""Incredible"". A wave of sweet oohs breezes through ""Stress Reliever"", paired with thick drums that give the track the airy whimsy of Jai Paul’s ""BTSTU"". Most of the remaining 11 tracks are closer to ""Too Hot"", which lifts the thunderous bass line from Dawn Penn’s classic, ""You Don't Love Me (No, No, No"". It’s all ingenious, brawny R&B that celebrates the past, but there’s not much on this album of midtempo ballads that presents a vision of the future. The few guest starts here don't upset the balance: B.o.B (""Nobody Wins"") and Mila J (""Body Parts""), deliver lukewarm verses and are outperformed by the bombast of the group vocals. Despite the evidence ""Those Things"" puts forward, Jodeci is clearly comfortable living amidst the vaulted synths of their prime, and that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. In truth, they display a confidence in declining to chase or win over new fans that is exceedingly rare in legacy acts. Missy’s retreading her own trailblazing route by glomming onto Diplo, and even Mary J. Blige had to go to Disclosure to get some play. Jodeci are no longer music’s go-to bad boys. Instead they have an ally in hip-hop’s favorite good boy, Drake, whose commitment to '90s R&B is plastered all over his discography, making the case for nostalgia over that new-new.","Twenty years on from their third album The Show, the After Party, the Hotel, Jodeci’s returned to a hip-hop and R&B landscape that’s more sexually liberated than ever before.

"Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress",Godspeed You! Black Emperor,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acfbb1335d7bf1699b01/1:1/w_160/a43ecff4.jpg,2015-04-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20334-asunder-sweet-and-other-distress/,Constellation,"When Godspeed You! Black Emperor returned to record after a long hiatus with Allelujah! Don’t Bend! Ascend! they weren’t quite releasing new music. The album consisted of pieces the Montreal collective had composed during the early 2000s, back when they were at their most prolific, and the album was simply a matter of getting long-performed work down in the studio. Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress contains music of a more recent vintage, which is potentially significant because following Godspeed has always meant grappling with a basic question: When you have one of the most distinctive sonic profiles in music—that trademark quiet/loud mix of soaring guitars, epic strings, and field recordings—how important is it to branch out beyond it? Do we want a Godspeed album that sounds like anything but Godspeed? Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress, conceived a decade after their initial run, when they defined everything this band is and should be, does not offer a new wrinkle. There is nothing about this album—from the particulars of the recording to the riffs to the arrangements—that would have sounded out of place if they had released it in 2002. Change is not Godspeed’s way, but the other side of that coin is that, despite many imitators, there’s also nothing else out there that sounds quite like them. The shifts on this record involve pivots more than actual movement: At points, guitars are unusually prominent and the music feels a bit heavier. It’s also their shortest album. But beyond a few such tweaks, the album is Godspeed to its core, moving from thin drones to Wagnerian pomp and circumstance and back again over long, patient stretches. As much as any record they’ve made, the music here is meant to work as one, and sequencing and flow is everything. They’ve been working out this material live for some time now, and fans have taken to calling the whole ""Behemoth"", an appropriate descriptor given its heaviness. Though there are four tracks, the album really happens in three movements. The first and third contain the slowly building refrains and crashing climaxes, and the middle two tracks are more of a single 16-minute piece consisting of drones, gushes of guitar feedback, and fragments of strings. On the vinyl version of the album, the A-side cleverly ends with a locked groove to suggest a sense of continuity, but the CD version finds the two middle pieces flowing one into the next. Sandwiching the drone section between the two crashing fanfares makes good sense, allowing the album to breathe and suggesting more variety than it might otherwise. Opening track ""Peasantry or ‘Light! Inside of Light!’"" is the album’s highlight, and ranks with Godspeed’s best work. The guitar riff has serious weight and crunch to it, and the piece unfolds with a modal sweep. But the transformation the main line gradually undergoes, where a dramatically beautiful desert vista becomes a setting for a melody that suggests a drunken holiday singalong, shows that there’s still a lot they can do with their basic ingredients. ""Peasantry"" and the closing ""Piss Crowns Are Trebled"" are so intense and grandiose they skirt self-parody, always a risk with this band. But it's possible to give Godspeed the benefit of the doubt, in part because of how they’ve conducted themselves throughout their career. In 2015, music like this is usually used to sell things, whether it’s a product or a television show. There’s so much feeling in it, huge washes of sound that could easily be regarded as manipulative, and capitalism inevitably strives to pair these kinds of sounds with product. As a listener, to give yourself over to this kind of soaring music, allowing yourself to be carried away, implies a certain amount of trust. Godspeed You! Black Emperor record and play instrumental pieces that exist to move you, using only the force of music, and in a space where sound is the primary context. It's a different kind of transaction. You have to let your guard down, and Godspeed have to transform feelings into compelling records. They're still on track.","Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress is the first album of truly new material Godspeed You! Black Emperor have released since reforming after their long hiatus.

Phase IV OST,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad475e6ef95969321a56/1:1/w_160/ceb23985.jpg,2015-03-31 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20386-phase-iv-ost/,Waxwork,"In the 1950s, as the atomic arms deadlock with the Soviet Union settled into a decades-long deep freeze, American moviegoers began to imagine threats coming from all angles, even from beneath their feet. Warner Brothers’ highest grossing film of 1954 was Them!,  about a scourge of atomically enhanced ants. Soon, all everyday bugs were distorted to inspire fear and horror, a trend lasting well into the 1970s, where movies gave us reason to fear fire-starting roaches (1975’s Bug), African killer bees (1978’s The Swarm) and flesh-eating earthworms (1976’s Squirm). One of the most profound—albeit neglected—sci-fi horror films to arise from the insect- kingdom subgenre was 1974’s Phase IV. Like Them!, Phase IV scrutinized ants, but instead of being supersized by radiation, these ants had been intellectually enhanced by a cosmic event*.* The movie holds a special place in the hearts of cinephiles and graphic designers as the lone film made by Saul Bass, an artist who designed the posters for Spartacus and Anatomy of a Murder, and the title sequences for West Side Story, Vertigo, and Goodfellas, among others. Alas, his lone foray behind the camera was a disaster: Phase IV sank without much attention upon its release, and is probably most famous today for being mocked in the very first season of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (and, I suppose, inspiring a Yeasayer video). Perhaps that’s why its soundtrack has never seen release until now, with Waxwork Records paying loving tribute to the film with a special vinyl pressing. Brian Gascoigne has credits intermittently spanning decades, ranging from The Dark Crystal to Gosford Park to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and he’s worked with Scott Walker. He gets the compositional credit on this soundtrack, though the intense analog synthesizer work is contributed by Desmond Briscoe and David Vorhaus. The soundtrack also features Japanese percussionist Stomu Yamash’ta. While many sci-fi and horror films of the '70s are usually brief cues (rare is the John Carpenter track that runs longer than three minutes) what makes Phase IV such a fascinating listen forty years later is that the compositions are broken down into four exploratory, ever-evolving sections, each in the eight-minute range, spanning a wide spectrum of emotion, from fear to pastoral calm, from alien to earthly. The drones that open ""Phase I"" might be Ligeti-like vocal choirs or bent circuits, but no matter the source, they make the skin prickle with dread. The sinewaves of Briscoe and Vorhaus soon blossom and Yamash’ta’s rumbling tympanum emerge, only to have it all give way to a walking bassline and some sludgy electronics, which threaten to dissolve the piece until a dirge-like theme returns at the end. Flute and strings emerge on ""Phase II"" and carry through most of ""Phase III"" but the analog synthesizers return midway through the piece and carry most of ""Phase IV"". There are traces of sound that might bring to mind the likes of Bitchin Bajas or even Shade Themes from Kairos, but the sound here is pretty much of its own realm. With Phase IV finally back in print (although still missing the original psychedelic ending that Bass imagined for the film), it’s cosmic justice of a sort that the accompanying music can now take its rightful place among the 70's strange soundtrack pantheon.","1974’s Phase IV, a sci-fi cult film about super-intelligent ants, has its soundtrack reissued by Waxworks, and the compositions are broken down into four exploratory, ever-evolving sections, each in the eight-minute range, spanning a wide spectrum of emotion, from fear to pastoral calm, from alien to earthly.

Deep Hits,Tufthunter,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad4bea9e61561daa60b7/1:1/w_160/7e505bb2.jpg,2015-03-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20389-deep-hits/,self-released,"As a guitarist for Talulah Gosh, Heavenly, and a host of other twee greats, Peter Momtchiloff now has nearly three decades' worth of scrappy indie pop gems to his name. With a catalog that deep, it certainly would've been well-earned if the British-born musician decided to undertake the exercise of compiling a 20th Century Masters collection of his disparate, dusty, and largely under-the-radar recordings. But though the name may suggest otherwise, Deep Hits, his debut release as Tufthunter, is a less self-indulgent affair. Instead, it's a collection of what Momtchiloff does best—guitar-centered pop songs, delightful and charming despite (or maybe because of) their lack of grander ambition. This time around there's an extra spark thanks to a host of guest vocal turns from friends he's accrued over the course of his career. Even though there's a different voice on each track, Momtchiloff conjures a fairly unified mood. In a recent interview, he acknowledged that the revolving-door concept of Tufthunter owes itself to Stephin Merritt's project the 6ths. But while those records skipped around the world of indie rock, enlisting luminaries like Bob Mould and Lou Barlow, Momtchiloff's guests are mostly confined to the twee world he came up in. Album opener ""Lit Up""'s lyrical focus on partying for ""old times' sake"" is central to the exercise that Momtchiloff is undertaking on Deep Hits. That Lois Maffeo-featuring track, as well as a handful of others, recalls the sunny strumming of his days in Heavenly. But this isn't merely an occasion for the accomplished guitarist to trot out his own familiar lilting lines: He's offering up a twisted and ramshackle take on the whole history of indie pop. On ""We Fly By Night"" he conjures a compelling vision of Stereolab-indebted krautrock, motoring on the back of a searing organ drone and a couple of brittle and anxious lead lines. He enlists the Magnetic Fields' Claudia Gonson for wry, orchestral backed storytelling on ""How Venus Got Her Name"" and his former bandmate Amelia Fletcher for stripped down K Records joy on ""My Future Band"". It's a difference of shades, sure, but by capably nodding to a whole host of genre touchstones over the course of the record, he demonstrates range in a style more often known for its charm than its technical ability. Despite the fact that Momtchiloff has resisted the temptation of literally making a compilation of his work, Deep Hits ultimately does something similar anyway, offering the whole spectrum of twee in a tidy 46 minutes, with all the pitfalls that may come with doing so. Even those legendary Sarah Records comps had their down moments. So it's understandable that when he runs the tracks a little longer, as on ""Low Life"" and ""You're All Going to Die"", the allure of the pastiche tends to wear a little thin. But at its highest points, like Gonson's dead-eyed just-so story and the self-doubting straightedge anthem ""The Drink and the Drugs"", Deep Hits suggests a promise for Tufthunter that goes beyond just capably looking in the rearview mirror.","As a guitarist for Talulah Gosh, Heavenly, and other twee greats, Peter Momtchiloff has nearly three decades' worth of indie pop gems to his name.

Rave Cave EP,Andrew Hung,by: Abigail Garnett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad64ea9e61561daa60e1/1:1/w_160/81c98c4a.jpeg,2015-03-31 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20405-rave-cave-ep/,self-released,"Andrew Hung, one-half of the duo Fuck Buttons, takes a step back on the Rave Cave EP. In place of the intense polish of the duo’s most recent album, Slow Focus, Hung offers a brief look at the way his mind works when faced with a vastly pared-down set of tools—in this case, a Game Boy. (Though as he has said, that choice was simply a convenient solution to the dearth of portable, easy-to-manipulate gear during Fuck Buttons’ last tour.) Writing music on an obsolete gaming tool probably seems hopelessly antiquarian to some (especially if you grew up with the DS) but the uninhibited, high-strung music Hung wrings from it feels fresh. There’s nothing here of the magnitude of their massive Tarot Sport centerpiece ""Olympians"", or the protracted leer of Slow Focus. The biggest and brightest moment is the irrepressible glitch-fest ""Korea Town"", a gorgeous tide of bleeps and bloops, with romantically wafting strings laid on thick on top. The EP’s other two tracks are harder-edged, built on heavily metronomic beats with just enough swing to stick. They’re also nowhere near as pretty: The propulsive, bull-headed stomp ""The Plane"" is stippled with sharp, abrasive sound effects, pushing the rough equipment to an aggressive extreme. Hung also shows a punkish sense of humor, adding in an almost comically seasick warble partway through ""Fables"". All three songs sound like a loose extension of the unconventional methodology that’s driven Hung and Fuck Buttons bandmate Benjamin John Power’s collaborative jamming. The EP also benefits from a handmade quality, one that you certainly wouldn’t find on a Fuck Buttons album at this point. Hung and Powers have often worked with cheap equipment, from karaoke machines to children's toys, though they've shown an increasing focus on sound quality as the scale of their work has increased. Here, Hung's unvarnished approach serves to highlight themes that repeatedly creep into his work—an underlying affinity for gear-grinding industrial sounds; a focus on process over a specific end result. In that sense, it's a welcome refresher.","On the Rave Cave EP, Andrew Hung (one half of the duo Fuck Buttons) revisits his fascination with cheap, pared-down tools.

Insides,Fort Romeau,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ac7fc0084474cd0c1585/1:1/w_160/6204e584.jpg,2015-03-31 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20244-fort-romeau-insides/,Ghostly,"For the four years he’s released music as Fort Romeau, South London’s Michael Greene has poked curiously at house music’s form. On his 2012 debut, Kingdoms, Greene delivered a set of workmanlike deep-house all built around carefully manipulated vocal samples. Spread out over the next couple years, Fort Romeau’s ensuing four EPs documented both his continually improving production abilities and his widening palette. Thanks to moments like the Kosmische-influenced slow burn of 2013’s ""Stay/True"" (from the EP of the same name) or the stuttery tech-house/2-step of ""SW9"" (also from the EP of the same name), Greene quietly established himself as an intriguing new voice in the genre. Insides is Fort Romeau’s second full-length record, and although it doesn’t continue on quite the same upward trend of his recent discography in the risk-taking department, it does boast some of his most fully dimensional and impressively produced work yet. While there are barely any vocal samples to be found here, it’s adorned with the kinds of textures and details that had been missing from the wide-eyed Kingdoms. Tonally, it’s a darker and more pensive affair, one that’s less concerned with its vocal centerpieces and more interested in atmosphere, craft and classicism. Some have framed Insides as a modern throwback record, one that owes its sound to Chicago house more than anything else, and indeed, from the first acidic squiggle in opener ""New Wave"", it’s evident that Greene is studiously and consciously showing his work. Having toured and DJed a fair amount in the time since his last full-length, it seems that he’s come back to the studio with knowledge and reverence to burn, and the galloping pianos and wending atmospherics in the 8-minute long ""All I Want"" and the brooding single-note synth warbles and tech-house flavorings of ""Insides"" bear that out. But merely painting Insides as an homage to Chicago would be to miss the thing that makes it most interesting. Ultimately, it’s Greene’s willingness to decorate house music’s form with new sounds and reference points that distinguishes him from the scads of Beatport randoms. Insides is inflected with tinges of K**osmische, ambient and microhouse to the extent that some of its best tracks—like the intricate patchwork of bells and percussion of ""Cloche"" or the lonely synth arpeggios of ""IKB""—could barely pass for house at all. Elsewhere, the loping computer music of ""Folle"" and the whirlygigging synth-aided second half of the ten-and-a-half-minute long ""Lately"" recall artists as varied as Ford & Lopatin and Tangerine Dream. That Fort Romeau was rashly named after an adjacent town while Greene was in France tells you something about his attitude to his music. He may occasionally be trumpeted by classicists as a flag-waver for the old school, but there’s no actual agenda here beyond his desire to make interesting new sounds. He's getting better at it with every passing release.","For the four years he’s released music as Fort Romeau, South London’s Michael Greene has poked curiously at house music’s form.

Jenny Death,Death Grips,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ada013d1975652139f78/1:1/w_160/dd1f5ecb.jpg,2015-03-31 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20451-jenny-death/,Harvest,"Keeping up with the Death Grips has increasingly become a headache. Cryptic break-up notes, a tumultuous split with Epic, a realignment with Harvest, cancelled tours (including one with Nine Inch Nails), no-show gigs: All of these antics were tolerable, sometimes fun, when they came backed up by compelling music. But even that part of the bargain, over the last year, has proved questionable. Last year’s Niggas on the Moon leaned too heavily on Björk samples and flattened their approach, while Fashion Week was an intriguing, if ultimately directionless, collection of instrumentals. *Fashion'*s song titles spelled out JENNYDEATHWHEN, hinting cryptically that their next album would be Jenny Death, the second half of the two-part sequence called The Powers That B. But by Fashion, it was hard to tell if even their hardcore faithful cared about what they would do next. Jenny, which Death Grips streamed on YouTube last week in advance of its release, is the record they needed to make. It’s not on the level of their artistic and commercial breakthrough The Money Store, but it will absolutely remind you of why you loved them in the first place. In fact, it’s so different from (and better than) Moon that it shouldn’t even be tethered to it. On these ten tracks, they’ve harnessed the unbridled energy of Government Plates into their most fully formed songs since Money, which helps justify their bluster. Producer Andy ""Flatlander"" Morin brings a lot of the death-disco of Money back into the mix, which broadens their approach without compromising their potency. Nothing here reaches the aggro-pop heights of ""I’ve Seen Footage"", but ""Inanimate Sensation"" comes close; it's clear why it was released as the first single. Over Flatlander’s seasick bass synths, Stefan ""MC Ride"" Burnett jumps through various vocals patterns—his trademark bark, chopped-and-screwed raps, menacing whispers—and ends up with something like a Jock Jams for the underworld. The buildup to MC Ride’s final verse is a staticky, topsy-turvy rush, culminating with the soon-to-be-immortal ""I like my iPod more than fucking!"" Yell that with your headphones on at work. MC Ride was so sorely missed on Fashion that his presence on Jenny feels like a triumphant comeback. Flatlander may provide the electronics and Hill may bring the percussive energy (and also lent initial critical credibility) to Death Grips, but MC Ride is the unpredictable heart of the group. He was somewhat lost in the madness of Plates and subdued on Moon, but he is in full, raw force here: The title ""I Break Mirrors With My Face in the United States"" brings to mind a sadistic animated .gif enacting the Black Flag Damaged cover, and MC Ride's raging, hypnotic vocal reinforces this impression. He isn’t just a spiral of rage, either—""Pss Pss"" casts him in creep mode, suggesting illicit fantasies in a hushed whisper. The music on Jenny nods to Death Grips' more conventional rock influences, but it’s in no way trying to pander to a rock audience. Each element they reference is blown up and rebuilt in their own vision. Vaguely surfy dream-pop gets shot into overdrive on ""Centuries of Damn"". ""Beyond Alive"" and ""ON GP"" both contain big rock riffs, the latter approaching metalgaze territory. ""GP"" inflates MC Ride’s discontentment into something massive and anthemic. It’s jaded stadium rock—all it needs is a stadium and an ironclad guarantee they’ll show up. You hear more of drummer Zach Hill’s acoustic drums on Jenny, too. He continues to unlearn his technical prowess from his Hella days, but he’s electrifying even when going back to basics. Throughout, you can hear them furthering their vision for aggression without borders, swallowing in hip-hop, hardcore, industrial, and the hardest forms of dance music, while not in debt to any one of those elements. Death Grips don’t just imagine a world where rap-rock is redeemed and various forms of heaviness coexist side-by-side, but where those lines are obliterated. That fantasy may not have panned out quite the way it should have, but to deny their ambitions does a disservice to what heavy music can be. Closer ""Death Grips 2.0"" acknowledges the ongoing ""will they or won’t they"" dynamic that’s long been a point of frustration amongst their critics. The title suggests a rebirth, but the content, a sort of Araabmetalmuzik blast of cut-up industrial beats, could also be a fiery demise. It’s the perfect Death Grips closer, especially with their status in constant question. Right after their alleged ""breakup,"" there were eulogies for the group, but Death Grips are not the sort of group to be eulogized. Are they calling it quits after this record and tour? Was the breakup even real to begin with? It’s hard to speculate whether Jenny is a redemptive closing chapter, a new beginning, or some other inscrutable part of Death Grips’ master plan, if they even have such a thing. What is evident is that Jenny Death is some of their strongest material in a while, and may even return a few disillusioned converts to the flock.","Jenny Death is billed as a companion album to Niggas on the Moon, and part of a larger sequence called The Powers That B. It furthers Death Grips' vision for aggression without borders, and while it isn't on the level of their artistic and commercial breakthrough The Money Store, it will absolutely remind you of why you loved them in the first place.

Adventure,Madeon,by: Corban Goble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad3cc0084474cd0c16b8/1:1/w_160/72829234.jpg,2015-03-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20379-adventure/,Columbia,"Though French producer Madeon has been known in electronic circles for years—he’s been active under the moniker since 2010 and has appeared at Coachella and Ultra—it became increasingly clear last year that the 20-year-old (!) Hugo Pierre Leclercq had bigger conquests in mind. The instrumental ""Imperium"", the first released song from his new Adventure, was first featured on the soundtrack of the globally massive soccer video game ""FIFA 15"". This is a distinction that often breaks big artists to a world audience, and Madeon’s mixture of colorful, sample-heavy EDM and its attending uplifting lilt made for the perfect feel-good vibe directly before the complexity of the new ""FIFA"" made you want to hurl your controller through your brother’s flat screen. With Adventure, Madeon’s debut LP, the producer presents a strikingly versatile collection. In a landscape filled with hot-on-paper-but-kinda-""eh"" collaborations between big name vocalists and hip producers, Madeon deploys his guests (Passion Pit, R&B singer Kyan, Bastille frontman Dan Smith) with a stirring effectiveness. Album highlight ""Pay No Mind"" weaponizes Passion Pit's bright synth-pop for a stadium anthem, and the warmth of ""La Lune"" recalls a more laidback version of Bastille’s catchy hit ""Pompeii"". On tracks like ""OK""—which features a Charli XCX sample culled from a scrapped collaboration—and ""Pixel Empire"", Madeon pays homage to 8-bit video game soundtracks, reminiscent of Rustie’s Essential Mix and the incomparable (yes, incomparable) ""Donkey Kong Country"" soundtrack all at once. While Adventure carries all the hallmarks of your usual skyscraping EDM release—stomping breakdowns, soaring choruses, maximalism-for-the-sake-of-it—it also straddles a fine balance between being a pop record and being a dance record. Though not everything is as huge as its banner singles, more inward-looking tracks like the closer ""Home"" are arguably as successful. ""Home"" perhaps best exemplifies Madeon’s range, given that it’s one of the only songs on the album that features Leclercq’s vocals. Over a track that moves from delicate and glimmering to sweeping, Leclercq sings delicately before jumping into the thundering chorus. It’s a sweet note to end on, and marks a signpost for the young producer to follow, if he chooses that direction. The good thing about Adventure is that there are many markers like this; on the path to what feels like something huge, Madeon’s journey is just beginning.","While Adventure carries all the hallmarks of your usual skyscraping EDM release—stomping breakdowns, soaring choruses, maximalism-for-the-sake-of-it—it also straddles a fine balance between being a pop record and being a dance record.

Huge, looping riffs stretch across deeply repetitive percussion, creating an atmosphere somewhere between trance and stupor. The word ""psychedelic"" is never far away when reading descriptions of the band, but three albums into their career, they’ve explored many colors on that particular spectrum. Beginning with outward-facing, Josh Homme-indebted rock on their eponymous debut in 2009, they switched to something closer to krautrock on 2013’s II. Here, they tighten their sound, cutting out the meandering themes and occasionally sloppy riffing. There are only four songs, but extra details emerge slowly on repeat listening. German producer Uwe Schmidt, better known as Atom™, has been brought in as a collaborator, bringing the discipline of his immersively repetitive electronic music with him. He’s also credited with playing a Korg synth that belonged to Kraftwerk during the 1980s. Föllakzoid can’t let go of their roots entirely—at best, they’re channeling the LSD-laced guitar patterns of Loop and Spacemen 3; at worst, vocalist Juan Pablo Rodrigues leans too hard on foggy vocal effects that recall Brooklyn psych also-rans (and labelmates) Psychic Ills. They’re most effective when working somewhere between their rock instincts and Schmidt’s concise approach. Opener ""Electric"" recalls a more-guitar heavy version of LCD Soundsystem’s ""Get Innocuous!"", where a patient build combines with a subtle layering of elements to deliver the album’s most transcendent moment. Föllakzoid barely shift course over the 45-minute III. The riff that dominates the closing ""Feuerzeug"" is only a breath away from the one that towers over ""Electric"". ""Piure"" is the best example of that here, mixing up backward-masked electronics, menacing ambient noise, and a guitar churn that sounds like it was played by Can’s Michael Karoli. In general, the album treats its journey as circular, a path of tiny incremental steps that eventually leads us back to where we began. In 2014 Föllakzoid played a set at Primavera Sound, leaving behind this video memento to mark the occasion. The beginning is marked by the reading of a poem by the Chilean writer Vicente Huidobro, which is heavy on birthing and religious imagery, where each line is so dense in implication it’s easy to just disappear into it for a while. It’s a handy comparison for the type of feeling Föllakzoid try to convey in their music, where their vaguely epic songs—only one track here, the nine-minute “Feuerzeug”, is less than 10 minutes in length—gain an allure by gradually stacking up moments of powerful suggestion. It doesn’t always reach the level of spiritual purity it could, but there’s a touch of steel and a sense of pacing that was missing from Föllakzoid’s prior work, positioning III as a gateway for a much a deeper dive into altered states.","The Chilean band Föllakzoid specialize in the pillowy sort of rock music designed to shield you from the world for a while.

Primrose Green,Ryley Walker,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ac595e6ef959693218ee/1:1/w_160/b38c7488.jpg,2015-03-30 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20215-primrose-green/,Dead Oceans,"In his quarter-century, Ryley Walker seems to have made definitive decisions about what qualifies as a worthy influence: Van Morrison records made between 1968 and 1974, Jackson C. Frank, Pentangle, and the recently reissued early works of Mike Cooper are all among the examples. On Primrose Green, he embraces those inspirations without wrestling with them. He lugs their aged weight around as signs of good taste and his self-proclaimed place in a historical lineage. Though Walker comes from a mid-sized city in Illinois, he sings as if he bounced between the British Isles as a kid. Alongside his shoplifted accent, he apes Morrison’s trademark grunts and melismas. Make no mistake: Walker is a prodigious talent. He’s one of the leading young stylists in a crowded instrumental guitar scene. He possesses the light touch of Bert Jansch, the unbottled energy of Peter Walker, and the musical erudition of John Fahey. And he has a Miles Davis-like capability to surround himself with astounding musicians, from early collaborator Daniel Bachman to the band of Chicago jazz firecrackers who not only support him on Primrose Green but also supply many of its best moments. Walker is versatile, too, with a chameleonic quality that allows him to slip into ragged electric blues and bucolic acoustic reveries with equal ease. Of all the songwriters trying their hand at this revivalist approach during the last decade, including Steve Gunn, Hiss Golden Messenger, and Sharon Van Etten, Walker is the most natural and enviable. The band he built for Primrose Green is a stirring, captivating ensemble, too, the kind of group that could jam for an uninterrupted hour and never lose an audience’s attention or its own freewheeling focus. During the extended introduction of ""Love Can Be Cruel"", for instance, they delight in the space between folk-rock form and jazz-band freedom. Heavy acoustic strumming, sharp electric guitar and twinkling keyboards dart around a deep rhythm, working into a frenzy until the song approaches the ecstasy of a raga. ""On the Banks of the Old Kishwaukee"" depends upon another stunning groove built by drummer Frank Rosaly and bassist Anton Hatwitch. Walker wires a moaning blues theme into the beat, suggesting the wonderful roots-rock patience of American Beauty-era Grateful Dead. The band sizzles during ""Sweet Satisfaction"", dips and dives during ""Same Minds"", and charges into vibraphone-and-bass bedlam during ""Summer Dress"". But the trouble comes with Walker—the songwriter and singer, not the instrumentalist. For someone so obsessed with classic troubadours, he has a damning disregard for his own songs. He over-sings almost every part of this record, trying to match his heroes with an inadequate instrument. The screamed lover-boy exhortations of ""Summer Dress"" are counterproductive at best, copycatting at worst. He treats every written syllable of ""Sweet Satisfaction"" like a chance to slur a half-dozen of them, stretching words until it’s easier to ignore them. Walker’s lyrics read like a set of unfinished end-rhyme exercises by a college student who has just discovered the Beats. Smoking grass at night makes him feel ""alright""; leaving his love, however cruel, would make him into a ""fool."" For a point of contrast, see ""Griffiths Buck Blues"", the one instrumental number on Primrose Green. Over a harmonium drone, Walker musters pure energy and expression with only his guitar. As he starts and stops, slows and sprints, he communicates dread and unease with the conviction his voice lacks. The extensive biography that accompanies Primrose Green positions it as ""an album of a sort we haven’t seen since the 1970s""—a bit of description perhaps too on the nose, as these 10 songs are acts of pure creative anachronism and affectation. The shape of Walker’s voice and the twists and turns of his band reanimate a specific aesthetic without adding much more than the tools of modern production. While Primrose Green is a great statement for a '70s freak-folk cosplayer, I just hope it’s not a career-defining one for Walker.","Ryley Walker is one of the leading young stylists in a crowded instrumental guitar scene, and on his debut, he aims to create a record that joins his folk-rock heroes: Van Morrison, Pentangle, Mike Cooper, and more.

The Day Is My Enemy,The Prodigy,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad20b1335d7bf1699b4d/1:1/w_160/793011ab.jpg,2015-03-30 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20360-the-day-is-my-enemy/,Cooking VinylTake Me to the Hospital,"Never discount the salubrious effects of lowered expectations. Part of the pleasure to be derived from the Prodigy's sixth studio album comes from the fact that there's really no reason, in 2015, for the Prodigy still to exist. A quarter-century, after all, is an awfully long time to try to hold a sneer, but that's precisely what they've been doing since Liam Howlett founded the group in 1990 with a couple of dancers, Keith Flint and Leeroy Thornhill. While the U.K. raved under the sign of a giant yellow smiley face, the Prodigy adopted a demonic rictus. That attitude, paired with Howlett's machine-gun breakbeats, mangled cartoon samples, and acid-metal amalgams, repeatedly took the group to the upper reaches of the British pop charts, and it helped them become one of the first British dance acts to break America when they signed a rumored $5 million contract—with Madonna's Maverick label, no less—for their 1997 album The Fat of the Land, a Trojan Horse for ""electronica"" that also paved the way for a lot of regrettable rap-rock. That record's concussive repercussions can still be felt through all manner of dance music that is loud, aggressive, and in love with its own transgressions: Skrillex, ""Express Yourself"", ""Turn Down for What"", you name it. But the Prodigy never really seemed to matter in quite the same way again. After a seven-year wait, 2004's Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned was a mixed bag of Fat of the Land­-style retreads, and, five years after that, Invaders Must Die sounded like still more rendered Fat drippings rescued from the pan—just beefed up to meet the production standards of the then-ascendant dubstep scene. Perhaps The Day Is My Enemy benefits from the fact that, in the past few years, the zeitgeist has moved on yet again—to hip-hop and R&B, on the one hand, and deeper, moodier shades of dance music on the other—which means that the Prodigy sound increasingly like a genre of one. The title song, which opens the album, is a malevolent high point. The guitar riff rains down like a buzz bomb and the quarter-note ride cymbal sounds like an anvil; Martina Topley-Bird, of all people, sings a trembling couplet borrowed from Cole Porter's ""All Through the Night"". There's a wild, madcap energy to it—I'm reminded, incongruously enough, of Colourbox's ""Hot Doggie"", from 4AD's Lonely Is an Eyesore compilation—that carries through the rest of the album's best songs. The double-barreled ""Nasty"" rockets ahead on a distorted biwa riff, rolling breakbeats, and call-and-response chants courtesy of longtime vocalists Keith Flint and Maxim, while a woozy Theremin melody taps a winking camp sensibility. ""Destroy"" fuses Belgian rave with skronking baritone sax, while ""Rhythm Bomb"" cribs the chorus of Jomanda's 1988 diva-house tune ""Make My Body Rock (Feel It)"". The best thing on the album, by far, is ""Ibiza"", a breakbeat fusillade stitched together with rayguns and chintzy Hammond organs; pub philosophers Sleaford Mods spit the withering hook—""Eye-beetha! Eye-beetha!""—and it's such a natural pairing, you wonder why they don't sing on all of the Prodigy's songs. The Prodigy, for all their anger, have never really been about meaning—just see ""Smack My Bitch Up"", or the equally execrable ""Baby's Got a Temper"", an ode to Rohypnol—but the Mods' sudsy expositions actually manage to lend a layer of depth to the music, even if it does just entail shouting ""Transmit! Transmit! What's he fucking doing?"" over and over. Elsewhere, the lyrics are as corny as ever. In ""Wall of Death"", Maxim and Keith Flint shout, ""You're not ready to visualize/ I'm not here to be sterilized/ Follow me to the wall of death!"" In ""Wild Frontier"", Maxim warns us that we've got to face our fear in the—yeah, you guessed it—wild frontier. And then there's ""Invisible Sun"", a ham-fisted attempt to capture Soundgarden levels of grandeur in trap beats, twangy guitars, and straight-up doggerel: ""Invisible sun, I'm stumbling in the dark/ Invisible sun, a shadow upon the stars/ Invisible sun, shining where there's no path/ Invisible sun, burning out question marks."" So, yes, there are easily as many misses as hits on the album, and 14 tracks is probably about seven tracks too long. Not to mention that ""Get Your Fight On""—lyrics sadly not written by David Rees—samples Pepe Deluxé's ""Salami Fever"", which the Prodigy already sampled on 2009's ""Take Me to the Hospital"". Then again, Howlett has been repeating himself in one way or another for some 25 years now; can you blame him for going back to a particularly fertile groove?","The Prodigy's influence can still be felt through all manner of dance music that is loud, aggressive, and in love with its own transgressions, but on their sixth album, they increasingly sound like a genre of one.

Carrie & Lowell,Sufjan Stevens,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ac5c5e6ef959693218f8/1:1/w_160/dbfa1978.jpg,2015-03-30 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20218-carrie-lowell/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Sufjan Stevens' new album, Carrie & Lowell, is his best. This is a big claim, considering his career: 2003's Michigan, 2004's stripped-down Seven Swans, 2005's Illinois, and 2010's knotty electro-acoustic collection The Age of Adz. He's also had residencies at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, collaborated with rappers and the National, donned wings and paint-splattered dayglo costumes, and released Christmas albums. But none of those side projects were ultimately ever as interesting, or effective, as when Sufjan was just Sufjan, a guy with a guitar or piano, well-detailed lyrics, and a gorgeous whisper that could reach into a heartbreaking falsetto. Part of what makes Carrie & Lowell so great is that it comes after all of those things—the wings, the orchestras—but it feels like you're hearing him for the first time again, and in his most intimate form. This record is a return to the sparse folk of Seven Swans, but with a decade's worth of honing and exploration packed into it. It already feels like his most classic and pure effort. By now the album's main narrative is well-known. Carrie & Lowell is titled after Stevens' mother and stepfather. Carrie was bipolar and schizophrenic and suffered from drug addiction and substance abuse. She died of stomach cancer in 2012, but had abandoned Stevens much earlier, first when he was 1, then later, repeatedly (""when I was three, three maybe four, she left us at that video store,"" he sings on ""Should Have Known Better""). His stepfather, Lowell Brams, was married to Carrie for five years when Sufjan was a child. As a testament to the importance of his role in Stevens' life, Brams currently runs Stevens' label, Asthmatic Kitty, and shows up repeatedly in the record, most poignantly on the title track, where Stevens frames those five years as his ""season of hope."" Stevens has always written personally, weaving his life story into larger narratives, but here his autobiography, front and center, is itself the grand history. The songs explore childhood, family, grief, depression, loneliness, faith, and rebirth in direct and unflinching language that matches the scaled-back instrumentation. There are Biblical references, and references to mythology, but most of it is squarely about Stevens and his family. A few of the songs (""Carrie & Lowell"", ""Eugene"", ""All of Me Wants All of You"") mention the summer trips to Oregon that Stevens made, between the ages of five and eight, with Carrie, Lowell, and his brother. There are Oregon-specific references to Eugene, the Tillamook Burn forest fires, Spencer Butte, the Lost Blue Bucket Mine, and swimming lessons with a man who calls him Subaru. These were moments when Stevens was closest to his mother, or at least in most constant proximity to her, and he recorded some of Carrie & Lowell's tracks on an iPhone in a hotel in Klamath Falls, Oregon, as if trying to find a way to recreate those moments one more time. Other songs focus on an adult Stevens coping with the aftermath of those early years, and the blankness his mother's distance and death left in him. He beats himself up for not trying harder to be closer earlier. On ""Should Have Known Better"" he sings ""I should have wrote a letter/ Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling."" He talks about his own drinking (""Now I'm drunk and afraid/ Wishing the world would go away"") and drug abuse, disconnected relationships (""You checked your text while I masturbated""), self-loathing, and emptiness (""In a manner of speaking I'm dead""). There are suicidal thoughts (arm cutting, driving a car off a cliff, drowning, and questions like ""Do I care if I survive this?""), which he pushes away with his faith and by focusing on the wonders around him (""Sea lion caves in the dark,"" the hysterical light of Eugene, Oregon). There is a lot of blood. Some broken bones. Tears. There is also a constant need to be closer—to his mother, to himself, to the world around him—even when it seems useless: ""What's the point of singing songs/ If they'll never even hear you?"" (""Eugene""). The other main character here is his brother, Marzuki Stevens, and his daughter, Sufjan's niece, who provides the one true moment of joy on the record: ""My brother had a daughter/ The beauty that she brings, illumination"" (""Should Have Known Better""). As he told Pitchfork, ""With this record, I needed to extract myself out of this environment of make-believe. It’s something that was necessary for me to do in the wake of my mother’s death—to pursue a sense of peace and serenity in spite of suffering. It’s not really trying to say anything new, or prove anything, or innovate. It feels artless, which is a good thing. This is not my art project; this is my life."" On the second to last track, ""No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross"", he sings, in falsetto, ""Fuck me I'm falling apart,"" and it is maybe the barest, most honest declaration you'll hear on a record this year.~~
~~ His relationship, or lack thereof, with his mother is complex: He never hates her. He feels her everywhere: She passes through him as an apparition, and everything comes back to her in one way or another. ""I love you more than the world can contain/ In its lonely and ramshackle head,"" he sings. He doesn't cast blame. ""Fourth of July"", a tender song about her death, is filled with terms of endearment (""my little hawk,"" ""my firefly""), and questions about how he can raise her from the dead and then make the most of his own life, before he ends the song by repeating, soberly, ""We're all gonna die."" The lyrics here are masterful and carefully shorn, and the music is as well. Stevens is joined by Laura Veirs, S. Carey, Thomas Bartlett, and others, but they come off as ghosts in the room around his carefully constructed soundscapes, compositions that tastefully blend acoustic and electronic elements that grow deeper with each listen. There are pianos, organs, starry washes, smears of synthesizers, clicking percussion, unidentifiable pulses, doubled vocals, soaring background harmonies, and quickly picked acoustic guitars that will remind you of Elliott Smith. In the past he'd get showy with multi-part suites or huge arrangements; the writing here is just as ambitious, but never showy. You often forget the music's there, but when you don't, it's catchy, inventive, melodic, seamless. The haunting production, too, is minimal but fathomless. Stevens has been making music for a long time, and Carrie & Lowell shines a light back on the rest of his oeuvre. You realize the story of Michigan's ""Romulus"" is heartbreakingly real, down to its references to Oregon (""Once when our mother called/ She had a voice of last year's cough/ We passed around the phone/ Sharing a word about Oregon""), and that desperate desire for even one touch: ""Once when we moved away/ She came to Romulus for a day/ Her Chevrolet broke down/ We prayed it'd never be fixed or be found/ We touched her hair."" He loves his mother, and is ashamed of her, and can't stop loving her. It's one example of many, and when you re-listen to the past albums, and songs like ""The Seer's Tower"" and its once mysterious ""Oh, my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us,"" it acts as a skeleton key to what was once an ineffable sadness. As he put it in ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr."": ""Even in my best behavior I am really just like him/ Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid."" Here are those secrets laid bare. There is a photo in the booklet of a young Stevens, at the table, eating a banana. It's one of a few photos in the booklet that seem to depict some of those Oregon summers: a beach spotted with rocks, a small half-painted wooden house near trees and hills. His look is not happy or sad; he's just a kid at a table, eating. But there's something melancholic there, something maybe you add onto it after listening to Carrie & Lowell, but something real nonetheless: His mother is standing beside him. She's not looking at him, but she's there. (She appears in three shots, and in none of them can you see her eyes.) You imagine Lowell took the picture (on the back of the booklet you see his reflection in the mirror of a photo taken of Carrie crocheting). It's a haunting feeling that that little kid, years later, would create a masterpiece so knowing about suffering, sadness, death, and loneliness. In that photo, though, he's still a kid, with all those kid hurts, trying to make sense of the world. And, at least for that moment, he's close to his mother. And it seems like maybe he's happy.","Sufjan Stevens has always written personally, weaving his life story into larger narratives, but here his autobiography is front and center. Carrie & Lowell is a return to the stripped-back folk of Seven Swans, but with a decade's worth of refinement and exploration packed into it.

Waiting,Thursday,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad36ea9e61561daa608d/1:1/w_160/da464808.jpg,2015-03-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20375-waiting/,EyeballCollectEyeballCollect,"There will always be a segment of a popular punk band’s fanbase maintaining their debut will never be topped, based on its ""rawness"" and ""honesty."" For Thursday, this cohort appears to be smaller than most. In fact, the overwhelming consensus is that Waiting is their least potent work, an opinion that’s less uncomfortable to hold knowing that it is also Geoff Rickly’s. But that’s more a reflection on the overall strength of their catalog and how every Thursday record managed to be superlative in its own way: Full Collapse is the most influential; War All the Time the heaviest; A City by the Light Divided remains their most melodic, A Common Existence their most brutal; and No Devolución their most comprehensive. Waiting simply stands as Thursday’s most promising and earnest album. These are qualities that are granted retroactively, and the slick packaging of this reissue (including their now-iconic dove logo, which didn't actually appear until War All the Time) realigns Waiting as part of Thursday’s arc rather than an outlier. While it’s easy to appreciate because of what it led to, Waiting managed to stand out at the time because of Rickly’s passionate, verbose lyrics and near-frightening intensity. This was by far the most developed aspect of Thursday’s sound in 2000 and would continue to set them apart even as a still-healthy record industry figured out what the hell to do with them. At the time of Waiting, Thursday didn’t quite know where they stood either. The music itself is agitated, propulsive. ""Porcelain"" was inspired by the suicide of a friend and begins the record expounding on the heartbreaking fragility of life itself, contrasted with Rickly’s anger and resentment towards a society unwilling to take the smallest steps to protect those who might not be able to help themselves. Rickly also advocated for ramped-up suicide prevention measures and tighter background checks for gun buyers in the lyrics sheet. The same overwhelming frustration courses through ""Dying in New Brunswick"", perhaps the most tortured track Rickly would ever write. As with most of Waiting, it’s drawn from his own experience—his girlfriend at the time moved to the titular city and was raped within a week. Rickly tries to understand her trauma (""In these city streets I hide my face/ I turn away when you look at me/ And every night when I try to sleep/ I can feel your hands all over my body"") as well as cultural mores and legal hurdles that causes the victim to blame themselves (""They say it doesn’t happen that often/ But it’s happening right now""). The only thing the two songs share is a longing for escape, from the city, from everything—death is preferable to the liminal state of dying. It’s extremely bleak stuff, to the point where a song called ""Ian Curtis"" is one of the least harrowing. Like many, I arrived at Waiting only after discovering Full Collapse*,* and I heard the chorus of ""Ian Curtis"" as a prescient barb at the Joy Division worshippers that would overrun neighboring New York City years later: ""I heard Ian Curtis hang himself again in your band."" As it turns out, it’s ""in your bed"", and the scene is actually of Rickly and an ex listening to Joy Division in bed together. Given this rueful context, as well as that of ""Porcelain"", the image reflects on the absurdity of romanticizing suicide. ""Ian Curtis"" is followed by an instrumental called ""Introduction""; who wouldn’t want a breather and restart after all of this? Such is the urgency of Waiting, with Rickly so inspired to just get this weight off him that the band didn’t have time to really figure out what to do besides push. Occasionally, you can hear the sheared, trebly guitars of Texas Is the Reason (whose Norm Brannon heads up Collect Records with Rickly), Fugazi’s more ruminative moments, or Sunny Day Real Estate’s yearning, exploratory passages. Thursday had too much of a melodic underpinning for ""screamo"" or even ""post-hardcore"" to really stick, but they had yet to figure out how much to commit to pop. On ""Porcelain"", Rickly can barely catch his breath chasing its cyclical melody, unable to fully give the chorus the boost it needs; by Full Collapse, they’d learn to explode on ""Understanding in a Car Crash"" and ""Standing on the Edge of Summer"". At times, it’s the sound of a band throwing songs together rather than crafting them: On ""In Transmission"" the dissonance between Rickly’s melodies and the lead guitar unintentionally serve its central metaphor of communication breakdowns. There are strong moments, but everything that Waiting did well, Full Collapse did better. But the same could be said of Full Collapse in relation to Thursday’s future works. In fact, Waiting gives hints of how they’d progress even beyond their commercial breakthrough. The violins are a nice touch on ""This Side of Brightness"", but they’re just a touch; on No Devolución’s ""Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart"", Thursday knew how to be orchestral. The social conscience that started to emerge on ""The Circle Ends"" would be fully explored on War All the Time and A Common Existence. And then there’s the last song they ever recorded, ""Stay True""—Rickly’s addressing an up-and-coming punk rock band and giving advice on what it’s like to be young, ambitious, idealistic, thin-skinned and prone to relying on outside validation. It never sounded patronizing or condescending; anyone who’s heard Waiting knows that Rickly and Thursday have been in that same position.","Thursday's debut Waiting, which is being reissued, is not the band's highest point; it is, however, the band's most promising and earnest album.

Flame Rave EP,Clark,by: Nick Neyland,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad5a9d034d5c69bf4359/1:1/w_160/364e9cdf.jpg,2015-03-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20399-flame-rave-ep/,Warp,"There’s something a little old fashioned about the music English producer Chris Clark makes, both in its components and in the underlying themes. The fact that he’s now a Warp mainstay is fitting—much of the music on Flame Rave, a four-track EP that follows his excellent Clark LP from last year, mirrors the future vision mapped out in the label’s earliest releases. It doesn’t imagine a world much beyond the first Artificial Intelligence compilation or Polygon Window’s Surfing on Sine Waves, where the future remains all burning chrome and collapsing new buildings. It’s to his credit that Clark can survey such a thoroughly excavated space and scrape out something worthwhile from it, and Flame Rave pushes on the Clark thread of big-theme dystopia until it begins to resemble something like a great dynastic collapse. Several worlds converge here, merged by Clark's skill and experience. There’s something of the Haxan Cloak’s deliberate hugeness, as well as the sense of techno shifting from a harbinger to a retro-future marker. On ""Silver Sun"", the EP’s lead track but also its weakest, Clark knots up a jungle breakbeat with slow-moving loops, drawing out a subtle sense of conflict that ties into his fascination with technology that throws up error messages everywhere. He never drives his music to the point of total malfunction, instead positioning himself in the gulf between a great night out and a bad one. ""Silver Sun"" even ends with some rave-y whoops and cheers, but it’s thoroughly backgrounded and filtered through heavy distortion, making it feel like a vicarious thrill at best. The idea of Clark on the outside of club culture looking in is something he’s touched on in interviews. He has the air of an observer at times, while at others he’s deeply engaged, and it’s when he entwines both modes that his music becomes engrossing. ""To Live and Die in Grantham"", its title perhaps a nod to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, builds around trance techno patterns that recall the ""pure trance"" version of the KLF’s ""What Time Is Love"", which surely comes from a lifetime of studying the form. But it’s all wrapped up in rushes of warm, emotive electronics, suggesting someone keen to move his audience in both brain and body. The cover of Flame Rave shows a face split into light and dark. It mirrors the scaly black-and-white picture from the sleeve of Clark, but the juxtaposition of color neatly reflects the progression he’s made from one of his most acclaimed albums to date. Flame Rave finds a little more joy, a little more to celebrate, among the retro-terror his music often evokes. If Clark was the sound of someone scaling an awesome peak, this is the point where he settles in, throws a big party, and gets caught up in pure emotion.","Clark's new EP, a follow up his excellent self-titled record, continues his fascination with technology that throws up error messages everywhere. He never drives his music to the point of total malfunction, instead positioning himself in the gulf between a great night out and a bad one.

700 Fill EP,Ratking,by: Craig Jenkins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad1913d1975652139e9f/1:1/w_160/908c458d.jpg,2015-03-27 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20355-700-fill-ep/,self-released,"Ratking’s debut album So It Goes was a Delorean trip through seemingly incongruous corners of New York rap music. Touching on insular Def Jux pessimism and outsized Dipset flair and coated by a shroud of bristly noise, So It Goes seemed to search for an old city, one in danger of being thrust into into the East River by an influx of doe-eyed, affluent young professionals. ""Welcome to New York"" this was not. Their music can feel like a trek through a forbidding city winter, so it’s fitting that the group holed up in December to craft the quick-hit follow up EP 700 Fill. Though it arrives at the tail end of an uncommonly brutal cold season and literally namechecks North Face jacket models and the grade of their goose-down filling on a song (""Steep Tech""), 700 Fill is a lighter, breezier listen than its predecessor, thanks to the group’s eagerness to toy with its sound and writing process. Much of 700 Fill was written in just a week by rappers Wiki and Hak over beats that producer Sporting Life pieced together ahead of recording. The lack of an overarching concept gives the new material a freer feel, as Wiki trades grizzled storytelling for battle raps and rhyme acrobatics. Still, there are gems here: ""Arnold Palmer"" kicks a metaphor comparing the titular ice tea and lemonade hybrid to Wiki’s own biracial heritage while pining for a cold Brisk and a fat J on a rooftop in summer, while ""Bethel"" triumphantly renounces So It Goes’ high school graduate career anxiety after a year of good press and extensive touring. 700 Fill cycles between fleshed out cuts and looser lyrical workouts like ""Lenape Lane"" and ""Sticky Trap"" but even the most perfunctory of these exercises are intriguing. Wiki’s internal rhyme-heavy raps and Hak’s airy hooks were occasionally too divergent to gel on So It Goes, but with 700 Fill, Ratking seems to be figuring out what to do with Hak. The EP confidently cuts him loose on intros, bridges and outros as a confectionary dusting to Wiki’s gruff veneer, although he’s still working out what to do when he’s tossed an entire verse on ""Lenape Lane"" and ""Bethel"". 700 Fill’s not afraid to throw the Wiki-Hak balancing act out the window, though: The two best cuts here are ""Eternal Reveal"", a gossamer Hak reverie with a short Wiki verse stuck in the middle, and ""Flurry"", a spitfire Wiki solo cut. Sporting Life’s taking verses too, and the brusque, unpolished humor of his voice is a reminder that home base for the group is Harlem. With Ratking’s rapping axis exploring new forms of expression, 700 Fill is really a showcase for Sporting Life. He’s eased off the needling skronk of So It Goes and the group’s debut EP Wiki93 in favor of spacier, more melodic textures. ""American Gods"" and ""Eternal Reveal"" both revisit Sport’s knack for flaying a sample beyond recognition but drop his trademark willful dissonance, the former in service of a soulful sendup of New York’s Just Blaze era and the latter, an idyllic waltz. Otherwise, Sport prefers affixing trap drums to winding, ghostly synth lines to dizzying effect. Imagine Dan the Automator popping in the Mike WiLL era. 700 Fill is the sound of Ratking pulling its sound apart between albums to feel around for what works and doesn’t. Its off-the-cuff sound and free Bittorrent release strategy suggest a group attempting to sidestep the press and PR machine to sneak around and find itself. ""We’re talking about practice,"" Wiki sneers in ""Bethel"", quoting a classic press conference from NBA superstar Allen Iverson. ""Not the game!"" If Wiki, Hak and Sport are just in warm-ups here, the form is still on point.","Ratking holed up in December to craft this quick-hit follow-up to their debut, and it is a lighter, breezier listen than its predecessor, thanks to the group’s eagerness to toy with its sound and writing process.

Short Movie,Laura Marling,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad39c0084474cd0c16af/1:1/w_160/7af7acd9.jpg,2015-03-27 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20377-short-movie/,Ribbon MusicVirgin EMI,"Laura Marling is a particularly standoffish singer/songwriter, reserved in interviews and tauntingly prickly in song; a typical line, from A Creature I Don’t Know standout ""Sophia"", is ""I never did say whatever it was you did that day."" As she’s grown, she’s moved farther in this direction, away from the plain-spoken vulnerability of Alas, I Cannot Swim into vocals that curl words into secretive murmurs, and lyrics that tiptoe up to confessions then stop just short. Mythology and formal allusions swirl around even her candid moments, assuring that any autobiography is lost in the fog. So it’s a mild shock to hear Marling sing ""We shared an apartment on the Upper West Side"" toward the beginning of her fifth record Short Movie. The lyric is rooted to a specific place, a specific happening in her life. It’s even a precise moment—2012’s post-Hurricane Sandy blackout, which left most of lower Manhattan without power and ""dark, as if no one lives there,"" as she says on ""False Hope"". In interviews, Marling acknowledges Short Movie is more unguarded, though characteristically only to a point: ""The arm’s distance was getting closer with this record for sure, but then I stopped,"" she told The Guardian, declining to elaborate. In part, the new sense of openness comes from the sound. Short Movie is her first album written on electric guitar—specifically, her father’s old Gibson 335. It’s not a drastic change, as Marling’s uptempo tracks have always had muscle, but it’s palpable nevertheless. Marling toured Once I Was an Eagle with longtime cellist Ruth de Turberville (who contributes lovely arrangements on Short Movie) but little else in the way of a band or instrumentation, and on Short Movie, she clutches every guitar fill like it’s a long-lost piece of her identity, luxuriating in space and writing bigger and hazier songs to match. The arrangement on ""Warrior"", for instance, is stranded atop a canyon of echo and given an arrangement so vast and dusty that Marling almost gets away with the America rip (yes, that one). ""Warrior"" is hauntingly serious, but elsewhere you can hear here loosening up: ""Strange,"" a near-spoken disembowelment of a hapless cheating man, wouldn’t work without the cruelest hitch of a laugh in Marling’s voice as she informs him, ""I don’t love you… I’m pretty sure that you know."" It’s easily the standout: every syllable delivered like acid, and lyrics that continually walk up to the line and cross it—right up to ""No, I do not believe we were born equally."" Short Movie has been called Marling’s ""quarterlife crisis"" album, but the crises she's grappling here are the same ones she's confronted her entire career: love as a threat to autonomy, suitors as perpetual disappointments, wariness of intimacy but also of the alternatives. Album opener ""Warrior"" is a mythological conceit typical of Marling—men as warriors, women as the steeds they misuse. Marling is the sort of artist to deliver ""I feel your love"" like it’s synonymous with fear, or choking gas; ""Walk Alone"" is the sound of a woman who’s sat with herself long enough to realize, horrified, that what she hears inside is a lonely-morning dirge. This turns out to be Short Movie’s main, minor downfall: Most of these themes were explored, in more eviscerating detail, in Once I Was an Eagle, and the album meanders in the second half. Without an overarching conceit like Once I Was an Eagle, Short Movie comes off sounding like a transition record, a short movie in the sense that it’s a prelude to something bigger. But Marling’s career is remarkable in part because album after album she not only delivers on those bigger things, but delivers them in her idiosyncratic voice. She’s spent her entire career dodging comparisons, but by now she has earned the right to be compared only to herself.","Short Movie is Laura Marling's most open and airy album yet, though it remains enigmatic. It is her first album written on electric guitar, and she clutches every guitar fill like it’s a long-lost piece of her identity, luxuriating in space and writing bigger and hazier songs to match.

56 Nights,Future,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad7cb1335d7bf1699be8/1:1/w_160/b2597073.jpg,2015-03-27 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20424-56-nights/,,"Future has been on an underrated tear since last October, when his rage-fueled Monster mixtape was dramatically overshadowed by an ill-advised guest appearance on Mike WiLL Made It’s ""Pussy Overrated"" with Wiz Khalifa, which, in the context of his failed romance with R&B singer Ciara, seemed even more crass than it was foolish. The tape itself was vintage Future but also magnificently petty, and it went mostly underappreciated as a result. He continued his strong run with the Zaytoven-produced Beast Mode, which was an equally snappy but less petulant response to his emotional turmoil. After announcing plans earlier this month to keep the ball rolling with a sequel to 2011’s Dirty Sprite on Twitter, Future unexpectedly dropped 56 Nights, the latest in what feels like a sustained campaign. The mixtape's title refers to the amount of time Future’s DJ, Esco, spent in a Dubai jail on a trip to the 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. It’s officially billed as a DJ Esco tape hosted by Future, the first since 2013’s No Sleep, but unlike that 23-track offering, featuring contributions from Shy Glizzy, Young Scooter and PeeWee Longway, 56 Nights is Future standing alone with no guests. When he raps ""None of this money that matter; all of my niggas, they matter"" on ""Diamonds From Africa"", it feels like an acknowledgement of his DJ’s ordeal. Future still has other problems, too, and like Beast Mode and Monster before it, 56 Nights hints at the lingering effects from his soured relationship. Where many songs on Beast Mode found Future trying to sort out the pain of estrangement in the embrace of other women, 56 Nights drowns in a potent drug concoction that influences both its sound and his addled, prattling lyrics, which often give way to profound moments of clarity. Casual sex is often written off as tedious, only spurred on by copious drug use (""I didn’t wanna fuck the bitch/ This molly made me fuck her even though she average,"" on ""March Madness""; ""I pour up again and again/ I said I wasn’t gonna fuck with that bitch then I fucked her again,"" on ""Never Gon Lose""). The overarching theme is reliance on drugs over women, a preference he spells out on ""Purple Comin In"": ""Fuck a bitch on that shit, I don’t need her"" versus ""Fell in love with that drank and I need it."" Future seems to have developed a codependency on pharmaceuticals, one that fills a void and levels his unease—on ""Trap Niggas"" he raps, ""I’m drinking Activis, the only thing that relax me""—and this continuous state of inebriation allows Future to be remarkably open. The bulk of the production on 56 Nights is handled by Southside with one song produced by Tarentino. Both are members of 808 Mafia, the in-house production team of Waka Flocka Flame’s Brick Squad Monopoly, and Future follows their unhinged, woozy lead, lining knocking 808s with frenetic flows that fumble into mumbling like on ""No Compadre"".  He occasionally offers brief bits of social commentary and self-reflection: On ""March Madness"" he sings ""All these cops shooting niggas, tragic"" and on ""Trap Niggas"", ""I got a lower case T across my chest/ Your crack house doing numbers then you blessed/ You move your mama to a crib from the 'jects."" The ideas arrive as garbled fragments that, when pieced together, tell his story, and 56 Nights is an unfiltered look at life through the eyes of a wasted Future.","Like Beast Mode and Monster before it, Future's latest mixtape hints at the lingering effects from the rapper's soured relationship with Ciara.

His discography is overshadowed by the names he has worked with—Jamie Lidell, Daft Punk, and many musicians from Canada's indie and electro circles, such as Peaches and Feist (he was a key contributor to the Grammy-nominated The Reminder). It's more likely that you own several albums with his name in the credits than one with his name on the cover. It doesn't help that he's changed his name and style several times. Gonzales' influences encompass classical, jazz, rap, chill-out music and easy-listening pop, and he continually reshuffles them to emphasize one strand or another. Before the '90s were out, he quit the Warner Bros.-signed Canadian alt-rock band Son, moved to Berlin and started releasing keyboard-driven coffeehouse electro under the apocryphal surname Gonzales. Then he came back in the '00s as Chilly Gonzales, a pop-classical songwriter and pianist with a sideline in '70s radio pastiches (see the album Soft Power). In chamber music, he found something like a solid niche. Gonzales' neo-Romantic mode has been his most productive in recent years, with the second of two Solo Piano albums being longlisted for the Polaris Prize. He returns to it on Chambers, a modest, plush song cycle with the new addition of string arrangements performed by Hamburg's capable Kaiser Quartett. The configuration allows Gonzales to build out his Satie-like compositions into homages to other composers from classical music history. But Chambers should not be mistaken for the kind of contemporary classical coming out of Naxos, ECM or New Amsterdam. Victoire, Nico Muhly, Valgeir Sigurðsson or yMusic, for instance, all sound downright recondite next to Gonzales. He is more interested in where the form has been, and, as he tells us in liner notes and a Vice op-ed, in making us hear it as Schubert was heard in his day—as pop. With Impressionist and minimalist diversions, he plies an extroverted row that ends in the Romantic era, untroubled by dissonance, alternate tonality or complex time. It's as if Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Varèse never happened. Gonzales has a soft, precise touch on the piano, tastefully decorating nimble progressions with expressive spills through nearby scales. As an admittedly novice string arranger, he favors ranks of staccato pulses and gently fencing legato lines, splicing them effectively on ""Advantage Points"". On ""Prelude to a Feud"", cascading piano arpeggios inspired by Bach and electronic dance music break out into a Tchaikovsky-like courtly dance. ""Cello Gonzales"" fashions the instrument of the title, with its plaintive vocal quality, into a Mendelssohn tribute. ""Sweet Burden"" channels dreamy, pensive French Impressionists; the lush, broad eddies of ""Green Leaves"" summon Vivaldi; ""Solitaire"" and others pine for Schubert. Gonzales makes some valid claims for the album's pop aspects—""Sample This"" purports to transmute a Southern rap bounce track, while ""Switchcraft"" is modeled on Juicy J's asymmetrical flow. You can hear it if you try, but it's unlikely that a casual listener will perceive these as bangers. Gonzales' limited interest in forms and textures beyond pristine, overt beauty level the record out toward soundtrack music, consistent with crowd-pleasers such as Peter Broderick, without many layers to peel back over time. Though enjoyable, it may land in a limbo, too simplistic for fans of great chamber music or its challenging modern variants; too classical—lacking bells, whistles, samples and beats—to make it more than pleasant dinner party music for people coming from the indie side.","Gonzales' neo-Romantic mode has been his most productive in recent years, with the second of two Solo Piano albums being longlisted for the Polaris Prize.

New York Before the War,Jesse Malin,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad2e13d1975652139ecb/1:1/w_160/de87f303.jpg,2015-03-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20369-new-york-before-the-war/,One Little IndianVelvet Elk,"Sheena was a punk rocker, but not anymore. As Jesse Malin portrays her—or someone like her—in ""Oh Sheena"", from his new album New York Before the War, the Ramones’ mascot is older and wiser, stuck perhaps in the kind of dead-end life she once dreaded, but not cynical just yet. ""There’s a world outside if you want it, there’s a world outside you can know,"" Malin promises her, wondering if we can realize any of those dreams we let slip away when we became adults. Sheena has to be in her late 50s or early 60s, but he believes it’s never too late to live up to the promise of her teenage rebellion. Nearly 40 years after Rocket to Russia, she can still break away. Even if it’s more about a punk ideal than an actual flesh-and-blood person, ""Oh Sheena"" works up some genuine poignancy as Malin, a rock'n'roll veteran of more than two decades, surveys his own past. In the 1990s he came up with the band D Generation, who were so mired in New York rock history that they co-opted the gutter glam and platform shoes of the New York Dolls. After four albums the group disbanded and Malin launched a solo career defined by critical raves and commercial indifference. Riddled with references to local landmarks and local bands, New York Before the War is both the record he’s been trying to make his entire career and the record he’s been making all along: a collection of songs defined by New York City, beholden to its history and his place within it. That title may be a reference to the studio where he recorded the album, which featured a prescient bit of graffiti. But ""the war"" could just as easily signify the cataclysm of 9/11 or even Giuliani’s seven years as mayor, during which time he fundamentally changed the city’s character. However, the New York of Before the War ultimately isn’t the real city itself, but something like a more literary creation. This is the New York of the Ramones and CBGBs, of Jonathan Lethem and Paul Auster, of The Warriors and Taxi Driver. Every guy on the corner is Johnny Thunders, and every girl in a bar is Patti Smith circa Just Kids. This is the New York of our collective imagination peopled with dreamers and artists, gutter saints and garage bands. It’s also a city perpetually in the process of disappearing. ""Now they’re closing down the book store, and they’re putting up a condo,"" he sings on ""Addicted"", which percolates with the kind of jittery energy anyone who’s set foot in Manhattan will recognize. When he sings the line, ""I’ve lived here all my life,"" it sounds like a very specific kind of introspection, not unlike that of a subway rider studiously avoiding eye contact with anyone else in the car. Perhaps the greatest thing about this imagined New York is its diversity. Malin doesn’t get into loft jazz or Bronx salsa, but Before the War covers a lot of ground within the confines of rock-and-roll, ranging from the expected punk-derived rave-ups to barstool ballads to heart-on-sleeve country. He not only makes these disparate styles fit together naturalistically, but also allows them to comment on the album’s overarching narrative. The opener, which is actually called ""The Dreamers"", manufactures suspense via a progression of cinematically ominous piano chords, which are only dampened somewhat by the awkward refrain: ""Every time I hear the sound of my international baby."" ""Bar Life"" is a rousingly rueful drinking song about an immigrant whose dreams are preempted by alcoholism, and there’s something both reassuring and depressing about hearing so many people singing along to his downfall. There is nothing new in Malin’s depiction of New York, and that may be the whole point: He wants this milieu to be instantly familiar. He wants you to connect Sheena with the Ramones, he wants you to hear echoes of the Voidoids in ""Freeway"" and Television in ""Boots of Immigration"". So many local references may be tedious for listeners who already suffer from New York fatigue or who don’t think you have to move to Brooklyn to start a band. While Malin makes the nostalgia generally relatable, he doesn’t evoke the setting with much specificity or detail. In fact, it’s hard to shake the notion that he is merely taking part in the city’s ongoing romanticization of its own gloriously seedy culture and history, which has been the local pastime since before Sheena copped an attitude.","New York Before the War is the record Jesse Malin’s been trying to make his entire career, a collection of songs defined by New York City, beholden to its history and his place within it.

Nasty Witch Rock,Anasazi,by: Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ad41b1335d7bf1699b7a/1:1/w_160/353bc6ff.jpg,2015-03-26 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20383-anasazi-nasty-witch-rock/,Toxic State,"""Hex da System"", a standout track from New York punk act Anasazi’s debut album Nasty Witch Rock, features a gleefully overwrought spoken introduction. ""To the south, dictators on altars...To the west, missiles pierce the shallow graves"", intones vocalist Chi Orengo, mixing allusions to geopolitical turmoil with imagery of contemporary warfare. Like Nasty Witch Rock writ large, this ominous missive is rife with goth-rock melodrama. Orengo’s theatrical delivery harks to 1980s Angeleno acts like Red Scare and 45 Grave, while Anasazi’s serpentine guitar leads evoke Rikk Agnew’s cascading, chorus-laden riffs for Christian Death’s debut. The tom-tom thump recalls London's Batcave club, and blackened UK anarcho-punk outliers like the Mob and Amebix loom prominently. Despite these signifiers, Anasazi—who formed in 2010 and have recorded a handful of prior demos and EPs—find sly ways to subvert genre convention, mingling goth tropes with fantasies of retribution upon the criminal justice system and its shills. After he sets the scene of embattled Middle Earth on ""Hex da System"", Orengo disses cops, rich people, politicians, and more, but he redeems these radical-left cliches by proposing novel solutions: sorcery, magic, incantations—a supernatural insurrection. Casting spells and conducting rituals are standard goth pastimes, but Anasazi doesn’t just dither with the imagery of daggers and white stains for the hell of collecting evil points. Rather, the black ceremonies in Orengo’s lyrics are deployed against the state. Throughout Nasty Witch Rock, there’s a hex upon prison-profiteers, a ""Black Leather Curse"" for gentrifying yuppies, a self-sacrifice that seems to vanquish the C.I.A. on ""Hallelujah/Memba Me"", and a bewitched gasoline bomb for uniformed investigators on ""Doors of Void"". Anasazi’s mystic insurgency is a clever conceit, appealing to fans of B-horror campiness and an era’s exasperation with federal gridlock. Legislation and litigation are mere salves on the political system’s fetid carcass, Anasazi suggests, so ""Hex da System"" instead. The lyrics booklet includes instructions. Unfortunately, the production on Nasty Witch Rock is just dismal, rendering most of the lyrics unintelligible and flattening the dynamic range. On albums by Toxic State label-mates and scene peers like Crazy Spirit and Hank Wood & the Hammerheads, piss-poor fidelity helped thicken the punk bands' violent churn. But for Anasazi, it saps vigor from what should be intensifying turnarounds and builds. On ""Maniac in the Mirror"", the saturated guitar and stifled cackles feel limp, while the tuneful co-vocals on ""Thelema’s Will"" and ""Morbid Native"" get squandered by inscrutable mixing. That it was produced by Ben Greenberg—who’s perfectly deft with heavy, bleak music, as evidenced by recent work on Ukiah Drag’s In the Reaper's Quarters—is vexing. But the most vivid illustration of Nasty Witch Rock’s shortcomings is Anasazi’s earlier, better-produced 7”s, ""I Saw the Witch Cry"" and ""Attic Noise"", released in 2012 by Sacred Bones and Toxic State, respectively. On ""Bone Collector"", from ""Attic Noise"", Orengo’s voice is harrowing, the drums are muscular, and the guitar riffs sound like ice picks to Nasty Witch Rock’s mushy snow. The sonic definition gives Anasazi’s song arrangements real menace, which in turn boosts the potency and power of Orengo’s occult chants. With three songs running over 15 minutes, ""Attic Noise"" is Anasazi’s most compelling cry for a coven’s coup d'etat. Nasty Witch Rock, meanwhile, suffers from a studio seance gone awry.","On their debut LP, the New York punk outfit Anasazi mingle goth tropes with fantasies of retribution upon the criminal justice system.

Claustrophobia,Scuba,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acc313d1975652139e11/1:1/w_160/bda231cb.jpg,2015-03-26 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20296-claustrophobia/,Hotflush,"Scuba, a.k.a. Paul Rose, got his start making dubstep in the now-classic sense—heads-down, skunked-out, half-time steppers—but as UK dubstep evolved into ""bass music,"" Scuba seemed the likeliest candidate to graduate to festival main stages. After a string of singles whose titles spoke to his newfound ambitions—""Adrenalin"", ""Flash Addict"", ""Hardbody""—he capped off his transformation with 2012's Personality, which married his sumptuous sound design to ecstatic piano house riffs, thundering four-to-the-floor bangers, and echoes of the Chemical Brothers' stadium-filling big beat. But Rose made Claustrophobia in a year that, for health reasons, he took off from touring, and perhaps as a result, the album spends as much time looking inward as it does contemplating the reactions of the massing crowds. Stylistically, the album is roughly split between techno, ambient, and IDM; with one foot in the living room and one foot in the club, it suggests that Scuba's ""big room"" phase is over, at least for now. Rose certainly hasn't turned his back on dancers; ""Television"", ""PCP"", and ""Black on Black"" are among the heaviest tracks in his catalog. So is the brilliant ""Why You Feel So Low"", a throbbing monster whose glowing low end faintly echoes the best of Consumed-era Plastikman. But his approach to techno is idiosyncratic. The pulsating ""Levitation"", left untethered to a kick drum, becomes an ambient track almost by default, and the same thing happens to the aptly named ""Drift"". A more conventional artist would have chained both to a four-to-the-floor anchor, but Rose seems to have faith that the listener doesn't always need a metronomic handrail. Scuba's music has always sounded wonderful—warm, rich, enveloping, ultra-vivid—but Claustrophobia feels like a major step up; the sonics are simply dazzling. Rattled keys, wind chimes, rubbed wineglass rims, half-heard voices, and all manner of incidental rustle serve to make the music leap from the speakers. ""All I Think About Is Death"" pairs those tricks with a woman's mournful singing to create an entrancing update of trip-hop. ""Needle Phobia"" starts out as a dead ringer for the drone that opens Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Volume II before morphing into a shuddering tribute to the sound of Autechre's Amber LP. And then there's ""Family Entertainment""—just two-and-a-half minutes of wailing babies and hospital acoustics that swell into a disconcerting fluttering in the ears. As it dissolves into a spray of static, it has the ring of hard-won epiphany. There's a moment on ""Television"" where the music just stops, with a massive crescendo giving way to nothing but a thumping kick drum. It feels a little bit like that gag in the Road Runner cartoons where Wile E. Coyote goes skittering off over the edge of the cliff, and the same anticlimactic fake-out crops up again on ""Drift"", a moody thrum that briefly threatens to go full-bore and then changes its mind at the last minute: There's a heart-in-mouth crescendo, a roll of the drums, and then, just where you'd expect pyrotechnics, inky silence. And it happens again on ""Black on Black"", the kind of sooty, industrial-tinged banger that Scuba can seemingly turn out in his sleep. It's a clever trick: instead of beating audiences over the head, it reels them in; instead of projecting outwards, it reflects inwards. Scuba's album titles have always tended to read pretty literally: Triangulation suggested his path through dance music's crowded waters, tacking and jibing between techno and dubstep; Personality reflected the swagger of a newfound confidence. But Claustrophobia doesn't seem quite so straightforward. Far from sounding backed into a corner, after a strategic retreat from the big time, Rose seems right at home.","Claustophobia spends as much time looking inward as it does contemplating the reactions of the massing crowds.

The Ark Work,Liturgy,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929acd89d034d5c69bf4276/1:1/w_160/1c2bb3eb.jpg,2015-03-26 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20313-the-ark-work/,Thrill Jockey,"The first way to experience Liturgy’s The Ark Work is as a confounding mass of sound. The band seems to have designed it that way: Along with the guitars and percussion, there are horns, strings, constantly hammering glockenspiel, even bagpipes, all blaring at once, like 11 open browser tabs autoplaying or a block of car alarms set off by a passing motorcycle. Hunter Hunt-Hendrix, the band’s leading force and The Ark Work’s primary arranger, has talked in interviews about realizing the sound in his head; The Ark Work, he claims, is the closest he’s come to sharing it with us. The sound he's designed here feels purposefully too large, a pressurized force exploding out of confinement. Hearing it feels like watching someone's head split open, which might be an appropriate image for a band so concerned with themes of annihilation and rebirth. The second way to experience The Ark Work is as a kind of aesthetic gauntlet, hurled with an audible clunk. Liturgy’s previous albums, 2009’s Renihilation and 2011’s Aesthethica, cast Hunt-Hendrix’s imposing ideas—which he has tried to clarify, perhaps comically, in a pair of perfectly inscrutable diagrams included with The Ark Work’s packaging—in songlike forms. The Ark Work is closer, in its 57-minute expanse and grandeur, to a symphony—something long and Germanic, maybe by Bruckner. Long sections of it hang stubbornly in place, pitched between bedlam and boredom, before surging over another exhilarating crag in the music’s development. Recurring themes pop up, like alpine flowers dotting a mountainside. ""Follow"", the album’s first full track, begins with a chiming contrapuntal figure in the glockenspiels, led by pedal tones in the bass line. It has a fragile, otherworldly quality, which the band snuffs out briskly when it plunges in moments later. The theme resurfaces a few tracks later, on ""Follow II"", played by an organ, on ""Haelegen"", and then again on ""Total War"". Each time, it feels like a welcome space for contemplation amidst the chaos. These moments provide navigable markers on what can frankly be an imposing, even dismaying listen. The Ark Work is harmonically rich, but very slow; to say that it moves is to point out that glass is technically a liquid. The most awe-inspiring payoffs occur after agonizing liftoff: On ""Follow II"", strings and horns lifts the music up, like pigeons on strings tied to a Mahlerian orchestra. The mass seems to hang an inch or two above ground, groaning and threatening to split open, before the seams burst and Hunt-Hendrix’s little voice spills out. This sense of watching an impossible bulk lift skyward is the most thrilling sensation The Ark Work provides, and it happens two or three times across the album. In these moments, Hunt-Hendrix’s thrashing ambitions feel justified, and they position Liturgy not as descendants of black metal but of Swans, eager to chase exhilaration to punishing, Herculean extremes. The crazed energy of Ark’s best music feels indebted to Werner Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo, and Hunt-Hendrix has more than a touch of Herzog’s maddening genius/genius madman dynamic about him. In both cases, the primary question haunting the project's edges is ""Is this guy kidding?"" The Ark Work has another unfortunate Herzog parallel, and it’s a specific one: In order to enjoy the grand vision before you, you have to block the sometimes-irritating sound of the creator’s voice from your ears. On previous albums, Hunt-Hendrix screamed in a register that was both shocking and oddly delicate, like gift wrap tearing. On The Ark Work, he drones on a single note, with very little variation, for most of the time. It sounds deadening on first contact, and it doesn’t reveal much depth on repeated listens. He seems to be aiming for a trancelike, occult mood, and he has referenced the triplet flows of Three 6 Mafia as inspiration. The long incantatory passages of ""Quetzalcoatl"" and ""Father Vorizen"", which seem like his most direct attempts at applying this rhythm, offer a handy example of just how far a sound can travel from its origin. That is a charitable way of saying that his vocals often border on unendurable. On ""Father Vorizen"", his droning is mostly tuneless and nearly rhythmless, a persistent hum that you find yourself wanting to swat away. Because it is competing with massive elements, his voice has been doubled up and set slightly to the side in the mix, making him sound less an entranced cult leader, stoking the flames, than someone mumbling in a corner. When he moans ""The doors of perception will open and close/ Hope will exist in a problematic relationship with reason/ Libidinal energy will whirl round like a rattle rattling/ Hearts will be stopped bones will shatter shattering,"" on ""Quetzalcoatl"", the prevailing knock on Liturgy as a dog-and-pony show for Hunt-Hendrix’s half-baked musings feels uncomfortably close at hand. It is an unfair judgment to pass on the glorious, rippling full-band unit, however: Greg Fox, one of the most intuitive, thrilling, and musical drummers of his generation, is back in the band, and his playing, as it did on Aesthethica, feels truer to the spirit of Hunt-Hendrix’s philosophy than any of his declarations. The band plays with tremendous power, verve, and energy, but the results feel leaden, even after dozens of listens. For all of its dense conceptual underpinnings, The Ark Work comes up curiously short on new ideas long before the album ends.  The stretch of music covering the album’s first five tracks—""Fanfare"" to ""Quetzalcoatl""—invokes awe, terror, confusion, joy, despair. At this point, however, The Ark Work is less than half over. Inevitably, some chair-squirming occurs. Fatigue sets in; interest ebbs. This is the flip side of grandeur: When you stretch it out far enough, it becomes difficult to distinguish from terminal boredom.","The first way to experience Liturgy’s The Ark Work is as a confounding mass of sound.

Radio Silence,Talib Kweli,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a00d96619ee182b5dded19a/1:1/w_160/Talib%20Kweli_%20Radio%20Silence.jpg,2017-11-25 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talib-kweli-radio-silence/,3D,"Scholar. Street philosopher. Triple Nobel Peace Prize victor. First black male to pilot an aircraft. Father of the Nike Swoosh. “The man that made Kool Aid say, ‘Oh yeah!’” So said Dave Chappelle, that hip-hop tastemaker with the 90-percent free-throw percentage, on the first track of Talib Kweli’s first album, Quality. Yeah, it was hyperbole worthy of ushering Xerxes the Great into court, but it reflected the rising Brooklyn star’s bottomless ambitions. While hip-hop has continued to stylistically mutate, Kweli has spent the decade and a half since as the vanguard for deep-thinking conscious rap. You can’t solve all the world’s curses—not even over seven solo records. But at least he’s given it a shot. Album number eight, Radio Silence, is another solid Kweli release to add to the pile. He’s still bending the knee to the same soul-infused beats that contemporaries like Kanye West and Lupe Fiasco mostly abandoned sometime during George W. Bush’s second term. Kweli is still stacking cultural references on top of cultural references: The opening 90 seconds of Radio Silence alone see him citing, among other things, Back to the Future and Carlito’s Way, and rhyming “Sonny Carson” with “Johnnie Cochran.” And he’s still sometimes guilty of being a better thinker than music maker. Kweli’s flow can feel rushed and sticky, as though he can’t articulate his thoughts as neatly as he can conjure them up. But his fans are loyal. Radio Silence will comfortably shore up the base. If the album is in any way shocking, it’s because of the topics that Kweli does not directly engage with. He’s long been one of rap’s most prominent social activists, using interviews and a super-prolific Twitter feed to advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement, address the escalation of white supremacy, and criticize the current presidency. On Radio Silence, Kweli only circles the topics, occasionally throwing out jabs—“Every problem can’t be solved at the ballot box,” he raps on “All of Us,” in perhaps the album’s most obvious reference to the administration—but stopping short of launching the big, direct haymakers. This is not a record distinctly of its era like, say, Common’s Black America Again or A Tribe Called Quest’s We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service—contemporary albums from artists that qualify as Kweli’s direct stylistic forefathers. Instead, these are mostly songs that could have been pulled from any era of his career. There are, though, some very good Talib Kweli numbers. Radio Silence is a mostly a fresh tonic of brightness and positivity. “I live my life in the sunshine,” he raps on the lush, triumphant opener, “The Magic Hour,” without any sense of triteness; “I’m praying for a better tomorrow.” But over the bluster, Kweli still delivers his short sermons. “All of Us” slashes away with loquacious one-liners that cut deep: “The common myth is we’re savages with no history or accomplishments/Or knowledge of ourselves, they did a job on us.” There’s even room for a verse from the elusive Jay Electronica, who takes police brutality head on by evoking the image of cops beating an elderly woman. “Officer Friendly is an enemy now,” Electronica sighs, reminding everyone that his inability to sign off on an album qualifies as hip-hop’s own Greek tragedy. The most focused effort is “She’s My Hero,” a song inspired by Bresha Meadows, the teenager who last year shot and killed her allegedly abusive father as he slept. Over a beat produced by Oh No, Kweli runs through the narrative with the storytelling elegance and human understanding of a skilled documentary maker. There’s more deep-thinking as Kweli drills into masculinity and the corrosive effects of negative male role models on “ Knockturnal.” But this is comfortable territory. We’ve seen him thrive on cuts like these dozens of times before. A change of pace does come with “Chips,” where Waka Flocka Flame tempts Kweli onto some rattling hi-hats and brash brass. It’s a weird experiment likely to pique the interest only of those who are into weird hip-hop experiments—the muscular, anti-lyrical Waka teaming up with the new-age philosopher. But Kweli sounds less at home on the blustering beat, and the results are as mixed as you might expect. “The One I Love” is the kind of rap-R&B hybrid number that was slid onto every commercial hip-hop release about 15 years ago and is totally fine. In fact, the album only occasionally slips out of “sounds pretty nice” territory. When it really hits its stride—like on the soulful production and funky flows of “Let it Roll”—it sure is good to have Kweli around. But a decade and a half deep, I’d rather hear him testing himself more. Risking defeat to go for the win is infinitely more interesting than always playing for the draw.","On his eighth solo album, Talib Kweli remains the vanguard for deep-thinking conscious rap; storytelling and uplift are in ample supply, though the risks are few and far between.

Soul of a Woman,Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a09f9dfcc01f9323305a2e4/1:1/w_160/Sharon%20Jones%20Dap%20King_Soul%20of%20a%20woman.jpg,2017-11-24 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sharon-jones-and-the-dap-kings-soul-of-a-woman/,Daptone,"When Sharon Jones passed away last November after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, she died not as a soul revival artist but as a soul artist, period. The distinction is subtle but meaningful. What sounded in the 2000s like a throwback to the era of 1960s and 1970s funk and R&B eventually became something very modern and of its moment. The Dap-Kings may be one of the best backing bands around, and Daptone Records a more diversified and adventurous label than many people think, but it was Jones who rooted the music in the here and now instead of the there and then. A lot is made of her experience as a corrections officer and armored truck guard, but she worked in wedding bands and did session work for decades before she recorded her first single, at 40 years old, and her first full-length album, at 46. She conveyed an unshakable belief that soul music could speak to this or any other moment in time, and her voice, so insistent and expressive, could transform a song like Janet Jackson’s “What Have You Done for Me Lately”—or even Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land”—into something new and timely. Remarkably, that voice sounds barely diminished on Soul of a Woman, retaining every ounce of its personality and authority despite how cancer and chemo had sapped her energy, if not her drive. When Jones felt strong enough, she went into the studio and made music with the Dap-Kings. Otherwise, she was either resting or touring. In fact, she didn’t stop playing live until just a few weeks before her death. “I can’t wait too much longer,” she sings on opener “Matter of Time,” which dreams of peace, freedom, and unity. From any other singer, such a statement might speak to the long arc of justice, but in this case Jones sings from the position of knowing she might not live long enough to enjoy the fruits of that struggle. (In fact, she suffered a stroke on election night, which left her hospitalized, unable to speak but still able to sing.) Yet Soul of a Woman is not an album about facing down death. There’s nothing grim or fearful or despairing in her performances. Rather, most of these songs are lively, even celebratory, as she sings about the age-old subjects of soul music: politics both public and romantic, the state of the world and the state of a relationship. The barnburner “Sail On!” turns the tables on a dismissive lover, the Dap-Kings’ horns blasting around her as Jones works out the moral equation of her situation. “Rumors,” with its effervescent groove and party vibe, wags a soul finger at the gossip mill: “Rumors tell me that you’re no good, baby!” Soul of a Woman was initially planned to sound very different than it does. Producer Gabriel Roth (aka Bosco Mann) envisioned an album of slower, more lushly orchestrated songs but ultimately decided that Jones’ final statement should include more upbeat dance numbers, the kind that elicited such an excited response at live shows. A few of those original tunes remain: “When I Saw Your Face” shows just how acrobatic Jones’ voice could be, as she soars around in her upper register to convey a sense of romantic ecstasy. “Girl! (You Got to Forgive Him)” throws the kitchen sink at its melodramatic arrangement, but Jones keeps the song anchored in a very real predicament and lends the advice real wisdom and gravity. By combining these powerful soul ballads with upbeat dance numbers, Soul of a Woman lovingly portrays Jones as an artist with remarkable emotional and interpretive range. Nothing on Soul of a Woman, in fact, suggests that this is actually a posthumous album, that it was recorded by someone who knew she wouldn’t live to see its release. Jones gives perhaps her greatest performance on the final song, “Call on God,” which she wrote decades ago for her choir at Universal Church of God, where she sang before and after she started working with the Dap-Kings. The band provides restrained churchly accompaniment—the gently supportive thrum of the organ, the sympathetic chords of the guitar, the dramatic pulse of the drums—and Jones sounds bigger than life as she sings, “I made up my mind to be with Him all the time/And I won’t let nothing turn me around.” It’s to her credit that it doesn’t sound like a farewell. Instead, the song—the entire album, in fact—is a poignant statement of the determination that motivated her all along.","On her final, posthumously released album, Jones alternates powerful ballads with the upbeat dance numbers that were staples of her live shows, confirming her stature a contemporary soul-music icon.

The Fall - Singles 1978-2016,The Fall,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a149c4a284a0e1df6070b17/1:1/w_160/thefalla-sides.jpg,2017-11-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-fall-the-fall-singles-1978-2016/,Cherry Red,"The last thing the world needs is another Fall compilation. The sheer volume of music that Mark E. Smith (and whoever he’s barking orders at) has produced over the past four decades has resulted in so many anthologies and quickie collections that you could build a house out of the jewel cases. But Cherry Red’s new seven-disc Fall box set instantly crushes them all like Godzilla on Bambi. It’s a survey of every single and B-side the Mancunian institution has released since 1978, providing a tidy, linear history of a notoriously unstable band. As with everything about the Fall, however, even this simple strategy is actually a lot more complicated than it appears. Back in 2006, The Guardian’s Dave Simpson attempted to track down every former member of the Fall, a list that could fill a small town’s phonebook. And there could likely be another compelling in-depth article written about the effort required to put this box set together. The Fall have released over 50 singles to date, and through almost as many labels, some of which are long-defunct. Singles 1978-2016 is the product of a nearly four-year, Indiana Jones-worthy quest, but with the religious artifacts replaced by an even more elusive, holier grail: proper publishing-rights paperwork. So the fact that this box set exists at all is a minor miracle. What’s even more remarkable is the fact that, while listening to these seven discs attentively in one sitting would require you to book a day off from your job, it rarely feels like work. Even after their fleeting late-’80s moment as a Top 40 threat had passed, and the quality of their albums became more of a crap shoot, the Fall remained an intriguingly unpredictable singles band, one whose cantankerous, chaotic reputation belies their economical songcraft and stylistic malleability. Singles 1978-2016 emulates the segregated format of Beggars Banquet’s popular 1990 compilations 458489 A Sides and 458489 B Sides. The box set’s first three discs (which are also available as a separate package) chronologically chart the journey from debut single “Bingo-Master’s Break Out” to last year’s “Wise Ol’ Man,” with each disc loosely representing a distinct phase in their evolution: the minimalist garage-punk origins, the semi-pop era, and the post-millennial free-for-all. The other four discs plot a parallel, circuitous course through the B-sides. (It’s a testament to Smith’s uncommon industriousness that the tracklist here is dramatically different than the Fall’s other career-spanning, multi-disc box set of note, The Complete Peel Sessions 1978-2004.) Separating the A-sides from B-sides makes a certain amount of sense, providing both an easy entry point into the band’s labyrinthine catalog and a scenic path for more committed listeners to go down. At the same time, with a band like the Fall, the distinction between A-sides and B-sides was often largely arbitrary—a B-side banger like 1981’s “Fantastic Life” could be just as rousing as any lead single from the same era; an A-side rumbler like 1986’s “Living Too Late” could be just as cold and imposing as any oddity tucked on the flipside. From the get-go, the Fall were clearly unlike any other punk band. Sure, the surface sneer of gut-punching early singles like “It’s the New Thing” may have aligned Mark. E. Smith with other Johnny Rotten-come-latelys, but his overstuffed lyric sheets were loaded with contrarian critiques of a punk culture that had become just as conformist and close-minded as the establishment it railed against. The Fall are often classified as post-punk—a movement synonymous with anti-rock experimentation and futurist principles—but in their early years, they were more interested in putting a post-modernist spin on pre-punk sounds. They cultivated mutant strains of country (“Fiery Jack”), 1950s rockabilly (“Lie Dream of a Casino Soul,” which sounds like “Tequila” being subjected to electro-shock therapy), and 1960s garage (“Psycho Mafia,” a showcase for original keyboardist Una Baines’ eerily emotionless, ice-picked organ lines). And even as Smith’s lyrics turned increasingly cryptic, he still trafficked in relatable subjects—football, World War II, over-caffeination—that made him more at home with the factory workers at the local pub than the art-school students at the discotheque. But then, Smith had a peculiar gift for rendering everyday English urbanity as dystopian sci-fi. The clanging “I’m Into C.B.,” for example, begins as a cheeky fetishization of trucker culture, before revealing its narrator as a sad-sack, jobless shut-in who uses his radio for devious prankster purposes—an uncanny prophecy of 21st-century online-trolling. The arrival of guitarist (and Smith’s future wife) Brix in 1983 didn’t so much change the Fall’s sound as embolden it. The haunted-house organ sounds of old were updated to bright synths, the drum-machine tinkering was beefed up into danceable beats, and Smith’s verbal spew was unleashed in more controlled, graceful arcs. And with Brix dropping shout-’em-out pop hooks like cherries on a mud sundae, the band enjoyed a steady six-record run on Beggars Banquet that yielded their most immediate, enduring songs. At the time, they were producing work of such high quality—and at such a high volume—that they could afford to relegate bop-along earworms like “C.R.E.E.P.” and “Oh! Brother” to non-album singles, while punting definitive tracks like “No Bulbs” to stopgap EPs. Up to this point, the Fall’s B-sides form an alternate canon every bit as wonderful and frightening as their headlining tracks, yielding a wealth of alternate-universe indie-rock touchstones (“2nd Dark Age”), hypno-dirge rants (“Repetition”), and eerily prescient premonitions (from the ominous “Auto Tech Pilot”: “I really think this computer thing is getting out of hand!”). Starting in the ’90s, the bloated demands of the CD-single took hold, with remixes, live takes, alternate versions, and even Christmas songs starting to appear. They’re emblematic of an era when the Fall seemed to be settling comfortably into middle age, even after Brix departed (she later rejoined) and the band’s revolving door began to swing more vigorously. It was a decade spent embracing trends (see: the Madchester-grooved “Telephone Thing”); flirting with elegantly sung, string-sweetened middle-brow indie (“Popcorn Double Feature”); mashing up reggae standards (“Why Are People Grudgeful?”); quoting Paul Simon (“15 Ways”); and twisting to golden oldies (“F-‘Oldin’ Money”). The lager-sloshing 1999 single “Touch Sensitive” could even pass for a Fatboy Slim jam, a fact reinforced by its festival-ready remix. But after this period of streamlined aesthetic stability, the Fall barreled into the new millennium oscillating violently between accessibility and inscrutability, as if the Y2K bug had bypassed our computers and lodged itself firmly in Mark E. Smith’s brain. On the one hand, the Fall’s later years have seen Smith re-embrace his raw, garage-punk roots, albeit with a more muscular menace. The 2004 single “Theme From Sparta F.C. #2” adheres to his tradition of soccer-stadium-worthy chants, but comes as vicious as a pack of marauding hooligans. “Reformation! (Uncut)” takes aim at the ex-bandmates who abandoned him mid-tour in 2006, wielding its sinister two-note bass riff like a pulse rifle. On the other hand, as his line-up has steadied over the past decade, Smith has been all-too-eager to disembowel his band’s sound—by 2013’s “The Remainderer” and “Amorator!,” the Fall had effectively become an improvisational ensemble, their songs serving as rusted spittoons for Smith’s increasingly slurred, phlegm-soaked invectives. Strange as it is to say about a seven-disc, eight-hour box set, Singles 1978-2016 is not exactly a comprehensive overview of the Fall’s discography. By its very nature, it must exclude the band’s greatest front-to-back album, 1982’s Hex Enduction Hour, which yielded several certified classics (“Hip Priest,” “The Classical”) but no official singles. Likewise, it can’t include essential album cuts (from early rave-up “Industrial Estate” to 2005 bruiser “What About Us?”) that never made it onto seven-inch. But this is still a staggering monument all the same, an elaborately detailed portrait of a shambolic artist whose astonishing productivity, creative restlessness, and utter disdain for the niceties of civil society know no bounds. This is Mark E. Smith’s lawn, and we’re all invited to get the fuck off of it.","This new seven-disc Fall box set surveys every single and B-side the Mancunian institution has released since 1978. It provides a tidy, linear history of a notoriously unstable band.

Too Dumb for Suicide: Tim Heidecker’s Trump Songs,Tim Heidecker,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0226647d91c73e0284a609/1:1/w_160/Too%20Dumb%20For%20Suicide-%20Tim%20Heidecker's%20Trump%20Songs.jpg,2017-11-22 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tim-heidecker-too-dumb-for-suicide-tim-heideckers-trump-songs/,Jagjaguwar,"In the dizzying, ludicrous, sociopolitical climate America has reduced itself to, what used to feel relevant now seems impotent. Take the overlapping forms of political comedy and protest art. Humor remains useful as a way to avoid insanity, but mocking someone as self-evidently farcical as Donald Trump is sadly futile. At worst, comedy right now can come off as clueless about how bad things really are, like laughter at a funeral. Protest art faces an even bigger quandary: how can artists hope to sway the consciousness of a public paralyzed by endless distractions, algorithmic bubbles, and weaponized lies? It’s fitting, then, that one of the few explicitly anti-Trump albums released since the November election comes not from a truth-telling comic or a hard-hitting musician. Instead, it’s by an anti-comedian known not for satire or commentary but absurdity and layers of irony. As you might expect, some of Tim Heidecker’s bluntly titled Too Dumb for Suicide: Tim Heidecker’s Trump Songs has the what-the-fuck quality of his surreal TV programs “Tim and Eric’s Awesome Show, Great Job!” and “On Cinema at the Cinema.” When he’s in this mode, the ambiguity of his sincerity—how funny is this really supposed to be?—becomes the point, rather than just making you laugh or giving you clear messages to think about. But even though there’s a fair share of goofy meta-comedy on Too Dumb For Suicide—an alt-rock anthem about Trump’s bowel movements and a parody of Jimmy Buffett’s “Margaritaville” called “Mar-A-Lago” being the most obvious examples—the best parts of the album can actually be taken at face value. Heidecker wrote these songs quickly, “with the blood still boiling from whatever indignity or absurdity had popped up on my newsfeed that day,” as he put it. That expediency apparently pushed him to be more direct in places, helping him capture some of the fear and anger in our current miasma. Too Dumb For Suicide opens quite directly, with a statement of intent called “Trump Tower.” Heidecker insists he’ll keep mocking the president no matter the consequences, even ending by openly thanking the First Amendment. Such a forthright approach produces the album’s best moments. On the Randy Newman homage “Cooked Chinese Chicken,” he makes a compelling case for burning the White House down to eradicate Trump’s stain. A fantasy ballad about Trump’s future legal reckoning, “Sentencing Day,” plays like both a celebration and an elegy. Heidecker’s words—“He’ll be gone/And we’ll all get to move on”—sound hopeful, but his mournful piano echoes the dread that justice might never be delivered. Even better is the buoyant “Trump Talkin’ Nukes,” a meditation on how one crazy person can blow up the world that’s also a surprisingly poignant history of generations dealing with nuclear doom, from hiding under school desks to play-acting Red Dawn. In between these thoughtful tunes, Heidecker clowns things up to varying degrees of success. In the bluesy “Richard Spencer,” he relays a decree from God that it’s OK to punch Nazis, while the countryfied “For Chan” is a caricature of internet trolls narrated by a greasy-faced alt-righter who “can’t get away with murder/But I can ruin somebody’s weekend.” (Heidecker writes from experience here, having been targeted himself). Less convincing are tracks that indulge in easy cliches, such as “MAGA,” a heavy-handed satire of the stereotypical Trump voter that sounds like a bad Twitter thread. The weaker spots on Too Dumb for Suicide don’t diminish its high points. It’s perhaps inevitable that a project aimed at a broad yet impenetrable target would be hit or miss. But the hits work in part because they’re coming from someone who is rarely this earnest in his passion. Here and there, Heidecker manages to articulate some of our prevailing confusion and terror in a way that resonates. With the days getting increasingly darker, even a few such moments can feel like the light at the end of a tunnel.","A comedian known for his absurdity and irony, Tim Heidecker returns with an album of protest art as musical comedy. Its shining moments come when he is honest about his fear and anger over Trump’s regime.

The Program,Cam’ron,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0a00c397b3705126b7bc6f/1:1/w_160/Cam'ron_the%20Program.jpg,2017-11-22 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/camron-the-program/,Killa Entertainment,"Cam’ron is supposed to be retired by now. In 2014, he announced that he was calling it quits and that the sequel to his 2004 epic Purple Haze, then scheduled for a 2015 release, would be his last album. He told Miss Info it was “time to move on” and later told The FADER he was “winding down,” segueing into a career in film and television. His heart isn’t in rapping anymore. Maybe it never really was. He always seemed almost hilariously bored by it, no more wowed by the perks of rap pageantry than he was impressed by his own showmanship. But he’s still here, seemingly begrudgingly so: Reuniting with long lost Dipset compatriots for the tryhard throwback “Once Upon a Time,” prepping a sequel no one asked for of 2006’s Killa Season, and sharing his first full-length in four years, a mixtape called The Program. These are the raps of a man with nothing left to prove and nothing left to earn. “Let me tell you rappers something/Look man I don’t need you/I never was a rapper, mane/I’m a get money nigga, I do this for leisure,” he raps on “Hallalujah” [sic]. Uncoincidentally, he’s never seemed less engaged than this. Cam’ron is a man who once rapped “My earring is nice, the price: Three townhomes in Delaware” and bragged about drinking sake on a Suzuki in Osaka Bay after shooting at his rivals. His verses were so blasé, hyper-specific, and subtly comical, with details odd enough to make the bizarre seem believable: random asides like holding a Spanish timeshare for nine years for time away from Times Square while your girl forged checks for him by the Port Authority. In fact, a debate over a colorful Cam’ron bar is what led Ilan Zechory, Tom Lehman, and Mahbod Moghadam to start Rap Genius. But these days Cam’s raps are less wordy, less mind-expanding, and frankly, less fun. In the years since 2009’s Crime Pays, Cam’s last solo studio album, he has slowly become a much less interesting writer, one that’s far less self-aggrandizing. Perhaps adulthood has finally overtaken his surrealist world, and reality has set in, but there isn’t the same artful absurdity to his rapping. Before, he merely seemed apathetic toward the lifestyle he led; now his indifference is aimed squarely at the audience. On “Coleslaw,” he gives Kanye bad PR advice, one ex-Roc rapper to another, before veering into aimless and sometimes senseless machismo. On “Hello,” his cornier punches are a letdown following Don Q, who rips off the tape’s densest schemes: “Had to get my respect, it was past due/Through with my past, I just reminisce when I pass through/Moving them bags, tryin’ to get ‘em flipped ‘til my stash grew/Shooters that blast over the nonsense when the cash blue.” The pen that once drew up the most fantastically farcical story designs in rap has all but dried up. That isn’t to say there isn’t some of that old Cam charm under all the bluster. “Uwasntthere,” originally planned for his proposed retirement album, is an autobiographical and vivid rags-to-riches story, comprised of neatly-stacked raps that fool around with phonetic sounds (“Some was unfortunate, pine box or orphanage/Watching your siblings turning into foster kids”). “Lean,” where a child choir hums Bill Withers’ “Lean on Me” behind him as he raps loyalty and camaraderie, is full of signature Cam quirks. This is the closest he gets to digging deep, enjoying himself, and satiating listeners. But far too many moments on The Program make you wonder why this mixtape was made in the first place: If not for him, then certainly not for us. For fans of Cam’s delightfully goofy interpolation of Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand Miles,” there’s “Dime After Dime,” a rework of Cyndi Lauper’s “Time After Time,” turning the soft rock staple into a drug anthem. The rest of the production is stymied by a lack of imagination. The beats that aren’t flashbacks to older variations of Cam songs are derivative or straight up copies. The AraabMuzik beat for “The Other Side” is a simple rip of a Lex Luger beat, “Kiss Myself” jacks Rick Ross’ “I Love My Bitches,” and “Chop It Up” is a by-the-numbers recreation of Scarface’s “On My Block.” Beat jacking is a cornerstone of mixtape culture, but none of these songs live up to their samples and Cam delivers forgettable performances on all of them. And that’s The Program’s biggest issue in a nutshell: Cam has been many things in the past (daffy, lazy, sometimes even cringe-worthy), but never forgettable. These songs are just hallmarks of a rapper all out of ideas, seeking a reason to stay.","On Cam’ron’s first full-length album in four years, he sounds disengaged. The beats don’t pop and the fun has drained from his lyrics.

Low in High School,Morrissey,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a00dad6cb62e049ecd34289/1:1/w_160/Low%20in%20high%20school.jpg,2017-11-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/morrissey-low-in-high-school/,BMG,"“I make this claim, now let me explain,” Morrissey sings after he first utters the title of “Jacky’s Only Happy When She’s Up on the Stage,” a standout track on his bizarre and ambitious new album Low in High School. Ironically, this is one of his recent statements that needs the least defending. Some zealous fans have suggested the song—which tells the story of a woman devoting herself to the theater after a bout of heartbreak—is an allegory for Britain leaving the E.U. (particularly after a live performance where he chanted “Brexit!” repeatedly at the end). But it plays more like a thinly veiled confession from Morrissey himself. “Jacky cracks when she isn’t on stage,” he admits in its final verse, as the audience flees the room. Morrissey has courted controversy and dared his fans to abandon him throughout his entire career, but Low in High School marks his second consecutive release that feels regrettably tethered to his increasingly alienating public persona. 2014’s muddled, exhausting World Peace Is None of Your Business was a career-low that’s now nearly impossible to hear. Shortly after its release, the album was removed from record distributors and streaming services due to a clash with his label: a move that feels as bluntly symbolic as, well, the conceit of a Morrissey song. If later solo highlights like 2004’s You Are the Quarry felt like catching up with an old friend, Morrissey’s music is now more like scrolling through their Twitter feed and remembering why you stopped hanging out in the first place. Since we first met him fronting the Smiths in the ’80s lamenting how pop music said nothing to him about his life, Morrissey has been adamant about imbuing his records with deeper political ambitions. But Low in High School returns him to his most utilitarian purpose: a spokesperson for youthful melancholy. This theme surfaces both in the album title and its cover art—Morrissey’s first in over two decades not to feature his own visage. The first single, “Spent the Day in Bed,” even plays like the 58-year-old’s spin on Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, a magical day spent shirking one’s obligations, delivered with a prescriptive, winking omniscience. “I’m not my type,” he sings in its funniest line, “But I love my bed.” Fortunately, that song, with its squelchy production and barely-there verses, feels like a pit-stop on the record more than a statement of purpose. For better or worse, Morrissey shows up to work. Like World Peace, Low in High School pairs him and his band with producer Joe Chiccarelli, who delights in exploring new sounds. While that impulse mostly served to gloss up underwritten material on World Peace, the adventurous atmosphere is more welcome this time. A dramatic army of horns elevates the swaggering opener “My Love, I’d Do Anything for You” to resemble superhero theme music, and the woozy keys in “I Wish You Lonely” make its glittery disco more infectious. The pomp and circumstance also inspires Morrissey to stretch his voice into long-abandoned territory, occasionally slipping into a breathy croon or the playful falsetto of his younger years. A few songs are some of Morrissey’s most engaging, exciting work of the 21st century. Other songs get your attention for the wrong reasons. “Give me an order and I’ll blow up your daughter,” he slurs angrily in the anti-troops polemic “I Bury the Living.” In a catalog filled with questionable manifestos disguised as anthems, this is his most unwieldy, tackling war, class, and suicide over seven interminable, mean-spirited minutes. Other epics about police brutality in Venezuela and Morrissey’s own sympathy for the people of Israel (“I can’t answer for what armies do/They are not you”) are more straightforward though they’re far from effective, let alone enjoyable. His lyrics expose the same insensitivity as his abhorrent comments blaming victims of sexual assault. He portrays the people of Venezuela as helpless and God-fearing, while opponents of Israel are merely jealous barbarians. As he ages, Morrissey’s worldview gets smaller and smaller, and his political musings all arrive with a crushing lack of subtlety or nuance. In a recent interview, Morrissey pinpointed Low in High School’s driving concern: “Can young people ever be carefree again?” The album’s most agreeable moments are when he posits romance—as opposed to bitter provocation—as the answer. In the breezy, stomp-clap swing of “All the Young People Must Fall in Love,” he vaguely takes aim at Trump and delivers the titular command as a beacon of hope for his devoted legion of loners. In a song called “When You Open Your Legs,” he sings proudly about getting kicked out of a club at 4 a.m. for public displays of affection, bellowing, “Everything I know deserts me now.” The sentiment is echoed in the stark piano ballad “In Your Lap,” which counters observations of apocalyptic chaos with dreams of oral sex. These are not his most delicate works of fantasy, but at least he’s practicing what he preaches. We all walk home alone, he’s reminded us time and time again, and if nothing else, Morrissey’s faith in love remains devout.","Though the music is often engaging and exciting, Low in High School is Morrissey’s second consecutive release that feels regrettably tethered to his increasingly alienating public persona.

SYRE,Jaden Smith,by: Kevin Lozano,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a13316e6c2e8d614bfdb557/1:1/w_160/syre%20jaden.jpg,2017-11-21 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jaden-smith-syre/,Roc NationMSFTS MUSIC,"Jaden Smith once said he thought it was an honor to be called “crazy.” It was his way of explaining the pseudo-philosophical babble spewing from his Twitter feed—a mix of stoned thoughts and even more stoned thoughts. Of Hollywood’s millennial generation of stars, he is among the funniest and most vexing. He’s a film and television actor, fashion designer, water-bottle company entrepreneur, and rapper whose pantheon of icons includes Kanye West and Silicon Valley tech-billionaire Elon Musk. In his music and his life, he’s a prankster and exhbitionist—showing up to public events in a Batman costume, or offering bits and pieces of his recently-shorn dreads as gifts on a talk show. For as long as Smith has been a public figure, he has played up the thin, almost invisible line between being a hoax and being completely serious—he tries to be as transgressive and misunderstood as a Duchamp or John Waters. Still, Smith earnestly wants his art to be given the credit he thinks it deserves because he really does consider it revolutionary. He calls SYRE, his debut studio album, a “love letter to the world.” The 19-year old says this record is “very honest,” a Rosetta Stone that only people from the future may understand. All of the sophistic ideas, musings, and pretensions that Smith has trafficked in are present, quite loudly, on SYRE. From its opening moment, he’s talking about the biblical story of creation, referencing the myth of Icarus, calling out crooked cops selling “crap,” and drowning his sorrows at the club. The opener, “B,” is part-one of the four-part song “BLUE.” On it, his sister Willow recites a sermon about the creation of man and the powers of Nyquil. Xylophone plinks meet church choruses, exploding electric guitars, and finally colossal bass drums, as Smith barrels into the track showing up haters and trying to get back with his girl. It’s incredible: it sounds like he’s trying too hard while at the same time not trying hard enough A minute later, on “L,” he raps, almost too hilarious to be believed: “Girl I’m Martin Luther, Martin Luther King/Life is hard, I’m Kamasutra-ing.” On “U,” he somehow tops himself, delivering the second most cringe-worthy line of the year: “Man I’m artichokin’/I can’t breathe, that’s the art of chokin’.” The most cringe-worthy line of the year, appearing a few songs later on “Hope,” is actually shocking—Jaden endorses 9/11 trutherism: “Look, Fahrenheit 451/Building seven wasn’t hit and there’s more shit to come/The Pentagon is on a run.” It’s legitimately upsetting and speaks volumes to how careless Smith is on this album. It would be generous to call this kind of songcraft scatterbrained. Smith refuses to stand still, shifting from sound to sound and thought to thought restlessly: Trap, stadium rock, John Mayer-like acoustic guitar licks, and sputtering noise can all appear in the frame of a single song. He cites Frank Ocean’s Blonde and West’s The Life of Pablo as primary influences here, which says more about his misplaced ambition that the actual sonics and content of the album. The beats are mostly helmed by Norwegian rapper Lido as well as members from Jaden’s MSFTsrep collective, which, in Smith’s own words, is “dedicated to supporting and waking up the population of planet earth.” The crisp sound of the production is the album’s one saving grace. It sounds top-shelf, as well it should since this album was three years in the making. While there are some musical highlights—like the 8-bit ambience of the Ricky Eat Acid-produced title-track—the album is constantly in pursuit of a voice it never finds. Which highlight Smith’s writing, some of the worst in rap this year. His lyrics are crass and half-baked and insulting to one’s intelligence. He bungles his way through a world of luxury hotels (“I’m at the SOHO House/If you wanna come through”), conspiracy theories (“The Illuminati’s real, that’s the deal”), and uneducated wokeness  in a way that is so artless, it becomes its own hollow kind of performance art. To spend an hour in Smith’s world is to be subject to a paranoid fantasy that mixes new age thinking with apocalyptic rhetoric. If you’re into this kind of thing, you might be better off drinking a cold pressed juice and watching a marathon of “Ancient Aliens.” It will be better for you than SYRE ever could be.","Full of chaotic beats and cringe-worthy lyrics, the debut studio album from Jaden Smith is a sophistic, paranoid fantasy that mixes new-age thinking with apocalyptic rhetoric.

Bill Brewster Presents Tribal Rites,Bill Brewster,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a009ca2ec4b2c2177a851d2/1:1/w_160/tribal%20rights_bill%20brewster.jpg,2017-11-21 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bill-brewster-bill-brewster-presents-tribal-rites/,Eskimo,"In 1999, Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton published Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, a seismic book that elevated the club DJ from mere nightlife accessory to unsung hero. Two of the music’s most influential DJs, Larry Levan in New York and Ron Hardy in Chicago, had died in 1992, having received little media exposure in their lifetimes. Brewster and Broughton’s work sought to correct that oversight by exalting the DJ and lovingly excavating the underground culture’s rich history. Brewster’s argument on behalf of dance music’s cultural validity has resonated widely. It’s difficult to imagine the current dance-music landscape—with even energy-drink manufacturers and liquor companies dedicated to documenting the culture—without Brewster’s example. As a DJ, Brewster has proven himself a tireless compiler of dance music’s hidden corners, and he spells out his life’s narrative arc as a DJ, writer, and music fiend on Tribal Rites, a fascinating 3xCD (or 4xLP) compilation. Across 41 tracks, Tribal Rites traces Brewster’s biography as a listener, from psychedelic rock to snotty punk to ecstatic house music, finding through lines across a bewildering number of sounds and—like the greatest DJs he’s interviewed—crafting a story with these seemingly disparate songs. In an era lousy with compilations, DJ mixes, and streaming playlists, the compilation not only unearths some elusive, bewildering gems; it offers the chance to hear through the ears of one of dance music’s most discerning listeners. A number of themes arise over the nearly four-hour runtime of Tribal Rites, but the first thing that jumps out is not so much its party-time atmosphere as its apocalyptic undertones, as evidenced by two tracks dating from 1971. There’s the sulfuric crunch of Agape’s “Rejoice,” a Christian rock curio that sets ominous Biblical lines (from Matthew 24:7 and Acts 2:20) into psychedelic rock; General Crook flips a line from the Sermon on the Mount for the stomping sting of “What Time It Is.” Which seems heavy, until you consider that dance music culture as we know it today originated in the pressure cooker of 1970s New York, serving as an antidote to the brutality its participants—primarily African-Americans, Latinos, and gays, lesbians, and trans people—faced in their daily lives. Early parties like David Mancuso’s Loft and Nicky Siano’s the Gallery were safe havens for their audience. In that light, when Brewster gets to Floyd Beck’s slinky groover “Party Is the Solution,” from 1980, it hits less like an escapist trifle and more like the revelatory and all-inclusive conceit that a proper dance party actually is. But Brewster is also enough of a British punk at heart to find a similar revelation in the snarky piss-take of Gaffa’s “Attitude Dancing (Land Of a 1000 Dunces).” The frisson of different genres coupling with one another on the dancefloor gives Tribal Rites its spark. There’s the dubbed-out disco frolic of the Raincoats’ “Animal Rhapsody (Version)” and Ruts DC doing spindly dance grooves; reggae’s massive influence creeps into a cavernous take on Duke Ellington’s “Caravan” as well as the early Afrobeat classic (and Loft staple) “Soul Makossa” (recast as the syrupy “Reggae Makossa”). But Brewster also finds illumination in quieter moments, like the synth-laced country chimes of the Bobbie Gentry rarity “Thunder in the Afternoon.” It says something about Brewster’s counterintuitive tastes that the comp’s most gobsmacking moment is an acoustic take—made with banjo, mandolin, and pedal steel—on Hall and Oates’ “I Can’t Go for That.” The last portion of the set focuses on streamlined house and techno, ranging from the dub-techno masterclass of Maurizio’s “M4” to Swayzak’s microhouse splicing of Larry Heard’s “Night Images” to the flute-laced tech-house remix of Chicken Lips’ “Is That You or Me.” But when the anthemic piano and gospel vocals of Clifton King’s “Family Prayer” come on, the energy is singular. A staple on stations like KISS-FM and WBMX back in the early ‘90s and the epitome of that era’s garage house sound, the song finds ecstatic uplift in lines like “And while we party/We all get closer/Dance to the family prayer.” Clifton King cites Ecclesiastes 1:9: “It is written there’s nothing new under the sun.” He then finds ample reason to keep dancing.","A sort of biography in compilation form, Tribal Rites offers the chance to hear dance-music history through the ears of one of the culture’s most discerning listeners.

FILM,Qasim Naqvi,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a02245e163df364f365c600/1:1/w_160/Qasim%20Naqvi-%20Film.jpg,2017-11-21 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/qasim-naqvi-film/,self-released,"It has been a banner couple of years for synthesizer music of all stripes—both enveloping excursions like Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith’s multidimensional epic The Kid and stripped-down investigations like Alessandro Cortini’s focused, meditative Avanti. Qasim Naqvi’s Chronology, released a year ago, fit into the latter category: Its six exacting studies of tone color and stillness were composed and recorded entirely on a temperamental Moog Model D, an analog synthesizer from the early 1970s. The Model D, also known as the Minimoog, is monophonic, which means it can only play one note at a time. But its sounds are so rich, that constraint isn’t as limiting as you might expect. Instead of availing himself of the kinds of more traditionally musical ideas that are typically facilitated by chords, Naqvi approached his sounds like a sculptor, lavishing attention on his buzzing, glistening waveforms’ texture, heft, and sheen. Those familiar with Naqvi’s work in the jazz trio Dawn of Midi may have been struck by one notable omission on Chronology. He is a formidable drummer capable of both quartz-powered motorik grooves and expressionistic detailing in the deepest corners of the rhythmic grid. But the ambient Chronology featured no rhythms at all, or at least none steadier than the brief explosions of fibrillation generated by microtonal harmonies hovering in close proximity. Naqvi’s new album, FILM, represents a step up in complexity. In addition to upgrading his Moog from a capricious ’70s model with a mind of its own to a more stable contemporary reissue of the instrument, he fleshed out his setup with an ARP Odyssey synthesizer and a modular rig. The result is a palette even richer than before: an array of coppery drones, gravelly bass, and sleek, impenetrable reverb marbled with the ghosts of sounds it has swallowed. The move to a modular system, with its emphasis on cycles and sequences, has allowed him finally to wade into rhythmic waters on a few tracks driven by steady pulses and rippling arpeggios. FILM is also, curiously, a more noticeably musical album than its predecessor: The opening “The Cast” is led by a stately bass progression that helps frame its wild backdrop of quivering sinewaves and sad foghorn bleats; “Sputnik” follows a curious, major-key chord progression along its graceful interstellar path. There’s a touch of melancholy retro sentiment to the latter, but the slippery tunings infuse its otherwise homey harmonies with a distinctly alien air. The music on FILM was originally composed for a pair of soundtracks: The first six tracks were made to accompany Naeem Mohaiemen’s three-channel video installation “Two Meetings and a Funeral”; the final four are taken from the score to Mohaiemen’s film Tripoli Cancelled, the fictional account of a man stranded in an abandoned airport for 10 years. It’s easy to see how this material would work in a visual context. Influenced both by the films’ ruined architectural spaces and by classic, synthesizer-driven film scores of the 1980s, FILM toggles between pure electronic sound design and minimalist composition; it strikes a balance between suggestive scene-setting and subtle drama. It’s possible to detect traces of John Carpenter’s ominous example in brooding miniatures like “The Cast,” while the tumbling arpeggios of “Aligned” recall the playful, liquid pinging of Laurie Spiegel’s “Appalachian Grove.” Mostly, though, the focus is on Naqvi’s expressive and unpredictable approach to shaping sound. In “The Cast,” small eruptions of tremolo gradually expand to fill the frame, a shift in scale that suggests fractal patterns. In “Algiers,” a similar process of dislocation takes place, as a reverberant crackle—the sound of moisture dripping off stalactites in a vast cavern, perhaps—gives way to the faraway drone of small planes circling high overhead, the combined vibrations creating intricate pinwheels of buzz-within-buzz. The record’s clear emotional climax comes with “Wreckage,” a sketch for arpeggio and reverb that sounds like Stars of the Lid heard through a very long train tunnel, or the Field sent plunging to the depths of the ocean. But the delicate “Mannequin” is just as moving: Each breathy, silvery tone in the track’s slow, painstaking progression feels like an existential sigh that has been frozen in midair. Like the protagonist of Tripoli Cancelled, these tracks are in no hurry to reach any particular destination. Naqvi’s carefully rendered tones make a tentative entrance, stretch their limbs, explore the ruined panorama for a short while, and slink away again, leaving little trace. Caught between accident and expression, it is a sound whose ephemerality makes it all the more haunting.","Originally composed for a pair of soundtracks, Qasim Naqvi’s expressive new LP toggles between pure electronic sound design and minimalist composition.

Romaplasm,Baths,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a00972fffdefc2c0f6f1591/1:1/w_160/Baths_Romaplasm.jpg,2017-11-20 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/baths-romaplasm/,Anticon,"When Will Wiesenfeld announced that he had recorded the theme song to a game called “Dream Daddy”—a gay-dad dating simulator where “you play as a Dad and your goal is to meet and romance other hot Dads”—he repaired a curious schism that had lingered between the music he made as Baths and the persona he’d cultivated on platforms like Twitter and Vine. Looking back, the 2013 album Obsidian scans almost shockingly dark. There are songs about suicidal ideation, existential worry, and failed relationships in there, told in desaturated realism over intricate matrices of beats and synths. That darkness chased Wiesenfeld into 2014’s Ocean Death EP, but something in that five-song collection started to open up into a wider space. Instead of singing about sharing a toilet seat with a boyfriend for whom he’d lost all feeling, Wiesenfeld sang about being the entire damn ocean, inviting sailors to come drown themselves in his depths. Sure, it’s heavy, but “Ocean Death” mirrors the fantastical obsessions that populate Wiesenfeld’s imagination as he presents it to his social media followers. There, he delights in anime, cartoons, and video games, delirious in his escapism from the grey and somber world we call “real.” Romaplasm, Baths’ first LP in four years and third overall, dives head first into that same reverie. Of all Wiesenfeld’s music, including his muted side project Geotic, it’s the most rife with pure pleasure. Synthesizers toot like gasps from an ancient hand-cranked pneumatic organ on “Extrasolar.” They chirp and burble among intermittent piano motifs on “Abscond,” and they swarm, sparkle, and itch on “Adam Copies.” Wiesenfeld has always had an ear for delightfully complex systems of sound. Instead of draping his voice over a beat and some accompaniment, he prefers to loop it through impossible Rube Goldberg machines, making even the music he composes with no game in mind sound as though it’s intended to soundtrack a hyperkinetic pixel platformer. The bleeps, the clicks, the compressive modulations of voice—they all belong to those worlds accessed with a vintage controller and a Sega emulator. Lyrically, Wiesenfeld also launches himself into the realm of vibrant fantasy. He sets Romaplasm’s opener “Yeoman” on an airship (an airship!) as the song’s speaker and the object of his affections together traverse the skies. It’s easy enough to hear the lyrics to the ebulliently catchy hook as a metaphor for the high of falling for someone new: “Left my life on the ground/To dance with you in the clouds,” Wiesenfeld sings. Then again, it’s just as easy (and maybe more fun) to take the song literally as a story about a couple voyaging on an airship, soaring above the towns where they lived before they commanded the power of flight. While plenty of the album’s tracks invoke imagery from RPGs (“Abscond” seems to take place inside one of those evergreen, picturesque towns where wise anthropomorphic animals sell you healing potions), Wiesenfeld also indulges some of the self-doubt and self-interrogation that rippled through Obsidian. “What am I gonna do with me?” he wonders on “Out,” seeing his own failures refracted through a prism of his exes’ eye colors. On “Wilt,” he asks, “Who will house my sentiment?” And through the miasmic production of “Human Bog,” he laments himself as “queer in a way that’s failing me/I’m not enough of anything.” Wiesenfeld floats these thoughts, but he never pursues them with as much self-destructive aggression as he did four years ago. He’s gentler with himself here, as though the fantasy spaces he investigates allow him some relief from the person he plays in reality, and he can come back to himself with more patience, more compassion. Baths isn’t the first artist to write music from a place of high fantasy, but he’s arrived here in a way that inverts the paths of a few of his escapist peers. Romaplasm shares some of its vernacular with Sufjan Stevens and Owen Pallett records released before both those artists ultimately whittled down their lyrics to blunt, spare realism. Wiesenfeld, conversely, soared away from the melancholic details of his real life to see what he could absorb from fantasy. Without abandoning the conundrums that made Obsidian so emotionally indelible, he’s embellished the worlds of his songs with color from the dreams in which he’s immersed himself over the years. The setting may not be real, but the sentiment rings true.","On the latest Baths album, Will Wiesenfeld launches his beats and synths into the realm of vibrant fantasy. Of all his releases, it’s the one most rife with pure pleasure.

Bajas Fresh,Bitchin Bajas,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a09f8d902612c645a5e1ee0/1:1/w_160/Bitchin%20Bajas_Baja%20Fresh.jpg,2017-11-20 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bitchin-bajas-bajas-fresh/,Drag City,"Cooper Crain once crystallized the Bitchin Bajas ethos with a simple question: “If you find a good loop that can hold its own musically, then why not use it?” That philosophy has served his group well for going on seven years, and has recently proven just as effective in collaboration. Through work with Bonnie “Prince” Billy, Natural Information Society, Olivia Wyatt, and Haley Fohr’s Jackie Lynn, Bitchin Bajas expanded their sound and prodded their partners to do the same. Credit the trio’s knack for finding good loops and knowing how to use them. In particular, Bitchin Bajas know how to use a good loop for a long time. It’s easy enough to let a cycle grind away forever, hoping that repetition alone will entrance listeners. It’s also tempting to get too proactive and force sonic variety from a loop, as a pre-emptive stab at fending off boredom. Bitchin Bajas excel at finding midpoints between those default poles. They trust their loops to grow naturally but can also shift textures and vary moods to avoid predictability. That’s why Bitchin Bajas’ music sounds best in extended durations. Their last full-length album, 2014’s self-titled two-disc set, stretched eight pieces across 77 minutes. The trio paid pretty obvious homage to their minimalist heroes—Terry Riley in particular—but lived up to that inspiration by carving their own way through familiar-sounding synth cycles and drones. On their follow-up, Bajas Fresh, Bitchin Bajas continue in long-form mode, filling 80 minutes with just seven tracks—including their longest to date, the 23-minute and 3-second “2303.” But this one is less about homage than exploration. Though no track is a radical departure, Bajas Fresh is the group’s most diverse and ambitious record so far. Part of that diversity comes from wider instrumentation. Five guests are credited on Bajas Fresh—including veteran Ghost guitarist Masaki Batoh—and each track has its own distinct tone and atmosphere. Perhaps this expanding sonic horizon is a byproduct of recent collaborations, but Crain, Rob Frye, and Daniel Quinlivan have also widened their field of vision naturally over their discography. The more music they’ve made together, the more comfortable they’ve gotten with introducing new elements into their sturdy approach. The best example might be the one song on Bajas Fresh that the trio didn’t write themselves. Their cover of “Angels and Demons at Play,” the title track from a Sun Ra album, takes the original’s bubbling rhythm and massages it into a meditation, turning Marshall Allen’s soaring flute into a slo-mo flutter. This transformation from jazz swing to minimalist loop is remarkably smooth, and that kind of easy confidence permeates all of Bitchin Bajas. It’s in all the rotations of “Jammu,” the field-recording-like rattling of “Yonaguni,” and the calm horn sounds of “Chokayo.” Even during “2303,” the record’s longest and most drone-heavy track, the band’s assuredness keeps everything in constant motion. For a long record full of long songs, Bajas Fresh has a remarkably distinct flow. The group balances tension and relaxation with the timing of a master storyteller. It’s a talent Bitchin Bajas has shown on previous records, but here they’ve perfected it, instilling direction and purpose into what could easily be aimlessly pleasant music. “It’s not abstract sound at all,” Crain explained when chatting with Haley Fohr in 2015. “I would hope if our music was ever portrayed as a painting of what we heard, it would be a beautiful picture, not an abstract or messy image.” Crain’s hopes are realized on Bajas Fresh, an album worth hanging on your wall and staring at for a long time.","Over seven tracks that span 80 minutes, the expansive, looping, shifting synths and rhythms of Bajas Fresh mark the trio’s most diverse and ambitious record.

S/T,Young Jesus,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a022862ffdefc2c0f6f16a7/1:1/w_160/young-jesus-1.jpg,2017-11-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-jesus-st/,Saddle Creek,"A name like Young Jesus is either deadly earnest or a total piss-take. This record’s literally called S/T, a statement in itself as if to say, “Please do not call it “Young Jesus’ self-titled album.’” Its seven one-word song titles can be read as a strange poem and the last two of them take up over half of S/T’s 47-minute run time. The band is listed as “composers” in the credits. It comes not with a “RIYL” list but a reading syllabus. Their most prominent interview for this album cycle was done by the Los Angeles Review of Books. Young Jesus are not at all ashamed about the lengths they’ve gone to make a big ol’ piece of art, and it might be completely insufferable if S/T didn’t prove them to be acts of generosity that break down the boundary between the artist and listener—Young Jesus’ third album is not a conversation piece, but a dialogue meant to be shared. This is an important distinction between S/T and their sorely, but understandably, overlooked previous work. 2015’s Grow/Decompose was hyperliterate, barfly talk-rock that recalled pickled lifers like the Hold Steady and Protomartyr, but it was also a concept album that explored spiritual and sexuality confusion and fluidity—that’s frontman John Rossiter dressed in drag on the cover. Reflecting the band’s transplantation from Chicago to Los Angeles, there wasn’t any of the jocular referentiality, Midwestern rumination, or classic rock poses that made those other bands such an easy sell to aging critics. The authorial aims of S/T are no less ambitious: “There’s a theory I’ve got cooking/about the way the body moves,” Rossiter intones on “Desert,” but it’s more of  an invitation to converse, not a lecture. Compared to the ripe prose of Grow/Decompose, S/T does a lot less talking with its economic poetry: “You are a room/If you want to settle down,” introduces “River,” a plea for reconciliation that reaches a crushing, predictable conclusion as Rossiter sings with faltering stoicism: “I guess I’ll see you around.” The 10 minutes of “Feeling” become intimidatingly literal, taking extended instrumental stretches to meditate on a single verse about the metaphysical sensation of feeling the feels. These are the rare moments of emotional brinksmanship on S/T, which is more interesting in exploring the life happening in between, perhaps inspired by Mount Eerie, a key passage finds Rossiter looking at crows and trying to divine meaning. Unlike Phil Elverum, he doesn’t just find it, but it’s one that makes him feel joyously overwhelmed by meaning (“I feel a fullness/feel entire moments always change”). At times, this awareness becomes overwhelming in the opposite direction: “Every little landscape breaks my heart,” Rossiter muses on “Desert,” later screaming, “Every little landscape breaks apart” in desperation on “Storm.” Rossiter is always in touch with his surroundings throughout S/T, abetted by a shockingly stark recording; there’s almost nothing associated with production, almost no perceptible overdubs or even reverb, the ambience arid and alien like a desert in the winter night. Or, as Rossiter puts it in “Green,” “A stranger in a strangely intimate embrace.” Freed from conventional post-punk, Young Jesus truly earn the title of “composers,” refashioning the tools of rock music as transportive devices: “Green” flows blissfully towards a coda of harmonic feedback, while “River” is an interstate heartbreak song, surveying scenes of nothing but cracked flatland and twisted metal. In its quiet moments—most of the time—S/T shares the same out-of-time, transportive, aural sandbox appeal of Young Team, Laughing Stock, Spiderland—a working title for “Eddy” could’ve been “Getting Stoned to Slint.” As for side-long closer “Storm,” imagine Broken Social Scene’s ”It’s All Gonna Break” rewritten as a feverish drunkalogue. “Back in ‘95/Mom and dad were screaming/And you were leaning out the back door of your mind,” Rossiter shouts. It’s initially left to interpretation whether he’s an omnipotent narrator, but his role becomes more clear as “Storm” unfolds: “Ten years later at the Holiday Inn breakfast, I started crying...I called and said I’m sick/I inherited something I can’t deny,” to which that friend or brother or substitute father figure replies, “You gotta deal with it.” It traverses 12 years in as many minutes until it finds Rossiter back in the present, standing in his kitchen under the weight of it all. “Is this existing? I’m gonna make it work,” serves as the valedictory sendoff of S/T, but it sounds like they band is just getting started.","Literary, emotional, and filling up all the space between indie and post-rock, the Los Angeles band’s third album is not a conversation piece, but a dialogue meant to be shared.
