Dead Combo,Dead Combo,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9613d197565213b10c/1:1/w_160/089ebc96.jpg,2004-10-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2584-dead-combo/,Output,"Dead Combo's self-titled debut ain't a record for all times, but it's applicable for many and tailor-made for some. Its shrill, treble-heavy, splintering guitars and buzzsaw electronics constitute a rackety Wall of Sound noise that competently squats on land already settled by The Jesus & Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, and Spacemen 3 . But whereas bands such as Spacemen 3 used primarily acoustic instrumentation and often drifted into murkier, jammier territory, Dead Combo's music is stiff, shrill, and loud, with no rhythmic give and little dynamic ambiguity. The propulsive ""Tech Out"" and ""Come On Baby, Yeah"" have a twisted tension that comes from the band's motorik rhythms and use of drum machines and other electronic devices. Atop this unflinchingly precise foundation are fuzzed-out guitars-- brisk, trebly, and volcanically potent. On poppier numbers like ""Sunny"" and ""You Don't Look So Good"", there's even sterility to Dead Combo's attack that makes their brand of sonic brazenness easier to swallow than that of grubbier acts like The Icarus Line or Hot Snakes. Oddly, Dead Combo also features two live tracks: ""Splinters"" and a cover of David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"". It's an unusual move on a freshman outing, but the songs are among this collection's finest, capturing the band's monolithic (and reverb-abetted) stage presence. On ""Let's Dance"", a rounder, clearer vocal performance provides the album its most melodic moment, albeit amid another requisite blizzard of distortion. ""Splinters"" sees the band trying their hand at schlock-rock, and a frenzied audience greets song with approbation. Dead Combo's aesthetic may not be affable-- noisy, trebly, garage-y rock 'n' roll is often cliche-ridden-- but there's still an art to cranking it up to 11. Some bands stock munitions for years without managing to pack a wallop like this; this is a textbook example of how to do it right.","Trevor Jackson's Output label offers the debut record from this Manhattan (by way of Finland) duo that's well-versed in both Jesus & Mary Chain jangle and stiff, propulsive rhythms.

Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi,Camera Obscura,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f6ea9e61561daa54a8/1:1/w_160/67d15fe4.jpg,2004-10-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1749-biggest-bluest-hi-fi/,AndmoresoundAndmoresound,"A few years before Underachievers Please Try Harder whispered its greeting to bookish girls and the boys who write sestinas about them, there was another Camera Obscura record. In those days, the wispy Glaswegian septet numbered merely six, and local boy-with--arab-strap-made-good Stuart Murdoch produced an early single (""Eighties Fan"") and arranged strings for them but wasn't yet shooting their album covers. Upon its release, U.S. listeners could only find this fine indie pop outing while exchanging shy glances in particularly well-stocked imports aisle. Thankfully, Merge has finally dusted off the group's UK breakthrough for American release, and although the record is narrower in scope than its follow-up-- which hopscotches from Leonard Cohen to The Supremes-- it still sparkles. On their charmingly understated first date, Camera Obscura hew more closely to their contemporaries than their 1960s influences. Winsome, acoustic-driven songs such as ""Swimming Pool"" and ""The Sun on His Back"" fit comfortably alongside fellow bedsit pop acts like The Guild League, The Fairways, and of course, Belle & Sebastian. Tracyanne Campbell's stiff-lipped vocals even evoke those of The Softies' Rose Melberg, particularly on ""Let's Go Bowling"" (one of the reissue's two bonus tracks, along with ""Shine Like a New Pin""). Here, Camera Obscura play their teen-romance cards close to their hope chests; the line between earnestness and artfulness is indeed thin. Like B&S;'s best (there I go again!), the sprightly ""I Don't Do Crowds"" could be an anthem for Victorian Lit majors-- or an ironic pleasure for disaffected hipsters just finding ""I'm a Cuckoo"" via its Avalanches remix. But more likely, it's both. Campbell, who shares vocal duties with John Henderson, adds to those delicious double layers on opener ""Happy New Year"", offering this one-of-a-kind couplet: ""Did you know I could be a lot of fun?/ I'm aware that friendship can die young."" Elsewhere, ""Double Feature"" waxes precious about Catherine Deneuve and winter, and ""Houseboat"" takes an outsider's look at the fun lovin' found in Christine McVie-penned Fleetwood Mac. A dispute over Nancy Sinatra provides the chorus to ""Anti-Western"" (""I'm taking your boots off,"" Campbell retorts), and ""Pen and Notebook"" works in a winning Johnny Marr namedrop over halting piano, which is later joined by swirling orchestration that runs the risk of boring any chamber-pop Philistines still in the audience (their loss). ""Eighties Fan""-- the single that brought Camera Obscura to the notice of John Peel-- has a drum opening that could have played over the Lost in Translation credits. Because of its connection to Murdoch, it's the best-known of these early tracks but there are a half-dozen songs on Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi that are just as good. Very few of them, however, capture the band's songwriting strengths-- placing a modern lyrical twist on the 1960s arrangements of Bacharach, Webb, and Hazlewood-- as well as ""Eighties Fan"" does. Come to think of it, very few tracks on Underachievers do either.","With Underachievers Please Try Harder deservedly gaining attention, Merge reissues the debut LP Scottish indie popsters (and Stuart Murdoch proteges) Camera Obscura.

Eucademix,Yuka Honda,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c169c0084474cd0c332c/1:1/w_160/746b011f.gif,2004-10-20 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3996-eucademix/,Tzadik,"It's been nearly 10 years since Cibo Matto dropped Viva! La Woman, but the recordings still prove the genius of two Japanese ex-pats rocking sample racks, Russell Simins, and a reefer truck full of prime cut New York weird. There's no question about it: I still know my chicken. The duo of Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori only released one other LP as Cibo Matto, though they've both stayed visible in Manhattan's downtown scene. Programmer and producer Honda has been particularly active recently, issuing a solo album through Tzadik in 2002 and teaming with Boredoms' Yoshimi P-We for Flower With No Color a year later. Her first solo record, Memories Are My Only Witness, sprinkled fractured make-out music between choppy electronic programming and a little of Honda's former band's uniquely kicky whimsy, while the Yoshimi meet-up-- though a dream collabo for some-- was gentle but somewhat meandering. Honda's second effort for Tzadik's Oracles series, Eucademix, is her strongest solo statement. The romanticism of both Memories Are My Only Witness and Cibo Matto's more introspective material is here-- particularly in the watery keys and daydream pace of the Air-ish ""Some Things Should Be Kept Unsaid"". But that track also has a midsection scored by the hot fuzz of an electric guitar, illustrating Honda's longstanding flair for odd assemblage. She's comfortable setting the distorted bass and screeching, layered solos of ""When the Monkey Kills"" next to ""Limoncello""'s detached hip-hop beats and keening violin sample, and supporting both with the contemplative, nearly new age piano piece ""Seed of Seed of Peach"". Opener ""Humming Song (Alone Together)"" is an opposite facet, weaving wordless female vocals into a pillowy, headache-induced lullaby. Like most Tzadik releases, Eucademix is experimental, but it never turns its back on the listener. It even rewards those who are still lying awake thinking about a Cibo Matto reunion (um...) with ""I Dream About You"", on which Honda's ex-partner Miho Hatori provides vocals. With its clopping, combat-boots-on-subway-steps beat, delicate guitar echoes, gender-specific chorus, and Hatori's whispery sultry vocals, the song would fit nicely on the second half of Viva! La Woman. ""The embrace of darkness makes me feel all right,"" Hatori playfully coos, ""when the beat takes over me..."" It would've been nice to hear a few more songs with Hatori, but the mostly instrumental Eucademix doesn't disappoint. From the plaintive acoustic guitars and shuffling beats of ""Parallel"" through ""Twirling Batons in My Head""'s tense, modified techno, Honda and her fellow instrumentalists (which include Marc Ribot and former Cibo Matto drummer Timo Ellis) never makes us crave more vocal guest shots. And, like most of Honda's work, this album has flashes of humor: ""Why Are You Lying to Your Therapist?"" asks the title of one spacey, wrong-speed guitar solo track, while ""Spooning With Jackknife"" is a perfect name for the closing cut's stuttering percussion triggers and disassembled blasts of feedback. Honda displays an impressive range of experimentation on Eucademix, but it's her talents as a programmer, player, and producer that really sells the album. Honda's music will roam stylistically, but it always hovers playfully above what most other producers are doing.","Formerly one-half of Cibo Matto, Yuka Honda releases her second album for John Zorn's Tzadik imprint, featuring her first collaboration with former bandmate Miho Hatori since 1999's Stereo Type A.

Just Another Diamond Day,Vashti Bunyan,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46b5e6ef95969320885/1:1/w_160/225412aa.jpg,2004-10-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1135-just-another-diamond-day/,PhilipsPhilips,"One of the happiest by-products of the ongoing underground freak-folk explosion is the reemergence of British singer Vashti Bunyan. After spending more than three decades completely off the music industry's grid, the past couple years have seen the angel-voiced Bunyan duet with fan Devendra Banhart on Rejoicing in the Hands, gig with Stephen Malkmus, and collaborate with both Piano Magic and Animal Collective. And now, as if in response to those wondering what all the fuss might be about, the Dicristina Stair label has finally given Bunyan's lone solo album, Just Another Diamond Day, its first U.S. CD release. Produced in 1970 by the legendary Joe Boyd, Just Another Diamond Day has long been considered a holy grail for Brit-folk record collectors, with original copies of the album fetching over $1,000 at auction. It shouldn't take many listens to realize why it's so highly regarded; Just Another Diamond Day is, in its own humble way, nearly a thing of perfection. The album features contributions from such folk luminaries as The Incredible String Band's Robin Williamson, Fairport Convention's David Swarbrick and Simon Nicol, as well as string arrangements by Robert Kirby, who performed the same duties for Nick Drake. Boyd's production is impeccable, with the sound of each breath and string given an appropriate weight in the mix. This is crucial because of the almost impossible fragility of Bunyan's voice, an instrument as lovely and delicate as a dew-covered spider's web but one which could easily be drowned out by over-instrumentation. Considering the deftness of its acoustic, percussion-less songs, Just Another Diamond Day seems at times like a sonic sibling to the Boyd-produced Nick Drake albums-- albeit one that chooses fresh air and sunlight over Drake's depressive shadows. Although Bunyan wrote all of the songs herself, the lyrics have an organic, out-of-time poetry that makes them feel more like traditional works. Her songs reference neither the politics of the time nor the psychedelically refracted medievalism so prevalent in the folk-rock of the era-- the simple quatrains of hypnotic songs like ""Diamond Day"", ""Come Wind Come Rain"", or ""Where I Like to Stand"" instead consist of uncomplicated lyrics (""Just another field to plough/ Just a grain of wheat/ Just a sack of seed to sow/ And the children eat"") that could've been written virtually any time in the past few centuries. Some listeners find Bunyan's thematic emphasis on nature to be overly cloying and childlike-- especially on such bucolic tracks as ""Lilly Pond"" or ""Glow Worms"". But others find themselves captivated by the sincerity and purity of Bunyan's pastoral vision, particularly in the subtle way she's able to portray human activities corresponding perfectly with the rhythms of the natural world, as though the people she encounters are just another feature of the landscape. (""I'm counting the waves/ The men in the boats they wave/ To their wives and say/ I'm counting the hours in the day."") And the whimsical wordplay she weaves through songs like ""Timothy Grub"" or ""Jog Along Bess"" (""Jog along Bess/ Hop along May/ Squeak along Blue/ It's a walk along day"") makes it easy to trace the influence she's exerted on contemporary artists like Banhart or Animal Collective. But even with her reputation re-established and her influence deservedly spreading, it's unlikely that you'll encounter another album as charming or transporting as Just Another Diamond Day any time soon.","Produced by the legendary Joe Boyd (Nick Drake, Nico, Fairport Convention), Vashti Bunyan's lone solo album massively influenced San Francisco's new freak-folk movement, despite being long out of print. Now the Dicristina Stair label finally rescues this 1970 classic from record collector hell.

This Island,Le Tigre,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcba5e6ef95969322ee7/1:1/w_160/1d3e88cc.jpg,2004-10-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4706-this-island/,InterscopeStrummer,"There's a simile in Lucretius' De Rerum Natura where the poet compares his work to the sweet honey doctors would put on the rims of cups to make bitter medicine more palatable. Good political pop music exploits the same loophole, and it's one that Le Tigre have used since their 1999 self-titled debut. Le Tigre was a subtle affair: Its sense of humor, its hummable hooks, and its light genre-hopping never compromised the band's heavy politics-- it just made them more sufferable. As Le Tigre's major-label debut, the album had the potential to push the trio's political agenda into commercial radio country and ultimately turn a few unsuspecting heads. Which is maybe why This Island is so frustrating: The fuzzed-out opener ""On the Verge"", the Beastie Boys-parody-Le Tigre George W. Rant ""Seconds"", the Aqua Teen cartoon-punk of ""Don't Drink Poison"" and ""TKO"", the shockingly humorless ""After Dark"", and the Mr. Scruff lounge-by-numbers incongruity ""Sixteen""-- each is immediately forgettable. ""New Kicks"", Le Tigre's first commercial single, is a much sadder story. In the words of their publicist, the song is ""a dance anthem made up of samples of anti-war speeches by Susan Sarandon, Al Sharpton, and others, punctuated by a 'Peace Up, War Down!' chant""-- and it sounds worse than anyone could have ever imagined. No track could be less indicative of Le Tigre's sound: There's no hook, and not one of the band members even sings here. That Universal has made this Le Tigre's first impression to mainstream listeners is confounding. In contrast, the Ric Ocasek-produced ""Tell You Now"" is one of the band's best songs yet: catchy, poppy, utterly sophisticated (check that slick two-way monologue chorus), and steeped in Le Tigre's grrrlish sentiment. It's unusual territory for the band-- Kathleen Hanna checks her squeals at the door, her cool delivery contrasting with her livid lyrics. Judging from the track, Ocasek could have been the key to This Island's success, and it's a shame not only that they recorded just this one song with him, but that it wasn't even made the single. If This Island failed musically but still got Le Tigre's message out, it could be counted as a minor success. But at this critical juncture in their career, Le Tigre seem tame: They're neither over-the-top nor subtle-- they're merely playing it safe. ""Viz""-- short for ""visibility""-- predicts lesbianism's wider acceptance, but hardly goes farther than, ""They call it way too rowdy, I call it finally free""; the whimsical ""Nanny Nanny Boo Boo"" goes the Avenue D and Fannypack route (""If you ask us how we want it we'll say man-to-man/ When you go to kiss our cheeks we're gonna put out our hands"") but feels out of place on an otherwise overly deadpan release. Towards the end of This Island, Le Tigre attempt a potentially meaningful cover of The Pointer Sisters' top 10 hit ""I'm So Excited"". Like The Pointer Sisters, Le Tigre have the chance here to push the limits of female sexuality in pop, to play with sex and gender stereotypes, to do all the sorts of things good covers can do. Instead, they merely pay homage to the original and then, halfway through the song, adopt a reggae beat for no apparent reason. The cover ends up being merely a squandered opportunity, which sadly sums up This Island as well.","After two albums and a handful of singles' worth of hook-filled electro-punk and progressive politics, Kathleen Hanna's propulsive trio are rewarded with a major-label deal and a chance to take their message to the mainstream.

I Heart Huckabees,Jon Brion,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46ac0084474cd0c04ac/1:1/w_160/5761db0f.jpg,2004-10-19 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1134-i-heart-huckabees/,Milan,"Jon Brion has emerged as the most successful of a new crop of film composers who have strayed from the independent music flock. Brion boasts a pop aesthetic honed by his songwriting with The Grays and Jellyfish, as well as his production work with Aimee Mann and Fiona Apple, and his buoyant soundscapes-- often bubbling with enveloping orchestral strokes and theatrical wall-of-sound presentation-- have, most notably, contributed to the maudlin grandeur of film directors P.T. Anderson and Michel Gondry. A soundtrack is unavoidably linked to the film it accompanies, and * I  Huckabees * -- a sprawling amalgam of shambolic character studies and psychobabble centered on a neurotic environmentalist's relationship with his ""existential detectives""-- is so frantic that most scenes don't lend themselves to further elaboration. This might explain why Brion's * Huckabees * score is more understated and unobtrusive than most of his work; his penchant for underscoring quiet intensity is at odds with the film's series of shouting matches. Brion unexpectedly falls back on his talents as a singer/songwriter, composing five new ""vocal pop rock"" songs that have little relation to the film itself, aside from the obligatory closing credits OST tie-in. Brion's pop songs may have comprised an interesting EP, but they feel arbitrary and scattered alongside the film's score. ""Revolving Door"" and ""Get What It's About"" are indebted to Elliott Smith and Aimee Mann's wry, self-deprecating ballads. The clear highlight is ""Knock Yourself"", a brief but enjoyable jangle-pop excursion accented with Brion's trademark orchestral flourishes. Brion admits that most of this material was amassed from pieces he composed years ago, pieces which seemed to ""click"" when added to corresponding scenes. However, much of the soundtrack's material is weaker than his later work, and several tracks feel like embryonic versions of future compositions. The film's main theme, ""Monday"", derives its power from the same template that forged * Punch-Drunk Love * 's woozy, lilting waltz. The piece is the score's strongest and most memorable instrumental. It gracefully bookends the film and the album despite intermittent missteps on both fronts, but it still feels strangely anonymous in the context of Brion's recent career peaks. For the most part, Brion manages to subdue his typically conspicuous arrangements to temper the film's frenzied momentum. Its bumbling detectives are paired with a breezy Mancini-esque theme that subtly emphasizes the * Pink Panther * slapstick of the detective subplot. Atmospheric pizzicato strings, liberally applied bell chimes, and angelic piano glissandos allow tracks like the ethereal ""Cubes"", molasses-thick ""JB's Blues"", and lounge-y ""True to Yourself"" to elevate the film's subjective hyperrealism without seeming overbearing. Brion has expressed dissatisfaction with most contemporary film soundtracks, and though his own work is a veritable antidote to the calculated emotion-extraction mechanisms of so many Hollywood film scores, * I  Huckabees * marks the first perceivable softening of Brion's characteristic audaciousness. Though he hasn't made any concessions to the trappings of a standard-issue Hollywood soundtrack-- and the one-two punch of * Punch-Drunk Love * and * Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind * set a high mark to follow-- Brion's * Huckabees * compositions are too often diversionary and fall prey to stagnation, making this a frequently inspired but ultimately uneven retread.","Jon Brion has emerged as the most successful of a new crop of film composers who have strayed from the ...

Stéréotypie,DACM,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a872c0084474cd0c0e1d/1:1/w_160/80279b2e.gif,2004-10-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2127-stereotypie/,Asphodel,"Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg's post-techno experiment DACM returns, this time with pixelated siren and Mego veteran Tujiko Noriko onboard. Excerpt from Stéréotypie's press release: ""This ideal, as a conglomeration of homemade fantasies, seems to unveil the limitations and the obsolescence of making a fantasy of physical and mechanical perfection come true, and also uncovers all the excitement attached to this fantasy, by fulfilling obsessions about norms and evenness together with a certain imperfection."" Stéréotypie's concept about fantasies being mistranslated yet still rewarding the artist with an unexpected ""perfection"" is nothing avant-garde. It's the essence of art. Hell, one of the most poignant moments in Britney Spears' legacy was caught on her Live from Las Vegas concert DVD when, midway through the lass' performance, she's dragged away by men in black leaving the spotlight to Jon Voight and Britney's wide-eyed sis in a nightgown by his lap. 'Ol Joe Buck then recites to her a poem about handsome princes, princesses, virginal purity, and the chastity belt. And each syllable he utters is punctuated by a distorted hiss of 200+ decibel amplification. Poetry translated into white noise. DACM thankfully dwells on another planet. The first release from the project's noisenik mastermind, Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg, was 2002's Showroom Dummies-- a dance piece that mainly involved models both clothed and nude in mannequin poses. His music typically domesticates and sculpts cold, raw electricity. Rehberg's solo work on Showroom drenched a few ""mainstream"" conventions of timbre in sulfuric acid. His lawnmower drone treatment of a cliché trance-techno synth melody was priceless. In Stéréotypie, his partnership with post-techno chanteuse Tujiko Noriko adds a deeper dynamic and genuine humanity to the DACM sound. Stéréotypie is a beauty that threatens to evaporate at anytime. Hence, the ""perfect fantasy versus imperfect reality"" concept. DACM stages an order built on rotting stilts, as almost every moment is tinged with scrambled data and irregular pacing. The album's finest song, ""Vidya"", embodies that element-- tweaking and liquidating sunbursts of a warp-speed synth patch to create the sensation of falling up into the sky; an elating grace before disintegrating into the atmosphere. Similar tracks also find a balance between playfulness and delirium. ""LN Start"" erupts with a thick refrigerator-drone lightly showered by microtones. ""Marie"" and ""Outparis Kiss"" also take such microtones and mutate them into happy accidents. The 12-minute ""Birthday"" loops a Boards of Canada-caliber synth trance before vibraphones brilliantly saunter in. Beaming with such pluck for at least its first 10 seconds is ""Latex"", a solo piece for latex that is akin to Tom Zé's classic, balloon-on-tooth experiments. The album's weakest moment is ""Party"", a machine-groove with congested sinuses, looped into oblivion. Besides ""Vidya"", Stéréotypie's other admirably peculiar moments are when Noriko's fingerprints are felt. ""Angel"" is vintage Noriko, a ballad about sacrificing one's soul for love. She whispers with near-vampiric intimacy: ""I'll give you everything/ Even this memory.../ I dream to be what I'll never be."" She drives the track's sexual tension alongside oddball guitar twangs, fractured synths, and an eight-mile-high bass thump. ""Patty"" is also arresting: It features decapitated, Copacabana lounge-jazz that wanders in a circle as Noriko meows Japanese, suddenly uttering ""stereotype"" during a silence. The lyric is a nagging reminder of the album's title, and may imply that DACM's work here is ""stereotypical"" of so much post-techno and its habit of soiling the sweet.","Electronic noise artist Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg collaborates with experimental pop singer Noriko Tujiko on the latest release from his post-techno experiment DACM.

Left of the Dial: Dispatches from the 80s Underground,Various Artists,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d29d034d5c69bf38c0/1:1/w_160/25b3ed30.jpg,2004-10-19 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1970-left-of-the-dial-dispatches-from-the-80s-underground/,Rhino,"Every night when my pregnant wife falls to sleep, I lean over and strap a pair of headphones to her swollen belly and queue up hours of music to pipe gently into the womb where my unborn child gestates. The program changes every night: The Beatles for lessons on love, Led Zeppelin for truth, Merzbow for fortitude. But every Sunday at the time when MTV used to broadcast 120 Minutes, I throw in the kind of music collected on Rhino's Left of the Dial, for just one reason: to turn my child into an insufferable hipster. The music on this set influenced most everything Pitchfork slobbers on today. The mandate of Left of the Dial-- to showcase anything that fit on college radio in the 80s-- means you'll find everything from punk and post-punk to synth-pop and dream-pop; it features early indie rock in all of its shades of amateurish enthusiasm and substance abuse. It covers most of the bands namechecked during the post-punk resurgence-- from Gang of Four to Throbbing Gristle to Joy Division-- and demonstrates how Bad Brains, Minor Threat, and The Minutemen expanded the punk world while The Replacements, R.E.M. and Beat Happening laid the groundwork for indie rock and Sonic Youth, Pixies, and Jane's Addiction did the same for 1990s grunge and alternative. But that's not all: We also get the moody atmospherics of The Church, Echo & The Bunnymen, and The Cure, and the synth-pop stylings of Japan, Depeche Mode, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Left of the Dial even has goth. And industrial. And, um, Faith No More. The set's compilers settled on 82 bands, and their selections are comprehensive and sometimes surprising. You don't get Devo, but they pick a Wall of Voodoo song-- and it's not ""Mexican Radio"". Hüsker Dü is better remembered today for their Bob Mould-penned tracks, but it's Grant Hart's ""Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely"" that's included here. The box is not without dirges or drags-- I forgot that Bauhaus' ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" was so damn long-- but the producers don't skimp on upbeat singles and jangly guitars. If Left of the Dial makes you nostalgic, it's more likely to evoke the weightlessness of youth than to cajole a lump in your throat. But you don't judge a compilation by its hits alone, and it doesn't take long to find the set's weakness: sequencing. Rhino may have the best licensing lawyers in the business, but the tracklist came straight from a committee. Left of the Dial sounds anonymously plotless, and the second disc is littered with awkward segues: Ultravox's ""Vienna"" chokes the momentum from The Pretenders' ""Message of Love"", and the murderous chorus on Sisters of Mercy's ""This Corrosion"" steamrollers poor old XTC. (And who ends a disc with ""Senses Working Overtime"", anyway?) What's worse, slogging through Ministry's ""Stigmata"" after The Smiths' effusive ""This Charming Man"" is like having your early morning sex shattered by a street cleaner roaring past your window. This kind of sequencing also destroys all sense of context. Normally, it's my job as a reviewer to lecture you about the history of The Dead Milkmen, or write a book report on The Jesus & Mary Chain, or at least explain how Bauhaus became Love and Rockets or Joy Division became New Order-- but there are too many stories crammed in here, and anyway, when ""Temptation"" comes on, all I think is, ""Wow, this is a really great song."" The set could also describe the competing narratives of polished synthesizer bands and passion-trumps-practice guitars-- but that makes no sense either, as the two sides often stay as distant as rival cliques at the high school reunion. Without a guiding principal, the dud tracks sound even weaker: You suspect there was only one person in the room arguing viciously to include Lone Justice's ""Ways to Be Wicked"", The Rain Parade's ""I Look Around"", or Faith No More's ""We Care a Lot"", and that everyone else just relented to shut him up. Although Left of the Dial's liner notes work as a cheat sheet, listening to the albums won't tell you anything about how these genres developed, interrelated, or collapsed; simply knowing the facts doesn't tell you why these songs matter. On the other hand, maybe that's the point. It reminds me of buying Rhino's Beg, Scream & Shout box several years ago and enjoying it without knowing anything about the 1960s R&B; singers whose work it collects. It all just seemed to come from some magical past time when great music poured sui generis out of the radio and everybody dug it. As for the struggles, influences, jagged careers, and sad ends that frame the music... maybe someday I'll read the liner notes. My kid might feel the same way about Left of the Dial and ignore my lectures and nostalgia and just enjoy the songs. And fuck it: If the music holds up, that will probably be for the best.","In the spirit of their decade-spanning soul music surveys, Beg, Scream & Shout and Can You Dig It?-- and following the ...

The songs have deep titles like ""Work"", ""Kill"", and ""Pain"". They're about girls, girls, and (possibly) painkillers. They range from ponderous ballads (""Drugs or Me"") to navel-gazing, midtempo tunes (the title track) to rockers that sound like watered-down versions of the band's earlier rockers (""Nothing Wrong"", ""Just Tonight""). I guess you could call ""Night Drive"", with its late-period Folk Implosion beats, an example of a band ""maturing."" But then singer/guitarist Jim Adkins opens his mouth: ""Do you feel bad like I feel bad?"" Lyrically, the rest of the album isn't much better. To a drug-addled lover, Adkins croons, ""Stay with me/ You're the one I need."" To an apathetic lover: ""Your votes can mean something."" To an easy lover: ""Lay back, baby, and we'll do this right."" To no one in particular: ""Baby, this is who I am/ Sorry, but I can't just go turn off how I feel."" If that's not bad enough, he even conjures the least-poetic expression of jealous ever: ""I'm sure your kiss remains employed."" Things haven't always been quite this bad from Jimmy Eat World. The best moments on earlier albums such as Static Prevails and Clarity weren't Shakespeare, but they communicated universes of longing to awkward kids. ""The Middle"" is also an obscenely catchy bit of pop, despite the greater indie community's cred-conscious dismissal of it. But there's none of that here. Futures is like a rotten onion, revealing layer upon layer of foulness. Musically, Jimmy Eat World have gone overboard with the trick they learned from U2: keep something somewhere jingling the same notes over and over again. Adkins' vocals are as whiny as ever, but here they sound canned as well. And then there's the would-be hipster nod to Heatmiser's ""Not Half Right"" on the swooning Smallville balladry of ""Kill"" (""like your favorite Heatmiser song said/ It's just like being alone""). Elliott Smith's only been dead for a year, guys-- a little respect, please. ""I'm in love with the ordinary,"" Adkins acknowledges on ""The World You Love"". That's not necessarily a bad thing; one of the year's finest album's, The Streets' A Grand Don't Come for Free, is kicked off by nothing more earth-shattering than a broken TV. Yet there's a difference between romanticizing the ordinary-- a bad cell phone connection, say, or that feeling on a first date that goes really, really well-- and being, well, ordinary. And it's hard to think of an album more mundane than Futures.","With song titles like ""Work"", ""Kill"", and ""Pain"", Jimmy Eat World may have finally dragged emo down as far as it can go.

Harmony and Abyss,Matthew Shipp,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d89d034d5c69bf2f0a/1:1/w_160/a07d0b08.jpg,2004-10-18 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7120-harmony-and-abyss/,Thirsty Ear,"With Harmony and Abyss, Matthew Shipp continues to improve upon the synthesis of jazz, electronics, and neo-classical composition first shown on his contributions to Thirsty Ear's ongoing Blue Series. Adhering to the methods established on 2002's Nu Bop and last year's Equilibrium, Shipp combines his acoustic piano with William Parker's bass, Gerald Cleaver's live drums, and the varied electronic hi-jinx of Chris Flam. The resulting mix avoids the wilder extremes of both free jazz and abstract electronica, and instead takes a more moderate scoop from the middle of each. This neither-fish-nor-fowl approach has been decried as populist pandering in some quarters-- particularly by those with fond memories of Shipp's more radical, molten work on records like David S. Ware's Cryptology-- but to his credit, Shipp clearly doesn't give a good goddamn what his listeners might expect of him. He resolutely plows forward on Harmony and Abyss, leaving jazz orthodoxy further in his rearview. In fact, only one track here-- the burbling, pointillist ""Invisible Light""-- contains what can easily be identified as improvisation. Otherwise, the album sounds carefully and almost rigidly composed, with Shipp's repetitive, chunky chords meticulously mapping out the shades and melodies of each song in order to ensure that no one gets lost peeking down any side streets. The album contains Shipp's most seamless integration of acoustic instruments and electronics yet, and its peak moments fall well outside simple categorization. ""Virgin Complex"", with its swirl of bowed strings, electronic vapor, and lyrical piano recalls the avant chamber-pop of Rachel's Systems/Layers as much as it does any jazz. Parker's nimble bass drives the quietly propulsive and majestic ""Blood 2 the Brain"", a multi-faceted track that wouldn't sound out of place on a DJ Shadow release. Elsewhere, Flam takes to the foreground, as on ""String Theory"" where Shipp's piano drifts unmoored through a wilderness of mysterious, foreboding whirrs and thuds. Best of all might be ""Amino Acid"" where Flam's electronically generated hoofbeats and thunderclaps effortlessly link onto Cleaver's dexterous percussion to form a woozy, lurching conga line beneath Shipp's inverted Monk-esque pounding. Strange as it may sound, though, the album's fussy, studied flawlessness is its chief flaw. The opening ""Ion"", for example, sounds as though all distinguishing fingerprints have been deliberately wiped away, leaving Shipp at the piano running restrained, depersonalized scale exercises over a stiff, boxy breakbeat. It's the sort of generic, unobtrusive piece that seems intended to not startle the customers down at Starbucks. Such antiseptic moments are rare on Harmony and Abyss, but even so, it's a bit disappointing to see such adventurous players operating within a format where so little seems to have been left to chance. Shipp should now feel completely secure in his ability to unify all these disparate musical elements; maybe next time he'll feel freer to air things out and really tear the roof off.","Latest Blue Series release from this NYC downtown jazz mainstay finds him leaving jazz orthodoxy and improvisation even further in his rearview.

1+1=Ate,Knockout Pills,by: Stephen M.

In the rock 'n' roll classroom, they're the detention-bound misfits in the back row-- ain't concerned with learnin' nothin' but a good time-- and 1+1=Ate, their second full-length, is an album of punk spitballs targeted at the back of your head. They've scrawled ""KISS"" on all of their notebooks, but their primary allegiance is to Cheap Trick. While fellow pop-punk bands like Sum 41, Good Charlotte, and Blink-182 are wearing their newly found maturity like a school uniform, The Knockout Pills wallow in arrested development, despite the fact that their back-cover photo depicts them as late-thirtysomethings. Featuring members of the Weird Lovemakers, Los Federales, and The Resonars, The Knockout Pills hail from Tucson, AZ, home of Calexico and Linda Ronstadt. There's no high-desert harmony or Mariachi influence in their sound, though-- these not-so-juvenile delinquents play a brand of pop/punk that could have emanated from any corner of the country. Rock 'n' roll has many universals-- fast tempos, loud guitars, barking vocals, and attitude-- and The Knockout Pills cram them all into 1+1=Ate. Guitarist Matt Rendon and bassist Travis Spillers trade off yapping vocals throughout the album, and trying to distinguish between them is only slightly less futile than trying to figure out what exactly they're saying. Their indecipherability never becomes a liability; instead, it only reinforces the album's one-take spontaneity and the exuberance of its stay-young mission. A few distinct words even rise from the rumble. On ""Stab Wound Baby"", they sing about a guy who wanted to be a doctor but instead ""now he's comin' home in a box."" ""Summertown Rundown"" laments the Arizonan heat: ""We got three more months of 110 degrees."" The dozen songs on 1+1=Ate all start with a prologue that introduces the main guitar riff, settle into a verse/chorus/verse structure, and are punctuated by a shout-along bridge and short guitar solo-- and all of them are over and done within three minutes. The Knockout Pills spruce up the songs with flourishes like the whoa-oh-oh chorus of ""Stab Wound Baby"" and the barreling piano on ""Not for Nothing"". And in addition to handclaps and a squealing audience, ""Summertown Rundown"" layers a surf-guitar solo over falsetto la-la-la's as it leads into a second searing solo. 1+1=Ate may not be exceedingly original, but that doesn't mean it's not inspired-- or that its not good, solid fun.","Featuring members of The Weird Lovemakers, Los Federales, and The Resonars, Tucson's Knockout Pills play hopped-up, stupidly fun pop/punk.

United States of America,United States of America,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a904c0084474cd0c0f68/1:1/w_160/22c37df3.jpg,2004-10-18 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8385-united-states-of-america/,EdselEdsel,"The United States of America was never immortalized by Pepsi commercials or Time-Life 20-disc retrospectives: The band barely lasted two years, released only one album (which Columbia's marketing department sat on its hands to promote), and ended up a cult favorite that would later be speculated as a phantom influence for the Krautrock sound. But 36 years after its release, USA's self-titled album still stands above the work of most of their Monterey-era, psych-rock peers, and this long-awaited reissue tacks on 10 tracks' worth of audition tapes, B-sides, and alternate takes. The band's deft addition of electronic noise and modulation into what would otherwise be soundtracks for the Beach Boys' California or ham 'n' eggs Anglo-rock was several years ahead of its time. Former UCLA ethnomusicology instructor Joseph Byrd concocted miracles with musique concrete-style tape collages and white noise blurts that veered in and out of the songs like uninvited but still welcome guests. He also tackled a dub-like mixology of tape delays and ring-modulated fade-outs and, best of all, distorted and punch-drunk synthesizers that sound indistinguishable from electric guitars. This was a fresh approach to rock from a unique group of musicians: UCLA students who had studied Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen but, as Byrd's liner notes claim, were ""ignorant"" of rock roots. And, although the band does indulge a few moments of awestruck discovery of their instruments' capabilities, the noise generally works with the music rather than simply being fodder from badge-wearing freaks tying to spook the Organization Man. If USA had an anthem, it was ""The American Metaphysical Circus"". The track opens with a pleasantly disorienting hodgepodge of sampled John Philip Souza marches and Byrd's faithful kiddie-baiting Ringling Bros. calliope melodies before chanteuse Dorothy Moskowitz arrives with her herbal tea-watered croon, carefully enunciating like a three-nights-of-sleep-deprived mother's lullaby. Meanwhile, electric violinist/ring modulator foreman Gordon Marron emits aurora borealis streaks of police siren wails and bassist Rand Forbes keeps the music resting its head on a bar table all night long. Byrd's free-association lyrics throughout the album are generally LSD journal entries (e.g. ""Lemonous petals, dissident play/ Tasting of ergot/ Dancing by night, dying by day""), satirical toasts to the Good Life (""I got a split level house with a wonderful view, sugar""), or phonetics intended for a jigsaw fit into the music (the Latin choral chant that opens ""Where Is Yesterday""). ""Hard Coming Love"" is a conventional rave-up that would've faded into background at an all-night, acid test show were it not for the UFO-like synth that mysteriously flies through the song's intermissions. That said, some of the album's synthesizer works haven't aged well and are stigmatized by the ""B-flick sound effects"" tag that magnifies the wrinkles on so many electro-acoustic pieces from the analog years. The tribal drum whomp that opens the go-go trance number ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" is pockmarked by a laser-gun misfire that might've cued a Playboy bunny in Pocahontas drag to jump through a paper wall and shake it for the camera after Hugh Hefner announced his solidarity with the American Indian Movement on The Mike Douglas Show. The patchouli-sprayed ballads ""Cloud Song"" and ""Love Song for the Dead Che"" both bloom with rich, East Indian-inspired piano and string melodies, and still breathe without any electronic fingerprints. On the other hand, the pots 'n' pans-banging hootenanny ""I Won't Leave My Wooden Wife for You, Sugar"" is relieved by its jump-edit to a New Orleans slapstick jazz coda. The bonus tracks included on this reissue indicate that USA may have aspired to gain prominence in both the mainstream and the avant-garde. ""Osamu""-- with its drone-minimalism rooted in composer La Monte Young's Theater of Eternal Music and sparse, dribbling kabuki rhythms-- is the band's most abstract, non-commercial moment. In stark contrast are the Fillmore East-goes-""American Bandstand"" pop tune ""No Love to Give"" and the AOR-ready, organ-pop of ""Perry Pier"". These songs exhibit one of the reasons why USA broke up so quickly: Byrd wrote that he wanted the band to go ""harder,"" while Moskowitz preferred the ""softer"" route. That yin and yang is uncannily blended in the band's magnum opus, ""The American Way of Love"". The three-part medley first thrashes out dirty psych-blues with Byrd advertising the wonders of being a John for cross-dressing prostitutes. Then the music bleeds into a radio station playing escapist Bacharach-pop or ""California good-time music,"" before brilliantly concluding with a sputtering music machine randomly firing samples of the album's previous melodies and utterances. Sadly, too few heard this music when it was first released.","The invaluable Sundazed label reissues this 1968 psych-pop masterpiece, adding 10 tracks worth of audition tapes, B-sides, and alternate takes.

A Gun to the Head: A Selection from the Ace of Hearts Era,Mission of Burma,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45313d197565213bf20/1:1/w_160/193fe881.jpg,2004-10-18 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5575-a-gun-to-the-head-a-selection-from-the-ace-of-hearts-era/,Ryko,"The tagline from Rykodisc's Mission of Burma retrospective, A Gun to the Head: A Selection from the Ace of Hearts Era, is a bit misleading. It seems to zero in on one facet of a copious output, when in fact the Ace of Hearts era comprises the bulk of Burma's recordings. Except for this year's new reunion album OnOffOn, Rick Harte's tiny Boston-based label released all of Burma's records: the ""Academy Fight Song"" / ""Max Ernst"" single (1980), the Signals, Calls, and Marches EP (1981), the Vs. LP (1982), and the posthumous live album The Horrible Truth About Burma (1985). In those years, Burma didn't just cobble together a Frankenstein's monster of post-punk, free jazz, avant-garde psychedelia, and Krautrock; they spliced these genres together at the cellular level to create brilliantly dynamic punk rock. Burma's songs have held up remarkably well over the decades, and their influence on bands from Sonic Youth to R.E.M. to Interpol cannot be overstated. But a retrospective must be gauged by different standards than original material. The bottom line: Is it necessary? There's no previously unreleased material included here, and the omission of ""Max Ernst""-- a Burma classic that helped initiate the titular Ace of Hearts era-- is befuddling. And since Ryko already remastered and reissued Burma's entire catalog in 1996, all of their records are easy to find. For Burma fans, it's redundant. Gun is therefore either for Burma neophytes who want to get a feel for the band's style and evolution, or for those who'd rather have a Burma sampler platter than shell out for three entrees. Arranged chronologically, its first five tracks are from the meticulously produced Signals EP (the remastered version of which also contained Burma's debut single), among which are their most famous anthems, ""That's When I Reach for My Revolver"" and ""Academy Fight Song"". The next nine songs are from the artier and almost monophonically recorded Vs., which sought to replicate the chaos of their live performances. The final two tracks are from the live document The Horrible Truth About Burma, which memorialized what the band thought would be their final performance. So considering this comp is for newbies, it's still prudent to ask: Who were Mission of Burma? Unlike many of their punk rock peers, Roger Miller and Clint Conley were trained musicians but they also liked to thrash. Both proclivities would inform Burma's music, as would the tension between Miller's brainy guitar compositions (see the serpentine menace of the Miller-penned ""Trem Two"") and Conley's anthemic, poppier instincts (see his classic soft/loud fist-pumper ""That's When I Reach for My Revolver""). After quitting their art-rock band Moving Parts, they linked up with drummer Peter Prescott and visionary tape-looper Martin Swope to form Mission of Burma in 1979. Simply put, they played minimal songs in complicated ways, filling them with both intellectual fodder and physical exhilaration. Burma was a postmodern art-rock band in the truest sense. They were heavily influenced by the tenets of Dadaism, and the liner notes of Signals ripped their enigmatic, lyrical Mobius strips (""the beginning, at the ending"") out of context and arrayed the words in alphabetical order. Swope was a human analog sampler, manipulating improvised tape loops while hidden offstage during Burma's cacophonous live performances: a countervailing voice turning the music against itself. ""I'm not your Academy,"" was Burma's clarion call, which echoed Dada's directive to break the Academy's stranglehold on the arts. But despite these intellectual tics, the songs from Signals are a reminder that Burma was, at heart, a furious, melodic punk band-- best evidenced by the one-note throb of ""Fame and Fortune"" and skittering power chords of ""(This Is Not a) Photograph"". While the hardcore scene got dumber, Burma kept getting smarter. By the time they recorded the more abstruse Vs., its title rang true-- Burma seemed to fly against the accepted hardcore mores of the day. The Vs. tracks collected here retain Burma's hypnotic drive, but weave it through more meditative and difficult structures. The tortured, plodding anthem ""Dead Call"" and the imploding chords of ""Weatherbox"" reveal themselves more slowly than many punk fans accustomed to instant gratification were willing to tolerate. Burma finally succumbed after the Vs. tour, when Miller's tinnitus became dangerously acute. Considering the ringing harmonics and piercing feedback that decorated his stage performances-- displayed here on live versions of ""Peking Spring"" and ""Go Fun Burn Man""-- one wonders whether he was externalizing the noise in his head. Mission of Burma wasn't the only classic post-punk band that doggedly pursued their vision to the point of obsession; in fact, that trait was a staple of the genre. Rather, the difference between Burma and like-minded art-punks like Pere Ubu and The Pop Group was that Burma's particular vision happened to perfectly align with the precarious axis between intellectualism and instinctive songcraft. Instead of trudging ever deeper into their penchant for dissonance, or eventually dropping it in favor of more immediately palatable pop/punk, Burma treaded the divide like a highwire without a net for the duration of their brief career. Their legend is only enhanced by the fact that they disbanded at the peak of their creative powers.","After the release of Ryko's unauthorized (and atrocious) Mission of Burma best-of Accomplished was halted last year, the label convened with the band and Ace of Hearts label owner Rick Harte to create the definitive primer.

The New Danger,Mos Def,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ca69fc7814a47cd721/1:1/w_160/d29daa85.jpg,2004-10-18 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5441-the-new-danger/,Geffen,"I know I'm in denial, but I'm still hoping that the first five minutes of The New Danger were unintentional. Perhaps Mos Def, still lit after a performance of Top Dog/Underdog, wandered into the studio during Living Colour's reunion jamboree, recorded five minutes of talking, and walked out with some sort of leather-induced amnesia. How else to explain the jarring transition between Raphael Saadiq's floating keys on ""The Boogie Man Song"" and Dr. Know's hyper-machismo axe-wielding on ""Freaky Black Greetings""? How to explain an awkward, ill-advised stumble through Durst-style rap-rock? After exactly five years of waiting for the follow-up to 1999's magnificent Black on Both Sides, Mos Def opens by rehashing the final minutes of ""Rock 'n' Roll"" with the less-than-subtle assistance of Black Jack Johnson. Mos, say it ain't so. Curiously, despite Mos' on-the-mark vocalizing about the neglected acknowledgment of the Afro-American influence on rock, he chose the arguably least ""black"" form to express himself. Granted, more African-American creative input in modern rock would be a wonderful thing-- and Mos' attempt is laudable-- but as he says, ""I ain't try to fuck with Limp Bizkit,"" suggesting that rap and rock are two very different beasts whose collusion could be disastrous. Yet both ""Freaky Black Greetings"" and ""Zimzallabim"" borrow heavily from the Chocolate Starfish playbook. Suffice to say, Mos' cry, ""We show you how to really make a moshpit bounce"" is unconvincing at best. ""War"" regurgitates a similar tune, adding a fairly benign critique of its titular subject, depressingly offering the impression that Mos believes a loud message makes an acceptable substitute for a thoughtful one. On the record's rock-tinged tracks, Know's overpowering licks seem to render a stop payment on Mos' creativity. ""Life Is Real"", for example, finds a terminal case of logorrhea infecting an uncharacteristically awful Mos verse: ""My whole life is ill/ My whole life is real/ Mornings, noons, nights/ Birthdays, work days, holidays, funerals."" What's more, Know's material fails to connect thematically or musically to the rest of the album, causing an unfortunate fit of dysrhythmia. It's unfortunate that a phenom like ""Sex, Love & Money""-- with its fat Dick Tracy horns, whimpering jungle flute, and marching band percussion-- is lost in the melee. Here, Mos tantalizes us with a glimpse of his past ebullience as he hums: ""Lay back and relax your mind/ About to double the dosage in the half-time/ Master physical mastermind."" Likewise, ""The Panties"" and ""Modern Marvel"" revel in the sleepy genius of ""Umi Says"" and deliver their respective messages of love and sadness with quiet, erupting impact. These, however, are the lone highlights of this otherwise disappointing release. For an artist whose stage moniker literally translates as ""the highest certainty,"" Mos Def's newest release carries the unfortunate weight of indecisiveness.","Mos Def's long-awaited sophomore full-length was five years in the making, but perhaps unwisely uses too many scraps from the nixed recording sessions of his rap-rock group Black Jack Johnson. And don't even get us started on Jay-Z killer ""The Rape Over"". The what?!

Please Describe Yourself,Dogs Die in Hot Cars,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9513d197565213b107/1:1/w_160/45842f8c.jpg,2004-10-17 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2583-please-describe-yourself/,V2,"The indie rock hype machine should be forgiven for lumping idiotically named Dogs Die in Hot Cars with the new wave revival. The truth is, Craig Macintosh's jittery vocals do work overtime to invoke XTC's Andy Partridge, the pop hooks are sugary enough for Orange Juice, and Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley's production is as florescent as their work for Dexys Midnight Runners or Madness. But even if it comes cloaked in the trendy trappings of 2004's VH1 Classic/1980s obsession, Please Describe Yourself is really an exercise in 90s nostalgia. As star-crazy as Joan Rivers and as lackadaisical as Phil Daniels' ""Parklife"" narration, Dogs Die in Hot Cars' full-length debut has more in common with contemporary Britpop revivalists like Athlete or Ordinary Boys than 80s fetishists like Hot Hot Heat, stellastarr* or The Fever. The telling moment is ""Lounger"", which nearly quotes the aforementioned Blur tune (""I get up when I like"") amid squeaky-clean guitars and Jarvis Cocker-like wit (so what if the melody recalls New Order's ""Temptation""). A snippet of awkward German even harks back to ""Parklife""'s ""Vorsprung durch Technik."" In that light, opener (and second single) ""Godhopping"" sounds less like Men at Work and more like Menswe@r-- its ""all the way to Bombay"" lyric is thematically, if not geographically, reminiscent of Athlete's chipper ""El Salvador"". ""Celebrity Sanctum""-- on which Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, and Lucy Liu all make silly/cute lyrical cameos-- shows the charming naivete of a band stuck in an era before reality TV muddied stardom's waters. That song also includes the decidedly unsurprising revelation that these guys really ""just want someone that will come home."" Presumably, she'll like Craig for Craig, not because he hangs with Leonardo. Standout track ""Paul Newman's Eyes"" continues our US Weekly celebfest. Its chorus (""I wish I had Paul Newman's eyes"") grows less funny with each listen, but recovers on the strength of enormous hooks that should have you listening well after the joke has worn thin. Elsewhere, first single ""I Love You 'Cause I Have To"" bobs and skanks like umpteenth-wave ska. That's right: S-K-A. Sure, they had that in the 80s, too, but if Reel Big Fish were to mount a mainstream comeback, this song would be their ticket to MTV2; cut the buoyant horns from their ""Take on Me"" cover, and you're halfway there. Even ""Come on Eileen"" saw a slight return in the 90s, thanks to (guess who!) Save Ferris. Goddamn right, Dogs Die in Hot Cars are living in the past-- the all-too-recent past. Finally, I hate mentioning the self-important racket of Franz Ferdinand, but you should know that Dogs Die in Hot Cars are sort of the wimpy younger siblings of their fellow Glaswegians-- the asexual catwalk of ""Pastimes & Lifestyles"" could dream of one day growing up to be ""Matinee"". Whoever labeled Franz Ferdinand ""Scotpop"" for their post-Britpop proclivities was probably just talking out of his ass, but it's much better suited to Macintosh & Co. than the abused-beyond-meaning appellative ""new wave.""","Debut album from this Scottish indie pop band most notably evokes XTC, Dexys Midnight Runners and Hot Hot Heat-- but also The Proclaimers.

Late,Duo505,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb94eb335119a49eca83/1:1/w_160/cc0b83e3.jpeg,2004-10-17 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2582-late/,Morr,"Music box melodies for tykes 'n' scamps can be subversive, if not damn sinister. Duo505's ice cream truck melodies are usually repeated ad nauseam until the guys themselves grow bored and attach a magnet to their machines. This recalls a 1988 Village Voice piece by rock criticism's great over-intellectualizer Greil Marcus. In ""Punk Is Where You Find It"", Marcus remembers opening an Absolut Vodka ad's insert in a New Yorker and then hearing a tiny music box that would tinkle ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas""... for 48 hours. He wrote: ""Imagine tens of thousands of undetectable music boxes... all secreted in the crevices of skyscrapers, in the cracks of telephone poles, stuck under bus seats... (behind the presidential seal the next time there's a televised White House news conference)."" He concluded, ""Imagine 'You Are My Sunshine' and 'When a Man Loves a Woman' turning the whole country into one vast theater for the aural itch of a song you can't get out of your head."" While it's doubtful that Vienna's Duo505 (B. Fleischmann and Herbert Weixelbaum) share that plan for global terrorism, they still create infectious and defiantly sentimental synth-pop that could haunt your neurons to kingdom come. Their weapon: the MC-505 Groovebox-- Roland's miracle synthesizer that combines the past models that made so much techno, house, and hip-hop possible, and now makes said genres ridiculously easy to produce. Duo505 employs two Grooveboxes to manufacture 8-bit cuddlecore ditties that could've been ripe for run 'n' jump Nintendo games and ""Heathcliff"" cartoons. And while their formula grows cumbersome over the course of seven songs-- this is the point of music-box subversion after all-- the band's execution still warrants repeated listens. The opener, ""Tsip Tsap"", first teases with bombastic, Mouse on Martian beats until in kicks a melody straight from a wedding video intro. Alas, instead of the anticipated excursion into nasty breakcore, we get artificial sweetener. The flower-for-you-and-now-mate-with-me-too ballad is repeated for five minutes until the end when the song's DAT recording was possibly dropped in a glass of acidic Coca-Cola. There, the keyboards are suddenly de-tuned and choke to death on garbled data. ""Nochwas"" drinks from the same bottle, but thumps a prime StairMaster beat. ""Lsdj08"" has a keen bounce with a tubular, chirp-pop rhythm and melodies made rad by buzzing textures. One could picture this tune getting looped on a skatepark's PA in a move devised by the local city council to promote civility among its delinquents. Many noses could get bloodied, but at least the music is something that even a born-again, Pentecostal mom could like. Less godly is ""Wenig"", with its disintegrating lullabies and Tourette's-addled noises adding a refreshing dynamic. Like that track, there are a few songs that break the monotony and sell this record. ""Toru Okada"" is a shoegazer epic that begins as a humble guitar ballad before enriching itself every few bars with marimbas and an electric guitar synth-patch that nudges the shy song in its ribs to go ahead and propose. ""Disko + Bett"" could also soften a cynic's black heart with its house thump smudged with distorted guitar tones and a talcum-powdered, xylophone melody. On the other hand, ""Facing It""-- Duo505's dour attempt at drama with a Sunday dusk piano melody and a flat, accordion patch-- only punches a post to see a ghost. In short: It's promising, but gradually tragic. Hence, this song ought to be played from every music box tucked into every car stereo, shopping mall, and hospital delivery room. The social unrest would be legend.","Morr Music artists B.

It makes sense that the art of our times should reflect this basic fact, and indeed, it's begun to; from novelists like Philip Roth to aging rock stars like R.E.M., basic questions of American values and power are being addressed. America is polarized-- perhaps moreso than at any other time in the post-Vietnam era-- and so it happens that even artists whose art is devoid of words or open sentiment take pains to politicize what they do, and Asheville, NC's Ahleuchatistas are no exception. For the second time in less than a year, they've released an album of confrontational, heady instrumentals that reflect the conflict and violence of our era, and packaged it in provocative artwork. The ""tistas"" portion of the bandname is a reference to Mexico's indigenous peoples' Zapatista movement, named originally for would-be Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. (He never did affect his desired coup.) The band means this reference as a sort of shoutout to oppressed people around the world and throughout history-- indeed the ""Ahleucha"" portion of their name comes from the title of an improvisational piece by a black American, Charlie Parker-- and the cover of this album puts their thoughts about the current war in Iraq, on display for anyone who cares to look. Painted by Courtney Chappell, it's a powerful, cubistically fractured skyline (presumably the mosque-dotted profile of Baghdad) being bombed by an F-15, as obviously Muslim women contort in agony in the foreground. The primary subject matter of the image actually shouldn't cause much controversy in my view-- is there anyone with a conscience who doesn't sympathize with the poor civilians caught in the middle of all of this?-- but the implication of an essentially American-perpetrated atrocity might not play terribly well to those not on the left. Okay, okay, so the guys in the trio aren't thrilled that we're in Iraq, but what does that have to do with their instrumental music? Well, everything and nothing. Out of context, it's precise, brutal troublefunk-- pointilistic free jazz for the scrapyard set and not for ears that are too attached to consonance. In context, it's bombs over Baghdad, firefights, and blood running in the streets. You don't have to read it solely as a critique of American force, either-- it works just as well as a sonic allegory for the daily atrocities visited upon the Iraqi populace by various factions of the insurgency. Ahleuchatistas may play heavy, challenging music with a lot of baggage, but they keep their approach steadfastly clear: Distortion is absent from both the bass of Derek Poteat and the guitar of Shane Perlowin, and Sean Dail is a brilliantly economical drummer, reminiscent in his best moments of Bill Bruford in his King Crimson prime. Poteat and Perlowin play a game of strike and counterstrike, mimicking war's sick spiral, and the intensity level is ridiculously high for the album's full 28-minute duration. It's a concise and wickedly effective concentration and the sturm und drang that they stretched twice as far on their debut, On the Culture Industry. Ultimately, when listening to The Same and the Other, you can take the Wassily Kandinsky approach-- abstract art is concrete, he famously insisted-- or you can take the more tempting and likely approach and read it as an allegory for contemporary strife and suffering. After all, even much abstract art carries a title and a story (pretense, if you will), and ignoring those things limits the experience to a viewing exercise. On that score, this album is a powerful statement and an explosive piece of music.","Instrumental band's politically charged, brutal troublefunk and pointilistic free jazz is heavy, challenging music with a lot of baggage, but the delivery is explosive and the approach steadfastly clear.

Has Been,William Shatner,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6859d034d5c69bf3560/1:1/w_160/ac38a0f1.jpg,2004-10-17 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7781-has-been/,Shout! Factory,"Unlikely as it may seem, William Shatner might be the ultimate icon for Generation Irony. At a regal and self-deprecating 73 years old, the actor has had plenty of time to marinate in his own persona. Shatner established his ironclad, overblown style as the heroic interplanetary paramour Captain James T. Kirk on the short-lived 1960s TV series ""Star Trek"". His placement in syndication purgatory and the pop culture zeitgeist of the latter half of the 20th century was reinforced by his turn beside the impossibly-hot-for-a-cop Heather Locklear in the equally short-lived ""T.J. Hooker"". His recording career is lesser-known. In 1968, Shatner made The Transformed Man, a surreal, comical work that placed ridiculous readings of pop hits (""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", ""Mr. Tambourine Man"") alongside recitations of selected Shakespeare passages. Despite Shatner's serious intentions, the album was received as pure kitsch, and the cover songs ended up on a 1988 Rhino novelty comp called Golden Throats: The Great Celebrity Sing-Off! A few years ago, Shatner the Singer resurfaced on ""In Love"", an intriguing, well-received cut from Ben Folds' Fear of Pop project. Folds enlisted Shatner based on his childhood fascination with The Transformed Man, and the two began a friendship that has now culminated with Has Been, a collection of 11, um, pieces-- spoken word vignettes, theatrical readings, droll musings-- so out of leftfield that any discussion of the album will necessarily stray from the field of music criticism and into pop culture analysis. While this humble music publication is hardly the platform to debate the merits and impact of irony in modern art, I will say that I'm glad that Shatner decided to make this music now. It's so confusing, enthralling, sincere, profound, and trite that it's nothing short of a mirror to society's own incongruities. Which, really, is quite an achievement. Folds' easygoing way with thematic contradiction-- smug sincerity, for one example; nerd chic for another-- makes him the ideal musical foil for Shatner's full-frontal Shatnerizing (it's a word, google it). Whether you know him from his early work, his hammy Priceline TV spots, or his recent tour de force as legal eagle Denny Crane on ""The Practice"" and its spinoff ""Boston Legal"", you know what I'm talking about. William Shatner's histrionic. Verbal. Cadence is the stuff of. Legend and. Many. A comedy routine. And fortunately, he never deigns himself to sing. But it's the fact that he's in on the joke these days that elevates him to some kind of groundbreaking standard-bearer of self-aware irony and innate honesty. Can those two elements co-exist? Remarkably, they do on Has Been-- even after multiple listens. For an album I approached ready to shrug off as sheer novelty, its humor and candor give it a fair amount of staying power. Turn up the burlesque swing of ""Ideal Woman"" or the title track's goofy spaghetti western rant at a party and watch the room go silent. Shatner's voice is naturally magnetic, lending alternating gravitas and levity; his delivery is that of an accomplished actor, so with only a slight deviation of emphasis he can shift from bombastic to sullen. But bombast is what he does best. His power-pop cover of Pulp's ""Common People"" has Joe Jackson going grandiose with Shatner and a chorus with upwards of 60 vocalists. His duet with Henry Rollins on ""I Can't Get Behind That"" is pure raging comedy set over abstract guitar screams from King Crimson's Adrian Belew, and his riff on mortality on the jazzy ""You'll Have Time"" is plainly hilarious. ""That's Me Trying"" might sum up the work best, with Folds' plaintive piano matched with acoustic guitar as Shatner tells a story of a deadbeat dad trying to make good. The song was written by High Fidelity and About a Boy novelist Nick Hornby, and stays aloof and alluring with convoluted pathos and inadvertent wit. However, when Shatner dips into the saccharine jar, things don't fare as well. ""It Hasn't Happened Yet"" is maudlin and dull, and the tragic story of ""What Have You Done?"" is too depressing to belong on an otherwise lighthearted album. Still, there's a great amount of range here, both musically and lyrically, and Folds and Shatner take it all in stride. Weird, I know, but it works.","Self-deprecating pop culture icon's first full-length since 1968's legendarily silly The Transformed Man features collaborations with Henry Rollins, Ben Folds, Joe Jackson, and King Crimson's Adrian Belew, as well as a notorious cover of Pulp's ""Common People"" and a song written by High Fidelity author and pop music critic Nick Hornby.

From a Basement on the Hill,Elliott Smith,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4735e6ef95969320897/1:1/w_160/e7a86d7b.jpg,2004-10-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7270-from-a-basement-on-the-hill/,Anti-,"Pontificating at length about the colossal sadness of Elliott Smith's discography might seem reductive or stupidly obvious, but ""sad"" still stands as the single most accurate label ever slapped onto any of the late singer/songwriter's records. Smith's melancholy is big, pervasive and suffocating: see strummed chords and meekly mewed verses coated in thick, gloppy layers of heartbreak, lyrics hanging heavy with cold defeat, vocals seeped in doom. Even the simplicity of Smith's songs can be oddly disheartening-- the pretty bits always conceal grim, prickly underbellies, with Smith's melodic lightness tempered by the very worst kind of self-alienation. Pop music has enjoyed a long and tenuous relationship with sadness-as-aesthetic-anchor, and Elliott Smith's role in that lineage was obvious from the start. It was forever preserved the moment that an obviously misplaced Smith stumbled onto the Academy Awards stage sporting an awkward, ill-fitting white suit. Now, nearly a year after his presumed suicide, Elliott Smith has come to occupy a painfully specific spot in our collective pop memory, curled up alongside spiritual brethren Kurt Cobain and Nick Drake-- all somber songwriters who realized their artistic ends in hideously relevant ways, fulfilling every last one of the dismal prophecies they wrote themselves into. And, as with Cobain and Drake, the most devastating part of Elliott Smith's death wasn't the knife slammed deep into his chest, but the bland inevitability of that motion-- how nobody was surprised, how things felt so ""validated,"" how it was disgustingly appropriate, how we were all just waiting for it. Unsurprisingly, From a Basement on the Hill-- Smith's posthumous sixth solo album-- doesn't break form: Released uncomfortably close to the one-year anniversary of his death, the album is riddled with helpless proclamations and self-incriminating taunts, clanging guitars and foggy, jumbled arrangements. Like nearly all of Smith's records, From a Basement covers his despair in sweet, perky, folk-pop kisses; and yet the album is still the saddest thing you'll hear all year. Smith's gloom may be romanticized into gold, but what's ultimately most harrowing about his unhappiness is its nastiness-- and that same gritty, uncompromising accuracy is also what makes his records so impossibly urgent, so uncomfortable and desperate. Reality is splattered all over From a Basement on the Hill-- dissonant guitars that sometimes coalesce and sometimes clash, vocals that flit from beautiful to strained, lyrics that range from clever to pedantic, production choices that hop maniacally from right to wrong. For whatever reason, Smith's happier moments have always felt a little meaner than his darkest. They're somehow more smirking and cruel, as if they'd been put in place as pure provocation. Even the lightest tracks here (see the excellent ""King's Crossing"", or the barely-there ""Memory Lane"") are bogged down by their own sense of inevitability, or maybe by our own-- it's almost impossible not to judge From a Basement on the Hill without first acknowledging the complicated context of its release, cringing at its song titles, and promptly biting back presumptive words like ""foreshadowing."" Supposedly, Smith had finished most of the work on From a Basement before his death last October, and the completed tracks were posthumously compiled by his immediate family and mixed by one-time girlfriend/present-day Jicks member Joanna Bolme and longtime producer Rob Schnapf (""final production"" is credited only to ""Elliott's family and friends""). And perhaps surprisingly, From a Basement on the Hill is perfectly coherent and cohesive, without any sense of being slapped together from half-finished parts. The record even boasts a classic Smith opener, the booming and majestic ""Coast to Coast"", which swells in and out in a haze of guitar ping and found sound murmurs. Collaborating again with former Heatmiser bandmate (and current Quasi member) Sam Coomes, ""Pretty (Ugly Before)"" weds tinkling piano with goofy guitar bits and lyrics that are somehow equally disheartened and optimistic (""Sunshine/ Been keeping me up for days/ There's no nighttime/ It's only a passing phase""). Still, the most disheartening thing about From a Basement on the Hill is its plainness-- it's neither a perfect record (and not one of Smith's best) nor the kind of colossal disaster that could be angrily pinned on money-hungry handlers and desperate fans. It's likely that Elliott Smith will be resurrected and rediscovered countless times over, and that his suicide will become as big a part of his legacy as his discography, feeding the mythology, informing the songs. But while From a Basement on the Hill will certainly have a place in that tradition, its impact will prove a stark contrast to his most affecting work.","Almost exactly one year after his death last October, Elliott Smith's posthumous final album features 15 songs, most of which are said to have been fully completed by Smith himself before being sent to one-time girlfriend Joanna Bolme and longtime producer Rob Schnapf for mixing.

The Delicate Seam,The Bloodthirsty Lovers,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a315b1335d7bf1698642/1:1/w_160/3b0609b5.jpg,2004-10-14 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/811-the-delicate-seam/,Frenchkiss,"Head-Bloodthirsty-Lover-in-Charge David Shouse is probably best known for fronting The Grifters, an erstwhile Memphis indie rock band that seems to be talked about more than listened to. For instance, none of the alleged Grifters fans I know seem to own any of their albums (""I think I used to have that one with the demon-looking guy on the front..."") or even remember what they sounded like. How has such a supposedly beloved band fallen so deeply into the cracks? I have a theory: Shouse writes good music that you enjoy as long as you're listening to it, but which flies out of your head as soon as you stop. People mainly namecheck The Grifters due to a period of prominence on Sub Pop in the mid-to-late 1990s, but his Darla- and V2-released LPs with Those Bastard Souls have long since been relegated to sub-footnote status in the indie rock annals. And his current project, The Bloodthirsty Lovers, is even more of a mirage than his last two groups (I think-- what did they sound like again?). The music hangs before your eyes, swirling like an exhaled breath on a cold day. But as soon as the record ends, the first breeze shatters it into oblivion. The Bloodthirsty Lovers have garnered rave reviews for their spacious, gauzy yet anthemic laptop-pop. Comparisons to Big Star, Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Brian Eno, and The Flaming Lips weigh down their press clips. You'd think a band with such effusive critical éclat and high-profile points of reference would be on everybody's lips, but ask yourself (and this is crucial): Do you know anyone who listens to them? Perhaps Bloodthirsty Lovers are that peculiar band who critics love and fans ignore (hello, Flying Saucer Attack), but I think it's more like this-- you listen to The Delicate Seam, you dig it, and then just forget to listen to it again. I'd lay this pneumonic short-circuit at the feet of Shouse's melodies. They're charming enough, but often meander so capriciously through the big 80s drums, Frenchkiss' standard-issue Les Savy Fav basslines, and coruscating, glitchy ambience that they don't instantly sear their signatures onto neurons like the sonically similar (if more memorable) synthetic popscapes of The Flaming Lips. Indeed, of the comparisons The Bloodthirsty Lovers have drawn, The Flaming Lips one is most accurate. But where the Lips are linear and hummable, the Lovers radiate out in concentric rings and often elude melodic summary. The Delicate Seam-- clocking in at a lean eight tracks-- finds Shouse collaborating with Big Ass Truck's Steve Selvidge and ex-Dambuilders drummer Kevin March. It opens with ""The Mods Go Mad"", a dizzy digi-anthem laden with bombastic guitars, incandescent electronic scribbles, and skewed aphorisms like, ""You're my napalm; I'm your codeine."" ""Stiltwalkers' Local #119"" stretches a straining vocal melody over plodding drums, rigidly buzzing chords, and reverberating electro flourishes. The aberrant ""A Postcard from the Sea"" is truly catchy, recalling the simple, mid-tempo pop of Galaxie 500-- all shiny chords and peppy emoting. The liquid swing of ""El Shocko"" imagines The Beach Boys as the ghost in the machine, delicate harmonies surging through fiber-optic wires. And closer ""Medicated"" features vocals from Young People singer Katie Eastburn; its languid strumming, percolating drones, and Eastburn's understated murmurs waft by like a hazy memory. And so, we finally locate The Bloodthirsty Lovers' particular double bind: The obscure, amorphous quality that makes their music interesting is the same quality that makes it difficult for the mind to hold on to.","Ex-Grifter David Shouse attempts to fleece us with another Frenchkiss-released full-length of spacious laptop pop.

New Pagan Love Song,Paul Brill,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4699d034d5c69bf306f/1:1/w_160/0aceaf6e.jpg,2004-10-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1133-new-pagan-love-song/,Scarlet Shame,"Engaging piano pop balladry is a commodity rendered rare through excess. Considering the morass of feckless singer/songwriters, quality artists are like exotic treasures and their presence has been so marginalized that fans often lack the know-how to separate the grist from the mill. Some artists thrive on winsome personalities, cunningly distracting listeners from the music with their stylistic excess. They stand out like TV antennae in an electric storm, inviting critical rejection and the inevitable backlash of the fickle scenesters who often comprise their fanbase. But if the Ben Kwellers of the genre take the easy route to notoriety in an overpopulated field, where does that leave the Paul Brills? Brill is a harmless bloke-- too good to be dragged down by his loudmouth peers and too modest to do anything about it. New Pagan Love Song is the New York-native's third full-length effort, but to most listeners it will serve as his introduction. Coy artists such as Brill often suffer from the attention-grabbing exploits of their lesser contemporaries. But then, that's their choice. As a member of the San Francisco-based Envelope, he endured the tension of a major-label bidding war, which wore on the band and ultimately led to their dissolution. In the years since, he's helmed a formidable if not yet widely recognized solo career. For New Pagan Love Song, Brill also took the roles of producer and engineer, affording himself increased creative freedom. The result is a demure opus that serves as a testament to the enduring potency of classical pop songwriting. The album is like a montage of matchbook paintings, full of small treasures that by blinking you may risk missing. The album shows a consistent affinity for time-tested techniques, but Brill isn't afraid to capitalize on the expanded palette afforded by modern technology, dipping in electronic affectations that allow his abundant creativity to flourish. The liner notes even boast a ""glitch guru,"" Michael McKnight, who doubtless played a key role in making the stuttered beats. On the virulently-catchy ""Comeback Kid"", a Yankee Hotel Foxtrot-style blend of electro-acoustic kitchen sink percussion pilots a bucolic array of instruments that includes banjo and pedal steel, while the saucy ""Lay Down Your Weary Head"" smacks of Portishead with its shuffling downtempo drumbeat and snappy upright bass groove. Brill's sound owes to a diverse set of forebears, but the composite typically falls somewhere between Elliott Smith and Grandaddy-- influences he flaunts loudly on ""Everything I Believe In"". There, Brill sounds a lot like Grandaddy's Jason Lytle, delivers a wrenching vocal performance that he drapes gently and plaintively over a glitchy piano-based waltz. Hardly overwhelmed by its digital apparel, the song thrives on the sort of classical restraint that lent Smith's songs timelessness. On ""Weekday Bender"" there are strains of Brendan Benson or Fountains of Wayne, while tracks like ""Daylight Scars"" and ""Desert Song"" reveal Brill's fondness for electro-pop architects such as Lali Puna and Juana Molina. New Pagan Love Song also carries a loose story line, tracing a confused, presumably amnesiac character through several episodes. For the most part, Brill's storytelling is simplistic, and it offers enough ambiguity to foster multiple interpretations. But while understated to the point of being almost inconsequential, the lyrical content only impedes Brill's defiantly traditionalist vibe. And as a result, New Pagan Love Song is a quiet accomplishment but an accomplishment nonetheless.","Unlike many singer/songwriters, Brill dials down his personality and lets his music do the talking. And it says, ""I tell a narrative about an amnesiac.""

We Fight Til Death,Windsor for the Derby,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaa19d034d5c69bf3ea9/1:1/w_160/d16e55e3.jpg,2004-10-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8783-we-fight-til-death/,Secretly Canadian,"In her steam-dreamed masterpiece, Song of Solomon, Toni Morrison insists that, ""If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it."" On their first two albums for Trance Syndicate, Windsor for the Derby took this possibility for granted. Covering thick, steel-curtain guitars with enough space in which to flop around, they seemed content to play aural scavenger, assembling the myriad junk-sale parts for you but demanding your own images and vicarious frameworks. So it comes as something of a surprise that on their sixth album, We Fight Til Death, Windsor seem to carry a grudge and make jagged accusations. One can't but imagine that, if pressed, they'd now flick a dandelion spore in Ms. Morrison's bluest eye and hum something about the vacuity of the word ""surrendered."" Well-played post-rock was always the bedrock of Windsor's sound, but they've added angst, a flayed post-punk edge, and new-wave organ loops to their ambition, creating a sound that should be familiar to Yo La Tengo fans, yet remains distinctly this band's own. Beginning on 2002's The Emotional Rescue, Windsor began to use vocals for more than just their innate musical timbres, and some of the foggy mutterings and inaudible wordings began to become genuinely decipherable. A subtle move away from their previous soundscapes, that album showed them reaching beyond academic musings, spawning teeth in the process, and learning how to gum at-- if not to gnash and grind-- the periphery of their sound. Now, on We Fight Til Death, Windsor for the Derby has put those incisors to use. The band hasn't lost the ability to soundtrack your lunch-hour daydreams, but the pacing on this album never subsides into monotonous quiet/loud dynamics, and the surprises all seem to throb with enough tension and release to avoid scattershot inscrutability. Indeed, Windsor seems to be asking: What is a vacation without the hourglass grind of the workday? So once the drifting, lysergic burst of gorgeous opener ""The Melody of a Fallen Tree"" subsides, the sweaty humidity it creates must break. It comes like a dank, determined storm on the ringing guitars on ""Nightingale"", committing the unspeakable bastard mash-up of Doors-derived incandescence with the anthemic rhythms of Talking Heads. Windsor head back to their roots on the moody ""The Door Is Red"". It's post-rock with a noir-punk sensibility-- too gassed with inert pleasures to ever rise to its feet-- and it uses that sangfroid refusal to fill the air with arrangements based on stillness and pensive voids. The song revels in hesitation, and while its guitars seem to want to argue the point, they eventually agree to disagree. After the minor mid-album lull-- the inert ""Logic and Surprise"" and the forcibly manic ""Black Coats"", two songs which seem to regress to paint-by-numbers indie rock-- comes the album's most immediately charming song, ""A Spring Like Sixty"". Atop slow, shuffling drums and flickering acoustic guitar, Windsor creates an arid, itchy ballad that dries the sweat from the record's straining and heaving. Despite all of its unpredictable sidesteps, nothing on the album prepares you for the mechanical Germanic grind of ""For People Unknown"". Bouncing on lockstep rhythms and a hypnotic guitar, the song's determinedly glacial sounds are both soothing and celebratory. Closer ""Flight"" recedes into the distance, sifting itself into smudgy dawns smoked with rotted leaves. The song's stinging feedback is as close to their former material as anything on the album, but it also underscores their growth. You don't need to create your own images with their efforts any longer; this whirlwind work coaxes you into one communal memory after another. Windsor for the Derby is no longer content to merely ride the air--- they're determined to suck it from the room and choke you dim.","Now in their 10th year, and with five largely unspectacular releases behind them, these Florida post-rockers re-sign to Secretly Canadian and find their footing, melding the Motorik kraut influences of their past with Yo La Tengo-esque pop aesthetic.

Does the Cosmic Shepherd Dream of Electric Tapirs?,Acid Mothers Temple,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff3c0084474cd0bfa48/1:1/w_160/5f2c6c08.jpg,2004-10-14 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/24-does-the-cosmic-shepherd-dream-of-electric-tapirs/,Spaceage,"You cannot stop Acid Mothers Temple; you can only hope to contain them. Fans of the relentless Japanese psych cooperative have had a perpetual embarrassment of riches the past several years: By now, the savvier amongst us could've accumulated over 15 official albums released by the group since 2000. (And that's not counting god-knows-how-many CDRs, side projects, and spinoffs.) Theirs is quickly becoming one of the most daunting discographies in contemporary music. Does the Cosmic Shepherd Dream of Electric Tapirs? is yet another addition to their fans' bounty and everyone else's collective confusion. Blissfully unfamiliar with concepts like restraint or moderation (or, one suspects, words like ""rehearsal"" or ""outtake"") AMT's every gesture is so amplified or exaggerated that it's as though they intend their work to be witnessed from across the solar system. In the past, they've proven themselves equally adept at intense, Blue Cheer-inspired thunder-psych as well as delicate hippie folk, and on Tapirs they indulge themselves extensively in each idiom. The group's revolving membership has waxed and waned over the years, but here they're trimmed down to a quintet, with guitarist and ""speed guru"" Makoto Kawabata surprisingly taking more of a supporting role than usual. There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth in smoke-filled rumpus rooms all over the world when the news spread earlier this year that vocalist Cotton Casino was parting ways with AMT. But she is present and very much accounted for on these recordings from 2002-2003, and knowing the way this bunch stockpiles material, I think it's premature to dub this her swan song. Casino lends some Yoko-esque yowling to the quaintly titled thrash of opener ""Daddy's Bare Meat"", which also features blistering electric soloing from Kawabata and AMT's now familiar and somewhat cheesy Battlestar Galactica-like sci-fi sound effects. After that chaotic but less-than-innovative start, AMT promptly switch gears and decide to do some extensive daisy-picking and beard-stroking. Multi-instrumentalist and ""cosmic joker"" Tsuyama Atsushi takes the lead on the acoustic-based ""Suzie Sixteen"", a short ditty that sounds like Os Mutantes singing doo-wop with your neighborhood alleycats (yes, there is actually meowing) and the Incredible String Band-referencing ""The Assassin's Beautiful Daughter"" which features such a gentle weave of guitar and recorder that it's sure to send you traipsing barefoot across the first meadow you can find. But no Acid Mothers Temple release would be complete without a mind-swallowing epic, and the 25-minute ""Dark Star Blues"" fulfills the requirement here. If there are any direct quotations of the Grateful Dead's legendary showpiece ""Dark Star"", I'm not sophisticated enough to detect them. Kawabata and company do, however, ride a simple, repetitive electric riff and Casino's towering vocals well beyond any galaxy Bobby Weir has visited in the past couple of decades. Personally, I'd have appreciated the drums being given more prominence in the mix-- the muddy sound keeps this track from being as devastating as it must've been in the room where it was recorded. The record finishes with the pure, featureless drone of ""The Transmigration of Hopheads"" (I'm unsure if there's an overarching point to the Philip K. Dick allusions of their titles here), a track even more minimalist than AMT's 2002 version of Terry Riley's In C and one that serves as a soothing tonic to the turbulence that's preceded it. It's an oddly fitting end to an album that splashes dead center into the ocean of AMT's burgeoning catalog.","Though longtime member Casino Cotton is said to have left the band, she's present and very much accounted for on this latest release from the renowned Japanese psych-rock/freakout powerhouse.

Bibidi Babidi Boo,Deerhoof,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f413d197565213979b/1:1/w_160/5973ad61.gif,2004-10-14 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2254-bibidi-babidi-boo/,5RC,"You have to hand it to Deerhoof-- after releasing seven full-length albums in as many years, the band has built a substantial enough following to merit a few cash-ins. Fortunately, they seem about as content ripping off their devotees as they are resting on their laurels, and Bibidi Babidi Boo, which could easily have been haphazardly rushed to stores as a stopgap money-maker, is instead being offered as a gratis download on the new Kill Rock Stars/5 Rue Christine free record label, KRS5RC. The band's generosity goes a long way toward justifying its existence. Few bands are as worthy of in-concert canonization as Deerhoof, whose live show is equal parts low-key spectacle and exploratory jam session. Many of these live recordings convey a ferocity rarely found on the band's studio-recorded material. Onstage, lead vocalist Satomi Matsuzaki is commanding rather than coy, drummer Greg Saunier has a crazed intensity yet unfailingly musters the band's challenging time signatures, and guitarist Chris Cohen subtly reshapes complex arrangements in a manner that feels improvisational but sounds precise and calculated. That Bibidi Babidi Boo only sporadically manages to convey this energy isn't solely the fault of the band. The album falls prey to the same oversights that so often lead to lackluster live albums-- a lack of proper sequencing, variable recording fidelity, and several weak performances tucked between stronger moments mar the album in the same way they might an ""official"" release. Perhaps missteps should be expected when cost isn't an issue; still, it's somewhat disappointing that the band's loyal followers have to settle with a compromise rather than be rewarded with the live document they deserve. The album's strongest moments emphasize Deerhoof's talents as a solid rock outfit without sacrificing the band's more experimental leanings. Though free improvisation plays a large role in Deerhoof's songwriting process, Bibidi Babidi Boo's most enjoyable tracks-- such as ""Milking"", which thrives on manic Kinks-like propulsion until its tranquil bridge-- streamline the spontaneous impulses of their studio counterparts. In other places, however, the album is weighed down with filler and half-hearted interpretations. ""Dog on the Sidewalk"" sacrifices the compelling minimalism of the band's original arrangement for uninspired rock embellishment. Instrumental interludes such as ""All Rise"" and ""Rainbow Silhouette of the Milky Man"" are brief but superfluous, while ""Wicca Wind"", ""Satan"", and ""The Forbidden Fruits"" are culled from bland, low-energy performances. Predictably, tracks recorded as BBC Peel Sessions-- including excellent versions of ""Giga Dance"" (which finds the band members switching instruments, notably Satomi filling in on drums) and ""Desaparecere""-- are of higher quality than the more informal radio and concert performances. The interactive visual scheme of the project's website-- an ambiguous ""map"" of the various performances-- emphasizes the album's casual creation; it follows no tracklist, and it doesn't even have a discernible form or structure. These songs seem meant to be experienced and then kept or discarded at will, an informal approach that's both charming and frustrating. Bibidi Babidi Boo is destined to hold an awkward place in Deerhoof's impressive discography, if it's ever widely recognized as a proper release at all. Though it's refreshing to know that Deerhoof have refused to play into the seedier commercial practices that so often characterize makeshift releases, the band's consideration doesn't exactly lift the album's dubious value. The material here simply isn't fit for proper release, and the larger looming Great Download Debate that it might have incited a few years ago is old hat. The crucial role of the internet in proliferating new music is pretty much unquestioned at this point, particularly among Deerhoof's audience. Bibidi Babidi Boo is nice for the converted, but it's not an ideal place to discover the band. It's little more than a cobbled together, expendable gift to their fans-- but at least the price is right.","This free, internet-only live album varies in the quality of its sound and the band's performances-- but did we mention it's free?

On the Offensive EP,Poster Children,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10a9d034d5c69bf2877/1:1/w_160/4b0427b4.jpg,2004-10-13 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6438-on-the-offensive-ep/,Hidden Agenda,"In any other year, a Poster Children covers EP would ring with the veteran combo's trademark electric guitar slash, be filled with hysterical hiccups from frontman Rick Valentin, and get its guidance and cool from bassist Rose Marshack. But this isn't any other year. It's an election year-- one that this band, and many others, seem to feel holds more importance than previous ones. In 2004, between Dean screams and Bush smirks, we've endured a steady stream of musical commentary. From Fat Wreck's Rock Against Bush comps, the stewing polemics of Steve Earle's The Revolution Starts... Now, and the star-ridden lineups of MoveOn's Vote for Change tour, the musical tub-thumping has been widespread and varied. Now Poster Children have thrown their hat into the protest music ring with a tidy explosive device called On the Offensive. And, rather than penning six original anti-Bush screeds, the band offers six covers, ensuring that the EP won't become instantly dated. So, upfront, Offensive scores points for blending the Poster Kids' activist streak with cred factor-- because no matter who wins in November, the band's faithful and raucous cover of The Clash's ""Clampdown"" will remain totally righteous. On the Offensive dusts off a few other diatribes from the previous conservative era, as well. The burbling plastastic synthesizers of Heaven 17's 1981 single ""(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang"" are replaced by a whiny chaos of both keyboards and guitars, and Valentin channeling H17 vocalist Glenn Gregory's dramatic phrasing. X's ""New World"" is also reborn, but with Valentin and Marshack's eerily perfect regeneration of the John Doe/Exene Cervenka harmony dynamic. With the volume down you might think your stereo slipped back to 1983. Wait: economic depression, a paranoid populace, fearmongering leaders. Maybe it did! The Kids also tear into ""Divide and Conquer"" by Hüsker Dü, a band whose name has been dropped in the more overzealous reviews of Green Day's ambitious but ultimately just lengthy and loud American Idiot. The greatest thing about On the Offensive is that it's never as idealistically raucous as something like Idiot: It's a banged-out covers record, not an attempt at a sweeping statement. And it wisely lets pure rock power do the preaching. On ""Divide"", The Poster Children seem more concerned with getting the lead guitar's trebly urgency right than hammering home the statement. As they do on the rest of On the Offensive (including the readings of Fear and XTC that fill out the set), they want their versions to stand up sonically, to be counted long after the 2004 presidential election. The band understands that the EP's embedded message to vote and be heard-- oh, and that Bush really sucks-- doesn't need incessant harping. It's there in the distortion of all these songs, and the throwback sound of the era they represent.","90s indie rock staples wave their placards and political dissent on this covers EP, featuring tracks originally performed by The Clash, X, Heaven 17, H?sker D?, XTC and Fear.

Moment Returns,Triosk,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87513d1975652139665/1:1/w_160/9e1ebe60.jpg,2004-10-13 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8252-moment-returns/,Leaf,"Last year, Australian trio Triosk met German laptop technician Jan Jelinek for an album of nu-skool electro-jazz ambience. It was an interesting record that ultimately showed Jelinek as something of a jazz-dub vintner: Ideally, clouds of cymbal splashes and piano overtones should have at least a decade to mellow inside dusty vinyl grooves before he works his magic on them-- preferably stored improperly in a horizontal stack in a neglected corner of an old record shop. But the real problem may have been that, as listeners unfamiliar with Triosk, we tended to approach their 1+3+1 collaboration as a Jelinek record, which wasn't quite right. Jelinek was but \xBC of a cross-continental quartet and his contributions suffered from high expectations. Now with Moment Returns-- a Triosk album with a couple of actual Jelinek elements and a number of band-created treatments inspired by his methods-- it's possible to hear what Triosk and Jelinek were going for in a new light. The important thing to note about Triosk is that they are truly a post-modern jazz group inspired by recorded documents of performance and driven by ""feel"" rather than tradition. Triosk is best understood as ""jazz"" with quotes, as they use the instrumentation and approach of a classic jazz trio (mostly piano/bass/drums, with some Fender Rhodes and vibes) to explore moods rather than the implications of chord changes. The approach is exceedingly lyrical; pianist Adrian Klumpes has found a path to the ""sparkling water cascading down from some clear waterfall"" sound Miles Davis so admired in Bill Evans' playing, and their electronic treatments add a balanced undercurrent of noise to keep the music from being too sweet. The music on Moment Returns was composed around the same time as the material generated for 1+3+1, and two tracks here feature Jelinek contributions. The nine-minute ""I Am a Beautiful and Unique Snowflake"" could be considered the record's centerpiece, and it encapsulates everything interesting about Triosk. Moving between a spacious Satie-like minimalism, where a halting four-note tune nervously takes shape above meandering bass and drums and a fountain of Jelinek's vinyl crackle, ""I Am a Beautiful and Unique Snowflake"" gushes forth in a loud payoff of heavy block chords and huge splashes of ride cymbal. ""Chrono"" begins with a classic Jelinek loop of slinky acoustic bass with a protective coating of digital noise before Klumpes' descending piano lines pull the tune into the clear melodic light. Triosk is not shy about identifying Jelinek as a major inspiration, so it's no surprise that the electronic flavoring the band adds on its own (all three members are credited with ""loops"") occasionally bears his stamp. The needle fuzz that accompanies the opening theme of ""Re-Ignite"" certainly sounds familiar, giving the noir ballad-- which makes interesting use of what sounds like a synthesized harp-- an extra dose of mystery. ""Awake in the Deep"" opens with two-note bass pattern and an eerie drone of distant feedback, but there's also the minutely detailed sound of a manual turntable that's been left unattended to fill the considerable space. The synthesized drones the band plays along to on ""Love Chariot"" and ""Tomorrowtoday Part 1"" relate more to the older ambient tradition of Eno, but in every case, Triosk's electro-acoustic blend remains coherent and inspired. All told, Moment Returns is a surprisingly effective record that tops their Jelinek collaboration, with the surface prettiness to fill background space, and enough detail and depth to survive close scrutiny.","Following last year's collaboration with German laptop technician Jan Jelinek, this Australian jazz trio set out to prove themselves on their own release.

Slew,Thomas Dimuzio,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb93c0084474cd0c28b7/1:1/w_160/346a4abb.gif,2004-10-13 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2581-slew/,ReR,"Attending a Thomas Dimuzio performance is like lying underneath a web of freeway bridges with your eyes closed, blocking out all visuals except the brief daggers of light that flicker with each passing car. There is a sense of probable dread-- metal, wooden or cigarette debris from the vehicles could fly off and injure you-- but also one of hypnotized calm, thanks to the amplified hum of Michelin and Goodyear against greased concrete. Dimuzio, a San Francisco electro-noise composer, seemingly replicates this experience with massive, body-vibrating drones punctuated by abrupt, skreeing hits of white noise. His improvised performances-- usually performed with guitar feedback and short-wave radio files processed with a laptop and CDJ player-- explore the gray area between tranquility and disarray, and they can draw your imagination into a wilderness it will refuse to leave, even when your nerves are shot by so many conflicting emotions. Slew compiles the veteran's 14 years' worth of compilation tracks, which range between hallucinatory dronescapes and jolted short-wave experiments. The album is a sequel to Dimuzio's fine 2002 compilation, Mono::Poly, which features collaborations with notable noiseniks like Chris Cutler, Atau Tanaka, and Fred Frith-- plus his document of DJ QBert taking musical brown acid. Like any Dimuzio record, Slew is filled with tracks that demand full attention-- even during their quietest moments, instances which tend to gently shimmer to a scalding boil. ""Never Steven"" opens Slew, and sets its mood. A remix of Dr. Nerve's ""44 Nerve Events"", the track is jumpstarted by a psycho-traumatic guitar rummaging through junk metal percussion and cricket-chirp microtones that kick in like a state of numb and blissful physical shock. ""Radiotraces"", Dimuzio's remix of avant-cellist Tom Cora, disrupts that peace with emotionally perplexed string melodies that seem to be stranded in the middle of the sea. The rest of Slew never releases that tension. On ""Usher Substart""-- a suitable tune for a compilation titled Soundtrack for the End of the World-- Dimuzio concocts a ringing and crescendo-rising drone from an electric guitar and a clarinet that resembles a field recording of an industrial neighborhood slowly melting in a thermonuclear firestorm. ""Hinge Map Ridge"" and ""Zero Tolerance"" also nod off to a bell-like drone, but in a more rhythmic and meditative light. ""4 Poles"" brilliantly unleashes fragmented, baby grand piano that skitters between stereo channels while the humidity soaks the walls with a soft, greenhouse din created from nothing more than feedback. ""Untitled"", which uncannily recreates a sweatshop atmosphere out of feedback and metallic noises that mimic a dozen sewing machines' tick-tacking needles jammed with ripped hair and caked dust. And then there's ""Turnkey (Onionhouse)"", which dances in the acid-rainwashed streets with scrambled short-wave vocals and DSP'd beats that drag their bleeding feet. Folks who consider drone music to be monotonous or pharmaceutically bastardized should obviously keep their distance from Slew. But Dimuzio's work doesn't require any postmodern conceptual disclaimer that must be read to understand any of his music-- it is to be felt. Whatever your tastes may be, please consider his musique concrete zinger ""Yard"". Here, he gold-pans away the grime of an air conditioner drone and discovers a looped piece of gibberish from what the liner notes attribute to an Elvis impersonator in a parade. What sounds like Ben Ali go-carts then circle around and mutates into lawn sprinklers. So alien.","A self-described ""compilation of compilation tracks,"" this sequel to 2002's Mono::Poly collects 14 of Dimuzio's hard-to-find drone pieces.

Miss Machine,The Dillinger Escape Plan,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9899d034d5c69bf5247/1:1/w_160/f231f27c.jpg,2004-10-13 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2315-miss-machine/,Relapse,"The Dillinger Escape Plan is about as close to a household name as a mathcore band is likely to get. Their debut full-length, Calculating Infinity, launched them to a level of prestige previously unknown to purveyors of their brand of speed metal, and its impact on the hardcore and rock communities ensured the somewhat astounding longevity of their name recognition. Musical dexterity has always been the band's primary selling point, but the contributions of their original vocalist, Dmitri Minakakis, often seem underappreciated. Minakakis' passionate, incendiary delivery provided tangible pathos to the band's awe-inspiring but detached musicianship. The band diverted attention from Minakakis' 2001 departure with an ingenious sleight of hand: While The Dillinger Escape Plan searched for a new lead vocalist, they filled their temporary vacancy with Mike Patton, whose stellar vocal contributions to their previous release, 2002's Irony Is a Dead Scene EP, suggested a bright if purely hypothetical future for the band. But this consummate metal wet dream was ultimately short-lived: Patton promptly left his special guest spot in the DEP roster, and the band fell back on Greg Puciato, whose promising demos won him a permanent spot as leading vocalist. Common Sense dictated that Puciato's role in the band would be something of a stopgap position; it would seem that a new and relatively unknown vocalist wouldn't exceed the legacies of his predecessors, but also wouldn't significantly hinder the sound the band has honed for so many years. But five years after their last LP, Puciato is still on board. Miss Machine's first few tracks are business as usual for DEP: ""Panasonic Youth"" and ""Sunshine the Werewolf""-- though not as punishing as most of the band's earlier material-- serve as an adequate bridge between their seminal debut and the brooding atmosphere of their work with Patton. Ben Weinman and Brian Benoit's frantically spiraling guitar figures and Chris Pennie's double-bass drum marathons give way to bristling, low-key breakdowns, and the band always manages to retain their brutal hardcore crunch within complex, fluid time signatures. Puciato lacks both Minakakis' immediacy and Patton's oily charm, but he manages to evoke both vocalists on the album's strongest tracks. However, DEP is still struggling to re-establish a unified and compelling sound, and their newfound penchant for melodic exploration seems out of place amid the album's most inspired thrash moments. ""Phone Home"" revels in sluggish, overbearing doom metal and spoils the album's bristling momentum, and ""Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants"" is timid and repetitive, unimaginatively juxtaposing menacingly hushed verses with a phoned-in shrieking chorus. Puciato's Patton-indebted metal crooning comes across as awkward and seems incompatible with the album's aggressive drive. On the perplexing ""Unretrofied"", the band shamelessly apes second-shelf Faith No More, leaning toward melodic pop and away from the band's trademark sound. Though Miss Machine displays DEP in top musical form, the band seems to have lost its confidence and direction. The album is alternately pensive and playful, and this fundamental musical split in their approach-- exemplified by Puciato's decided lack of a distinctive voice-- prevents their new material from reaching anything near the heights of their previous work. A few missteps are to be expected after years of internal change, but Miss Machine's confusing musical tangents and general aimlessness show The Dillinger Escape Plan straining to find their footing in the very scene they helped to define.","After a five-year wait and a series of interim EPs, math-metal freaks The Dillinger Escape Plan finally release their second album-- their first with vocalist Greg Puciato.

Crimes,The Blood Brothers,by: Rob Harvilla,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a313ea9e61561daa4bcd/1:1/w_160/62a8c402.jpg,2004-10-13 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/809-crimes/,V2,"These voices cannot be human. In full mushroom-cloud bloom, Blood Brothers Johnny Whitney and Jordan Blilie scream as if they're drowning, their scalpel-thin shrieks clinging to each other as they flail. The effect is not just vicious and visceral but downright brutal. All you can do is cringe. The catchiest tune on Crimes-- the quintet's fourth full-length and first for V2-- sounds like a Boss Hog track. It's called ""Love Rhymes With Hideous Car Wreck"", and it features a scuzz-punk riff and Whitney bleating, ""Love love love, love love love, love love love, love love love,"" as if he were the prancing flower girl at Björk's wedding. Blilie snarls baritone macho counterpoint like Jon Spencer, except he's full of murderous disdain instead of himself. Eventually, he's overpowered by a 30-second throat-shredding breakdown. Yes, the Brothers still overuse lyrical gore the way the Evil Dead series did Kero syrup, but their sonic pace and intensity has somewhat slowed. This, the band insists, is borne out of necessity. Plowing through three straight five-minute shrieking-fit epics from last year's breakthrough Burn, Piano Island, Burn proved exhausting and near-impossible onstage, so Crimes paces itself with entrails-spilling murder ballads and packs its breakneck hardcore freakouts into two-minute dirty bombs. Thus, you now get both the decaying equine jam ""Beautiful Horses"" (""Ride the crippled horse! Ride the broken mare! Ride the jaundiced buck!""), as well as the fabulous pop/punk-flaying ""Teen Heat"", which coins the excellent phrase ""promageddon."" However, any fears that the songs' slashed runtimes are a pop makeover for their new label are unwarranted: The Brothers remain as violent and creatively unpleasant as ever, with enough clout to thank Brett Gurewitz in the liner notes but enough subversion to misspell his name. In the ""How the Hell Could This Possibly Be a College Radio Hit?"" category, ""Trash Flavored Trash"" isn't quite as joyously horrifying as Piano Island's ""Ambulance vs. Ambulance"", but it still highlights what these Seattle miscreants do best: coat Dali-worthy horror flick imagery (""There's a girl in a cage making love to a switchblade/ There's a man behind bars milking abandoned cars/ There's a priest in shackles building bombs out of bibles"") in candy-coated riffs that roil and mutate and abruptly erupt. Crimes' quieter moments are neither as predictable nor consistent. The title track/mission statement (""We're just like those condom wrappers/ Used up, torn up, thrown away"") showcases Whitney's astonishing vocal range, which veers from tortured James Brown screams to spot-on simulations of new labelmate Jack White's baby-talk tirades and Gossip diva Beth Ditto's white-punks-on-Aretha testifying. On ""Live at the Apocalypse Cabaret"" he's somewhat muzzled, hauling in Blilie's spoken-word sneers for balance but saddling the duet with a decaying Ben Folds piano bar-bounce weighed down by a macabre image ammo dump: masturbating priests, lions eating your children on television, ""Baby heads planted in the ground don't make baby trees."" The tune's moody piano-and-guitar outro is gloriously mauled by ""Beautiful Horses"", and although the record's finale, ""Devastator"", begins with fervent gospel moans, they're eventually torn asunder by an atom bomb-tossing brawl showcasing perhaps the Brothers' ultimate thesis: ""Everybody needs a little devastation."" Just because The Blood Brothers figured out how to prevent exhausting themselves doesn't mean they can't exhaust you.","Blood Brothers Johnny Whitney and Jordan Blilie still scream as if they're drowning, but on its fourth album-- and first for V2-- the band has slowed its sonic pace and intensity and compressed its most breakneck tracks into smaller packages.

"Birds, Beasts & Flowers EP",The Autumn DefenseHem,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c165c0084474cd0c3327/1:1/w_160/f7e7b587.gif,2004-10-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3993-birds-beasts-flowers-ep-split-with-autumn-defense/,Arena Rock,"Hem's 2001 release Rabbit Songs reaffirmed my faith in the amount of time and money I've invested in seeking out independent music-- a quest guided by the implicit promise that the perfect album might just be languishing on some tiny label's roster, heard by only a handful of ears. On a friend's glowing recommendation, I picked up Hem's debut LP and it found itself a permanent place in my listening rotation for the next few years. Not only is it a work of enduring craft but also an accomplishment of accessibility, embraced by an audience spanning a huge range of ages and tastes. Widely overlooked on its release, it grew through word of mouth and a small amount of press until finally being reissued on Dreamworks last year. Unfortunately, Hem's latest full-length, Eveningland, trades in their chamber-folk sound for a decidedly Boston Pops meets Nashville sessions feel-- or, as bandleader Dan Messe has (positively) called it, ""country-politan."" Oh well. Fans of a more stripped-down Hem can take small refuge in Birds, Beasts & Flowers, a split EP with Wilco bassist John Stirratt's project Autumn Defense in which the two bands alternate three tracks apiece. They both showcase sounds that gesture toward earlier American music, meeting halfway between the humbler side of Hem and ornate side of Autumn Defense. The album begins with a Radio Denmark version of Rabbit Songs highlight ""Half Acre"". Its pace is slowed, with piano and banjo intertwining around each other and the added orchestral accents of strings, timpani, and cymbal. Autumn Defense's ""Bluebirds Fall"" follows, a melodic, Zombies-like track accented with a distorted organ. That same 1960s pop tinge is also showcased on their ""You Know Where I Live"", which features a harpsichord and sunny harmonies. Hem offers an arrangement of one of Eveningland's better selections, the wistful lounge-country ballad ""Pacific Street"". The album closes with a piano and vibraphone-driven instrumental track from Autumn Defense, ""Mayday"", a piece that's well-arranged but lacks a strong melody. Birds, Beasts, & Flowers isn't a remarkable release. Both of these acts have a lot of potential (partly realized in Hem's first album) and are a step or two away from beautifully synthesizing a vast array of American music genres that are often hijacked by mediocre artists. But both are headed in directions that suggest they're taken with the silly Rolling Stone and Uncut quotes plastered on this EP's cover sticker-- Hem are ""sophisticated and sexy"" and Autumn Defense are ""comfort music for the soul."" So perhaps I'm the one not getting it-- maybe what I see as promise, these bands view as an edge that needs muting. I hope not. At their best, they prove themselves capable of a fresh and moving take on well-trod territory.","The country-politan Hem and Wilco bassist John Sirratt's Autumn Defense each provide three Americana-laced tracks to this split EP.

Shredders Dub,Calamalka,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71e9d034d5c69bf36f7/1:1/w_160/329b8a94.jpg,2004-10-12 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1783-shredders-dub/,Plug Research,"The Stooges are feted for ""industrializing"" rock and roll, their assembly-lined rhythms imitating Detroit factories that clanged together modern America's crux of survival. Later, Kraftwerk's ""machine-music"" romanticized the autobahn as a symphony where the daydreamers forget destinations and accident risks. Somehow dub reggae is lost in this discussion. Machines made classic dub possible. King Tubby and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry employed tape speeds, echoplexes, and delay boxes to mutate traditional reggae into after-hours hallucinations. The dub rhythm's traditional Caribbean element of hitting right on the four and nearly missing the beat, arguably resembles a machine worn by years of dried grease and friction. Michael Campitelli (Calamalka) mostly captures dub's factory life in Shredders Dub. The Vancouverian's debut album has a rich atmosphere that inhabits a rehearsal space tucked underneath a junk-shop's trapdoor. Blistered hands master the music's craftsmanship. The raw beats are usually thwacked on a live trapkit like a sledgehammer-- quite a relief from the bald-shaven drum machines heard in so much digital-dub. The live basslines maintain a steady groove without either deafening the room or falling flat. Campitelli also avoids cluttering his lysergic excursions with the debris of aimless guitar strums and B-flick inspired ""cosmic"" noises that infest like flu germs. However, he's still faithful to dub's common dreariness and stubborn hope for salvation. Half of Shredders' tunes are meant to shout through a car's disintegrating subwoofers in the dead of night. ""Hear the Most"" sets this mood by throwing the listener out into the moonless streets that, no matter the loneliness, are never empty. A distant funeral bell marks the time, as the ring-modulated voices whisper in one's ear, and the bass and snares stomp their feet like a stalker picking up the pace behind you. In keeping with Shredders' other bludgeoning raveups, those same footsteps could be mistaken for factories. ""Chassi"" connects dub to thrash and funk with distorted bass, a cement-shoed hip-hop rhythm, and a Rhodes that honks through a gridlock. The equally sinister ""Bumpea"" broods on the E-string with switchbladed rimshots and an orbiting satellite that recovers a lost broadcast of a keyboard played at a 1970 Miles Davis Fillmore gig. If Campitelli woke up a bit during the stiff drum solo that ends the song, he'd be a richer man. But machines can't change their minds. The rest of Shredders steps away from the industrial dogpatches and floats in a narcotic haze, sometimes finding beauty and sometimes waiting too long to exhale. The best is ""Lighting Rigg"", whose jazz-guitar riffs bloom like sunshine through the gray Atlantic. ""Electric Blue"" also picks up that vibe and drizzles microtones upon the sea. Too bad Campitelli is too complacent to swim up to the surface, as he deadpans under deep medication, ""I am what it is be reliable,"" in the otherwise engrossing ""Reliable I"". The album's weakest moment, ""Gamblor"", is a rather dour and cumbersome space-out that doesn't pick up until minute seven-- though extra brownie points go to the song title's Simpsons reference, a brief instance of comic relief that lightens Shredders Dub's carefully crafted claustrophobia.","Vancouver's Calamalka highlights dub's industrial essence on his debut for the Los Angeles electronic label Plug Research.

Desperate Straights,Henry CowSlapp Happy,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a684b1335d7bf1698e49/1:1/w_160/06a93320.gif,2004-10-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7780-desperate-straights-with-henry-cow/,VirginVirgin,"How do you feel about clarinets? I like them okay. I don't like it when they squeak, and I'm not the world's #1 Dixieland fan, but sometimes clarinets sound cool. Of course, they don't get much play in rock circles, mostly because you can't hear them over the guitars. Sometimes they pop up in chamber-pop or twee Beatles songs. Clarinets, like their woodwind cousins flute and bassoon, thrive in delicate environments, and in the right hands, lend a tenderness that's out of range of other instruments. I think they get a bad rap because, well, they're not exactly the toughest of instruments, and the little boys who would grow into rock stars aren't lining up to play them in the high school band. Slapp Happy liked clarinets-- and pianos, too, and cabaret. The English and German trio formed in 1972 in response to minimalist composer Anthony Moore's desire to start a pop band. He'd already issued a couple of experimental albums by then, and met singer Dagmar Krause while in Hamburg, Germany. Krause, who'd begun singing in nightclubs at 14, had a strong background in traditional German music, cabaret and the art-song of composers like Kurt Weill. Her voice, an instantly recognizable alto that often polarizes listeners, didn't seem obviously suited to pop music, but her range of expression (from silly coo with wide vibrato to witchy shriek) was perfect for Moore's eclectic pieces. The third member was Peter Blegvad, erstwhile associate of Germany's Faust and future creator of the cult British comic Leviathan. Blegvad didn't come from a classical background as Moore had, but was rather a skewed pop songwriter who would later find apt partners in Anton Fier and XTC's Andy Partridge. Desperate Straights, a collaboration with British avant-prog band Henry Cow, was Slapp Happy's third official LP. The band's first record, Sort Of, had been completed with assistance from Faust, while their second, self-titled album (later released as Casablanca Moon), was originally recorded for Polydor but then scrapped and re-recorded when the band signed to Virgin. Those first two Slapp Happy records were soft pop for eccentrics, informed by British Invasion rock, Dylan, and hints of European cafe music. Desperate Straights was a slightly different story. Though ""pop"" in a basic sense, its songs were more closely related to Weill and classical art-song than contemporary pop. But don't get the wrong idea: Although Henry Cow members Chris Cutler, Fred Frith, John Greaves, and Tim Hodgkinson contribute greatly to the baroque sound of the record, Moore and Blegvad's songwriting steal the show. ""Some Questions About Hats"" begins things with a jazz piano chord and Krause's query, ""Can one wear uncanny hats?"" She poses similarly pressing questions throughout: ""Can one weather hats?"" ""Can one dismiss hats as simple things? Vapid things? Scat, evanescent things?"" Moore and Blegvad's music favors the delicate-- soft piano, violin, french horn, Cutler's brushed cymbals, and doubling Krause's vocal with clarinet in a way similar to Weill's arrangements for his Threepenny Opera. Greaves' music for ""Bad Alchemy"" is delicate, too, though with sharply angled melodic lines and snare-heavy percussive accents from Cutler that lend the piece a martial quality. Krause describes visions of being a hermaphrodite, views her ""self unmixed"" and wonders if she is ""neither one nor quite the other."" Moore provides the instrumental title track, a jazz waltz with blue-nostalgic piano chords and an understated shuffling accompaniment from Cutler. The music sounds as if it's coming from a deserted club at dawn, after the wait staff has left and the bartenders are waiting for the band to get bored and go home. Slapp Happy would have been an interesting bar band; they'd have been kicked out of the rock and blues dives, perhaps been forced to set up a small stage in front of a coffee shop, playing existential cabaret for tips. ""Apes in Capes"" is another waltz, subbing out the jazz touches for pointed chamber-rock, and Moore's playful, nonsensical wordplay: ""Harken child by life beguiled, it's said that some come unsung, Sorry, no song for some, sing-song's ham-strung."" In fact, Slapp Happy excelled at being playful. Blegvad's stop-and-go surf rock tune ""Strayed"" laments losing touch with reality (""Gone into hiding, can't abide the latest tidings from the tribe""), and features his vocals, sounding like a very happily stoned Lou Reed. The band turns what should be a depressing trainwreck into something charming, greatly assisted by Frith's faux-Hawaiian guitar asides. Likewise, their take on Handel's Messiah comes out like an art-school garage band, a far cry from the bloated classical redux of their proggy contemporaries. In fact, the only time Desperate Straights approaches ""bloated"" at all is on its instrumental closer, ""Caucasian Lullaby"", a lengthy, dissonant piece that recalls both Brian Eno's early ambient records and Henry Cow's live improvisations. Slapp Happy disbanded after this album, with Krause, Cutler and Frith eventually forming the considerably more experimental Art Bears. However, Krause, Blegvad, and Moore reformed the band in the late 90s, updating their sound with drum loops and digitally enhanced production, but unfortunately toning down most of the idiosyncrasies that made records like Desperate Straights so cool. Still, their work in the 70s stands as some of the most unique and interesting ""pop"" of the era, and anyone into pushing the chamber-pop envelope should search for this album in particular.","ReR reissues Slapp Happy's delicate third album, a cabaret-informed collaboration with British avant-prog band Henry Cow.

The Folded Palm,Frog Eyes,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be73c0084474cd0c2eb5/1:1/w_160/eac7d260.jpg,2004-10-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3267-the-folded-palm/,Absolutely Kosher,"It's too late for Frog Eyes to change their name to Wolf Eyes, but in the past year, the band's frontman, Carey Mercer, has turned spitty, snarly, and lupine. Where he once sounded like David Bowie, he now seems to channel Tim Buckley-- he's no longer a singer so much as a yelping, rasping, contorting spectacle. Mercer's throaty kabuki made both Frog Eyes' limited, acoustic LP Ego Scriptor and his solo album, Light Flows the Putrid Dawn, so thoroughly spooky that few listeners could digest them without a seventh-track stretch. Unsurprisingly, Xiu Xiu comparisons have steadily surfaced. While Jamie Stewart has become subtler, more musical and less vaudevillian, Mercer is becoming flashier, extra-musical, and terrifically affected. They're moving in opposite directions, but both men have arrived at the same crossroad-- expect a Frog Eyes/Xiu Xiu seven-inch split any day now. The rest of Frog Eyes have always proved an excellent supporting cast to Mercer's Lear. Their buggy leader has the hooks and crazy headshake thing, so the band simply focuses on dutiful playing, giving both The Bloody Hand and The Golden River an unearthed lost-scrolls-of-Gallus glow which never would have materialized had the Frog Eyes worker bees left Queen Mercer and squirreled up their own private honey pots. And yet, there now seems to have been a bit of a revolt. Frog Eyes' newest effort, The Folded Palm, is at times complete anarchy: Mercer chews up his own melodies and spits them out with nary a tone left, drummer Melanie Campbell plays her most violent set to date, piano man Grayson Walker insists on spelling out chords that mirror the band leader's, and bassist Michael Rak is either transgressing well into guitar and key ranges or competing with their volume. That's not to say the band isn't playing together-- as usual, they're tight as hell. What they're doing is matching Mercer bite for bite and catcall for caterwaul, like a four-headed dog feasting on the same coin-eyed meal. As a result, The Folded Palm is the band at its loudest and most menacing. To say the album ""starts off strong"" is only half the story-- the opening three-song suite is a fucking firebomb. Campbell calls the band to arms with a tricky stomp and a crack at her trashcan cymbal, and a barrage of sound named ""The Fence Feels Its Post"" follows her command. Mercer's howls barely break through the mix, and when they do, they tend to the frantic and imagistic. The song bleeds into ""The Akhian Press"", a more musical, less theatrical return to past Frog Eyes tracks such as The Golden River's ""World's Greatest Concertos"". ""I Like Dot Dot Dot"" is the shortest of the opening three tracks (which is saying something when you consider that the longest is only 1:52), and the closest Frog Eyes come to punk on this album-- it's all fast strums, headless chicken deliveries, and Mercer's gorgeous chorus-pedal lick. ""The Akhian Press"" and ""I Like Dot Dot Dot"" debuted earlier this year on Ego Scriptor, but the fuller The Folded Palm recordings make those versions seem like mere footnotes. The rest of The Folded Palm shares in the tri-partite opener's fury-- the best songs smartly stay short of the three-minute line, and some don't even stretch over two. It's a shame that, since the band has diffused song emphasis from the Mercer core and kicked up the energy, the truly memorable melodies that made each of The Golden River and The Hand a success have trouble finding their place amidst the new jitter. Whereas substance used to take precedence over style, Mercer's theatrics now often obscure potentially beautiful lines. ""New Soft Motherhood Alliance""-- one of the most successful songs on Mercer's solo album-- now drowns in its own cheap make-up and gaudy Meat Loaf melodrama. Frog Eyes have played live more often in 2004 than in years past, and The Folded Palm benefits from the band's wealth of on-stage energy. Naturally, their yelps and instrumental overloads work better when they are not only heard but also seen and felt; yet it will be exciting to discover how Frog Eyes makes good on the implicit commitment they make on The Folded Palm to mirroring their live and recorded personas. For the time being, three solid records in one year will more than suffice.","In a year in which Frog Eyes leader Casey Mercer has already delivered a solo record and his band's acoustic LP, Ego Scriptor, the Canadian foursome have now harnessed the power of their live show and delivered their most anarchic statement to date.

New Roman Times,Camper Van Beethoven,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f89d034d5c69bf31bb/1:1/w_160/efa66346.jpg,2004-10-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1266-new-roman-times/,Vanguard,"Of the noteworthy bands to emerge during the great American indie rock flowering in the mid-to-late 1980s, Camper Van Beethoven perhaps left behind the most uncertain legacy. Their California-baked, Middle Eastern-tinged ska-folk was always a bit too silly to appeal to dour, purebred hipsters; and they didn't stay together long enough to enjoy the commercial success of fellow college radio alumni like R.E.M., Meat Puppets, or Soul Asylum. And unlike other recently reunited acts like Pixies or Mission of Burma, Camper Van Beethoven have never been particularly influential. Then, of course, there's the Cracker factor. Although David Lowery's post-Camper unit have surely had their moments, too often it seemed as though Lowery's chief objective with that band was to deaden any lingering fondness aging CVB fans might have for him. So despite the fact that their best albums-- particularly 1988's Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart-- hold up as well as nearly anything from the era, the bottom line is that Camper Van Beethoven entered the new century with much of their music out of print and their reputation in desperate need of rehabilitation. Thankfully, the group's members recognized this and put themselves to work brushing away the cobwebs and sweeping up the rec room. Live reunion gigs and archival releases like their version of Fleetwood Mac's Tusk and 2002's handsome box set Cigarettes & Carrot Juice: The Santa Cruz Years primed the motor; now Camper Van has fully completed their re-ignition campaign with this bona fide reunion album, which features their entire classic line-up: Lowery, guitarist Greg Lisher, bassist Victor Krummenacher, drummer Chris Pedersen, violinist Jonathan Segel, plus David Immergluck on extra guitar and strings. For better or worse, Camper Van Beethoven have gone to great lengths to ensure that New Roman Times is no mere nostalgia trip. Never a band to do things by half-measures, here they've delivered a full-fledged concept album/rock opera complete with a daffy plot about a fictional America divided into smaller republics (most notably the secular Republic of California and the Fundamentalist Christian Republic of Texas) who are at war with one another. The plot isn't always easy to follow-- and perhaps we'd all be better off ignoring it entirely-- but it does allow the band to employ some none-too-disguised political jabs as well as to indulge their taste for 1970s-style prog rock. But it's this self-indulgent streak that gets New Roman Times off to an inauspicious start. Following the brief, uneventful introductory ""Prelude"", the band immediately launches into the ponderous math-rock of ""Sons of the New Golden West"". The track would be completely unrecognizable as CVB if not for Segel's distinctive fiddle above the din. When this unpleasantness is followed by the bland Crackerisms of ""51-7"" and the ridiculous FM power chording of ""White Fluffy Clouds"", you'd be forgiven for thinking that maybe this reunion wasn't such a hot idea after all. However, things improve with the pedal steel lilt of ""That Gum You Like Is Back in Style"", a wistful country tune that would've fit effortlessly onto 1989's Key Lime Pie. With this track the group finally begins to hit its weird and familiar stride. At their best, Camper Van Beethoven are able to casually pull off genre-leaping exploits that most bands would be foolish to even attempt, and they reach just such a pinnacle when they bounce recklessly from the brain-damaged hoedown of ""Militia Song"" to the self-explanatory instrumental ""R'N'R Uzbekistan"" to the melodic gypsy sway of ""The Poppies of Balmorhea"". Other highlights include the surprisingly convincing cop-show funk of ""Discotheque CVB"" and the tripped-out ""I Am Talking to This Flower"" which eventually spills out into a nutty version of Steve Reich's tape-loop piece ""Come Out"". On these tracks-- and the genuinely disorienting ""I Hate This Part of Texas""-- the group surprisingly re-attains the delightful THC-fuelled heights of strangeness that made them special in the first place. Unfortunately, these high points are surrounded by plenty of semi-coherent nonsense about the wanderings of their fictional protagonist soldier boy, who is prone to making weighty pronouncements like, ""I would die for hippie chicks!"" In case you couldn't guess, the political content here is wielded with all the subtlety of a rubber mallet, and features such refined irony as Lowery chanting, ""Might makes right/ God is on our side and makes us mighty."" It's this broad streak of trite wise-assery that kept too many would-be listeners from taking Camper Van Beethoven seriously back in their heyday. And while the band has done much in the past couple years to restore their legacy to the respectability it deserves, one has to hope that their smirks don't torpedo this second act as well.","The 1980s indie rock legends reunite for a concept album about a fictional America divided into warring republics like the secular Republic of California and the Fundamentalist Christian Republic of Texas-- in other words, Karl Rove's wet dream.

One in an Infinity of Ways,Ammoncontact,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1abc0084474cd0bfe72/1:1/w_160/c11475b0.jpg,2004-10-11 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/455-one-in-an-infinity-of-ways/,Plug Research,"An album's closing track can spoil everything, as Ammoncontact's One in an Infinity of Ways demonstrates. Before the salt is tasted in the sugar, this L.A.-based jazz-hop unit unveils several nourishing, leftfield instrumental grooves. But when Sol Uprising's Lil Sci delivers a laser-cut rap on the record's final track-- one that would perfectly complement the opener, instrumental space-out ""Dreamy""-- the absence of MCs becomes glaring and the album suddenly seems like a collection of missed opportunities. Or, as Lil Sci puts it: ""That's why I don't judge until I hear the half of the half."" One in an Infinity of Ways, indeed. In all fairness, the incomplete-art element is what Ammoncontact's Carlos Niño and Fabian Ammon are possibly reaching for on their second album, as hip-hop and psychedelic jazz instrumentals are often left 50% done for future remixing and rapping. However, when producers can neither afford a set of guests nor rhyme worth a damn, most of the music simply falls in the background-- for good or ill. That said, ""Dreamy"" falls into the good, and it can leave one seeing purple, red, and orange spots everywhere the eye glances. Bedroom-techno dandy Daedelus supplies the bass clarinet thrumps and acoustic guitar licks that dart about while a flute sample melts the cortex. As previously mentioned, the inclusion of Lil Sci's laidback rhymes about keeping your chin up during adversity may could proven that psychedelica can sell almost any public service announcement. Unfortunately, other choice MC spots also turn up two cherries with each pull of the slots. ""Healing Vibrations"" has a looped Afro-jazz beat that nearly rivals the Apache break before Niño and Ammon seamlessly let the music nod off into a 2 a.m. jazz trance courtesy of bassist/guitarist Greg Malone and skinsman Andres Renteria. It's one of many moments when Ammoncontact successfully blur the line between the sampler and live instruments. The three-part ""Infinity of Rhythm Instrumental"" knocks listeners awake with a bludgeon by conga before settling into a methanol haze with downtempo Rhodes funk. Other fine tracks include the P-Funk bounce of, ahem, ""Fun Is for Funky"" and the robotic funk of ""Wu Woomp Whoomp"", which struggles to escape the length of its two-foot power cord. Prefuse 73's Scott Herren has called Ammoncontact's sound ""machine funk,"" yet it's one that is devoid of poetry. Bare-boned throwaways ""Through the Moon"" and ""Wu Wu Woomp"" (you read right) drag a tepid hip-hop beat around in circles-- dying for the verses of any li'l Johnny who found God in the Gospel according to Emniem. ""Like Waves of the Sea"" has a swank Latin-jazz bass riff that sadly goes nowhere, while the staccato orchestral tease ""Ballad of the Untitled"" sounds too incomplete to even count as a lock-groove piece. The demand for an emcee savior is exacerbated with every listen. The nagging title One in an Infinity of Ways implies that Ammoncontact are capable of greater good, and they would've left the listener with a remarkable batch of abstract sketches-- if Lil Sci hadn't exposed the nudity of it all. I can't wait for the remixes to hopefully correct things.","The latest release from this Los Angeles-based Plug Research jazz-hop duo is missing something... or somebody.

All the Leaves Are Gone,Josephine FosterThe Supposed,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bea413d197565213b783/1:1/w_160/beea7226.gif,2004-10-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3324-all-the-leaves-are-gone-with-the-supposed/,Locust,"At its start, All The Leaves Are Gone heeds Lady Macbeth's advice and looks like the flower. For the first few minutes of album opener ""Well-Heeled Man"", Josephine Foster lips pretty whatnots over sparse guitar action, echoing both her work with Jason Ajemian as Born Heller and ""Little Life"", her stand out contribution to Devendra Banhart's recent neo-folk compilation Golden Apples of the Sun. And then the serpent rears its head: Drums roll, cymbals crash, acoustic guitars fight an electric improvisational warrior-- from pretty much herein, All the Leaves Are Gone is a bloodthirsty rock album, hot and curdling till the last man bites the Martian grass. Moving from ""sparse Appalachian folk"" to ""bloodthirsty rock"" seems like a huge gap not to mind, but the protean Foster proves she can do either of them convincingly. On her own, she acquires the intimate affectations of Shirley Collins with a weird twist of opera bravado; with the support of backing band The Supposed, Foster remains operatic but the excess rock energy triggers her Joan Baez and Cat Power reflexes. All of which is to say: Foster's vocal range-- vertically or theatrically-- never poses any issues here. The Old Dawson Prater Wives' Tale that Foster originally conceived All the Leaves Are Gone as a rock musical doesn't seem out of the question: Foster's empowered delivery makes her hooks stick even more than in her sparser outfits, as if the whole album is designed to be whistle-worthy fare for departing theatergoers. It would not surprise if some indie rock visionary takes Foster's songs here and writes a brilliant accompanying stage play. Until that time, the songs alone will more than suffice. The album's title track offers its own antidote for the bleak house it pitches (""There is no end to your sorrow"") with an Eastern-tinged electric guitar closely trailing Foster's matter-of-fact melody until the two miraculously consummate. ""Deathknell"" is surprisingly amelodic for Foster-- the vocals stay buried deep in her throat-- but the choice is disastrously effective, lending a sense of dread to Foster's anxious chorus, ""I had a mother, mother had a mother, no one remembers their name."" Foster and The Supposed run circles around themselves on the blazing ""Jailbird (Hero of the Sorrow)"", which teems with electric guitar-vocal counterpoint and innumerably distinct mega-riffs. Unfortunately, The Supposed's electric guitarist can be pretty annoying. It's unclear who he thinks he is, or what band he thinks he's in, or what song he thinks he's jazzing up on tracks like ""Who Will Feel Better at the Days End?"", which starts promisingly with double-plucks snatched off Tim Buckley's Starsailor but degenerates into high-speed wankery reminiscent of the high school pit band guitarist who doesn't know how to read music, so he ""just plays whatever."" The same problem exists on ""The Most Loved One"" and album closer ""(You Are Worth) A Million Dollars"": The guy is clearly well trained, but his improvisations more than often detract from Foster, who is (deservedly) the principal here. Let's not quibble, though: All the Leaves Are Gone is theatrical, occasionally vaudevillian, and-- like Foster's earlier offerings this year-- is never wasteful or impassionate.",,7.7,
Treble & Tremble,Earlimart,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe3ea9e61561daa7340/1:1/w_160/bdd41106.jpg,2004-10-11 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2653-treble-tremble/,Palm,"Los Angeles-based Earlimart's last album, Everyone Down Here, was made a unique affair by frontman Aaron Espinoza's quaint impulses, his artisan's fussiness over detail, and the record's texture. The resulting wistful, buzzy rock effortlessly absorbed the past 20 or so years of sonic gadgetry (synths, loops, filters, tuneless noise as a legitimate arrangement option), and accommodated them all within a sturdy folk-flecked framework. And if it sounded like countless other records by countless other bands, there always remained a colorless, odorless component of intelligent craftsmanship. The same holds true for Treble & Tremble. It's starting to piss me off. Writing about Earlimart in the context of the current indie landscape is like explaining why Grey Goose is a better spirit than Popov: It comes down to the feeling you have after you've finished them. The opener, ""Hold on Slow Down""-- a ballad of floating wispy, hollowed-out vocals over basic but grand Lennon-esque piano chords-- is a bit of a sequel to ""The Movies"", the standout track on Everyone Down Here. It's a good, honest gambit, especially since Espinoza is not a great singer-- as he appears well aware. The album's title is a serviceable description of Espinoza's vocal style. He has a standard indie rock head voice, which he treats as a producer's auto-challenge: Treble and Tremble showcases a full array of old-school remedies, from inventive mic'ing and overdubbing to brutal filters and bullhorn distortion a la Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse. If Espinoza sang any better than he does, he'd probably be bored in the studio. ""First Instant Last Report"" finds Earlimart at their most accessible and fun, which is also, paradoxically, their weakest. It's these upbeat strummy songs, with their PB&J; pairing of guitar crunch and keys, that betray the band's recent mentorship by Grandaddy (whom Earlimart are otherwise poised to outgrow). Once again, the best tracks are the darker ones. ""Heaven Adores You"" begins in stupor and ends in catharsis: Toward its end, a gorgeous string riff careens from nowhere to snap everything into place like a tiny deus ex machina. And the rococo lead guitar on ""Broke the Furniture"" raises the reasonable question: Why aren't more indie guitarists ripping off George Harrison? (Oh, right: They can't.) Espinoza is neither a bad lyricist nor an ambitious one, dealing primarily in complete neutralities (e.g. ""I lost my way/ In trying to find/ Somewhere else to stay""). Yet there's an intriguing abundance of professional self-reflection on display here. Like the album's name, most song titles also refer to music, songwriting, and-- crucially-- recording. There's ""The Hidden Track"" (which the band proudly places third in the LP's running order), ""A Bell and a Whistle"", ""Sounds"", and ""Unintentional Tape Manipulations""-- all traditional verse/chorus/verse songs. Elsewhere are references to songs being out of key-- ""808 Crickets"", which likely refers to the drum machine rather than, say, an insect count, quotes a device from Earlimart's recent tour: The band used a constant cricket-noise background loop at its concerts, conjuring up an odd, hushed environment. A dime-store Freud analysis of Espinoza's preoccupations will tell you the same thing the album itself is desperate to relate: Earlimart like music, so they make music about music. In a genre beset by extra-musical agendas-- and in an all-in-the-context age of churning trend cycles and ironic revivals-- this is an approach that could catch us off guard and perplexed. But that sure as hell isn't Earlimart's fault.","From self-aware song titles to a bagful of production tricks, these Los Angeles-based trad-rockers are at their best when making music about music.

Mañana,Savath y Savalas,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a362c0084474cd0c0269/1:1/w_160/ba028d8c.gif,2004-10-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7009-manana/,Warp,"Finally, Scott Herren has stopped being so damned culturally sensitive. Relocated from the American South to southern Spain, Herren fell in love with Barcelonan culture and music and recycled his former post-rock alias, Savath & Savalas, as an interpreter of Catalan folk music with this year's Apropa't LP. On paper, it sounded as if Herren would be applying his unique micro-editing CTRL-X/CTRL-V talents to another land's musical heritage, having already reprocessed the American tropes of jazz and hip-hop under his flagship moniker, Prefuse 73. Instead, Herren put his skittering rhythms in storage and produced a much softer album, like a romantic evening over a bottle of Rioja, a pot of paella, and sundry other stereotypically Spanish things. For those who thought they could forecast Herren's tactics, Apropa't was a surprise and, very likely, a disappointment. (""Oh gross, is this world music?!?"") Yet the project accomplished what Herren himself was likely looking to do: introduce his fans to the Catalan music of S&S; singer Eva Puyuelo Muns with a minimum of distraction and interpretation. But Herren has built a career on recontextualization-- be it of dusty vinyl excavations or his own compositions-- and this follow-up EP gives him space to exercise those strengths. 2003's Extinguished EP built a banquet out of leftovers from Prefuse 73's One Word Extinguisher album, mixing stray beats and found sound into a fully-developed companion piece. Mañana is also a re-imagination of source material; it's eight original songs that spin the Barcelona travelogue of Apropa't in a new direction. The first element one hears on Mañana is a cut-up, hiccuping vocal sample-- an immediate indication that Herren is using the EP to inject his Prefuse 73 methodology into the Savath & Savalas sound. Though the track is titled ""Interludio Inconcreto"", it might as well be an overture for the half-hour of music to follow. A beat-less swirl of abrupt string swells and disconnected syllables, the piece retains the hazy atmosphere of Apropa't while happily shirking traditional instrumentation and arrangement. ""Demà Vindrà"" accomplishes a similar feat, preserving the whispery vocals of Herren and Muns that dominate Apropa't but sautéing them on a bed of sampled string-plucks, static crackles, and headphone-hopping ooo's. Less subtle is ""Sota L'Aigüa"", on which an initial passage of soft singing and gentle backwards loops runs headlong into a surprise appearance by the kind of beat programming tweaked to perfection on One Word Extinguisher. For two minutes, this drum flurry gives Herren's Barcelonan project its strongest backbone, adding helpful variety to what was oftentimes on Apropa't a sound too weightless to leave an impression. ""No Puedo de Cidir"" is no less jarring when placed alongside traditional compositions; it sounds like a Tortoise outtake got mixed in with the S&S; masters at John McEntire's Soma Studios. The EP crests with ""Equipatage de Flors Seques"", wherein Herren gets all ""Revolution 9"" on his Barcelona period by pitting tetherless piano ramblings against loop fuckery that only coalesces for one short stretch. It's an intentionally disorienting take on the indigenous music at the project's core, and one wonders what Herren's collaborator Muns thinks of the final product-- and whether it's a coincidence that Mañana is rumored to be their final collaboration. But it's difficult to ignore that the track is far more interesting and dense than anything on Apropa't, at least to this typically foreign-culture-ignorant American. Mañana finds Herren working up the nerve to interpret the music of his adopted Spanish home instead of merely documenting it, and the results allow the EP to easily outshine its shy big brother.","Prefuse 73's Scott Herren last release under the Savath & Savalas moniker was steeped in tradition and convention, a lite-FM, soft-pop bore. Here, he goes from culturally sensitive to culturally imperialistic, and creates the record fans had originally hoped Aprop'at might be, employing his signature glitchmarks and cutting up singer Eva Puyuelo Muns' gentle coo.

Summer in Abaddon,Pinback,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07913d19756521383c4/1:1/w_160/963d6f5d.jpg,2004-10-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6299-summer-in-abaddon/,Touch and Go,"The title of Pinback's third album, Summer in Abaddon, sounds like a morbid joke: It implies a hiatus or a vacation, a productive retreat to perhaps an artists' commune or an off-season spent at a remote hideaway. But Abaddon is not the name of a small coastal town or a resort near the Poconos: Deriving from Hebrew, it refers to the pits of hell, a place of annihilation and destruction where its dwellers become unimaginably small and brutally insignificant. The word is also the name of the angel/demon who reigns over this kingdom of pitch; he is death incarnate. It's a word pendulously heavy with slithery meaning, but Pinback's album isn't about physical suffering. For the band's two mainstays-- Armistead Burwell Smith IV, formerly of 3 Mile Pilot, and Rob Crow (Thingy and ex-Heavy Vegetable)-- hell is creative stagnation. It is the inability to make music. Surprisingly, Summer in Abaddon, the band's first release for Touch & Go, is arguably their best record yet, a logical and accessible realization of a sound they've been developing for more than six years. Appropriately, the album plays as a chronicle of time wasted; its songs are full of romantic cul-de-sacs, barroom blackouts, and crossword puzzles. The disc opens with ""Non Photo-Blue"", an image of modern futility: ""She's posting all the time, but the boards are down."" ""Fortress"" describes a ""sick summer in bed,"" spending ""days with the light off, freezing."" Death looms over ""Bloods on Fire"", as Crow and Smith eulogize a friend: ""Here's to the pranks we never pulled/ And never will."" Yet, while Summer in Abaddon is bleak, it's not without an appropriately dark and self-effacing sense of humor, one best glimpsed in the chorus of ""This Red Book"": ""I could strangle you all/ Did I say that out loud?"" If the lyrics recount endless unproductive hours, then Pinback's music steadily ticks off the seconds and minutes. The band-- which on this release also includes Kenseth Thibideau, Cameron Jones, and Ryan Bromley-- has always been rhythmically tight, but on Summer in Abaddon, they sound clockwork precise: The drums, guitars, and bass lock together like cogs turning against each other: one moving the next moving the next moving until they form a Mobius strip groove. If ""Sender"" didn't fade out, the instrumental interplay could imaginably go on for months until its gears finally wound down. Even the name Pinback-- taken from the sci-fi movie Dark Star-- suggests something mechanical, like a wind-up robot. On the first few songs of Summer in Abaddon, there seem to be few sustained notes outside of voice and background synths; instead, the emphasis is on points of sound. At times, the songs evoke the rapid fire of synapses as the brain develops a series of ideas. Such a precise sound suggests clinical, cloistered detachment, a self-imposed isolation of extreme introversion. However, as the album progresses, it grows slightly more lush and louder-- albeit it no less dynamic or desolate. ""The Yellow Ones"" sets a ponderous piano line against ever-steady drum beats and whistling keyboards, creating a hushed nocturne. By contrast, ""AFK"" ends the album with an aggressive and maybe even outraged punk energy, as if Crow and Smith are trying to will their way out of the abyss. Compared to earlier Pinback songs such as ""June"" and ""Some Voices"", the 10 tracks on Summer in Abaddon initially sound less dramatic; the band has opted to convey their ideas and emotions through subtle implication and impressionistic lyrics. Despite the tremendous metaphysical weight they carry, the songs glide by with an unhindered fluidity, verses unceremoniously giving way to choruses and back again. The dynamics are often subdued, but Pinback aren't emotionally distant as much as indirect. If the album is the product of wasted time, it does not reflect that waste. And therein lies the knotty paradox at the heart of Summer in Abaddon: Pinback's darkest hours have inspired their finest moment.","The long-time central focus of indie rock mainstays Armistead Burwell Smith IV (ex-3 Mile Pilot) and Rob Crow (Thingy, ex-Heavy Vegetable) emerges from creative stagnation, its members obsessing over all the time they've wasted.

After an album's worth of thorny sine waves and electronic sound deconstructions, Michael Beckett, the tech-head behind kpt, scrubbed away his steel-wool atmospheres and ended with a stark, nouveau-folk arrangement that left listeners scratching their heads. It seemed a disjointed end to his ethereal computerized compositions. But one listen to his latest, self-titled effort makes it obvious Beckett was simply introducing us to a genre on which he had further designs: pop. Well, perhaps ""pop"" is putting too fine a sheen on it. On kpt.michi.gan, Beckett pits lustrous folk guitar arrangements against his tastes for harsh, unsettling wirescapes. The result is an often stunning but mostly perplexing effort in what one could term static-folk. Beckett's forcible juxtaposition of autumnal pop songs and academic electronic composition rarely gels; instead, it dissolves into sudden tempo-shifts and confused atmospheric discord. ""The Summer Session"" opens with the sounds of an electronic slaughterhouse trembling with blood-curdling squeals and jugular sine waves. Just as the cacophony gets too burdensome, a gorgeous acoustic guitar loop sifts in out of the gore and engulfs the listener in pleasant, sylvan imagery. The transition is too jarring, though, and winds up sounding like two song fragments super-glued together in the studio-- attempting an update of the whimsical psychedelic shifts of ""A Day in the Life"", it falls apart in a chaotic identity clash. On this album, Beckett sings more often than he has in the past but still seems uneasy with his vocals. Much like touring pal and occasional lap-pop co-conspirator Schneider TM, he uses a vocoder to angularize the soft, plush textures of his voice. ""Hey People!"" begs us to cast off our cares and submit to feverish urban lusts, but his vocoded urging seems to hold us at arm's length, making his detached command ring false and hollow. Like much of the album, Beckett wants to carve a line of protest in wet cement, but he's too finicky to use his fingers. Every once in a while, Beckett returns to his roots, unearthing the heathen beauty in mechanized howling and re-claiming the compelling noise-squalls of older compositions like ""Derber Papa"". ""Mount Michigan"" hovers on what sounds like a subtle bagpipe jeer before blending buzzing sine waves and revolving interference into a Fennesz-like ode to hard-wired misanthropy. Circular noises hum like natural machinery as Beckett recreates a supermarket ambience, and, reminding us that repetition is the harmony beneath our self-neglect, the is coated in simple, sublime noise. In the end, Beckett dips from the soft/harsh well far too often. On ""Coughsong"", he wheezes into a rolling acoustic guitar part reminiscent of Sea Change-era Beck or Serge Gainsbourg. As the drifting ease begins to loll you sunblind, he splits it headfirst with dirty drums and aggressive static waves. He contorts both his simplistic pop urges and his more obtuse soundscaping, and makes good on neither. Always drooling to have his cake and eat it too, you can't help but wish Beckett were either less the egghead or a little less the pop-jughead. By now, it's hard to tell just where his strengths lie.","Best-known for his excellent Schneider TM collaboration (and Smiths cover) ""The Light 3000"", kpt.michi.gan's second solo album attempts a Fennesz-ish balance of digital noise and vague pop sensibilities.

Our Shadows Will Remain,Joseph Arthur,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1105e6ef959693200dd/1:1/w_160/5458a5de.jpg,2004-10-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/303-our-shadows-will-remain/,Vector,"When U.S. atomic bombs exploded in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the blasts were so powerful that they incinerated people immediately and burned their shadows onto floors and walls. There are scientific reasons for this phenomenon, but it carries such a strong metaphorical punch that it carries a depth of meaning even beyond its empirical explanation: Humans-- and humanity-- are easily lost amid the collisions of countries and ideologies. That Joseph Arthur has titled his fourth album Our Shadows Will Remain reveals his own conflicted emotions about life during wartime. On one hand, his fourth full-length album-- and first after parting ways with longtime label Real World and signing with Vector Recordings-- is informed by terror-era jitteriness, a fear of something worse than death: abject annihilation. Clashing with this paranoia, cynicism, grief, and disbelief, however, is Arthur's wavering optimism. The bright blast that vaporizes him may not be a terrorist's bomb, but the Rapture. A strong believer in God and an afterlife, he nevertheless fears death. Always more naively sincere boho than detached hipster, Arthur left his apartment studio in his adopted hometown of New York and decamped to the relative safety of New Orleans to record Our Shadows Will Remain. The resulting album is not a drastic departure, but it does sound more expansive-- both geographically and musically. There seems to be a lot of distance in the album, as Arthur evokes both the Midwest (the brief ""In Ohio"") and Los Angeles (""Echo Park""), not to mention New Orleans and New York. Arthur fills this space with music that melds the homemade beats of his one-man Come to Where I'm From with the live-band sound of Redemption's Son. The Prague Philharmonic Orchestra injects three songs with swooping strings and nervy anxiety. In contrast, drums detonate throughout ""Stumble and Pain"", creating an apocalyptic march. Arthur layers his vocals heavily on most tracks, harmonizing with an infinite regression of selves. On his first duet, ""A Smile That Explodes"""", he sings with New Zealand singer Julia Darling, whose crystalline voice dramatically offsets his grainy tenor and lends the song a somber, defeated tone. Likewise, Our Shadows Will Remain is similarly moody and conflicted. While not as claustrophobic (or as bold) as Come to Where I'm From, it's much less hopeful and uplifting than Redemption's Son, which is significant: The progression in two years from hard-won optimism to bleak pessimism seems to mirror the national unraveling of post-9/11 solidarity into deep disillusionment and disgust in response to the invasion of Iraq. But current events only partially inform Our Shadows Will Remain, providing a context for these songs but not necessarily a subject. Despite the plural pronoun in its title, this is a deeply personal record. In fact, as if mirroring his move from New York, the album at times sounds as though Arthur's main subject is retreat-- from society, from home, from friends and especially lovers. ""I wanna try,"" he sings on ""Puppets"", ""to get away from everybody else."" The album ends with the blunt command ""Leave Us Alone"". Here, as on previous albums, Arthur demonstrates his gift for emotionally direct songwriting, but the specifics often escape his attention. Occasionally, a lyric rings false, relies on cliche, sounds clumsily vague, or simply tries too hard (""like a ghost without an atmosphere his voice sang without a song""). There's a sense of futility and loss to his lyrics, but these slight gaffes are made all the more noticeable by gracefully evocative lines like the one that ends ""A Smile That Explodes"": ""I write one more letter I won't send except for across the floor."" Still, the overall meanings of this complicated album are never lost. These songs communicate a gnawing, almost unnamable hurt that drives Arthur not just emotionally but-- more crucially-- artistically. He wants to leave behind more than just a shadow.","Life during wartime isn't just about the Mud Club and CBGB's or giving peace a chance, it's also about paranoia, disbelief, cynicism, grief, and optimism.

Mirages,Tim Hecker,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0985e6ef95969323591/1:1/w_160/80d5113f.jpg,2004-10-10 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3799-mirages/,Alien8,"Tim Hecker's latest album, Mirages, highlights a peculiar problem with abstract electronic music: Artists with the talent and vision to develop an identifiable sound sometimes have difficulty breaking away from it. A minute into ""Acéphale""-- the first track on Mirages-- I knew instantly that I was listening to a Tim Hecker album. His distinctive layering of crackly digital static, mournful swoons of drone, and rumbling bottom is easy to source if you're familiar with either of his previous records, last year's Radio Amor or 2001's Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again. ""Acéphale"" opens with an extended twist of death metal guitar (an element that repeats periodically throughout the album), a welcome and appropriate addition to the Hecker palette, but the song is still unmistakably his work. But is it a bad thing to have a unique sonic ID? Abstract electronic music gains intimacy when a producer has a specific voice-- the imagined personality on the other side of the laptop becomes clearer and more distinct. The downside is that it can be unnerving to closely follow an artist's career over the long term when one release sounds quite similar to the next, even if the quality level remains high (see Boards of Canada). Which isn't to say there are no differences between Mirages and its predecessors. This is Hecker's most subtle and flowing record, as well as the least ""musical."" While Haunt Me retained traces of Hecker's techno roots (particularly in its use of repetition) and Radio Amor experimented with harsher sounds and unusual use of piano, Mirages is a unified ambient suite, swallowing dark shades of gnarled guitar and exaggerated bass. The keyboard parts on Mirages are prettier, and the overall mood is more contemplative, but there's a deep pit of melancholy at the center of the record, a mood with a strongly cumulative effect. Unlike Fennesz-- to whom he is often compared (a reference that, as the Austrian producer shifts his musical focus, makes less sense than it used to)-- it's impossible to imagine Hecker in terms of single tracks. His music strives for endlessness and needs to be digested over the length of an album. On Hecker's albums, you never even know for certain where one title ends and another begins. Another new wrinkle is collaboration: Oren Ambarchi (who has worked with Fennesz, among others) adds guitar to ""Kaito""-- one of the record's best tracks, a song that fuses Ambarchi's trademark slow and measured tones with Hecker's cluttered midrange. Fly Pan Am add an industrial clang to ""Aerial Silver"", and David Bryant adds guitar (mostly in the form of feedback) to the 10-minute closer ""Incurably Optimistic!"". This final track is also the perfect illustration of the potential problem with trademark sounds within abstract electronic music. ""Incurably Optimistic!"" could be mixed into the center of Haunt Me and no one who hadn't heard that album would know the difference. And yet, it's also perhaps Hecker's finest single moment, with a crushingly sad organ melody reminiscent of a funeral service that gradually gives way to oblong piles of guitar distortion. ""Incurably Optimistic!"" is such a gorgeous track-- and such a fine end to this thoroughly enjoyable record-- that I have to wonder: With music this moving and well-constructed, can we fault Hecker for repeating himself?","The course of this Canadian producer's third full-length remains virtually unchanged from his last two, though that proves to not be a bad thing.

Love Songs for Patriots,American Music Club,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1aa5e6ef95969320238/1:1/w_160/e2938502.jpg,2004-10-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/454-love-songs-for-patriots/,Merge,"That American Music Club aren't more universally revered is perplexing. Between 1983 and 1994, the group released seven influential albums, eclectic melanges that integrated rock, folk, blues, jazz, and country into a document of raw Americana, yet never attained a level of recognition befitting such prolific and consistently powerful musicians. Of course, it's easy to understand why they've never been a ""buzz band""-- buzz is the currency of the young, and AMC catered to a slightly older set. They conveyed complex sentiments more likely to resonate with those who'd lived long enough to get knocked down a few times, shedding layers of self-esteem and solipsism along the way. The unbruised adolescent ego likes its angst to be clear-cut and attributable to the denigrations of an insouciant universe. Emotional complexity engenders too much unpleasant introspection and not enough pat catharsis. But this very trammel to superstardom has made AMC's longevity and continuing dynamism possible, and their first new album in 10 years, Love Songs for Patriots, is not only just as hearty as their earliest work, but it profits from another decade of experience grimed into its leathery creases. Love Songs for Patriots is a uniformly strong collection of sharp-eyed, sardonic allegories. Its first three tracks-- ""Ladies and Gentleman"", ""Another Morning"", and ""Patriot's Heart""-- demonstrate what AMC does better than almost anyone else: an elusive blend of gruff, shimmering music, understated drama, intuitive dynamics, and effortlessly poignant lyrics that burrow into the profane idealism at the heart of the American dream. Frontman Mark Eitzel's words are timeless and complicated, and sad without celebrating sadness: They acknowledge its inevitability while screaming defiantly into its sullen face. On ""Ladies and Gentlemen"", Eitzel is the archetypal barroom prophet, a pale figure kicking up sawdust in a dark, smoky room and summoning spirits into the leaden air. A brewing storm of heavily distorted chords, sculpted feedback, and detuned piano rumble beneath him. The consummate showman, Eitzel moans and shouts as the music lurches through segments of stark lounge and roiling disarray, issuing a plainspoken demand for redemption through honesty: ""Ladies and gentlemen, it's time/ The bartender is looking you right in the eye/ Says I'm going to replace all your weak blood with my wine/ If you can't live with the truth with the truth/ Go ahead, try to live with a lie."" ""Another Morning"" is more subdued, a well-sequenced mote of gossamer pop after the breathless claustrophobia of ""Ladies and Gentlemen"". Over a lovely bed of iridescent reverb, wafting acoustic guitar, and pliable percussion, Eitzel gently goads an unnamed ""you"" for her addiction to depression: ""Someone does you wrong, you give away your whole life to prove it/ You wear your pain with pride, you refuse to remove it/ You become the evil that plays with you like a doll/ Big rooms only make our lives small."" Delivered with less grace, the lines would seem mean-spirited and petty, but Eitzel breathes them out with such sympathy and tenderness that they become less an indictment than a prayer for deliverance. Rounding out the trio is the commanding ""Patriot's Heart"". Another character sketch, it's a scathing... I almost said ""indictment"" again, but that's not quite right: There's no sense of accusation or self-righteousness embedded in the song. Instead, it's weary, defeated but still standing, and profoundly empathetic toward its subject, a male stripper whose transformation from person to icon embodies the downfall of a culture that's lost its heart to materialism. Over plodding crests and sloughs of bone-tired, ragged bar-rock, Eitzel gradually transfigures his protagonist from a debased yet essentially human soul into a symbolic reservoir for the sum total of untenable desire (""After a few tequilas, I become something holy""), culminating in the dissolution of maligned dignity. ""I'm the past you wasted/ I'm the future you're obliterating/ Come on grandpa, remind me what we're celebrating."" The rest of the record continues to chart the shadowy regions of the spirit. Eitzel displays good-natured, satiric humor on the lulling, quiet ballad ""Myopic Books"", simple wisdom on the twinkling night-song ""Love Is"" (""We're so small compared to our hearts""), and undiluted, romantic hope on the breezy ""Only Love Can Set You Free"". Reviews of long-running bands often close by recommending that you check out their more salient back-catalog first, but I'm happy to say that the wonderfully humane and genuine Love Songs for Patriots is as fine a point of entry into their massive oeuvre as any.","After a 10-year hiatus, Mark Eitzel's American Music Club join the parade of recently reunited bands aiming to buck conventional wisdom and recapture past glory.

Frank Black Francis,Frank Black,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f813d19756521389ab/1:1/w_160/42ffc7de.jpg,2004-10-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/784-frank-black-francis/,spinART,"Memo
To: Charles Thompson, aka Black Francis, aka Frank Black
Re: Messing with the gospel Dude, you worry way too much. Sincerely,
--a fan You can say this for Frank Black: The man cares about his fans. The liner notes for his archival record Frank Black Francis-- the latest in his long string of solo albums, but the first to sport both of his stage names simultaneously and focus on Pixies material-- fret almost comically that the album will either not provide listeners value for their money, or will anger them because he's chosen to tamper with his classic material. Well, there's certainly no question that his concerns are well-founded. The first disc-- a set of solo acoustic demos Black recorded at producer Gary Smith's Allston, Mass., apartment before the Pixies hit the studio for their legendary first sessions at Fort Apache-- isn't going to speak to anyone who doesn't already know the material inside and out. Those who do, however, will no doubt lose their shit for a chance to hear these naked versions of some of the best-loved Pixies songs. Black's stated concern that the quality of the recordings is too bootleg is actually misplaced. Although it was recorded into Smith's cassette Walkman with nothing more than a little reverb added, the tape sounds startlingly fresh and clear. Plus, Black's disarming asides and spirited performance give the recordings a verve that helps them stand up well in the face of the canonical final versions that we've all played half to death (they're too good to ever really be killed). On the other hand, the second disc-- newly recorded version of 13 Pixies tracks-- is a total oddity. Many listeners who will salivate while the first disc spins might find themselves choking back the bile while listening to the second. Our relationship with the artists who change us the most are funny things, and hearing the songs of one of those bands as radically re-interpreted as they are here can be jarring, even upsetting, if you don't keep an open mind about it. Black, mostly independent of the rest of the Pixies (Joey Santiago does pop in for ""additional editing""), re-recorded these stone-cold Pixies classics with Two Pale Boys, veterans of collaboration with Pere Ubu's David Thomas, and as re-workings go, these amount to total detonations of their forebears. Once you get past the fact that you're hearing ""Subbacultcha"" re-imagined as a Tom Waits-ian electro-acoustic coffee shop rant or ""Caribou"" as if it dropped out of Wayne Coyne's back pocket, Black and the Boys-- known to their mothers as Andy Diagram and Keith Moline-- actually have done a pretty interesting job of ""messing with the gospel,"" as Black puts it in his liners. It's not all successful, however: ""Velouria"" is tragically slaughtered by a lugubrious pace and intestinal bass, while ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" needs the Pixies' mayhem more than the bendy elasto-synths it gets here. And the limping ambient version of ""Where Is My Mind?"" is what I imagine being killed with plastic cocktail swords would be like. But three strikeouts in 13 at-bats won't necessarily lose you a game, and the mind-bending readings of ""Caribou"" and ""Nimrod's Son"" are home runs that help to validate the endeavor. ""Caribou"" finds Black's falsetto in unusually supple, tender form as a whirling electronic background swells and pulses with his every vocal tic, while ""Nimrod's Son"" becomes seasick burlesque wrapped in a dubby echo. ""Wave of Mutilation"" playfully nods to the Doolittle arrangement as ""waves"" of manipulated static wash over the chorus. Is there anything here that bests or equals an original? Absolutely not, but at least the trio land some punches and go down swinging. Back on Disc 1, ""Caribou"" positively burns with razor-throated intensity, even as Black quickly explains to Smith, ""I'm supposed to be screaming here,"" and then veers off into wild shrieks and alley cat noises. He does his best to convey the basic outline of the weird ""Broken Face"" intro, but otherwise gives the song a good, rapid-fire run-through, and his Spanish accent is remarkably authentic on both ""Vamos"" and ""Isla de Encanta"". In all my years of listening to Black surrounded by other guitarists, I don't think it ever occurred to me how much facility the man himself has with the six-string. Here, his percussive strumming, odd picking patterns, and animated runs are impressive, often providing clues to these song's eventual arrangements. If you've read this far and you're not familiar with the Pixies' studio albums, please understand that under no circumstances should you begin your acquaintance with the band's material here. There are whole Pixies albums for that, and they're all worth owning. Those of you who have been with the band since the days of torn flannel and 120 Minutes are obviously the target audience of this release, which is a thoughtful presentation of what essentially was the final unreleased material in the Pixies vault. The second disc is ultimately little more than a curiosity for most-- and will no doubt be complete anathema for some-- but given that the entire package retails for a single-disc price, that's hardly a reason for a die-hard to opt out. The fact is, as a fan, I enjoyed the hell out of hearing Black's demos, and my guess is you will too.","The former/current Pixies frontman creates a prequel-- and sequel-- to his famous band's work. On the first disc of this two-disc set, Black unearths pre-Pixies demos; on the second, he revisits his own older material with a new band and new arrangements.

Hidden Vagenda,Kimya Dawson,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb91c0084474cd0c28b2/1:1/w_160/483f81b6.jpg,2004-10-07 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2579-hidden-vagenda/,K,"Kimya Dawson's move to K Records was perhaps inevitable. Her work with The Moldy Peaches has always been indebted to K cornerstone Beat Happening, and the withdrawn folk of her three previous solo albums would fit snugly beside the twee that has long clogged that label's roster. But Dawson has always channeled the confrontational energy of her work with Adam Green into her otherwise innocuous solo material, and tempers her wide-eyed sincerity with a deeply sardonic sensibility. The success of her music is blocked by two equally formidable limitations: Her rudimentary guitar arrangements and hoarse, adolescent voice are at high risk of producing cloying results, and the remnants of affected hostility from her Moldy Peaches days add yet another potential layer of unpleasantness. Her work has been compelling when her balance between cynical disaffection and childish naivete is in constant flux. Her 2002 debut I'm Sorry That Sometimes I'm Mean sounds like a journal entry from the bedroom of a Gen-Xer in arrested development, infusing a cynical post-adolescent assessment of the world at large with the comforting Casiotones and music box chimes of childhood. The sonic construction of Hidden Vagenda reveals a discernible maturation-- Dawson's arrangements here are her most complex to date, adding a diverse collection of instrumentalists and vocalists to her typically bare-bones production. Lyrically, however, Dawson seems trapped in the narrow confines of her conceptual focus. Hidden Vagenda attempts to disguise itself as a concept album of sorts, using the current American political landscape as an imprecise template for foreboding tales of death, capitalist opportunism, and the destruction of family and community, all told through the filter of juvenilia artifice. Dawson's choice to directly engage current events is a gamble that ultimately fails. Her simple musical approach works well to illustrate broad concepts, such as the child-like rumination on death in ""It's Been Raining"", but falls flat in the face of events whose magnitude overshadow casual introspection. It's difficult to empathize with Dawson's response to the 9/11 attacks in ""Anthrax (Power Ballad Version)"" (""We turned on CNN/ Watched the towers fall again/ And realized our lives weren't so bad"") when her tone is so ambivalent. Her political commentary consistently falls flat: Her token laundry list of Bush-era grievances in ""Viva La Persistence"" encompasses everything from colonial imperialism to Vanilla Coke, but her intentional lack of mature insight-- a natural result of her conceptual approach-- quickly becomes exasperating, particularly in the song's most juvenile moments (""Would I choose deep-fried apathy/ McNuggets where my balls should be/ Or supersized conformity?""). However, most of the album avoids awkward political sentiment, and many of these tracks stand out musically as Dawson's strongest material. The disconcerting group sing-along ""I Will Never Forget"" employs tympani, strings, and music box ornamentation to add a newfound richness to her tortured recollections of childhood. The silly bicycle bells and oompah horn section of ""Parade"" complement the song's surreal urban imagery, and languid alt-country closer ""Angels and Seagulls"" is sarcastic but strangely calming; Dawson delights in the prospect of solitude that drowning might provide. Though the jump to a new label has allowed Dawson a fuller and more rewarding production style, she is still far from perfecting a persona that, in all likelihood, will always seem somewhat disingenuous. Hidden Vagenda is elegantly constructed and outwardly naive, but it lacks a consistent underlying honesty. Despite her evocation of youth, Dawson still frequently comes across as jaded, and the conflict that arises from this clash-- though intermittently compelling-- deprives Hidden Vagenda of the sincerity the material deserves.","On her fourth solo record (and first for K), the former Moldy Peach tackles her usual juvenile subject matter-- and occasionally, the American political landscape.

Favourite Colours,The Sadies,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a331ea9e61561daa4c11/1:1/w_160/cc9d5b0e.jpg,2004-10-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6964-favourite-colours/,Yep Roc,"In my review of The Sadies' last effort, Stories Often Told, I said they were a few short steps away from perfecting the balance in their amalgam of surf, country and garage-rock. Even with the subsequent addition of bluegrass and old trucker songs to their mix, I can still say with some certainty that I was right-- they've managed to find that perfect balance. Nothing on Favourite Colours sounds like a detour. The resulting mishmash is served nicely by the ever-broadening term ""Americana,"" though the band are actually Canadian (those u's in the title aren't there for nothing) and the record's most prominent guest is mad Englishman Robyn Hitchcock, who appears on closer ""Why Would Anybody Live Here?"". But while the album is stylistically and sonically brilliant, it still suffers from the primary flaw of the band's four previous albums: Their songwriting hasn't made the same leap as their chops. There are a few standout melodies, but most of them are too limited in range to be truly memorable. The band's vocals can recall a sort of fantasy collaboration between Kris Kristofferson and Sweetheart of the Rodeo-era Byrds without exactly nailing what made either great, but they're still apropos for their easy-loping country-surf beat. On Favourite Colours, the band members handle the production themselves for the first time, and they give those close harmonies a roomy atmosphere, with pedal steels echoing in the distance, drums that impart the sound of the room in which they were recorded, and guitars that jangle and twang in equal measure. The album opens with the surf-bluegrass rush of ""Northumberland West"", a two-minute instrumental stuffed with more rapid-fire Ozark guitar licks than an entire mid-80s Mekons album. ""Translucent Sparrow"" is spiked with nasty fuzz guitar and a lugubrious, almost Atom Heart Mother-ish horn section, while ""Song of the Chief Musician (Part 2)"" is gentle country jangle in an ocean of reverb. ""Song of the Chief Musician"" is one of three tracks curiously given the ""Part"" distinction, though none of them share a title or much of anything else in common. Those three songs are the album's strongest moments, and as such they form a sort of backbone for the record. ""1000 Cities Falling (Part 1)"" is an arresting ballad led by fingerpicked guitars and spacey steel interjections, while ""Why Be So Curious? (Part 3)"" reflects back on the rhythmic feel of ""Northumberland West"" and offers one of the album's best vocal melodies. The beautifully placid instrumental ""The Iceberg"" and lilting acoustic two-step of ""A Good Flying Day"" nicely round out the album's midsection, but it's difficult to remember much of what comes between those songs and the album's end. ""As Much as Such"" strains to work its melody into its surroundings and feels painfully forced, while ""Only You and Your Eyes""-- which could have blossomed into a classic surf ballad-- fails to develop beyond its first few bars. Even Hitchcock's guest spot comes up short in the melody department, sounding like a castoff from an unsuccessful Egyptians session. It's a shame that the album loses momentum in its final third, because Favourite Colours is otherwise The Sadies' most fully realized statement to date. They may yet make the album they've always threatened to craft, but for now The Sadies still remain a band of seemingly great potential and slightly disappointing results.","Canadian surf/country/garage band finally finds a proper balance between their mish-mash of styles, and has our own Joe Tangari to thank for it. Possibly.

Dents and Shells,Richard Buckner,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3dec0084474cd0c0377/1:1/w_160/b1fba500.jpg,2004-10-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1000-dents-and-shells/,Merge,"If it wasn't already apparent, Richard Buckner's sixth album, Dents and Shells, drives the point home: The man is nearly immutable. With the exception of his forays into folk-rock (Since and Impasse), Buckner's evolution has been judicious and purposeful. His debut, the 1994 classic Bloomed, was a palimpsest of ornate gray graphite sketches, and on subsequent albums he's put his collar up against the wind and trudged deeper into the chilly, murky recesses of his aesthetic. Since that first album, Buckner has created increasingly more ephemeral, impressionistic gradations of tone and mood. Dents and Shells continues to explore Buckner's shadowy continent of song, a Symbolist mirror-world where bright glints of detail fleetingly flash, then submerge, cloaked in shifting fogs. Dents and Shells is Buckner in top form, using a broad brush to manifest his enigmatic poetics, hallucinatory atmospheres, and melodies that appear and evaporate like breath exhaled onto cold glass. The vanishing drone and epic percussive sweep (provided by ex-Butthole Surfer King Coffey) of ""Charmers"", and the hushed, ramshackle clatter of ""As the Waves Will Always Roll"" ably demonstrate this singer-as-condensation sensibility. While strongly rooted in classic folk, Buckner's songs are rendered pristinely strange by their smallness and smeariness-- they're vast, dim topographies described by chords that are barely there, recondite realms of visions and visitations. Buckner is the disembodied Eye roving freely within impossible spaces, cataloging impressionistic signatures through a hazy lens. But it's not all simmer and seethe: Buckner's more ponderous tunes are leavened with lovely pop ballads like ""Her"", a sturdy platform of guitar decorated with a twinkling, frugal piano from which he calls out ""to nothing, in the wake of watching her sipping wine from a camping cup on some missing night."" Superficially, Dents and Shells trods the well-worn folk paths of heartache and loss, but its lingering impression is more aligned with the elegant and darkly compelling logic of math. Most shapes found in nature have mathematical counterparts, and the shifting, complex patterns of Buckner's lyrics and guitar work peel back the surfaces to reveal the numbers underpinning everything. In this sub-world, the sky is a grid, the stars are vertices, the horizon of a distant shore is an x-axis, and the shells dotting it are the spiraling integers of the Fibonacci Sequence. On ""A Chance Counsel""-- a classically Buckner confection of gleaming chords and drawled warbling-- he sings: ""Let's hear the outline,"" and later, ""listen at a number on the door."" To hear the outlines, the fraught spaces between tangible objects or discernible thoughts, is what Buckner teaches us to do. By listening at the numbers, he upturns the precise shells of logic and reveals dents in the sand that contain the mysteries skirting the outlines of natural law. By now, Buckner is so far inside his vision that one fails to really see him-- the man sinks beneath all the swirling phantoms, the inscrutable blocks of coded image, and the eddying currents of blurry atmosphere he's summoned up around him. By the same token, one wonders if he can see out anymore. His increasingly esoteric songs suggest that the musical cocoon he's been spinning around himself for a decade deflects his sight inward again and again.

The Grind Date,De La Soul,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c513d1975652139729/1:1/w_160/9d863f6f.jpg,2004-10-07 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2208-the-grind-date/,Sanctuary,"De La Soul, hip-hop's perennial ugly ducklings, have often forsaken the genre's style du jour in favor of musical contrarianism. When N.W.A. and West Coast gangster nihilism hit the charts, the trio battled E and Cube's thuggery with flowers and hi-top fades. When Bad Boy had a chokehold on the industry, De La Soul countered with their Stakes Is High manifesto. Now, with bear-knit sweaters and white tees on fire-- and after Tommy Boy dropped the trio's Spitkickin' asses for lacking a thirst for commercialism-- Posdnuos, Trugoy, and Maceo explore The Grind Date. After 15 years, many observers wondered when their DiMaggio-like fresh streak would die. The triumvirate averages three years between albums-- stemming and refitting their dark horse costumes is hardly an overnight project-- but the results are frequently worth the wait, and The Grind Date is the group's best payoff in ages. Let's be honest: Anything Matthew Knowles (responsible for his booty-hopping progeny Beyonce and owner of De La's new home Sanctuary Union) touches, is vinyl dynamite. Moreover, any album that kicks off with Jermaine Jackson's handiwork has genius written all over it. But frequent De La collaborator Supa Dave West's opening volley only serves as the jumpoff for a producer home run derby, and De La Soul wisely allow their all-county beatmaking team (Madlib, 9th Wonder, Jay Dee, and the aforementioned Supa Dave, among others) to craft a vehicle on which the trio can again revamp their style. The third installment of the Art Official Intelligence series was envisioned as a DJ album before Tommy Boy canned it. The Grind Date inherits that project's propensity for organic production, as De La often wisely let the beats steep. On ""Verbal Clap"", Jay Dee pushes a sparse, apocalyptic swirl that lacks his trademark sound but buzzes with intensity. The ghostly keys and muted snare so effectively captivate the listener that Pos, Maceo, and Dave are willingly obscured. Even Ghostface displays a moment of weakness when he struggles to match the triumphant brass on Supa Dave West's ""He Comes"" (although Tony Sparks does manage to reclaim his stature with shoutouts to Uday and Qusay). Of course, De La delivers their lyrical goods via FreshDirect with the comfort and ease of well-seasoned veterans. The title track serves as the album's centerpiece as Pos and Dave command the mic with authority and finesse. Dave spits, ""Meat grind, street grind, whatever the beast/ I'ma take it at the horns til the pinky toe calls."" Pos and Maceo's flexibility is uncanny as they retrofit their cadences to swing tracks into coalescence. Madlib's disjointed vibes and tinkling glass on ""Shopping Bags"" blend seamlessly with Pos' stuttering memo re: the perils of gold-diggers: ""She say jump/ You scream, 'Okay, I'm reloaded!'/ Nigga, you shooting blanks."" They even manage to draw the otherwise irrelevant Carl Thomas into the den of smoothness. As Yummy croons ""I never can say goodbye"" on ""No"", De La Soul echoes the sentiment. The Grind Date brings together an unimaginable team of the underground's hottest producers and meshes their idiosyncrasies without dissidence. But more importantly, if this turns out to be the trio's final record, they'll have gone out proud, with unshakeable confidence and determination.","Ending their 15-year run on Tommy Boy, De La Soul's first Sanctuary release features an all-star lineup of underground beatmakers-- including Madlib, 9th Wonder, Jay Dee, and mainstay Supa Dave West-- expertly backing the trio's usual cagy, confident lyrics.

Discreet Music / Ambient 1: Music for Airports / Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror / Ambient 4: On Land,Brian EnoHarold Budd,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc80eb335119a49ecca2/1:1/w_160/6425dde2.jpg,2004-10-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/,EGEG,"Remember Teenage Fanclub's Bandwagonesque? In 1991, it was Spin's album of the year, besting Nirvana's Nevermind, a release that would later be hailed by the same publication as the greatest LP of the 90s. Such contradictions are a testament to the cerebral oddity that, even though stories are told forward, they're formed backward-- events, or works of art, that occur at a certain time can take on greater importance when subsequent events lend them meaning. The then-present may have deemed Bandwagonesque just as compelling as Nevermind, but the future rendered Nirvana's record far more important. This bothersome epistemological fact has led the world of academic art in the 20th century-- ever concerned with securing historical posterity-- to adopt a curious mindset. Artists have had to learn to speak a language of continuous self-analysis, regarding themselves in historical and present contexts so as to constantly reaffirm and even force their relevance within such stories. In modern art, it's been widely complained, the justification of a piece can be more important than its content. The artist learns a craft, but also a thought process that demonstrates a constant awareness of his or her continuity with the past, importance in the present, and meaning for the future-- every artist is equal parts analyst, critic, and salesperson. Brian Eno has gradually been placed-- and has placed himself-- at the beginning of a growing number of stories regarding contemporary music; needless to say, the man went to art school. His historical-analytical mindset has angered some when it's led him to make sweeping claims such as, ""I invented ambient music."" Of course, much music has both ideologically and aesthetically predated Eno's (an issue explored in Mark Pendergast's The Ambient Century). The sense in which Eno invented ambient music is that he was able to identify its parts and impact, and thus hone a thesis stated through his Ambient 1-4 series. He took a loose collection of artistic impressions that were somehow related and defined their connection and import, creating-- as John Dewey's Art as Experience would've called it-- a unified, qualitative aesthetic experience. He ""discovered"" ambient music in the same way that most countries have been ""discovered""-- when a Westerner finds it, names it, and gives it borders. His works are breathtaking, but the polemics that accompany them are of equal parts accomplishment and influence. Eno's ambient ideal was formed in 1975 during months of lying in a hospital bed recovering from a car accident, forced to listen to too-quiet 18th century harp music that his body cast prevented him from turning up. This alerted him to the way that recorded sound can effectively merge with the environment in which it's played, appealing to ""many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular."" He aimed to create a cocoon for thought and reflection through a music that could be used with utilitarian purpose. He has described the process as a painter taking the human figure out of a landscape. In music, this figure took the form of his own voice, a cohesive melody, and other evidence of human intervention-- by eliminating these, he created a sense of space where there was once an object. Brian Eno's affinity with composer John Cage is strong, in both their shared conception of environment as music and use of chance operations to illustrate this effect. The difference is that John Cage saw even musical basics like tonality and harmony-- the things that lend music emotional content-- as subject to his own theoretical rigidity, making some of his work ultimately uninviting to an average listener. But Eno's ambient works subvert themselves to the standards of musical beauty even in the farthest absence of humanity. Thus, in the same way that the most nihilistic of literary resolutions can somehow offer transcendence of meaning if the writing is beautiful, the ambient albums embody a duality of emotional distance and deep affection within that detachment. As in a dream, such music has the power to make one nostalgic for places either never visited or nonexistent. And to many modern listeners, the melancholic nostalgia in these works has become twofold; it's both inherent in the music itself, and in the now-datedness of the recording style, which evokes a world of 1970s and 80s synthesizer music. One thinks of, for example, the soundtracks to grainy science-fiction movies such as Vangelis' score to Blade Runner, or that of Dune (the theme of which Eno contributed). Eno's sound appeals today to the ideal worlds both of abstract perfection and to the media of our own younger lives. The most direct outgrowth of Eno's epiphanal experience was the Discreet Music, released in the same year as his accident; indeed, he recommended that it be played over hospital speakers to create an environment soothing to patients (it has, in fact, become a popular piece for expecting mothers). The 30-minute title track is one of the most pure realizations of Eno's original vision, a gentle immersion in slow, warm waves of sound. It's intended to be played at low volumes ""even to the extent that it frequently falls below the threshold of audibility."" The piece is an analog version of several theories that Eno would explore fully through computer software in the 90s. It's based in a sort of musical systems theory-- self-organizing works in a free-roaming environment of musical parameters predetermined by the composer. Thus, the actual execution of the music requires ""little to no intervention"" on the musician's part. Such systems create pieces that could go on forever, static in terms of musical movement yet never repeating exactly. In this case, Eno hooked his synth up to a tape delay system that allowed two melodic lines to linger and evolve with minimal input on his behalf. The result remains one of the greatest single ambient pieces that Eno has produced. The album also includes three smaller works, variations upon Johann Pachelbel's ""The Canon in D Major"" derived by applying chance procedures to the original score and performed by a group of musicians conducted by Gavin Bryars-- composer of the beautiful The Sinking of the Titanic. If the piece ""Discreet Music"" is an aural statement of what ambient sounds like, then these are the term's ideological distillations. By building swirling drones upon a staple of the classical repertoire, Eno representationally strips music of its functionality-- the classic tension and resolution of one chord moving toward the next. Pachelbel's ""Canon"", in its circle-of-fifths progression, is a textbook piece of functional harmony; Eno's deconstruction, conversely, makes any expectation of musical movement impossible. Thus, though not the most enveloping or appealing of Eno's works, these variations gently force the listener to switch fundamental modes of hearing. Eno's first official statement of larger intent came three years later with Ambient 1: Music for Airports. The dispassionate title reflects the smooth, sterile, modernist surfaces that the music evokes. Eno picked a building similar to a hospital, the location of ambient music's conception. Both hospitals and airports are centered on mechanized rituals that are simultaneously in the service of, and often numb to, basic human needs. Eno thus aimed to make a music that would ""get rid of people's nervousness."" The music comes in four sparse sections-- some of them solo piano, some synthesized voices and other tones, all altered through subtle tape manipulation. In long, disintegrating notes that echo the work of Morton Feldman, Music for Airports gives the listener nothing to hold onto, remaining as transitory as its location. In describing this album, Eno said, ""One of the things music can do is change your sense of time so you don't really mind if things slip away or alter in some way."" In Music for Airports' meeting of place and sound, Eno realizes music's capacity to unify contrasting conceptions of time. The imagery of airports implies constant movement-- passengers rushing to catch a flight, planes taking off, lines of people and conveyor belts moving forward. Yet Eno's work is composed of placid, sustained tones that connote stillness. This contrast evokes both the inherent transcendent suspension in speed and the sense of ""rushing forward"" within a warm drone, and it's why many have likened the emotional content of Eno's work to the barrage of sixteenth notes found in minimalist pieces. Though opposite in rhythmic conceits, both seem to warp one's sense of movement through space. Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror (1980) is Eno's collaboration with pianist Harold Budd, a late bloomer of a musician who became a master of playing his instrument at barely audible volumes. In the Grand Unified Story of Music, it's definitely the ambient album that most directly leads to much of the Windham Hill label's output-- a connection Eno would care to forget, as he's complained that new age mimics his aesthetic universe while divesting it of deeper meaning. Budd's placid, Satie-like melodies on reverbed piano are backed by hushed tones from Eno. The Plateaux matches Eno's other ambient albums in its moments of deep beauty, though it does little to mute the human presence. One gets the feeling that Harold Budd was after something slightly different from Eno, as his playing seems a bit busy under the concept at hand. Still, left on in the background, Plateaux is a light-filled album that accomplishes the goal of transforming its environment. It can turn any room into a place of fragile reverence, and it can offer poignancy to the most mundane of actions. Ambient 4: On Land (1982) has been cited by both Eno and many fans as his best work. It's a complete realization of several artistic aims, and of all his albums it remains the most distinctive-- there are hardly any successful imitators of its unique universe. As Discreet Music foretold the manner by which Eno would realize self-contained musical environments, On Land presages the sound of several musical elements acting independently, coinciding only by chance yet remaining cohesive. The tracks of On Land, all fairly unchanging environments in this way, seem to similarly extend infinitely past the boundaries of their beginnings and ends. Eno has talked of finding his inspiration for On Land in Ghana, when he used a microphone and headphones to hear the conflated sounds of his surrounding radius. ""The effect of this simple technological system was to cluster all the disparate sounds into one aural frame; they became music."" (For a demonstration of this effect, just walk around outside with a microphone amplified into a pair of headphones: It really is striking to hear the world flattened into two dimensions upon one's ears.) The result was an attempt to make dense ""worlds"" of sound using the same sense of disparate yet spatially connected elements. The album is both more varied than his other ambient works and more foreboding. The atmospheres in many of On Land's pieces are so dense as to leave one staring down a chasm of sound, with no visible bottom apparent. Eno used several nonmusical objects and field recordings to contribute to On Land's thick aural web, the album being a testament to Eno's use of the studio as an instrument. On Land intensifies the most subtle and indescribable of emotions, and it stands at the forefront of the transformative possibilities inherent in non-rhythmic, non-melodic music. Brian Eno's ambient works received criticism similar to minimalist music of the time. About Steve Reich, a critic once sniped that listening to his pieces was like watching waves roll upon the shore-- pretty but meaningless. About Eno, guitarist Lydia Lunch once complained that all ambient did was ""flow and weave,"" that its emotional ambiguity was oppressive and vapid. Both criticisms assumed a certain way of perceiving sound to be the only valid conceits under which to compose. But as time progresses, we find more and more artists influenced by Eno's expansion of sonic possibility, rendering earlier criticisms inherently moot. Some may find Eno's constant analysis aggrandizing, but it's that very mode of thought that allowed him to identify ""ambient"" as a coherent idea in the first place. He both verbalized and demonstrated a concept that perfectly fit its time and place, and that has visibly shifted the landscape of musical thought. For that, Eno gets to join the ranks of those who have accomplished such sea changes throughout history-- a shift in thought we often attribute to ""genius.""",,8.8,
City,Client,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e59d034d5c69bf3660/1:1/w_160/944caf34.jpg,2004-10-06 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1732-city/,Mute,"Calling in favors from younger, hipper musicians is often a clumsy grasp at cultural relevance, an attempt to open one's fanbase by embracing the kiddies' heroes and icons-- or at least their flavors of the month. On City, the newest release by those Orwellian sirens in Client (i.e. Client A and Client B), Kate Holmes (aka Client B) has called in a favor from hubby Alan McGee's clients The Libertines. Given the boys' tumultuous year, it's a blogworthy move-- there aren't many more sure-fire e-conversation starters than needle-pricks and broken crack pipes. Fortunately, it's not a bust: Barât and Doherty's garage-punk leanings nicely offset Client's chilly electro-pop soundscapes. Barât's limp Brit drawl works particularly well against the charging dance-groove in ""Pornography"". His detached vocals recall The Human League's Philip Oakey or Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan (whose former bandmate, Andy Fletcher, signed Client to his Toast Hawaii imprint), and mesh well with the impassioned rants of Client A, ex-Dubstar singer Sarah Blackwood. Doherty, though, is another story. Given very little to work with on the beat-to-death-titled ""Down to the Underground"", his ale-rough vocal coughs against a gurgling electronic beat and seems force-fed, as though there were little room left for him but the studio was already booked. Client unsurprisingly perfects their insurgent dance ministry when the boys have gone, and it's in the cool flirtation under their over-the-shoulder glances that the album leaves its mark. ""Overdrive"" is a volatile love swoon that spills across its reverberated beat like a chipped marble on uneven glass. Full of girth, dirt, and static-grime, the song tracks the dark, forlorn nature of post-bar lust, and begs you to watch as it flaunts its wares. In direct juxtaposition to ""Overdrive""'s caustic groove, ""One Day at a Time"" plays the Debbie Gibson to the former's Grace Jones. While some partners would wait for you to drown in sleep and then pick through your wallet for your gas card, Client here matronly pulls the covers up to your chin but still makes sure your toes are covered. Atop floating synths and a starry-eyed beat, its endearing charity contrasts pleasantly with City's general hedonism, giving the record a much-needed breather. Still, as the album closes with another dawn-colored stomp, you can't help but feel deja vu. Fans of Client will appreciate the more dynamic edge to City-- like the syrupy synthetic strings on ""The Chill of October""-- but those without a history with the band may write it off as another limp post-electroclash exercise. As for The Libertines... well, it's a sign that these kids are still just barely alright.","Mute Records releases the second full-length from the Orwellian named Client A and Client B, who here get a little help from Libertine A and B, Pete Doherty and Carl B?rat.

Those Who Were Hung Hang Here,Uncut,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a903c0084474cd0c0f66/1:1/w_160/a3051d98.jpg,2004-10-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8384-those-who-were-hung-hang-here/,Paper Bag,"Uncut began as a two-piece electro-punk band, but in recent years have re-fashioned themselves as the latest contenders in the post-punk revival championships. When vocalist/guitarist Ian Worang lost his techno-savant partner Jake Fairley to Cologne, he assembled a trad four-piece using friends from the Canadian music scene. As a result, Worang moved away from the computer-base of the band's origins and embraced the jagged guitars and floating withdrawal of post-punk. This refashioned quartet more than makes up for its losses on its debut, Those Who Were Hung Hang Here. Combining dieseled guitar lines with Worang's gauze-covered vocals, the band's forceful sound and savoir-faire carve nuances into a genre that by now has little room for invention. The splintered guitar lines and sang-froid drums of ""Understanding the New Violence""-- originally released as a club single in the Worang/Fairley days-- flirt with the innovation/revival dichotomy. An insurgent bassline is laid over Worang's whispered vocals, thickening the mix to murky, unfathomable depths before the song finally comes to terms with its unaligned angst and gives in to clamorous rebirth, searing itself into the album's icier moments. On ""Buried with Friends"", Worang spits sweet nothings with the detached declasse of the urban pedagogue. But this ain't your diag drunkard's diatribe: There's a quiet disgust to Worang's intellect-- he'd rather moan than shout. Against black-eyed guitars and hazy post-punk dimness, Worang's vocals encircle you as though they were piped in from an all-night cafe, and it's this Interpol-like sound that the naysayers will surely seize upon when writing them off. Unfortunately, the band's few missteps have nothing to do with their likeness to the atmospheric NYC rockers. Rather, most of the blame falls on the ideas left over from Fairley's days: Seven of this record's 11 tracks prominently display his influence, which doesn't mesh well with Uncut's revamped sound. ""Copilot"", for example, begins with wheezy synthesizers and a plodding beat, while ""A Summer Day"" sputters atop a techno twitch that could have come from a previous recording session. In these schizophrenic moments, Worang seems to be trying to both remain true to the origins of these songs and reconfigure them to work best within the dynamics of his now four-piece band. It doesn't always work, but when it does Those Who Were Hung Hang Here reminds us that it's still possible to create thrilling music on those old dog-eared vinyl copies of Closer.","Not to be confused with the Beatles-obsessed UK monthly, Uncut are Canadian post-punk revivalists trying to rectify with their electro-pop past.

Conscientious Objector,R. Stevie Moore,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c56dea9e61561daa81db/1:1/w_160/d2bf0b78.jpg,2004-10-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5609-conscientious-objector/,CDR,"R. Stevie Moore was born in Nashville, January 1952, the son of former Elvis bassist Bob Moore. Beginning in the mid-1970s, he began releasing albums and cassettes, and since has amassed more than 400 separate full-length albums. That's right: 400. So why haven't you heard this guy? First of all, other than a few scattered indie label releases, most of his material has been self-released via mail order (now via rsteviemoore.com). Early records such as 1976's Phonography and 1977's Swing and a Miss defined his aesthetic: a mixture of Anglo-powered pop, Zappa-esque instrumentals, lo-fi experimental sound design, and other music that defies categorization. Amazingly, although the nature of his music varies considerably from song to song, his albums are consistently interesting; if you like one, there's a very good chance you'll like many. Conscientious Objector was released in June, and is described by Moore as ""works in progress."" Don't let that fool you: Its songs are no less ""finished"" than hundreds of others in his canon-- they're merely waiting on a final destination (either in a different mix or another record). The sound is generally unpolished, despite the best efforts of his collaborators, but certainly not to the detriment of the experience. Fans of Daniel Johnson should find much to love about Moore's sound, but beyond that, lovers of eccentric pop-- from the school of Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks, XTC, Animal Collective, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Bob Drake-- have a goldmine in this double album. The range of music on Conscientious Objector is staggering, from Moore's ""cover"" of the 1956 exotica tune ""Monitor"" to the gentle, guitar and vocal showcase ""Take Back"" to the trippy drum 'n' bass of ""Yung & Moore Show (Theme 1)"" to the lazy alt-country of ""Social Studies Buddies"" to the hi-speed, dreamy IDM of ""Name Tag the Entertainer Take 12"" to the bizarre collaboration with Paw Tracks' Ariel Pink on ""What Else Am I Not Supposed to Do?"" to the Tom Waits-ish reading of ""Hot Cakes and Sausage"" to the breezy electro-bossa on ""Divorce Court"" to a Bell Labs text-to-speech reading of all of his song titles on ""A to Z"" to the freak-folkish lament ""Big Ben (Bridge Collapse Kills 300 Toddlers) by Spandek"" to the bizarre, hazy cover of 2 Live Crew's ""Me So Horny"" to his a cappella ""Swans"" to the synthesizer explosion of ""Judson Fountain of Wayne Wayne"". And that's just the first disc! Moore certainly gets a little help from his friends. In addition to collaborators Ariel Pink, Terry Burrows (aka Yukio Yung), and Don Campau, he also works with XTC's Andy Partridge on ""Bang You're Alive"" and former XTC guitarist Dave Gregory, who contributes two birthday-themed greetings, ""Gregorian RSM52"" and ""Gregorian KO40"" (named for Moore and his longtime partner Krys O). Furthermore, he uses vocals tracks from the Electric Six to construct ""Gabe R."" and gets assistance from Bell Labs to make minimalist vocal mantra on ""Discodiscodiscodisco""-- only to follow it up with his own monologue, ""Disco Freaks"", wherein he blames the end of the world on dance music and complains that ""you don't make me ice cubes quick enough."" Elsewhere, The Breetles' Chris Breetveld co-writes ""(My Baby's Got A) Bank Account"", a concise slice of Anglophile power-pop, and Burrows contributes to many tracks that Moore maintains will be heard in ""superior alternate"" mixes on a forthcoming album, The Yung & Moore Show. And then there's old Walt Gollender, who unknowingly contributes to the set's funniest ""pieces,"" the two-parted ""Walt Gollender's Breath"". Nevertheless, the spirit of Conscientious Objector is pure Moore. ""Schwann Catalog"" (named after the famous classical music mail-order catalog) features a backing track by Burrows but lyrics and vocals by Moore. His falsetto is deep-- not the sound of an old man trying to sound younger or softer, but a sensitive, humble one sounding knowingly vulnerable. Burrows reworks his ""I Go into Your Mind"" (originally from Moore's cult-classic 1978 LP Delicate Tension) into dreamy, trip-pop, featuring Krys O's graceful, weathered vocals. The song, like much of Moore's work, is born from a mind obviously reared on many strands of popular music, yet so attuned to its maker's idiosyncrasies as to seem detached from any song that had ever been. Even when he applies himself to relatively mundane numbers like the Beatlesque ""Down"" or the dubious doo-wop of ""Wonder Where"", the end result is less piss-take than insular diversion. And they're never less than interesting. Of course, over the course of 51 tracks there's bound to be some filler. But then, given Moore's sizable discography, one shouldn't expect anything close to a perfect track record. Ultimately, the breadth of expression and creativity is enough for me to recommend Conscientious Objector on principle alone, and since there are so many truly good songs in the lot, it becomes a simple decision. R. Stevie Moore may well be the most talented, interesting pop musician never to have released a record on a major label, and this album is as much a testament to him as any.","This eclectic 51-track, self-released 2xCD is a delightful intro to the daunting world of the highly eccentric R. Stevie Moore, who has released more than 400 records in the past 30 years.

Pockets,Karate,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6d5e6ef95969322bf0/1:1/w_160/e643922d.jpeg,2004-10-06 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4387-pockets/,Southern,"There's an old saw that goes, ""There are two kinds of people in the world..."" Vis-a-vis Karate's mixture of emo, jazz, and post-rock (a libation they've blended much more palatably than like-minded contemporaries Joan of Arc), one feels compelled to state that there are two kinds of artists in the world. The first are those who doggedly pursue their aesthetic agenda through a single lens-- like, say, essayist David Sedaris, who's written approximately one million belles-lettres about how hard (yet funny) it was to grow up gay in the South-- and the second are those who filter their unique sensibility through various lenses, like Karate bandleader Geoff Farina. Karate's music is likely energized by Farina's multifarious other projects: He's released three solo albums, played with indie pop act Secret Stars, and co-founded an artists' colony in Rhode Island. He writes about gear for Tape Op magazine, and has composed scores for films by Genet, Beckett, and Man Ray at the behest of the Italian film festival Cinemazero. This sort of artistic dilettantism helps to prevent any single endeavor from becoming stagnant-- one imagines the butcher who keeps all of his knives sharp by not overusing any single one. Even within Karate, Farina hasn't idled. Their initially unremarkable emo reached a turning point with 2000's Unsolved, which began a sequence of albums that arrayed vast guitarscapes around the technical elements of jazz and the abstruse theory of post-rock. It's a career-defining album that's at once accessible and distinctive-- a unified artistic statement that realizes their full potential. On Pockets, Karate shed their post-rock trappings entirely, sublimating emo and jazz beneath a patina of polished, intuitive 70s pop-rock. These concise songs feel effortless in a way that belies their understated technical proficiency, and are so seamlessly sequenced that the mood-- breezy and jazzy, yet dark and deliberately unfolding-- is airtight. Farina metes out sharp, oblique narratives that in his resonant and ascetically emotive voice, and Pockets attains the confluence of instinctive aural appeal, hard-won technical ability, and refined vision of which year-end lists are made. A record of such stark beauty and discreet drama could only open with a flourish, and the first quavering chord of ""With Age"" is a gloved hand drawing back a velvet curtain. It establishes a formula that flexes through many permutations of mood and color over the remainder of the album: Clean, bright guitars that swing at a peppy mid-tempo or ponderously bend and stress; melodic, fleet basslines; a wash of supple percussion; and fluid dynamic shifts interleaved with cadenced, organic guitar solos. ""Water"" is a spacious masterpiece of quietly seething atmosphere, as Farina intones, ""I want to take you to dinner but you'd rather hang out in rest stops/ Engaging in discourse better scratched into desktops,"" over minimal percussion and a liquid arpeggio. The staccato, uptempo swing of ""The State I'm In, a.k.a. Goode Buy from Cobbs Creek Park"" is a boisterous lament of working class struggles. And ""Cacophony""-- one of two songs that features supplementary guitar from Codeine's Chris Brokaw-- unfurls woozy, meandering melodies over martial drumming in a procession of grand crests and expanses of arid ambiance. By all rights, Karate-- 10 years and six albums into their career-- should be recording limp rehashes of old material by now. But the most striking thing about Pockets is how fresh and vital it sounds. Pockets is a lens through which Farina flows pure and unfettered, focused into one puissant beam. No longer the artist who dabbles, his production is enriched and amplified by the harmonization of all the false starts, fragmentary ideas, and assimilated styles that he's amassed in his pursuit of transcendence.","Serial dabbler and all-around renaissance man Geoff Farina leads Karate on mostly post-rock-free trip through the worlds of emo, jazz, and 1970s pop/rock.

In between delivering prominent major-label efforts at a roughly biennial clip, the band have got their kicks in lower-profile fringe collaborations-- most notably their millennium-capping Goodbye 20th Century, which saw them interpreting the works of a host of seminal experimental composers. It's a dubious double life that draws divisive lines-- perhaps unintentionally-- between fan and fanatic, grazer and junkie. Still, it takes a strong stomach to digest some of these asides-- even for diehards. The band hit its experimental apex (or nadir) in 2000 when they released the cavorting, bohemia-smitten NYC Ghosts & Flowers. The album was met with overwhelming disapprobation and, on their subsequent major-label efforts, SY have retreated into markedly subdued territory, producing a pair of albums-- Murray Street and Sonic Nurse-- that thrive on traditional song structures. While the results of their avant-garde endeavors have not always been successful, they've all but vouchsafed Sonic Youth's legacy as a band unafraid to take risks and abruptly change direction when needed. That said, Hidros 3 (To Patti Smith) is probably not the record many of their devotees were hoping for. Instead, it's perhaps what hardened SY fans have come to expect: Something unlike anything the band have done before, and no friendlier for it. Mats Gustafsson is a well-established reed player and improviser. He's also the incidental progenitor of the fluteophone (simply a flute played with a saxophone mouthpiece). Gustafsson made his mark as a virtuoso, but the Sweden native recently chiseled himself a niche as an upstart avant-jazz composer with his diverse and often challenging Hidros series. The sequence's third installment was performed live by Sonic Youth, guitarist Loren Connors, and a slew of accompanying musicians at an October 2000 concert, and is perhaps the young composer's boldest statement to date. Stylistically, the performance harkens back to Sonic Youth's noisome early days as rogue freelancers in no-wave icon Glenn Branca's guitar-based orchestras. Hidros 3 isn't shy about its unfettered experimentalism, stridently eschewing all semblance of time and structure. The work is more of a textural tone poem-- and a rather heavy-handed one at that-- spending most of its time in a noisy netherworld of guitars, electronics, and occasional contrabass saxophone. Its rare quiet moments offer respite and a chance to collect oneself from the jarring high-volume passages, but are often marred by Kim Gordon's equally strident vocals. Gordon plays a marginal but important role, sporadically delivering anemic beat-style diatribes that serve as a comparably abrasive accompaniment to the shrill guitar fronts. It would have been nice if she were used in a more contrary fashion, perhaps as a more congenial melodic counterweight to the anarchic instrumentals a la John Cage's use of pitch-perfect opera singing against a backdrop of found sound in his Aria with Fontana Mix. But as such, Gordon ruptures the peace one might hope to find within these helter-skelter miasmas. Even without Gordon, the terrain is rough going. The first of two installments of ""Processed Voice"" is a 12-minute slog through marshes of caterwauling electronics and stuttering guitars. After six minutes of utter chaos, a brief and unintelligible vocal loop is incorporated, providing the movement's only source of rhythmic consistency. Elsewhere, melodic clarity is equally scarce: A fleeting solo at around the 5:30 mark of the second ""Processed Voice"" is as close as this collection comes to delivering a discernible hook. In Hidros 3, nothing is sacred. These rugged compositions are uniformly loud, shapeless, and often protracted to extreme lengths. There's little ambiguity about the adroitness of the guitarists' noise making, and their deft improvising takes the album in sundry directions. This transience and variety should help revive some listeners after the album's particularly dense sections. But because of Hidros' largely improvised nature, it's difficult to judge Gustafsson's composition objectively. The recording is frustratingly irresolute and demands a great deal of input from its performers. Of course, Gustafsson couldn't have done better than enlisting one of the most innovative and established guitar bands of the past 20 years. But in doing so, he vested his creative power in non-control, making for a vital document of Sonic Youth's most outre period and an adventurous, if indeterminate, mark on his own burgeoning resume.","Sonic Youth switch back into avant mode on the third installment in Swedish reed player and improviser Mats Gustafsson's Hidros series. Ignoring most of musical tenets of time and structure, this October 2000 performance harkens back to Sonic Youth's noisome early days as rogue freelancers in no-wave icon Glenn Branca's guitar-based orchestras.

Joyful Rebellion,k-os,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3bc0084474cd0c2a3f/1:1/w_160/0c087c41.jpg,2004-10-05 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4585-joyful-rebellion/,Astralwerks,"Too many emerging hip-hop artists build their reputation by slandering the genre's contemporary trends. It's the Catch-22 of an artform built on both evolution and revolt: Each new artist is eventually put in the crosshairs by his or her followers. Toronto-based hip-hop spiritualist K-Os is no different, and on opener ""Emcee Murdah"" he reminds us that from the start. Unraveling slow spitfire rhymes against a doomsday guitar loop, K-Os complains, ""Emcees keep faking/ Hoping to make the bacon,"" insisting that ""they want the cash flow/ They steady schemin' for the #1 spot."" Age-old complaints, indeed, and with each passing year and every half-hearted attempt to reform pop music's greatest cash cow, such grievances have become one of the genre's most absurd ironies. The vanity in these pedantic holier-than-thou-isms turns what is meant to be an expression of individuality into a cheap boast. In short, it's the sort of plea for attention that's being attacked in the first place. We all know that it's easy to be the hater-- the question is whether K-Os has the chops and vision to back his boasts. As usual, the answer is no. Instead, the musical tapestry beneath K-Os' rhymes is Joyful Rebellion's greatest strength. Tracking the spiritual crossroads of hip-hop, reggae, soul, and flamenco, Joyful Rebellion stirs each of those ingredients into an album that, at the very least, deserves acclaim for blending classic and often forgotten Afro-sounds into 04's hip-hop scene. ""Man I Used to Be"" brings the lock-step beat of ""Billie Jean"" and an MJ falsetto to a Prince-figured soul jam that comes complete with velvety string loops. K-Os speeds his rhymes in time to the track's heated bursts and-- unlike on the opener, where his pace seems willfully slow-- he's steady enough to keep up with the sharp beat. Although the song's late-70s acoustic-disco strut walks a fine line between parody and ode, it's hypnotic enough to make you not bother trying to guess its intent. ""Crabbuckit"" is a New Orleans front-stoop jam bursting at the seams with stomping bass and hand claps. Against the song's heat-faded piano, K-Os' flow is as steady as the Mississippi flooding St. Louis Cathedral-- he rolls out crisp, sharp rhymes against the track's grotto rhythms. The sound of Tom Waits left to wrinkle in the shouted gales of a hurricane, the song gives the album's first third a sweltering momentum that takes a while to dissolve. Yet, dissolve it does, as what at first seems like multifaceted musicianship fades into fractured genre-hopping. ""Crucial"" never escapes its watery reggae-tinged rhythms or matches its anthemic aspirations, and ""One Blood"" is yet another song protesting the state of hip-hop. At these moments, it would be easy to write K-Os off as little more than a preachy peace troubadour. Fortunately, K-Os lulls you into allowing him the space to preach and convert on ""Hallelujah"". Working a greasy porch-front entreaty that's part culture and part Rainbow Coalition, the song is a simple paean to peace and ease. Adrift on a steady acoustic guitar and ascending strings, K-Os sings more than he rhymes, slowing himself to the leather-voiced husk of Bunny Wailer's more world-weary moments. While confronting fatigue, K-Os remolds the possibilities of the genre he's railing against. He strains himself inside the closure of a dying fire, and finally proves capable of shaping towers out of dust-black cinders.","A compelling musical tapestry backgrounds this Toronto emcee's often off-target (and occasionally holier-than-thou) slings and arrows.

Handwriting,Khonnor,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3aea9e61561daa741e/1:1/w_160/6088e4bc.jpg,2004-10-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4584-handwriting/,Type,"For a moment, try to forget that Connor Kirby-Long (aka Khonnor) is 17 years old, and that his cliched misspelling of his own first name underscores his immaturity. The Vermont native's debut album, Handwriting, sounds as if it lingers underneath a lone, orange phosphorescent streetlight in the vacant lot outside a gated, suburban community. Kirby-Long maintains a sense of poetic distance with processed-guitar symphonics that dissolve into the ether like blood rushing into freshly noise-damaged ears. While listening to the record, Fennesz immediately come to mind-- especially on the album closer, ""Tattletalent [Encore]"", whose hymnal guitar shutters seem sampled from the Austrian maestro's Live in Japan. However, Kirby-Long domesticates this otherwise raw and deeply impressionistic sound, turning it into something more lyrical, coherent, and reminiscent of shoegaze. Faithful to the shoegaze tradition, Kirby-Long's mutterings are often incomprehensible and evoke emotions that cannot be adequately described by the English vocabulary. Yet, if the digital paint was removed and the song's sketches were intact, Handwriting would be little more than conventional looped guitar melodies set to an auto-piloted, drum machine beat. In other words, the album's ""folktronic"" elements are ornaments rather than qualities that can walk on their own. But the kid still returns with Polaroids of his adolescence and sexual frustrations to tack on his bedroom corkboard and lament over-- red-eyed, backstabbing girlfriends and all. Given his age, one can understand Kirby-Long's sense of being promised the world and then realizing he is owed nothing. ""Finally convinced myself that I'm not living,"" croons the poor sod on opener ""Man from the Anthill"", on which he bathes his yearning in amniotic static and steel guitar. Kirby-Long prays that he'll stroll through the garden by Jesus' hand, but is still waiting for an answer after ""14 hours... and 61 bus stops."" He then mires the good Lord's response into a din of scrambled FM-broadcast voices, all of them speaking in tongues. ""Daylight and Delight""'s familiar indie rock guitar riff drives across a dirt road in a slight, heat-stroked daze. Kirby-Long finds shade in a vivid orchestration of ringing guitar drones and sauntering piano melodies that mold into a fine trance just before the song's unfortunate fade-out. ""Dusty"" uses the same palette: It's a sleepwalking Pavement-style ballad colored in spots by Fennesz-esque hits of static disruption and a great faded guitar that struggles as it gasps for air. Less successful are ""Megans Present"", which uneasily balances Kirby-Long's croon between a wavering female voice and a schmaltzy new age synthline, and the poorly mixed guitar warbles of ""The Stoned Night"". The album's centerpiece, ""An Ape Is Loose"", has a mournful yet optimistic guitar hook that could be looped for an hour and still sound alive. It's a pity that this glorious moment only lasts for half of the tune, and it's also an example of why Kirby-Long needs to have patience with his best ideas. And if he also opened his mouth a bit wider and dialed his vocal radio to a cleaner signal, we might even pick up some profound verses.","Blending Fennesz's impressionistic sound with folktronics, 17-year-old laptop-symphonist Connor Kirby-Long has created a head-turning debut.

In the Alleyway,Hercules,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c164ea9e61561daa7d8e/1:1/w_160/90ab3461.gif,2004-10-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3992-in-the-alleyway/,March,"Well, Smile finally arrived, so I guess this means we're just a few months away from the orchestral pop backlash. In the meantime, here's In the Alleyway, the full-length debut by New Orleans duo Hercules. Though this record shares its whirling melodies and kaleidoscopic arrangements with the rest of today's Brian Wilson adherents, its most striking aspect is its minimalism. Instead of the emulating the kitchen-sink quality of The Flaming Lips or Head of Femur, Hercules have a quiet, restrained brilliance: a ""Ruby Tuesday"" drum fill here, glissanding ""Four Seasons"" strings there, and big Bacharach tunefulness all over the damn place. Hercules are songwriting and production team Peter Baldwin and Ben Sumner, who previously played everything but the didgeridoo for local neo-psych group Bipolaroid. The pair has also recorded a Christmas record, a covers record, scored some films, and did some undisclosed work with Lullaby Baxter. Its members are instrumentalists, but Fan Modine's Gordon Zacharias provides elegant, restrained vocals on seven of In the Alleyway's 11 tracks, and his high, innocent delivery and touch of Morrissey-esque melodrama makes compelling art of their unadorned lyrics, which cover the usual indie pop touchstones: lost love, disillusionment, and all manner of bad weather. The blithely grief-stricken ""Good for You"" provides the album's lyrical high point, as Zacharias hides his tears like Smokey Robinson or the aforementioned Moz behind swooning orchestration. Much of the album leans heavily on classic mid-60s pop. Opener ""Something's Been Missing from My Life"" starts with a stab of organs so familiar you half-expect a voice chime in and say, ""I/ I love the colorful clothes she wears."" Languid acoustic guitars and squiggly electrics are often panned all the way to either side of the mix. And the strings are inevitably Spectoresque, particularly when they seize the foreground on peppy instrumental ""Let's Go Out"". Despite the 1960s fetish, Hercules are at their best when they incorporate more modern elements into their sound. For example, after bouncy Revolver-style horns leaven the simple melancholia of ""Don't Cry"", fuzzed-out shoegaze guitars arrive for an elegantly dissonant plane crash of a coda. The strings on the leisurely ""Hurricane"" may fit for teatime on a summer's day, but they sit atop both peaceful acoustic guitars and painterly feedback and swirling noise. The shoegaze influence amounts only to occasional squalls amid the album's endless summer, but it points toward an inspiring new direction for smart, orchestral pop. Quick: Enjoy it, before the snobby contrarian in the next cubicle calls you a square.","Part shoegaze and part sunny orchestral pop, this New Orleans duo's debut rides the current Smile-assisted wave of Beach Boys hysteria.

Palookaville,Fatboy Slim,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd64eb335119a49ece86/1:1/w_160/d8ae9ea1.jpg,2004-10-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3011-palookaville/,Astralwerks,"In the late 1990s, big beat seemed vital: The Chemical Brothers were giving the often-goofy sound a tinge of style, and Fatboy Slim was gatecrashing happy hours, dormitories, and the P.A. systems of sporting events with the sculpted trash energy of singles like ""The Rockafeller Skank"" and ""Praise You"". But the sound's blaring populism quickly seemed tiresome, and by the turn of the millennium its whip-crack breakbeats and whooping bottom end had been sold for scrap to Rockstar Games and street luge enthusiasts. The Brothers and the Boy, Norman Cook, survived the fire sale, returning in the 2000s with less obvious albums that recaptured some of their dance community cred. But unfortunately, many U.S. college kids were still clamoring for catchy new skanks to bump chests and wet tees to. With 2000's Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, Fatboy attempted to make trance crash with some trademark Slim fervor. But while it lessened the buffoonery, the record still ticked with guest shots (R&B; mercenary Macy Gray), and Christopher Walken danced the smirking loops of ""Weapon of Choice"" into gimmicky replay on the brains of millions. Fatboy Slim seemed stuck in the loop that made him popular in the first place. Cook's response is Palookaville, which is precision-built for a polarized and perhaps even less responsive 2004. Perhaps realizing dance music's irrelevance to Americans outside of Fat Joe joints on the broad side, and the house, techno, and IDM heads in the underground minority-- and realizing that the bombast as we knew it in the 90s still echoes in Spike TV promos and shaving cream spots with sick production values-- Cook has returned the Fatboy Slim brand to market. Here, he's backed more by rock than the burble of the 808, but Slim still loves blabbing repetition and dropping yapping vocal samples into the gobs of the dull, and this helps make Palookaville less a reformation than merely his latest and quite bland big beat manifesto. The album begins with two of its weakest tracks, ""Don't Let the Man Get You Down"" and ""Slash Dot Dash"". It's fine for ""Man"" to cut the defining phrase from the Five Man Electrical Band's ""Signs"" (""Long-haired freaky people need not apply!"") over piano breaks and wiggy percussion-- it's possibly both a rallying cry for a new age of freaks or a snide comment on censorship. But where's the rest of the song? It drifts into squiggling Fatboy Slim generica, sapping whatever power might've been left in the vocal hook. And ""Slash Dot Dash""? It's as empty as the vacuum after the dot-com bust, a tinfoil crumple of store-bought spy guitar and a vocal sample that needles three times sharper than the funk soul brother. But while Palookaville gets off to an unquestionably cauliflower-ear start, it does feature some punchy amalgams of rock and electronic elements towards its center, and some of the live instrumentation that Cook has touted as part of his new routine eventually begins to make an impression. Latyrx's Lateef busts an admittedly toned-down version of his malleable, inventive flow over the concise rhythms of ""Wonderful Night"", and also lights up the weedy canter of ""The Journey"". Damon Albarn continues his quirky collaborator streak with the tinkling, hazy ""Put It Back Together"", on which his slurring soul croon leads sunny backup singers in an oddball Caribbean lilt that's fueled by funk breaks and assorted Fatboy Slim noise that actually works. ""North West Three"" is also solid, and although most people listening to Fatboy Slim aren't hoping to conjure memories of Love Story, it could double as the theme to an autumnal love affair. Still, despite its handful of strong moments, Palookaville can't shake its widescreen, broadly accessible feel: Dance Music for Dummies, maybe? ""Song for Chesh"" feels assembled from leftover cuts and samples; ""Jin Go Lo Ba"" returns to the blatant NBA highlight film baiting of ""Slash Dot Dash"". Drop that beat and let the tomahawk dunk montage begin. And if that's not tiresome enough, Cook also taps his old pal Bootsy Collins for a shit-eating tear through Steve Miller Band's ""The Joker"" that's at least as sugary as Uncle Kracker and Dobie Gray's tepid remake of ""Drift Away"". A shizzle here or a fizzle there does not make a tired sound fresh. Palookaville avoids booming with tired, late-90s big beat fever, but it's never far away from that genre's vacancy, since it aims so squarely for the same old middle of the road.","Four years on from 2000's Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, big beat progenitor and one-time club-hit manufacturer Fatboy Slim attempts to breathe new life into a genre now more closely associated with soundtracking sporting events than packing dance floors.

Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56613d1975652138f47/1:1/w_160/b18af6ef.jpg,2004-10-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11700-abattoir-bluesthe-lyre-of-orpheus/,Anti-,"Nick Cave has made a long and bountiful career of cataloging mankind's depravities, and how greatly these deeds contrast with our declared pious objectives. But moderation has never been Cave's strength, so when he opens fire with the immoderate double barrels of Abattoir Blues and The Lyre of Orpheus, it appears that he intends to fight audacity with audacity. For the occasion, Saint Nick has again donned his Boatman's Call preacher darks. You can almost taste the brimstone puffing from his nostrils on Abattoir Blues's opener ""Get Ready for Love"", which-- in its full-throated gospel-punk regalia-- sounds like it could be the most raucous Blues Explosion track ever. This unruly blast sets the stage for The Bad Seeds' most varied and dynamic collection in years, an ironic fact considering that this is their first album since the departure of designated avant guardian Blixa Bargeld. I'm not sure when it was decided that double albums now require two titles (is this Outkast's fault?) but the record imprecisely splits its quiet half (Orpheus) from the disorderly half (Abattoir), with only a couple of strays crossing the border in each direction. Compared to previous Nick Cave efforts, its most prominent new feature is the risky inclusion of a backing gospel choir on several numbers, a maneuver so hackneyed that even U2 has largely abandoned it. But on tracks such as ""Hiding All Away"" the extra voices manage to dovetail nicely with The Bad Seeds' more theatrical, over-the-top tendencies-- only the most devoutly secular will find cause to object. Throughout his career, Cave has avoided overt political and social commentary, and on the surface, that remains the case here, with the bulk of Abattoir/Orpheus ostensibly consisting of love songs directed to God, nature, or some other nameless ""she"" or ""babe."" But it'd be pretty difficult not to notice the panicked, apocalyptic subtext that veins through tracks like ""Cannibal's Hymn"" or ""Messiah Ward"". ""Do you feel what I feel, dear?/ Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy/ These things are not good for me,"" Cave sings on ""Abattoir Blues"", a song which attempts to inject some humor into Armageddon. ""The sky is on fire, the dead are heaped across the land/ I went to bed last night and my moral code got jammed/ I woke up this morning with a Frappucino in my hand."" Elsewhere, Cave struggles to decide whether the arts should be merely an entertaining distraction for an audience or if the artist has a responsibility to direct our focus on society's ills. On ""Nature Boy"", the singer gets advice from his father after watching a gory news report: ""Don't look away now.../ In the end it is beauty/ That is going to save the world."" And on the writer's block lament ""There She Goes, My Beautiful World"", he notes the link between creativity and the ability to endure and stand witness to hardship. ""John Wilmot, penned his poetry riddled with the pox.../ St. John of the Cross did his best stuff imprisoned in a box/ And Johnny Thunders was half alive when he wrote 'Chinese Rocks'."" But Cave also creates escapist music, singing extensively of linden trees and cornflowers, red-breasted robins, and gamboling lambs. And it sure seems as though he slams the door on the notion of art saving the world on The Lyre of Orpheus's title track. In Cave's sardonic, tedious rewrite of the Greek myth, the music created by Orpheus' instrument spreads across the Earth like a murderous pestilence until God gets pissed and throws him down into hell where Eurydice threatens to shove the lyre up Orpheus' ""orifice."" (Unfortunately, this song sounds no better than it looks on paper.) It would be foolish, however, to think that you could get through a Nick Cave project this ambitious without a few clunkers. At least here Cave's missteps occur when his reach exceeds his grasp, and the songs that fail manage to do so dramatically rather than boringly. If you're able to hunker down and dodge the occasional duds, you're rewarded at the finish line with ""O Children"", a straight-faced, full chorus number that somehow overcomes every inspirational music cliche (including a lyrical references to ""Amazing Grace"") to become genuinely beautiful and stirring. It may even leave you with a brief but powerful feeling that piety may yet someday overcome depravity.","In the wake of longtime Bad Seeds member Blixa Bargeld's departure, Nick Cave issues this double album-- its halves ostensibly split between quiet and more chaotic material-- on which he further explores human nature's dichotomous penchants for piety and depravity.

Schöner Flußengel,Keith Fullerton Whitman,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa24ea9e61561daa5b51/1:1/w_160/7e6a6d1d.jpg,2004-10-04 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8662-schoner-fluengel/,Kranky,"Electronic music needs amateur ornithologists like Master Whitman. Artists who emulate the standard, escape-from-civilization allure of birdsong and then abruptly make an about-face to mimic a scrambling flock's ack-ack-acks are mavericks in any man's English. Whitman's Hrvatski guise sets that example with near-bipolar mood swings between Pollackian ""Amen"" breakbeats and guitar balladry that falls asleep at the wheel. Whitman's work under his given name also has an avian nature: Our man's processed-guitar masterwork, ""Feedback Zwei"", seems like a conversation between two sparrows bickering over a suburban stucco hut village that paved over their habitat and spared a few oaks for decoration. To truly know this man's passion, check out his close-mic recordings of birds gorging at his backyard feeder on Birdsightings-- it's edited from six hours of field work. This aesthetic is the Samson's Hair of Whitman's Schöner Flu\xDFengel, a vinyl-only album that's limited to a commercial-damning 1,000 copies. The record cover's depiction of a medieval cathedral aglow with phantasmagoric flames pays homage to the gothic pretensions of 1980s prog-metal. Yet, the music is more introspective and spiritually awake than wanky guitar solos and screaming about good times in the Lake of Fire. Schöner's skeleton was pieced together with telephone switchboard-like modular synthesizers at Harvard, where Whitman guest-lectured on electronic music. The result generally expands the kraut drone 'n' freakout element he explored on Antithesis. The album is best heard in one sitting-- its fractured tracks don't individually stand on both feet. Whitman sticks to a narrow palate of circular acoustic guitar harmonies dueling in stereo, hymnal organ timbres, soft-boiled percussion, and laser noises mulched into sawdust. Most of the seven tracks are patterned into birdsong meditation, flock violence disruption, and bewilderment before reprising the spiritual calm. In other words, it's like witnessing the world seemingly falling to pieces but feeling assured that everything would turn out okay in the end. The opener, ""Lixus Analogique"", sets that template by leashing down poltergeist-like bedsprings that echo about the house. A guitar tiptoes in and a snare-roll builds the tension into a climax of a fumigating laser-vacuum and roiling improv beats. The German compound word-abusing ""Bewusstseinserweiternd"" eases in a nasal ohm chant that blooms like ink in water with clarinet and organ drones before the squealing frequencies. That image also festers in ""Interlude"", with motorcycled analog synths that loosely recall Throbbing Gristle's ""Hamburger Lady"". ""Gravicembalo"" toys with tapped bass guitar strings that shout into the fog before a somber organ lets the twilight in and melts the cathedral down into 0s and 1s. Schöner's best moments are its few Rubix Cube-rotating, glitch grooves. That element hypnotizes like rooftop rain midway through ""El Seny La Rauxa"", before getting interrupted by... well, you know the routine. ""Weiter"" breathes deeply with that same sense of groove, but does so on a Rhodes and, in contrast, the lasers grow rather tiresome after 20 minutes. At their worst, they bequeath a savage tackiness when mixed with God's Country folk guitar tunes. ""Lixus Numerique"" suffers from this kitsch, recalling the Me Decade's televised prog/new-age performances that try to touch viewers with blue-screen graphics of streaming stars. The sight of John Lennon sighing his ""biofeedback"" with David Rosenbloom's scanner strapped to his brain on ""The Mike Douglas Show"" comes to mind. But on the whole, I have to hand it to Whitman for concocting a soundscape that grows less alien and more serene with each listen: Schöner is a beast that won't leave your bedroom months after you stop playing the music.","Kranky offers the latest outing from acclaimed drone artist Keith Fullerton Whitman, a highly limited-edition release (1,000 copies) that uses birdsong as its source material.

Codename: Dustsucker,Bark Psychosis,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a468ea9e61561daa4ed2/1:1/w_160/aab1d009.jpg,2004-10-04 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1132-codename-dustsucker/,Fire,"Too often in the (still) geeky-white-kid-dominated indie world, rhythm gets cast aside as a marginal sidekick to ambitions such as writing the perfect melody or scoring an NME-abetted college radio chart-topper. Dancepunk tried valiantly to remedy this but, in a way, only made things worse: Musicians who seemed to have little or no interest in a groove took a crash course in ESG and sought to control rhythm's basic tenets because it was the thing to do. As a result, the image of the awkward white kid sloppily banging out a rigid disco beat on a shitty drumset is now more farcical than endearing, and the fun of records like The Rapture's Echoes has been overshadowed by pale imitators. It's nice, then, that Codename: Dustsucker, built from the ground up on ""found drumming"" from ex-band member Mark Simnett and new tracks from Talk Talk's Lee Harris, thrives on and reveres rhythm rather than merely tinkering with or flat-out ignoring it. Dustsucker arrives a decade after Bark Psychosis' previous album, Hex, and the band's subsequent dissolution. That 10-year hiatus may seem slight in a year in which Brian Wilson fans were relieved of their 37-year wait for Smile but, like the former Beach Boy, Bark Psychosis deliver. And, like Hex, Dustsucker sounds utterly unique, eschewing even the broadest classification. This album is percussion-centric, and that's to say nothing of the temperance and agility of the drummers' playing. It's also an album smitten with texture, space, and silence, a seamless blend of acoustic instrumentation and electronic processing on which its piecemeal compositions generate massive momentum within predominantly slothful tempos. On ""Shapeshifting"", one can hear a constant push-and-pull between the acoustic and electronic elements, as plaintive strummed guitar nudges against a stiff drumbeat with metallic, Gamelan-like flourishes. The record is also filled with huge, billowing clouds of resonance, which occasionally inundate its tracks in a morass of sustained sounds. ""400 Winters"" lingers and lingers, drawn out by massive amounts of reverb, plenty of held notes, and an ethereal underpinning of backward-looped vibraphone. Though melancholic, the song is ultimately too hopeful to be dragged down and it's easier to bask in its hazy formlessness than moan about its lack of variation. But while ""400 Winters"" manages to stay afloat, some tracks suffer from lethargy. ""Inqb8tr"" is opulently adorned in multiple layers of effects and textures, but is too congested to endure its eight-minute runtime. But even when Dustsucker's songwriting falters, the percussion is distinct, lending direction to the record's stacked orchestration. ""Reserve Shot Gunman"" emerges from directionless darkness with a propulsive, vaguely Latin groove. A mercurial bassline gradually annexes notes until finding a melody that, in lieu of vocals, provides the track both a face and a backbone. ""From What Is Said to When It's Read"" incorporates huge, tympanic tom sounds as a kind of melodic element, while ""Shapeshifting"" rides an unflinching vamp through a two-minute coda that features no melody, only noisome sound effects and drums. Dustsucker may be languorous and dense enough to put off those who are on edge, but even when the album grinds to a halt under its excessive weight the scenery is beatific. And what the songs lack in structural certainty or melodic eloquence they usually make up for in the remarkable depth and vibrancy of their textures. Considering the band's 10-year layoff, it's a somewhat understated return-- and one painted in broad strokes. But the album's unerring intimacy implores closer looks. In 2004, the fact that this record exists at all is significant, and fans of Hex should find plenty to like under its moody lightning.","Long-awaited follow-up to 1994's critical smash Hex finds the band in remarkable form, again drawing comparisons to former contemporaries Talk Talk and The Durutti Column.

This Week,Jean Grae,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf845e6ef959693233ed/1:1/w_160/81f06a1c.jpg,2004-10-04 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3540-this-week/,Babygrande,"Jean Grae is the model of a post-modern emcee: She's the South African daughter of jazz professionals, was a classmate of Mos Def at La Guardia School of the Arts, and is a diehard fan of both Big Audio Dynamite and The Clash. And not only is she truly unique, she exudes a paranoiac attachment to iconoclasm that pushes her individuality on each dynamite verse. On ""A-Alike"", Grae boasts her dexterity: ""A poet two steps ahead like Noah just left/ Mo' and sex? Holdin' Techs/ No, I'm not what you expect/ Golden pen exposing men false like a fallen disciple/ All in the Bible/ The cause is the calling haiku."" This Week brims with such crafty phrases while at the same time capitalizing on Grae's flair for merging commentary and rhythm. On This Week, Grae enters the booth with both pistols loaded: ""Critically acclaimed and shot down since attack/ I took all the criticism, loaded it up and shot back,"" she tells her detractors in the album's intro. From there on out, Grae's marks are timely. With the number of hip-hop-kitten-cum-R&B-sidekicks; on the rise, Grae's critique of their oversexed role in hip-hop is scathing without seeming Puritanical. ""Baby, bet you know they not like/ And anyway you know it's know easy/ To come across a girl like me,"" Grae purrs on ""Not Like Me"" as she lays out a plan for romantic fruition that doesn't involve Lil' Jon spraying her with a Super Soaker. On her skit ""Before the Spot"", Grae paints the hoards of fake-id-toting teenage girls with the brush of immaturity, referring to them as juveniles drunkenly extolling some men's claims of sexual dominance. But despite her liberating content, Grae doesn't fear the bounce. She wisely conscripts two of the hottest producers in the game-- MIDI Mafia and 9th Wonder-- who, in total, deliver three unbreakable tracks. ""You Don't Want It"" features MIDI Mafia's patented Atari hop, ripe with the clicks and bleeps of a stripped-down club banger. With ""buzz sicker than the hive or the flu,"" Grae laces the drops with a pop rarely found on indie releases. Meanwhile, 9th Wonder delivers two smoky cuts-- most notably, ""Fyre Blazer"", which sways with woo's and ahh's while 9th's muddled backbeat and spotty keys add his trademark veneer. Yet, while no track dips below the quality line, the album lacks thematic fluidity and spark. The excellent ""P.S."" seems detached from the rest of the record, as does Jean's schizophrenic rant on ""Going Crazy"". Nonetheless, This Week is an effective sophomore album and would serve as a moving introduction to one of hip-hop's most promising rappers.","Second full-length from underground hip-hop's most deadly female emcee boasts production work from MIDI Mafia and 9th Wonder.

Power,Q and Not U,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1cf9d034d5c69bf2a44/1:1/w_160/1c088161.jpg,2004-10-04 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6628-power/,Dischord,"They're not a pity case, but Q & Not U have definitely had their share of shake-ups. First, bassist Matt Borlik petered out shortly after 2000's debut No Kill No Beep Beep, forcing D.C.'s great new punk band into an infinitely more limited guitar/guitar/drum configuration. As it happens, the Chinese character for ""crisis"" means both ""danger"" and ""opportunity,"" and Q & Not U strong-armed this potential setback into a chance for growth. Guitarist/frontmen Chris Richards and Harris Klahr re-centered the band's dynamics, keeping the strings high and shooting the vocals up into the falsetto range, drummer John Davis traded brute Dischord energy for smaller, cleaner fills, and by 2002's sophomore follow-up Different Damage, Q & Not U relied more noticeably on melody to foot the bill for their high-octane rock numbers. In Spring 2003, Davis hurt his right foot-- his kickdrum foot-- playing hockey. So Q & Not U essentially lost what remained of their rhythm section, and were forced to cancel the remainder of their tour while Davis recovered. Fortunately, drummers tend to tough it out when shit goes horribly wrong (e.g. Rick Allen's missing arm or Keith Moon's broken body), and Davis took up the task of adapting his playing style to sidestep his critical injury. He healed enough to command the pointedly drum-heavy X-Polynation EP in late 2003, but a year later, something stuck from his days with his kick in a cast. On Power, Davis lays way back in the cut, keeping the math-rock runs to single digits and on some tracks sitting out entirely. So the ""new"" Q & Not U hardly sounds like a baby Fugazi-- they've different-damaged Different Damage, trading up its last few yelps for some supremely delicate melodies and dangerously nude a cappella falsetto. Power is, to say the least, hardly the collection of hard rockers that No Kill and Different Damage were. But with its lilt melodies, Davis' downplayed role, and the band's admission that, hey, a bassline here or there couldn't hurt, Power boasts a cohesion and distinct identity missing from Q & Not U's two previous albums. Like ""Soft Pyramids"" does for Different Damage, ""Wonderful People"" lays out the extent of Q & Not U's new musical agenda. Melodies will keep their color, drums will switch the TI-83 herky-jerks with sliderule austere, and fat synthesized basslines will slink under chicken-scratch guitars and brilliant hooks (""Water softly running, running"" is an early highlight). Richards and Klahr's pasty-funk falsetto keeps the song fun and buoyant, and the extra room in the mix lets the band's straight-ahead thump blight the bright lights. Perhaps Q & Not U rely on the falsetto a little too heavily on Power but the squeaks are never purely decorative. The band has written some vocal lines here that sound straight out of church hymnals and medieval palace song books-- they're uncompromisingly childlike at times-- and the tension birthed from grown men singing beyond their range grants the tunes a new and compelling lease. ""Collect the Diamonds"" struggles at first (the line, ""This could be serious/ It could be so deadly, deadly serious,"" makes me vomit), but then settles into the album's best call-and-response chorus. ""Throw Back Your Head"" is wholly successful, with wood flutes and an octaved melody filling out the song's space, while ""District Night Prayer"" opts for three parts and packs a kitschy spookout similar to Vince Guaraldi's ""Christmas Time Is Here"". Which is not to say that Power is a strictly regal affair; Q & Not U manages to nice up the dance here, too. ""Beautiful Beats"" morphs into a drum machine romp with huge synths, catcalls, and guitar clicks pinched from Archie Bell & The Drells' ""Tighten Up"". ""Wet Work"" fronts an edgy guitar lead that's undermined by Davis' snare clicks and a silly synthbass squelch. At its end, the song breaks down with a soulful snare-on-one homage to Sly & The Family Stone's ""Dance to the Music"", skipping the dance-punk tropes and heading straight into cold-blooded funk. Power proves Q & Not U's malleability, but perhaps just as importantly, assures they're still capable of that Dischord rock energy that defined their debut: No crowd would ever let Q & Not U finish a show without playing ""A Line in the Sand"". The album's closing suite (the rabid ""X-Polynation"", the tattered space-laser funk on ""Book Of Flags"", and the mercilessly monochrome ""Tag-Tag"") stands as a monument to the band's homegrown post-punk predisposition. Q & Not U is increasingly supple on Power, but hardly nomadic.","Third full-length from these Dischord post-punks has them trying on a more disco flavor (replete with strained falsettos), and finally realizing a distinct identity seperate from the Fugazi emulation of previous outings.

Around the Sun,R.E.M.,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a252b1335d7bf1698486/1:1/w_160/8a7d380a.jpg,2004-10-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6752-around-the-sun/,Warner Bros.,"After the surprise departure of drummer Bill Berry, the remaining members of R.E.M. found themselves unmoored and adrift both professionally and musically. They had always presented R.E.M. as a cohesive, democratic whole, with all four members receiving equal songwriting credit. Despite their one-time vow not to move forward as anything but a quartet, Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Michael Stipe stuck it out after Berry left. Some fans considered this to be an unfortunate decision, but the remaining members seemed to view it as an opportunity to redefine their sound. R.E.M.'s first post-Berry album, 1998's Up, picked up not where its predecessor, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, left off, but where Radiohead's OK Computer did, with the trio taking a touristic trip into synths, programmed beats, and sound effects, and quoting Pet Sounds almost verbatim on ""At My Most Beautiful"". It sounded like a transitional record, but then so did the follow-up, Reveal. On their third post-Berry album, Around the Sun, Buck, Mills, and Stipe have settled on an uneasy mixture of textureless production and tentative stabs at past glory. On lead track and first single, ""Leaving New York"", Stipe harmonizes with himself in a low voice that could have been sampled from Reckoning. ""Final Straw"" borrows its whirling organ from Out of Time's ""Low"", and Q-Tip's cameo on ""The Outsider"" recalls KRS-One's appearance on ""Radio Song"". Around the Sun sounds more straightforward than its two predecessors, however none of the instruments-- including Stipe's voice-- sound live or organic. Instead, they have a sparkling sheen, which has never been the best trait for either Stipe's vocals or Buck's usually piercing guitar. Concurrent with the band's move away from its rootsy jangle was a trend in Stipe's songwriting toward the blandly declarative, which began with ""Everybody Hurts"". Each subsequent album has contained more and more full-sentence song titles-- ""You're in the Air"", ""I've Been High"", ""She Just Wants to Be"", ""I'll Take the Rain"", etc. This tendency seems foreign and unexpected coming from a songwriter who in the past sounded unwilling to settle for easy answers, and who even parsed the difference between asking and telling on ""Fall on Me"". Perhaps it's impending middle age, perhaps it's the empty drum stool, or perhaps it's Stipe's role as the pop culture attache for the American political left, but his lyrics have become lazily explanatory: No longer content to question the world, Stipe seems intent on simply describing it, often in the most anodyne terms. ""It's harder to leave than to be left behind,"" he sings on ""Leaving New York"". Elsewhere, he says, ""Open up your eyes/ You're so alive"" (""Aftermath""), ""There's love at the end of the line"" (""High Speed Train""), and, ""Some things don't hold up over the course of a lifetime"" (""Worst Joke Ever""). Too often Stipe sounds like a parent passing on received wisdom to children. At worst, this tendency is grossly arrogant; at best, it's merely complacent, as if success has excused R.E.M. from searching beyond platitudes. But Around the Sun manages to overcome at least some of its shortcomings thanks to Stipe's new role as shunned lover. Having once promised he would never write a love song-- or lip-sync in a video, or carry on past 1999, or play as a trio-- he sounds very new to the form, and songs like ""Make It All OK"" and ""High Speed Train"" even sound endearingly awkward and vulnerable. Elsewhere, Stipe's love songs are more cryptic. On ""The Outsiders"", he sings about meeting someone for dinner and getting life-changing news, but he never reveals the terrible secret. ""Make It All OK""-- about recriminations between lovers-- gives Stipe his best line: He answers rejection with the taunt, ""Jesus loves me fine."" His tone is so self-serious that the song sounds bled of its humor, pathos approaching bathos. But Stipe's romantic confusion-- and the unprecedented hints at what may or may not be his personal life-- gives ""Make It All OK"" and ""Aftermath"" a prismatically emotional quality, their flaws so naked that they become strengths. It's too bad the same can't be said of Around the Sun in its entirety. Its chief problem is that every word, every note, and every instrument sounds dry, sapped of most of their personality. Whereas R.E.M. were once Southern eccentrics trying to figure things out, and making lasting music in the process, lately they sound neither Southern nor eccentric and, more to the point, their music is far from memorable.","R.E.M.'s first album since 2001's effects-heavy Reveal doesn't totally strip away their recent fondness for digital production, but manages to return them to a more natural sound. Guests include Scott McCaughey (Young Fresh Fellows), Ken Stringfellow (Posies), and Q-Tip (A Tribe Called Quest).

In the World of Him,Sally Timms,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b35e6ef9596932103c/1:1/w_160/cf8b3511.jpg,2004-10-03 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8064-in-the-world-of-him/,Touch and Go,"As a longtime member of the tireless Mekons, Sally Timms is pretty much bound by oath to mingle genres and confound expectations. It's a creed that has served her well both within the group and without it, leading to successes like the Mekons' pioneering alt-country album Fear and Whiskey and her well-received 1999 Bloodshot release Cowboy Sally's Twilight Laments for Lost Buckaroos. But it also means she's been involved in her fair share of frustrating, undigested head-scratchers, and unfortunately, In the World of Him seems destined to join their ranks. The gimmick this time around is that almost all of these nine songs are covers written by male songwriters and sung from a man's perspective. (The sole exception is the Timms original ""Little Tommy Tucker"", which is sung from the perspective of the now-grown nursery rhyme character.) Although gender-bending by now can no longer be considered a groundbreaking device, this approach on paper would nevertheless appear to be at least somewhat ripe with possibility. Even from within these masculine parameters, however, Timms has made some perplexing choices in song selection. For one, she maintains the Mekons' regrettable tradition of endlessly re-recording songs from their own back catalog. The most baffling example is yet another version of the Mekons' ""Corporal Chalkie"", a fine, ironic anti-war dirge to be sure, but one that just appeared in a virtually identical arrangement on the group's Punk Rock album earlier this year. Timms takes on Jon Langford's ""Sentimental Marching Song"" and the Mekons' ""Bomb"" also risk sounding overly familiar to her attentive fanbase, and their inclusion can't help but make In the World of Him feel rather uninventive and skimpy. Elsewhere on the album, Timms covers a tasteful but eccentric collection of songwriters that includes Mark Eitzel, Johnny Dowd, and Kevin Coyne. In the process, she abandons virtually all traces of either the Mekons' pub-punk or her previous C&W; leanings in favor of an icy minimalism rather reminiscent of Nico's The Marble Index (although Timms' crystalline vocal timbre couldn't be more different from Nico's guttural delivery). On Eitzel's ""God's Eternal Love"", Timms' angelic pipes are supported by little more than a smeary haze of electronic drone, while funhouse keyboards give Dowd's ""139 Hernalser Gurtel"" a woozy cabaret tilt. Perhaps her most effective performance, and the one where she most obviously improves upon the original, is a version of Ryan Adams' ""Fools We Are as Men"", which she sings in a beautiful, urgent hush accompanied only by acoustic guitar and accordion. The adventurous cast of songwriters Timms has selected provide the album a wide depth of lyrical flavor. It's worth noting that none of these tracks specifically address love or sex, concentrating instead on spiritual self-doubt, vulnerability, and skewering lunkheaded militaristic machismo. Though several tracks here-- particularly her rendition of Coyne's ""I'm Just a Man""-- do give the listener compelling, timely interpretations of the male psyche, one is unlikely to get a very broad or accurate view of contemporary manhood by studying the work of such iconoclastic lyricists. If In the World of Him is intended to be Timms' comprehensive portrait of modern men or what it's like to live among them, one can't help but wish she had taken a few more adventurous risks within the extensive male songbook.","Touch & Go issues the latest solo album from the Mekons' Sally Timms, a collection of covers sung from male points of view.

The Whispering Wall,The Legendary Pink Dots,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bccaabf31b7dc7155dd5/1:1/w_160/b191c0e3.jpg,2004-10-03 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4723-the-whispering-wall/,ROIR,"2003 was a strange year for Edward Ka-Spel and Phil Knight (aka the Silver Man). For the pair, it marked the first year since 1980 that their Legendary Pink Dots project hadn't released an album-- and they were coming off a year in which they'd released three. After 21 years of grinding out studio albums at a clip of nearly two a year, along with touring and all of the other things that go along with residing on the margins of popular music, I suppose they just needed a bit of a break. On the evidence provided by The Whispering Wall, that break served them well: The Whispering Wall is one of the most accessible records of their career. Of course, that just proves that everything's relative. There's more than enough Dots weirdness here to satiate fans and send just about everyone else running for the hills. The curious few remaining and wondering where to dip their toes into the band's massive catalog could certainly do worse than this-- if you like the idea of a whimsical British Einstürzende Neubauten, this is your band, and The Whispering Wall makes a suitably disconcerting companion to Neubauten's own 2004 album, Perpetuum Mobile. The arc of this album is a fair bit more minimalist than most past Dots efforts, with Edward Ka-Spel's ""r""-less invocations tiptoeing through Rorschach blots of keyboard, sputtering, pitch-black electronics and the occasional mausoleum cabaret breakdown. And yet, it all begins very aggressively with ""Soft Toy"", a pulsing nod to Van Der Graaf Generator and original-edition King Crimson beset by Niels Van Hornblower's sax outbursts and guided by Erik Drost's grit-teethed rhythm guitar. The album doesn't return to this kind of aggressive dark prog again, but it does feature a great deal more variety and consistency than the average Dots platter. ""A Distant Summer"" is a pensive, tense hymn with self-harmonized Ka-Spels (almost too) quietly intoning over an unchanging programmed beat as static washes, subcutaneous guitar and skin-tickling electronic clouds of electronic debris float by underneath. The song is a perfect example of how uncomfortable the Dots can make a song, as the tension builds and builds and builds, never to release-- it's a sort of musical adaptation of water torture, but it's intensely seductive as well. ""For Sale"" bobs on bright synths that recall a less coldly calculated Kraftwerk, while ""King of a Small World"" is quietly ferocious death jazz featuring mostly Ka-Spel backed by nothing but a walking bass and staccato organ. ""And when they least expect it, we shall take them in a blaze of glory/ See the future/ See the chalk lines,"" he deadpans, raising his voice ever so slightly in a way that underscores its chilling menace. And that reflects a lot of what's great about the Dots-- they traffic in horror and gothic darkness, but they do it with elegance, more slowly crescendoing George Romero dread than Wes Craven splatterfest. They even end the album with a moment of genuine, placid beauty in ""No Wall, No Strings"", which is nothing but a few minutes of soft drone with a slowly shifting melodic tone playing over it. In a way, that little piece of beauty and light at the album's end relieves the tension and terror of the hour that precedes it, and even if it doesn't take the band completely out of the black forest they call home, it makes The Whispering Wall one of the band's most satisfying albums.","After 21 years of grinding out studio albums at a clip of nearly two a year, experimental rockers Legendary Pink Dots needed a break. It served them well: The Whispering Wall is one of the most accessible records of their career.

Mbira Magic,Richard Crandell,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71d5e6ef95969320ecc/1:1/w_160/48761120.jpg,2004-10-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1782-mbira-magic/,Tzadik,"Tomorrow's artists-to-be, allow me to spin a cautionary yarn. I once had a friend who became addicted to downloading cracked music software. After a few months, he had literally tens of thousands of dollars worth of programs on his computer, allowing him to realize any possible musical whim. The problem was, the more options that each new program afforded him, the more difficult the thought of creating any music at all became. When surrounded by infinite possibilities, he actually produced the least musical output of his life. Here, he discovered the basic reason that musicians will almost always impose restrictions upon themselves, be it in form, genre, instrumentation, or software: Total artistic freedom is paralyzing. Tight parameters-- limitations stemming from the physical nature of an instrument, or a conscious decision of what to allow oneself-- can force a musician to focus on aspects of music usually taken for granted. 61 year-old Richard Crandell has spent his life playing with some of the world's great instrumentalists, from Leo Kottke to Taj Mahal to John Fahey; his first Tzadik release, Mbira Magic, is a testament to the ideal of liberation through restriction. The album is made entirely from a multitracked mbira (thumb piano) and occasional rhythmic accompaniment. With only a few keys, scales and tones available, Crandell's attention is turned toward rhythmic interaction, counterpoint, and impact through the addition and subtraction of melodic elements. Mbira Magic is entirely acoustic, but the album inhabits the same world of atmospherics as ambient music. Crandell's phrases swell and ebb, as though pausing to breathe. There are no effects added to his sound, but he'll often phase melodies upon each other so as to create a layer of delayed response. The first piece, ""Eleven"", is the longest on the album, as he improvises over an 11-note phrase treated in such a way for a little over 11 minutes. The following track, ""Steelhead"", is a more concise statement. Here, and elsewhere, he's accompanied by Cyro Baptista, a renowned experimental percussionist who has played with artists such as David Byrne, John Zorn, and Herbie Hancock. Baptista keeps his sounds as humble as Crandell's tones, and together they create propulsive miniatures. The mbira is naturally suited to playing the traditional circular melodies of African music, which obscure any recognizable beginning or end, and many of Crandell's tracks are built upon similarly repetitive themes. Yet while he works within scales commonly associated with other cultures, his sound defies any overt connection to world music. His shimmering patterns are more reminiscent of minimalists such as Reich, or Glass, and he applies methods and chords learned from studying fingerpicked guitar. Like lo-fi recordings from pared-down artists such as Mountain Goats or Devendra Banhart, Crandell's pieces give a palpable sense of their creation. Several tracks contain improvised sections, and the overall effect is one of sitting with him as he weaves quiet lines that float on air. Crandell achieves a wide range of impressions and moods-- the echoes from a church on ""Bells"", or the folk melody on ""Bolivian Lullaby""-- but they're all tempered by the unimposing nature of his instrument. Mbira Magic doesn't strive to be virtuosic or gripping, but allows its hypnotic melodies to quietly alter the environment around them. It's a beautiful piece of genre-less work, and a statement of maturity from an artist whose music is interesting enough to be content with but a handful of notes.","John Zorn's Tzadik label issues this 61-year-old experimentalist's cornily titled album, which he created almost exclusively using an African thumb piano called the mbira.

Audit in Progress,Hot Snakes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c125abf31b7dc7156593/1:1/w_160/6e2e9017.jpg,2004-10-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3932-audit-in-progress/,Swami,"Let it never be said that the Swami doesn't love the rock. When the turbaned one isn't disinterring forgotten gems from the lightless mines of classic punk, to reissue them with bonus tracks and modern production values, he's seeking out new bands that replicate the glory of '77 with striking fidelity and a rigid perma-sneer. Thus has it come to pass that Swami has reissued infamous San Fran garage-punks Crime twice in 2004-- first, the Crime CD San Francisco's Still Doomed, and again, in the guise of the third Hot Snakes LP of heat-seeking proto-punk, Audit in Progress. Hot Snakes is the latest chapter in a long-running partnership between John Reis and Rick Froberg, who began grinding out antic, gasoline-doused rock together in the band Pitchfork, then attained indie immortality with their math-punk band Drive Like Jehu. The duo parted ways for a while in the mid-to-late-90s, as Reis attempted to capitalize upon the temporary commercial viability of his other band, Rocket from the Crypt, and Froberg pursued his visual art, the distinctive, stylized line work that now adorns Hot Snakes CDs. Reis and Froberg reunited around the turn of the millennium, with Delta 72 drummer Jason Kourkounis providing the robust rhythmic chassis. Unexpectedly, the spirit of Jehu was revived, to the enduring elation of fans still lamenting their break-up after their seminal swan song, Yank Crime. There are numerous, comparative ways of understanding Hot Snakes-- a more concise, streamlined version of Jehu, or RFTC without the greaser sensibility and wailing saxes. But they're best discerned on their own terms: a desire to carry on the legacy of classic punk bands like Crime (roiling, distressed rock riffs) and Suicide (menacing, propulsive rhythms) with a minimum of modern revision. Reviews of familiar bands often deal predominantly with progressions, a tactic that fails to find purchase in music that seems resistant to change and intent on holding its ground. Hot Snakes have staked out their sonic territory like a lion guarding the carcass of a slain gazelle, snarling in an unassailable splay-legged stance. As such, we'll examine their scanty alterations straightaway. The most glaring is the replacement of Kourkounis by RFTC/Black Heart Procession drummer Mario Rubalcaba, and if Audit in Progress evinces a slight decline in raw power, this embryonic dynamic is the likely cause. While Rubalcaba is a proficient percussionist possessed of a distinct style, his crisper, more rigid drumming simply doesn't mesh as well with Hot Snakes' metallic doom-rock guitars and monotone shout-alongs as Kourkounis's rumbling, primal pounding did. Audit in Progress remains sufficiently fierce, but sounds a little tinny when compared to the rippling muscles of 2002's Suicide Invoice. Besides this foundational shift, Hot Snakes pick up right where they left off-- perhaps the songs are a little shorter, a bit more compressed, but are still of a piece with anything from Suicide Invoice and Automatic Midnight. The new album opens with ""Braintrust"". A rapid-fire rhythm guitar recalling Black Flag paves the way for a cyclical, trebly lead, frantic drums, and the locked groove of Gar Wood's fleet bass. Froberg takes on the role of misanthropic sloganeer or street-corner proselytizer, belting out his apocalyptic aphorisms over furiously oscillating punk rock. Like many a Hot Snakes song, it's a runaway bus that drags the listener in its wake like a loose muffler, bouncing and sparking on asphalt. The chorus manifests an immediately recognizable Hot Snakes' tactic: the relentless momentum accordion-wrecks into ominous, anthemic chords that are sustained like a held breath before the panting exhalations of the verses kick in again. Other standout tracks include ""Hi-Lites"", ""Think About Carbs"", and album closer ""Plenty for All"". ""Hi-Lites"" attains a hysterically seesawing balance, pivoting violently on the fulcrum of Froberg's hollered non-sequiturs. ""Think About Carbs"" is one of a couple tracks that break the album's hypnotic drive, forfeiting it for a starker sound: Sparse, staccato guitars allow the muted bassline to shine, and both collude to create a platform for the record's most polychromatic singing. Froberg's more variegated vocal inflections and unusual prolixity border on a hoarse, punk version of rap, and strategic phrase repetitions (""boxes boxes boxes boxes"") grace the song with a mounting urgency akin to Richard Hell's ""New Pleasure"" (""automatic automatic automatic automatic""). And ""Plenty for All"", which one would have expected to find sequenced earlier in the album for its instant appeal, kicks off with a gleaming lead cribbed from GnR's ""Sweet Child o' Mine"", harmonically twinned with chugging power chords. It's as close as Hot Snakes come to fashionable, limpid indie rock, a concession to the power of melody amid a brutal homage to scorched ozone and ruinous riffage. For those familiar with Hot Snakes' back-catalog, there are few surprises to be found on Audit in Progress, but Jehu is so beloved that fans tend to adore anything Reis and Froberg touch, as long as it doesn't stray too far from their established dynamic. Their third Hot Snakes album finds them hunkering down inside it, and should find favor with those who don't understand why such a high premium is placed on newness in rock, a genre that once consisted of barre chords and simple fury. I don't know if Aesop had any fables about snakes; if not, Reis and Froberg are writing one for him.

Real Gone,Tom Waits,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9c05e6ef95969321485/1:1/w_160/fc9bc227.jpg,2004-10-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8565-real-gone/,Anti-,"Tom Waits sings with his eyes closed, face squished tight, arms jerking, elbows popping, his entire body curled small and fetal around the microphone stand. Waits' mouth is barely open, but his ears are perked high, perfectly straight, craning skyward, stretching out: Tom Waits is channeling frequencies that the rest of us cannot hear. In a 2002 interview with GQ's Elizabeth Gilbert, Tom Waits talked forgivingly about his ears, mumbling humbly about an innate, almost inhuman sensitivity to sound. For Waits, the amplification of everyday chatter has long functioned as both a service and a liability, feeding his music and completely screwing up his life. Real Gone, like most of Tom Waits' records, is teeming with all kinds of mysterious noises: clangs and spits, faceless hollers, squawks, irrational toots, not-quite-human coughs, vicious bangs, apologetic whispers. It lurches along like a junk-heap jalopy, unsteady and unsafe, bits flying off in every direction, stopping, starting, and bouncing in pain. It hasn't always been this way. Sometime in the early 1980s, Waits stumbled past a mirror, caught a quick glimpse of his knobby mug, and was slapped with a cosmic, knee-wobbling epiphany: Tom Waits saw Billy Joel. Waits' subsequent work-- especially the raucous, circus-heavy Rain Dogs, or the glorious Swordfishtrombones-- established him as a blue-ribbon eccentric, cranking out perfect anti-ballads as an antidote to Piano Man temptations. Wife and longtime collaborator Kathleen Brennan (who co-wrote and co-produced Real Gone, along with Waits' last eleven records), has sagely proclaimed that all Tom Waits' songs can be easily slapped into one of two categories: Grim Reapers and Grand Weepers. Happily, Real Gone has its share of both-- although devious preference is, of course, purposefully paid to the former. For Real Gone, Waits ditched his trademark piano and most of his rhythm section, opting instead to cough up man-made beats like hairballs and sputter abrasive scats. Waits relishes his vocal tics and impossibly gnarled pipes, shamelessly savoring his homemade racket, building more and more momentum with each new bark. Unsurprisingly, Waits' sputters can get a bit tiring (they're certainly repetitive), but they ultimately lend his work a weird, organic immediacy, freezing it forever in time-- he could never make this record again, or at least not in the exact same way. His bursts are too spontaneous, too imperfect-- which makes Real Gone more about Tom Waits than anything or anyone else. Appropriately, Waits' fingerprints are everywhere; his blood drips from every twist and cackle, his spit soars and splatters. After a few spins of Real Gone, you almost want to wipe your face off. Lyrically, Waits still excels, beating out his peers in both absurdity and grace. Nobody howls warnings quite like Tom Waits, and the deliciously apocalyptic ""Don't Go into That Barn"" features some of his best poetic barbs, cawed as a challenge, confrontational and wicked. Waits is a storyteller in the best campfire tradition, and his cautionary fables are never without the proper exposition (""Bank since Saginaw Calinda was born/ It's been cotton, soybeans, tobacco and corn/ Behind the porticoed house/ Of a long dead farm/ They found the falling down timbers of a spooky old barn""). Waits is preoccupied with specifics, never once mewing a vague scenario or untied emotion. His songs may be tremendously bizarre, even ominous-- but they're always exceptionally real; every character has a pair of trousers to wear, a meal to chew, a task to complete. And there is always a place that Tom Waits thinks it would be best for them to avoid. Real Gone does stumble a bit, with Waits occasionally overindulging his quirks. ""Circus"", a tedious spoken word manifesto layered over muted, lazy horn wails, feels uncommonly stagnant; ""Sins of My Father"", which clocks in at 11 minutes, is unforgivably long. And opener ""Top of the Hill"" remains, somehow, both the best and worst thing you'll hear all year: Waits' grimaced beats, tangled up in themselves, shudder alongside a simple electric guitar melody and a repeated, shrugging request (""Come and get me on the ride up/ I'm only goin' to the top of the hill""). The song heaves on even when you think it should stop, growing increasingly breathless by the second, as if Waits really was lumbering uphill, begging you for a lift. And when you finally stop wincing, when you finally pull over and open the door-- you grin and you dance.","18th proper studio album from the gruff-voiced singer/songwriter serves marks a departure from 2002's Alice and Blood Money, with an emphasis on mouth-made percussion. Avant-garde guitarist Marc Ribot guests for the first time since 1999's Mule Variations, while other notable contributors include Primus' Les Claypool and Brain Manita, and Waits' son Casey.

Night on Fire,VHS or Beta,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94eea9e61561daa59f9/1:1/w_160/08327721.jpg,2004-09-30 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8458-night-on-fire/,Astralwerks,"So it's come to this. After spending their debut kicking out lengthy Daft Punk-style house jams, Louisville's VHS or BETA have moved on, like so many bands this year, to pillaging the dance-friendly template of late-80s Cure-- Night on Fire, their second outing, finds them window-dressing themselves in shades of black and purple. While the band's past is well-researched, but it smacks of microfiched headlines and yellowed Newsweeks. Their very name is a calculated allusion to the Reagan era, in the way it whimsically cites trends that those alive at the time understand as useless fads or outmoded technology that we're grateful to be rid of. Sadly, their music is everything the name implies-- a fuzzy fourth-generation bootleg of a bygone decade's pop culture trash. The title track opens with a summary of what's to come. Limp guitar lines bounce against a studio-stiffened dance beat that'll become painfully familiar by album's end (hint: there's only one.) Jerky, lock-kneed basslines bottom out beneath faux-Anglo vocals, and merge with production-added noise-squalls. As the song builds toward a unifying chorus that pleads, ""Put your hands together/ And we'll light this night/ Light this night on fire,"" the image conveyed is more of trash-can weenie roasts than the inter-city conflagration the album attempts to incite. These faceless angst-jams constitute the album's entire runtime, from the flame-out angularity of ""The Melting Moon"" to the watery dance-punk of ""No Cabaret"". When not tracking 80s legends through the velveteen eve, VHS or BETA find time to retrace their own electro-disco roots. ""Nightwaves"" adds jagged, kinetic guitar striking to their frothy beats, but it's the clean, Joe Satriani-inspired soloing that really stands out, wiping away the song's advancing tensions amidst cheesy guitar pyrotechnics. ""Forever"" is an inert, vocoded club track that adds eons to its namesake, bleating the title-phrase for almost six stale minutes atop a pungent mechanical beat. Like so much of the album, ideas are borrowed second-hand and regurgitated with a lifeless will to sustain the band, but never inspire others. Night on Fire may be enough to sustain their Astralwerks contract for one more album, but by then we'll likely be too preoccupied with more pressing dilemmas to notice.","Apparently, these former self-consciously stylized Daft Punk imitators could only afford just the one beat for their Astralwerks debut.

Every Night,Saturday Looks Good to Me,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35aea9e61561daa4c65/1:1/w_160/c74b4fd2.jpg,2004-09-30 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7003-every-night/,Polyvinyl,"Indulging imprinted nostalgia is a tricky business. It's to the credit of Fred Thomas and his army of collaborators in Saturday Looks Good to Me that they so consistently connect with a weirdly instinctual recognition of the generalized 60s music from which their own music is drawn. For the most part, their audience's perception of that music is purely indexical, informed only by second-hand documents of the era. For the same reason, my parents would never spin Every Night or All Your Summer Songs when they could flip on an oldies station or mine their LP collection instead: SLGTM are catering to a perception of the 1960s that never actually existed; they channel their own experiences into decades they've never lived, and speak to an audience who can appreciate Phil Spector references, bombastic Pet Sounds percussion, garage organ, and the kind of tambourine that once grounded a rhythm rather than embellished it, but necessarily can't experience these components with the same kind of time-warp authenticity that the music exudes. If SLGTM didn't recognize the fundamental conflict of recontextualizing a style of music for which most of their listeners have only an abstract historical context, their music would fall apart. The success of Every Night, much like All Your Summer Songs before it, is entirely dependent on its contemporary relevance in the guise of almost fetishistic devotion to 60s pop nostalgia. ""Since You Stole My Heart"", a mono-friendly girl-group love letter that smacks of the sickly sweetest trip down a boardwalk you've never been on, represents the far extreme of SLGTM's direct emulative powers. But gradually, a darker world of thrift stores, cheap cigarettes, and rum & Cokes pierces through the band's façade of straight-faced homage, hinting at something more compelling and contemporary beneath. The divide between the band's affected 90s lo-fi feel and genuine 60s recording fidelity is a delicate one, and pushing too far to either side damages the band's inspired but fragile aesthetic. Summer Songs achieved this balance nearly flawlessly, but Every Night occasionally loses its footing. A few largely acoustic tracks (particularly the heavy and oddly polished ""Dialtone"" and ""We Can't Work It Out"") fail to adequately veil Thomas' narcissistic pretense as a lyricist. Where the pop-mysticism of ""If You Ask""'s psych-lite production effectively hides the song's weighty lyrical undercurrent, the relatively hi-fi demo quality of ""Dialtone"" brings Thomas' brooding relationship with an ex-love to the forefront of the song, relegating the blithe piano and tambourine arrangement to mere set dressing. The resulting song feels overproduced and too distinctly current, and temporarily hinders the album's retro charm. Many songs, however, achieve the same heights of Summer Songs; the reverb-drenched, Spector string-heavy ""Until the World Stops Spinning"", Nuggets outtake ""Keep Walking"", and effervescent sunshine vibe of penultimate ""Lift Me Up"" are frozen in an ambiguous moment that reasonably could have been culled from any point in time between 1960-1967, with just enough contemporary lyrical context and modern vocal affectation to connect the band's musical conceits to more current influences. If the band's established sound wasn't such a direct homage, replication of a former release might be considered a major fault. However, SLGTM construct their songs from such a deceptively diverse palette that their reserve of material, though all vaguely familiar, is potentially endless. Their scope may be limited, but their wealth of source material is as broad as the subconscious vinyl fantasies of their audience.","This indie-pop collective's latest outing follows the blueprint of their previous releases-- including last year's exceptional All Your Summer Songs-- as one big love song to 60s pop nostalgia.

Painting a Burning Building,Brandon Wiard,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaa0b1335d7bf16996d0/1:1/w_160/61fd3953.jpg,2004-09-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8782-painting-a-burning-building/,Cerberus,"It's been a few years since the Elephant Six Recording Co. label appeared on an album sleeve, having been officially retired by the members of the collective and their respective bands once they decided that the concept had run its course. Looking back, it's clear that the collective only really produced a handful of truly great works, albums that managed to balance their pop sense and ambitious experimentalism perfectly, but I still miss it for that very mixture. Even when those bands failed to get everything in equilibrium, they frequently produced something of interest, and restless creativity is a sorely lacking quality in a lot of bands. Still, I think that spirit colors a lot of what litters today's indie pop landscape, from crazy pop bands like The Unicorns and oddball history rockers like The Decemberists to lone mavericks like Brandon Wiard. That's pronounced ""Wired,"" as in ""totally Wiard,"" ""Wiard for sound,"" and any number of other awful puns that will no doubt dog him until the day he dies or hangs up his guitar and keyboards. He's already got two albums under his belt, albeit albums that very few people heard. 2001's To Someone I Know and 2003's demo compendium Super Secret Double Awesome Japanese Import B-Side Collection established him as a guy who could turn a hook and craft a decent song, and Painting a Burning Building initially sounds like he's content to simply realize the potential heard on those records and make a solid indie-pop record-- opener ""Already in Amazement"" spills over with rambunctious energy, building in catchiness as the chorus approaches on rubber rhythms, plinking piano and whirring MiniMoog. The chorus itself clubs you with prime power-pop as Wiard blurts and babbled geekily about how totally enthralled he is with his latest crush. At this point, you're basically poised to take in a fairly standard power-pop record, albeit a very good one, but when you've listened to as many of these discs as I have, you sometimes find yourself hoping for a bit more than just that. The two slower songs that follow, piled as they are with harmonies, fuzzy guitars and electronics store keyboards, don't really give much of an indication that we're going anywhere different, but as the album wears on, little things creep in. A violin here, a cello there, a surprisingly complex stacked harmony, tempo changes, and pretty soon you're wondering what exactly is going on here. The album's final third answers that question by completely wiping aside any kind of basic approach in favor of a trio of epic suites stuffed with sea-shanty interludes, sound collages, ornate orchestration and slick beats. And while on the surface there's a chasm of difference between the simple, straightahead pop of ""I'll Write These Songs"", with its refrain of, ""I'll write these songs for her/ Just to see the way she moves when I sing,"" and the huge collection of voices, trumpets and strings that give way to Wiard's solo a cappella musings on shipwrecks in ""Old Heartless Sun"", it's actually set up nicely by songs like ""Permanent Smile"", which morphs from blued-eyed soul to pretty, string-laden autumnal pop and back again. But, yeah, these suites are really something-- the liners divide them into sections with separate instrumental credits, and Wiard transfers songs from earlier in the album into a sort of church choir setting. ""KMS"", by far the hardest rocking and roughest song on the album, is transformed into a maritime hymn in the middle of ""Second Story"" and a track later ""Since You've Gone Away"" comes back as a ghostly, Smile-ish thing featuring members of The Original Brothers and Sisters of Love in the choir and copious digital audio manipulation. In fact, Smile is probably the most apt comparison for these songs, as they similarly string together disparate sections into a whole that's far, far more than the sum of its parts, and massively entertaining at that. The net result is an album that similarly defies mathematical logic, offering infectious, propulsive should-be singles like ""KMS"" and the Kara Dupuy-sung ""Moving On"", churning power ballads like ""Miss Michigan"" and more than 20 minutes of total mindfuckery to cap it all off. Needless to say, this is difficult to pull off, and even skilled practitioners like those in the Elephant Six stable only manage a success like this every so often, so give Wiard his due. He could have continued to grow slowly and safely, but instead he dove in head first, and came out with a fantastic album that ought to put him on the map.","Power-pop singer/songwriter perfectly balances his accessible pop sense with an ambitious experimental streak on his second proper full-length.

Burned Mind,Wolf Eyes,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa6813d1975652139a26/1:1/w_160/4843a068.jpg,2004-09-30 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8730-burned-mind/,Sub Pop,"Music should not make you want to die. If a record ever successfully achieved such an effect, my sincere hope is that it would be summarily taken off the market and marked for burial at a nuclear waste site. But while few bands are truly capable of inducing such crisis, an unprepared listener's response to abstract, texture-based noise music, like that of Wolf Eyes, will often run something like this: ""This makes me want to kill myself."" With songs like ""Burn Your House Down"" and ""Let the Smoke Rise"", Wolf Eyes have doubtless left many craving a fistful of aspirin and a glass of water, but these Michigan noisters' brazen electro-industrial soundscapes have yet to provoke any suicides. Dauntingly abrasive, yes; spiritually violating, no: Wolf Eyes are hyperbole-inducing provocateurs whose scalding compositions never fail to get a rise out of unsuspecting bystanders. And that's part of what makes them so appealing/appalling. Which raises the inevitable cynical question: Do Wolf Eyes have any actual fans, or just the ever-fickle appreciators, grazers, and gimmick seekers? This collection has been likened to an art project, and that's an unjust charge. Burned Mind doesn't belong in a museum (where it may well garner glowing reviews), though it does answer to the trove of obnoxious descriptors typically foisted upon music of its stripe: dense, abstract, challenging, and confrontational. But more often than not, Wolf Eyes are on your side: Enlist them to kick your meek ass, and they're happy to oblige. The mesmeric, chainsaw guitar rips of ""Reaper's Gong"" are nothing if not galvanizing, while the plodding saw-synth tsunami of ""Stabbed in the Face"" is downright debilitating. Songs like this might make some want to harm themselves, but can for others offer a quick syringe of adrenaline, or provoke a meditative look inward at a dark stratum of emotions, chief among them frustration, anger, and an overwhelming sense of imminent peril. In fact, much of Burned Mind sounds as if it were scored for a late-21st century update of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where the villain is actually an indefatigable android gone haywire. The opening 45 seconds of ""Dead in a Boat"" may suggest a quieter, less volatile beast than was present on previous records like Dead Hills and Slicer, but those notions are quickly dispelled as the silence is broken by a wave of electronic squall. The introduction grows more misleading with the next track, ""Stabbed in the Face"", which features a looped female scream over a heady milieu of feedback and grating pitch-bends. One of the most uncompromisingly and mesmerically abrasive tracks in recent memory, it's easily Burned Mind's crown jewel, and a serviceable mission statement for a band who explore noise not for gimmickry or shock-value, but because that's the mode in which they express themselves best. This is by far Wolf Eyes' most visceral release to date. The masochistic appeal of stertorous noise and the comely allure of pop music are one in the same: Burned Mind, like any pop album worth its salt, conjures a deeper realm of images and moods beyond its surface qualities. Beneath the shock value of these overwhelming sonic miasmas are unambiguous aural parables about a world gone awry, and technology is held as the main culprit. Song titles like ""Dead in a Boat"", ""Urine Burn"", and ""Black Vomit"" are just façades (if not entirely inaccurate ones), indicative of the arid landscapes of human squalor and degradation stretching open behind. The rusty swingset shrieks of the interminable title track evoke images of spiritless machinery at work, as the band pummel with an admirable dearth of humanity. Superficially, there's only so much that can be said about Burned Mind that hasn't already been belabored into irrelevance and bought Wolf Eyes curt dismissals. Of course, their style is, to a degree, old news; there are manifold precedents for this breed of unrelenting stridency, dating back to Lou Reed's infamous Metal Music Machine. Throbbing Gristle took a similar stance against technology and industry in the 1970s, and their influence is certainly echoed here. If Wolf Eyes stand out from the legacy of doomsayers that includes Throbbing Gristle, Suicide, Whitehouse, and more recently Yellow Swans, it's because they're impressively, expertly abrasive. The shear inertia of these songs is sufficient to make most self-styled hardcore kids recoil in terror. Burned Mind, better than any recent album I can think of, betrays music's implied purpose of providing an enjoyable aural experience, while at the same time being psychologically compelling and richly imagistic enough to invite repeat listens.","This Michigan-based noise trio has risen to notoriety over the past few years not just as Sonic Youth's attention-getting opening act of choice, but on the strength of their wildly divisive, abrasive, and in fact, downright excruciating full-lengths. Burned Mind, the group's Sub Pop debut, is among the most visceral, caustic records you're likely to hear all year. What we're saying is, the underground has a new Merzbow.

Damage,Blues Explosion,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2413d197565213affa/1:1/w_160/fc6f0db3.gif,2004-09-30 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4295-damage-as-blues-explosion/,Sanctuary,"It could be that I've been missing the point for 10 years, but I've always taken the Blues Explosion at face value. In my estimation, their curled-lip punk-blues shtick is sharp and virile enough that, despite the mascara and wet-dog haircuts, it can't be a put-on. Spencer, like a reformed criminal rueful of his sin-soaked days with Pussy Galore, once said, ""We love music way too much to be doing it as a joke."" And the love shows up in the band's track record: moonshine ranting with R.L. Burnside, homage paid to James Brown on Orange, eight window-rattling albums. It all adds up to a band so in love with the blues they had to kill them. I guess my question is this: Are we so mired in po-mo irony that on witnessing such artistic devotion we conclude it must be a joke? Can't a guy just rock out with his cock out and mean it? I know it's not popular opinion, but after seeing the band destroy several concert stages I'm convinced they're on the level. They've consistently, diligently mined rock 'n' roll for the primal power and backdoor mojo it had when it was still the devil's music. And like the man says, they've done it with love. ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the devil's music!"" Spencer informs midway through Damage. Well, fuck. Maybe I have been wrong all this time. In its grab bag of styles, inflated instrumentation, and rogues gallery of production credits (Dan Nakamura and DJ Shadow take the boards along longtime BX cohort Steve Jordan), Damage is a far cry from the stripped-down screech that made these guys famous. In its contrast, it calls out everything the Blues Explosion once was and now isn't. Kind of like the weak-ass rhymes all over To the 5 Boroughs that made me realize how infantile the Beastie Boys' lyrics have been throughout their career (which somehow also made me love them even more), the inevitable clichés on Damage reveal the shortcomings-- and the potential-- of the entire Blues Explosion concept. Basically, that concept is a one-trick pony still kicking thanks to impetuous experimentation and an endless supply of attitude. There's a fair amount of musical talent thrown in, too, mostly in the form of demolition man Russell Simins. But Damage's heavy-handed production so overcrowds those core elements that the album ends up feeling more like a collection of Blues Explosion remixes than a regular release. Which isn't entirely bad, because some of these tunes are raging classics begging to be added to your ""Saturday Night Kickstart"" playlist. Others are pure filler. Let the downloading commence. By far the most memorable number here, ""Crunchy"" is a swaggering, midtempo boogie that actually finds Spencer singing the chorus straight. The Automator's production is flawless, nestling Judah Bauer's guitar, funhouse Wurlitzer, and a deliberately sluggish bassline next to (not on top of) each other for a polished, almost pop-rock effect. It's a sprawling surprise-- one thing the Explosion's never been is pop-- and it works better than you'd likely expect. ""Burn It Off"", the album's first single, is one of the only two songs featuring just the three-pronged Blues Explosion lineup. Like a Now I Got Worry outtake beefed up through Pro Tools (like most songs on the record are), their original fire is at full crank as Simins and Bauer shout Stooge-like backup chants behind Spencer's vocals and scuzzy guitar. Its B-side is the DJ Shadow collaboration ""Fed Up and Low Down"", a buck-wild electro-blues mashup that pivots between vintage soul and hardcore with some vinyl scratched in for color. It's another experiment that hits the mark, but sounds like it was meant for another album. As does ""Rivals"", a jazzy, horn-laced instrumental that winds through some intriguing ideas before sadly fading out after less than two minutes. But the biggest disappointment here is ""Hot Gossip"", a half-baked pseudo-protest song with Chuck D phoning in a few poorly placed come-ons. With no real rap to spit, Chuck's talents go to waste repeating Spencer's trite slogans. This one's particularly bad, but the rest of the songs (with the exception of the filtered bass drum bombast of the title track and the weird dub blues of ""Spoiled"" with Martina Topley-Bird) aren't worth mentioning because you've heard them before on previous albums. I assume Spencer meant to galvanize and revitalize his Blues Explosion by shortening the name. Seems like the Blues Explosion is trying to hold on for the long haul, and moments of Damage prove there's still some passion left seething under the leather and denim. But if they're going to keep things fresh, newfangled production will only carry them so far. Their conviction-- feigned or not-- has always been what's fueled them, and that can only come from inside.",,6.8,
Transmaniacon,RTX,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30fc0084474cd0c01bb/1:1/w_160/272f7bae.jpg,2004-09-29 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6932-transmaniacon/,Drag City,"Royal Trux's prodigal Jennifer Herrema has returned to the Drag City fold, seemingly with a plan to find some kind of redemption through music: She's dedicated her latest project-- the debut album from RTX, a new trio she's formed with guitarist Jaimo Welch and drummer Nadav Eisenman-- to her recently deceased father. For an alum of 90s sludge-rockers Royal Trux to connect to feelings this humanistic on a record is a departure in itself; Herrema and her former bandmate/husband Neil Hagerty always seemed more concerned with what came out of the body-- blood, shit, sweat, cries of pain-- than with its intangible insides. And yet, this album's title suggests transition and transformation, insanity and death... without ever clarifying exactly what's going on. Despite this, Trux aficionados and fans of Hagerty's solo work will find that Transmaniacon retains lots of the gritty, disgusting promise that attracted them to the duo in the first place. Though it seems to make a point of avoiding the stoned, lingering distortion of Trux LPs, Transmaniacon is a churning guitar album that revels in the super 70s, with brief stretches of disjointed, conceptual blare. However, it can be difficult to find a point to the record's mutton chops and bash-art stylistics. ""Joint Chief"" simply reworks Royal Trux's ""Shockwave Rider"" while simultaneously giving Monster Magnet a run for their money. ""Limozine"", too, is all riff and swagger, and no depth, with Herrema's sneering rasp filtered through piercing static as Welch unleashes a torrent of blistering fretboard solos. RTX fill this self-produced outing with filters and warbles that, while sometimes intriguing, are more often trying. On ""Heavy Gator"", Herrema's vocal is unnecessarily layered multiple times over faraway guitar and simplistic percussion, while the song's real meat-- her ""whoah-whoa's"" and muscular guitar chug-- is left to fight against the squelch. ""PB+J"" takes the effects even further, detaching into a jigsaw of digitized pitch-shifts. Somewhere amongst all these disjointed piece is a hard-rock power-ballad (of some kind), but since the song ends so quickly, we're left to wonder whether it's intended as anything more than a lazy study in rock 'n' roll regeneration. So maybe Transmaniacon is just a big eardrum buster. Its guitars are often Mountain-sized, after all, and a tour featuring people in bearskin cloaks wouldn't be out of the realm of the expected. But then, in come tracks to suggest that Herrema's album dedication does indeed point to a cathartic musical agenda: A pained wail that could be woman-made is generated from the chaos of ""Psychic Self Defense"", while closer ""Resurrect"" showcases a less-distorted Sonic Youth-meets-Aerosmith pace (and elegiac soloing) seems specifically directed towards a watcher from above. As a series of samples takes over its melody, Herrema repeats the song's plaintive vocal phrase, indicating healing or closure wrapped in throaty delivery. Transmaniacon could certainly be the start of something good. There's true songcraft in songs like the crashing, ragged ""Pulling Out Now"" or the fuzzed-out Sabbath/Fu Manchu stomp of ""Low Ass Mountain Song"", and the album's art direction-- a high-concept version of trad-metal imagery-- is truly awesome. But for now, RTX seem to be having some difficulty deciding whether to focus on boozy rock 'n' roll or noisy art projects, and this album's middle ground isn't making much headway toward a lasting impression.","Formerly one-half of 90s sludge-rockers Royal Trux, Jennifer Herrema returns to Drag City with this misleadingly named new trio.

Just Beyond the River,James YorkstonThe Athletes,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab209d034d5c69bf3f7e/1:1/w_160/9b321cd7.gif,2004-09-29 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8913-just-beyond-the-river/,Domino,"If there's a new folk movement afoot, nobody told James Yorkston-- the old one seems to suit the Scottish singer/songwriter and his backing band, The Athletes, just fine. Songs such as the delicate, dirge-like ""Banjo #2"" and the gently wistful ""Hotel"" are redolent with both leaf-covered Celtic soil and voices that echo over the moors: Anne Briggs, Nick Drake, Fairport Convention. ""The peat catches light,"" Yorkston observes, softly as ever, on the jig-like ""Shipwreckers"". Yorkston even came to prominence thanks to English folkie John Martyn, who played Moving Up Country on radio and brought the youngster on tour. Yet Yorkston isn't a traditionalist merely for tradition's sake. Like Sufjan Stevens' Seven Swans, Just Beyond the River is an artful, slow-building work-- with banjos! Whereas Stevens' latest makes Christianity safe for hipsterdom, Yorkston's record creates a bucolic, timeless world where magic remains a recent memory. What lies behind the river? For Yorkston, it's the terrifying present with its ever-shrinking family units and a lack of emotional solace casting a fraught shadow over even the most idyllic melody. Four Tet's Kieran Hebden produced the records and makes near-perfect use of Yorkston's deep voice, which sounds like sad-folkie Beck with a touch of Ray Davies lilt. The vocals lie just low enough beneath the John Fahey guitars, traditional bouzoukis, and occasional strings that it takes several listens for lyrics like, ""Look beyond my need for clamor/ My clumsy touch and Catholic roving eye,"" to unwrap themselves like the gift they are. Honest, understated songwriting makes ""Hermitage"" one of this year's most poignant breakup songs: ""Take your chances on the wide and open shores/ Pull together all your dreams and make them yours,"" Yorkston tells a lover who criticizes his coldness. The album winds to a close with ""The Snow It Melts the Soonest"", a track on which the tension between Yorkston's faerie realm and encroaching modernity finally explodes. Yorkston heroine Briggs recorded this traditional folk song a cappella, filling it with her delightfully unaffected melisma. In Yorkston's version, the tune drones, pounds, and jabbers in a language that somehow bridges the rest of the album to Hebden's work. It also leaves Yorkston's options tantalizingly open for his next album.","If there's a new folk movement afoot, nobody told Domino Records' James Yorkston-- the old one seems to suit the Scottish singer/songwriter just fine.

Trust Not Those in Whom Without Some Touch of Madness,Thalia Zedek,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab42c0084474cd0c1331/1:1/w_160/97092707.jpg,2004-09-29 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8946-trust-not-those-in-whom-without-some-touch-of-madness/,Thrill Jockey,"Taking its poetically incoherent title from an inspired fortune cookie message, Trust Not Those in Whom Without Some Touch of Madness finds Thalia Zedek once again fearlessly sifting through past mistakes and old regrets in an attempt to find some guidance for the future. In her previous work with bands like Uzi, Live Skull, and Come, and now as a solo artist, Zedek has never shied away from mining some seriously desperate emotional terrain, which may be one reason why her formidable but inhospitable body of work remains so under-appreciated. Unwary newcomers will find little to comfort them here, as Zedek returns to the same spare instrumental line-up she used on 2002's You're a Big Girl Now. Her voice has matured to a fine saw-toothed rasp, and carries with it the echoes of every hard minute through which she's lived. Violist David Curry has replaced Come's brilliant Chris Brokaw as Zedek's chief musical foil, and his spirited, evocative playing encircles these songs like a cloud of devilish smoke. (Cello, piano and pedal steel also make brief but crucial appearances in accompaniment to Zedek's voice and guitar.) Though the musicians occasionally make overt references to traditional blues, C&W;, or Appalachian folk, the proceedings here generally breathe in the same nebulous, turbulent atmosphere that has fueled groups like the Bad Seeds or The Dirty Three. Zedek has never been drawn to simple verse/chorus/verse structures, and at first glance her melodies can seem sprawling and unwieldy. After a couple careful listens, though, the ingenious latticework of songs like ""Ship"" or ""Evil Hand"" slowly unfold themselves to leave a powerful and lasting impression. Nearly every track features a series of fitful crescendos that emerge from the raging dialogues between Curry's viola, the restless drumming of Daniel Curry, and Zedek's guitar. (On top of everything else she's become quite a unique and underrated guitar stylist.) ""I don't know what memories are for/ We just go back and forth,"" Zedek sings on ""Bone"", one of several harrowing portraits of relationships caught in a repetitive cycle of destruction. Throughout the album she continues to question the value of memory, particularly if we persistently fail to heed the lessons of the past. In the song ""Virginia"" she advises, ""Don't ever look back... you'll lose everything if you do,"" and on ""Sailor"" she displays little sympathy for those who brazenly ignore the warnings they've been given: ""Do not weep for the sailor who won't prostrate before the storm/ We all knew it had been foretold there was red sky in the morn."" But still she returns again and again to explore occasions of past guilt or remorse like worrying about a loose tooth, and in so doing she draws some pretty bleak conclusions: ""It's all over now/ Whatever you've found is what you will die with."" It's not exactly uplifting stuff, and as with melancholic peers like Vic Chesnutt or Richard Buckner the relentless darkness of her material is likely to keep her relegated to the status of cult favorite. Thankfully, here she allows her guitar and Curry's viola to get the final word, sending the closing ""Hell Is in Hello"" sailing in a cathartic maelstrom of noise and feedback, hopefully purging away the demons of memory once and for all.","Thrill Jockey debut from this ex-member of Come, Live Skull, and Uzi returns to the same spare instrumental line-up she used on 2002's Matador-released You're a Big Girl Now.

Young Prayer,Panda Bear,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb49ea9e61561daa71e0/1:1/w_160/5f3df021.jpg,2004-09-29 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6141-young-prayer/,Paw Tracks,"The Beach Boys come up sometimes in discussions of Animal Collective, which would seem very strange if you caught the group on the wrong record. When they get noisy and decide to experiment, they're more Bryn Jones than Brian Wilson, but both this year's exceptional Sung Tongs and the less-heard 2003 live-in-the-woods document Campfire Songs had those familiar high-pitched and intertwined harmonies. Animal Collective's relationship to the Beach Boys is unusual, though, as they don't seem particularly inspired by Wilson's compositional sense. More than anything, Animal Collective taps directly into the thing that made the Beach Boys a 20th Century American version of sacred music. It's an approach in which voices say more with music than they ever could with words, and it's why the Beach Boys transcended their dorky lyrics as easily as Animal Collective transcend unintelligibility. Key Collective member Panda Bear (Noah Lennox) conceived Young Prayer, his first widely available solo album, in response to the death of his father, in the very house where the man passed away. Though it's Panda solo, Young Prayer is easily identifiable as an Animal Collective release in the Campfire Songs and Sung Tongs mode, and other Collective members contribute here and there. I asked Lennox once if any particular Animal Collective member was the ""pop guy,"" prone to push the band to a more tuneful and accessible direction, and he denied the existence of such a creature. Comparing Young Prayer side-by-side with the Avey Tare split EP on Leaf, however, Panda fits the profile. There are no song titles on Young Prayer, but it seems destined to be the kind of cult record, like Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Vol. II, for which listeners will make up their own. Actually, everything about it suggests cult; it's the kind of record that will have a profound impact on a small number of people, be ridiculed by a few more, and never be heard at all by almost everybody. Young Prayer is incredibly personal and naked, but it's also unique, and it will doubtless disappear and be rediscovered periodically as years pass. Though Young Prayer is extremely accessible and consists mostly of voice, guitar, and piano, the ""tunes"" are hard to source. No folk or pop music I can name is structured quite like this. In an odd way, Young Prayer seems inspired by Gregorian chant, as notes seem bent in accordance to a mysterious logic recorded in some dusty scroll. The inspiration of the mass is most prevalent on Track 7, where the deep, aquatic echo seems as if it were achieved by having Lennox sing on one end of the Sistine Chapel into a microphone posted at the other. The final track, in which Lennox sings at the bottom end of his range, sounds even more like a monk channeling a biblical precept in Latin, and augmented by two overlapping piano lines inspired by classical minimalism (the Reich homage is reminiscent of the piano line from Stereolab's ""Blue Milk""). It's hard to imagine a more lovely or appropriate closer. The arrangements are simple as can be, with the majority of the nine tracks (it's a perfectly short album at just under 30 minutes) consisting of acoustic guitar and voice, and the sequencing is superb. As the second track ends at an emotional peak with the word ""rejoice,"" the minute-long guitar and piano interlude lightly carried the listener to the next, more emotionally exhausting song. And after the fourth track, which is the most evocative of Campfire Songs of anything here, with its unsteady acoustic banging and singing that seems design to disappear quietly into the night sky, a summer camp chant-and-clap canon follows to bring us back down to earth. Where Campfire Songs was filled with odd overlapping harmonies, Young Prayer finds Lennox typically using a single track for vocals, alternating between a quavering tenor and an even more unsteady falsetto. The fearlessness of his singing here, as Lennox navigates odd runs and subjects his melodies to unusual effects, is the heart of Young Prayer. He's a good singer, no question, but fortunately, he refuses to compose within his limitations. Moments such as the tail end of the first track, when he jumps up an octave to finish the phrase ""how you will know me"" (my best guess-- the diction makes precise lyric decoding exceedingly difficult) at a point a note above his falsetto range, lends a layer of incredible poignancy. If Brian Wilson's ultimate goal was to create a ""teenage symphony to god,"" Panda Bear and the rest of Animal Collective realize that the liturgical part of that equation was most important. Lyrics may be hard to make out and budgets are far too low for symphonies, but the god part they have down, and those moments in life we get close to but can never quite explain inspire every note of Young Prayer.",,8.5,
Bloc Party EP,Bloc Party,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4655e6ef95969320877/1:1/w_160/cfc5eb45.jpg,2004-09-29 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1129-bloc-party-ep/,Dim Mak,"I'll say this for Bloc Party: They know who Bertrand Russell is. He's quoted in their online bio: ""Collective fear stimulates the herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd."" The text proper unfolds in the utilitarian language of a socialist pamphlet. References to writers like J.G. Ballard and Richard Brautigan accrue like patches on an emo kid's hoodie. These guys have read some books, and aren't afraid to say so. That said, it's surprising how little of their intellectual fodder has found its way into their discourse. If they've read Russell, they've probably read his pupil, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who would strongly disapprove of their dogmatic imprecision: In one illuminating incident, the ever-crotchety philosopher responded to a comment about the beauty of a particular tree by asking with irritation, ""What do you mean by that?"" Bloc Party thinks that the trees are beautiful and society is screwed, but it's a bit unclear what they actually mean. The dominant paradigm hardly seems subverted by lines like, ""We don't read the papers, we don't read the news/ Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled."" It's a little galling when namedrops outweigh insight in ostensibly political music, but hardly shocking. In an era when many think Che Guevara sang for Rage Against the Machine, you only have to mention the names of great thinkers to blow minds. Luckily, Bloc Party fare much better musically than they do rhetorically-- there's nothing ambiguous about their rollicking, poppy post-punk. In terms of influences, one wants to say-- you're going to groan-- Gang of Four, The Fall, and Wire. I know, you're thinking: Do we really need any more post-punk fetishists? When they're this on point, yes. The best post-punk stems from the construction of a perfectly balanced machine, where manic energy, peristaltic rhythm, crisp shifts in intensity and tempo, and heartfelt sloganeering achieve a thrumming equilibrium. Bloc Party just fucking nail these precarious dynamics on what's shaping up to be the new-wave anthem of the year, ""Banquet"", which opens and closes this EP. The rigid, crashing drums, the dueling staccato guitars, the standard-bearing vocal volleys and strategically deployed ""ah-ooh's"" add up to a textbook Gang of Four fist-pumper. The ""Banquet"" remix boils the song down to drums, bass, squirrelly embellishments and ephemeral guitar gestures, creating an expansive echo chamber for the powerful vocal track. Hell of a set of pipes on that guy. The nervy guitar spirals and call-and-response verses of ""Staying Fat"" are punctuated by Bloc Party's ace-in-the-hole: the soaring chorus, where the syncopated voices merge into towering, horizon-breaking harmonies. The cyclical, droning ""She's Hearing Voices"" was the British single, and it's a curious choice, since its churning atmosphere is the least poppy effort on the EP-- would it be asking you to swallow too much if I said it sounds like Isaac Brock jamming with TV on the Radio? Mark E. Smith might consider a plagiarism suit upon hearing ""The Marshals are Dead"", but would hopefully be too charmed by the strangely beautiful indie-prog of ""The Answer"" to follow through. Bloc Party's politics may be a bit inchoate, but in this sort of music, shouting about a ""new world order"" is a familiar trope that's ultimately more palatable than the millionth pledge of apathy in an indie-rock song. If intellectual constructs must be reduced to genre signifiers, I suppose that calls for revolution are at least more invigorating than celebrations of indifference. In an era of moral relativism and political ambivalence, you have to give it to Bloc Party for singing like they mean it, even if they don't make explicitly clear what ""it"" is.","These UK indie rockers may be catching the post-punk/new-wave revival at its tail end, but they've also written one of its most essential singles-- and this debut five-song EP suggests they may have a solid full-length in them, too.

The Beautiful Struggle,Talib Kweli,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc155e6ef95969322d77/1:1/w_160/2629fdbe.jpg,2004-09-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4550-the-beautiful-struggle/,Rawkus,"When radio stations blasted Busta Rhymes' ""Pass the Courvoisier"" nonstop back in '02, young black America's newly whetted taste for the liquor single-handedly saved France's dying brandy industry, and forged the oddest transatlantic bond since Joe Millionaire's European tryst. This year, in a repeat show of efficacy, icons like Puffy and Andre 3000 have made public appeals to fight political apathy, sparking surged interest in politics amongst the hip-hop masses, and narrowing the gap between hip-hop's cultural and political influence as the country shifts into election mode. The Beautiful Struggle revels in hip-hop's recent emergence as an iconic powerhouse while reintroducing Brooklyn native and ""three time Nobel prize winner"" Talib Kweli as one of the genre's most vocal supporters and sharpest antagonists. This duality has always been present in Kweli's catalog: His music embraces the binding value of truth as much as it documents his divergence from the methods traditionally used to uphold it. But that's one reason why The Beautiful Struggle makes such a curious addition to his oeuvre: It again challenges his unquestioned integrity in its choice of producers while re-evaluating his political poignancy for the new audiences they open him up to. For purists, anything commercial is death, and though 2002's Quality hinted that a move toward a more mainstream team of producers might not be out of the question on a future release, the sight of producers like The Neptunes, Just Blaze, and Kanye West (who appeared once on Quality before he was an unstoppable force on Top 40 radio) here could be a point of contention for Kweli's more uptight contingency. However, the fact that The Beautiful Struggle marks the return of original collaborator Hi-Tek is good news for any Kweli fan-- even if he only appears on three of the album's tracks. Meanwhile, up against harder hitting beats, Kweli plays his cards expertly: His adaptive, veteran flow serves as an unusually smart counterpoint to the glossy proclivities of his beatmakers, safeguarding him against a disaster like The Roots' Scott Storch collaboration ""Don't Say Nuthin'"". On ""Never Been in Love"", Talib's romanticism draws out a less fiery side of the typically aggressive Just Blaze. Here, behind cracking snares and wafting female intonations, Kweli lowers his political guard to wax lovely: ""Jewel of the Nile so I'm romancing the stone/ The rhythm is in the words and I watched her dance to my poems."" But even while Kweli's navigation of Big Hip-Hop's tricky terrain is impressive, he predictably doesn't make it out completely unscathed. The Beautiful Struggle's weakest cuts utilize the industry's most banal and lucrative tactic: relentless repetition. ""I Try"" shamelessly rehashes Kweli's hit ""Get By"". (Note the re-rhyme.) For this one, Kanye drags out another set of syncopated hi-hats and John Legend piano licks while Mary J's guest vocal wears thin in contrast to Simone's moans. Later, MIDI Mafia intervenes with the confusing ""We Got the Beat"", a clumsy mix of vintage Afrika Bambaataa electro and Fefe Dobson soul-pop. I can overlook the occasional embarrassing line (""You just a clone like KFC"") and even the questionable Go-Go's allusion, but the Kravitz-esque guitar solo that closes the track out is one too many strikes for this unsalvageable album low. What frustrates about The Beautiful Struggle is that its flaws are purely musical: Kweli remains the fist-raising visionary who burned ""The Manifesto"" at the Lyricist Lounge with the same fiery pen that blazed ""African Lounge"". And whether he's indicting Sierra Leone's child-mining practices on ""Going Hard"" or lamenting the lost innocence of star-struck females on ""Broken Glass"", Kweli continually re-proves his aggressive conviction and reaffirms his title as hip-hop's cerebral emcee. Even his patented Afrocentrism finds a home here: ""Black Girl Pain"" intimately details his daughter's joys and pains as she suffers her parents' separation and the trials of a black childhood. Talib's greatest challenge as a 21st century emcee, then, will be to reconcile his spiny message with the eminence of commercial slickness. Though The Beautiful Struggle falters at times, and never quite reaches the heights of Reflection Eternal, his decision to re-open doors to Hi-Tek for this record was a wise one: On the Tek-produced closing title track, Kweli's incisive commentary still captures the listener as it did on Train of Thought-- particularly as he closes out the record with the battle cry, ""The struggle is too beautiful/ I'm too strong for your slavery."" The music may be easily swallowed but the message is not.","Latest outing from this formerly underground hip-hop visionary finds him collaborating with hot-shit producers Kanye West, Just Blaze, The Neptunes, and Jazze Pha, and marks the return of DJ Hi-Tek.

It'll Be Cool,Silkworm,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4049d034d5c69bf2f79/1:1/w_160/62f4a98d.jpg,2004-09-28 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7160-itll-be-cool/,Touch and Go,"Robert DeNiro's Goodfellas character Jimmy Conway is described as being someone who roots for the bad guys in movies. The men of Silkworm, I'm guessing, ignore both the good guys and the bad guys and instead root for the extras. And if you've ever watched a movie and concentrated on the potentially complex inner lives of the nameless inhabitants who mill about behind the central action, It'll Be Cool might become your soundtrack of choice. Silkworm are like the character actors who deliver flawless supporting performances in film after film, the ones who everybody recognizes but whose faces you always have trouble placing and whose names you never remember. It'll Be Cool, produced with typical brawniness by Steve Albini, is the band's ninth album, and it's as sturdy, dependable, and wholly unconcerned with fashion as ever. But reliability only takes a band so far, and once again, Silkworm have crafted a splendid album that risks being forgotten as soon as the end credits roll. Throughout It'll Be Cool, Silkworm are able to drudge up all the emotional drama they require for their miniature narratives by investigating what would usually be considered the margins of the action. Songs are set in places like hockey penalty boxes, funeral parlors, and sinking yachts. On ""Insomnia"", they sing about Julius Caesar but it's to discuss the emperor's sleeping disorder rather than any of his more glorious or photogenic exploits. ""You are always looking past the facts/ You put your faith in the Christian undertaker/ Like he can repay your debts,"" bassist/vocalist Tim Midgett accuses on ""Xian Undertaker"", with audible disdain for those who wish to overlook the seemingly minor events that comprise the bulk of our lives. This lyrical attention to quirky detail stands in marked contrast to the broad, blunt strokes of Silkworm's instrumental attack. More than ever before, they're musically centered on Midgett's burly, economic bass and the locomotive drumming of Michael Dahlquist. The near-motorik chug of opener ""Don't Look Back"" sounds as though it could have extended for miles in any direction had the band kept the tape running. (Although they would've benefited from repeating the song title about 25 fewer times.) Riff-centric tracks like ""The Operative"" and ""Insomnia"" make judicious use of Amphetamine Reptile's back catalog-- a satisfyingly untrendy decision. Elsewhere, they incorporate luxury items such as mandolins or Matt Kadane's keyboards into the blend, although on the electronically grating ""Penalty Box"" you'll likely wish they hadn't bothered. Ultimately, It'll Be Cool succumbs to the general lack of ambition that has always been Silkworm's Achilles' heel. (""If sleeping were a battle we would meet for drills at 3:00 am,"" Midgett sings at one point.) Diehards may quietly argue about which of the band's many albums might eventually stand as their masterpiece, but it's tough to ignore the fact that since 1996's Firewater all of their movement has been lateral.","Ninth full-length from these indie rock mainstays, again produced by Steve Albini, is dependable as ever-- but dependable only goes so far.

Rhythmatism,Steve Reid,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30db1335d7bf169862d/1:1/w_160/29fa46c5.jpg,2004-09-28 05:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6930-rhythmatism/,MustevicMustevic,"During the late 1960s and early 70s, jazz innovation mirrored social upheaval by consciously turning away from tradition and embracing the avant-garde. Elaborate collectives such as the Sun Ra Arkestra, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, and Miles Davis' hard-fusion trailblazers arrived at a wholly modern big band sound through exotic song structures and the use of electric instruments. With their aggressively lyrical and non-linear soloing, John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Pharaoh Sanders eradicated the time-honored tenets of melody, harmony, and time signature, searching instead for spiritual truth within the music itself. Free jazz, ""the new thing,"" experimental-- whatever it was called, the work of these artists was impassioned, unprecedented, and divisive, pushing music into unexpected realms. Around that time-- and at the other end of the spectrum-- funk-jazz was more concerned with keeping a groove than breaking new ground. But it was far from static: Eddie Harris and Herbie Hancock used the on-the-one downbeat of James Brown and Sly Stone as the foundation for their sophisticated compositions, while Jimmy McGriff and Grant Green's warm, buttery solos dipped blues and R&B; into jazz's jelly jar. Not as challenging to the ear as free jazz, funk-jazz still hit harder than some of the fusionary misfires that followed and, 20 years later, spawned acid-jazz. Recently reissued on Soul Jazz, Steve Reid's Rhythmatism steps expertly between funky and free. ""Soul jazz"" is the perfect moniker for the album, which both reflects the exploratory soloing and marathon track lengths of the free jazz school and digs intently into hard-swinging grooves. Recorded in 1975, Rhythmatism is exactly what its title implies: an examination into the power and pliability of the beat. Reid takes the helm on drums, and the rest of his acoustic quintet-- bass, piano, sax, and trombone-- exudes a warm, earthy sound, diving into the rhythmic core of their instruments rather than taking them on unfettered flights. Reid's drums propel these tunes against their tempo, building tension through repetition and slight nuance. There are no flashy fills-- instead, he's content to add subtle color with variations in volume and pace. Album opener ""Kai"" is a masterpiece, a luscious, essential listen for anyone looking to discern the sanguine, pulsing heart of jazz music. Composer Les Walker's piano spars with Reid's hypnotic stick-and-brush work, but the drummer never flinches as the pianist hopscotches across the keys. Arthur Blythe alternates between flow and fire on alto sax while David Wertman's slippery upright bass provides a round, hearty bottom end. This 12-minute epic isn't a casual listen, but it's so fulfilling that you'll want to grant it your complete attention. ""Rocks (For Cannonball)"" is the album's most explosively abstract tune thanks to Walker's meandering keyboard hysterics. Throughout it all, however, Reid stays locked on course. His technique comes to the fore as he pounds his kit against polyrhythmic percussion-- tambourine, shakers, bells-- plied by other band members. Once again, the rhythm section of Reid and Wertman is formidable and unshakable, and throughout this track-- as well as ""C You Around""-- Blythe's minor-key sorties on alto are reminiscent of late-era Coltrane. The effect is transporting. Beginning in medias res, the criminally short ""Center of the Earth"" is the album's emotional centerpiece. It sounds as if a studio tech pressed ""record"" at the teary-eyed peak of a climactic jam. With a sudden explosion of baritone sax, trumpet, and guitar-- plus a boxful of percussion toys-- the whole song is one ecstatic, extended crescendo. Music doesn't get any more joyful than this without putting its tongue in its cheek, and that's something a soul master like Reid simply had no reason to do.","England's Soul Jazz imprint reissues one of two lost masterpieces from this obscure but brilliant 70s jazz-funk drummer.

Gold,The Fucking Am,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07aea9e61561daa4591/1:1/w_160/5741335c.jpg,2004-09-28 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3323-gold/,Drag City,"Upon its release in 2001, many indie rock policy wonks noted that ""The Fucking Am"" would've been a better moniker for a Fucking Champs/Trans Am collaboration than the trucking company-esque handle ""Trans Champs"" that graced the cover of their Double Exposure. Ever the quirky appeasers, the gentlemen of The Fucking Champs and Trans Am have united once again, this time under this improved banner. The name is not only a boon to the asterisk industry, but also tunes in to just what the new group's doing. The Champs have always been enamored of chunkheaded metal and mono 70s handlebar-rock, while Trans Am have recast decades past mostly through an ironic/robotic tonic of tape backup drives and synthesizers-- and when combined, the two groups find an unusually evenly proportioned middle ground. In other words, everyone can relax a little and stop trying to recharge intellectualism via the instrumental form. Gold gives Trans Am a chance to veer away from the shrillness of their recent work, while the Champs don't ride as high on the harmonized guitar hog. And both groups contribute to a wash of accompanying atmospherics that suggests their respective allegiances to electronically created music. Opener ""Bad Leg""'s lurching, stopping, and starting percussion feels like the doing of the Am, while its soaring guitar line is all Champs. And how about that mid-song break into buzzing Pink Floyd keyboard fluff? With two bands' worth of personnel, it's easy for The Fucking Am to fill out the metallic/melodic collagism that typifies types like Death From Above 1979 or the louder parts of Eagles of Death Metal, and ""Leg"" is a great example of this. The subsequent ""Gauntlet"" isn't as strong-- particularly its heavily treated, heavy-handed vocals make for an awfully weak pun. That said, a loop of its phase-shifting drum fill intro and strutting main riff would still keep a loft of 80s fetishists partying at right angles for an entire week. Gold's midsection again points to its casual amiability. Starting with a melody inspired by the soft-rock saccharine croon of Orleans' ""Still the One"", ""Doing Research for an Autobiography"" shambles into a series of descending ""Foreplay/Long Time"" organ solos, and has an endearingly live-recorded quality. And ""Taking Liberties"" chucks the instrumental format for a boozy, dangling cigarette backup to the chest-beating guest vocal of Jillian Iva. The Fucking Am then heightens the micro-prog arc of Double Exposure's ""First Comes Sunday Morning"" and ""Then Comes Saturday Night"", offering a three-way album-closing tribute to hazy seventies sunlight in ""Acoustico Gomez"", ""Elastico Gomez"", and ""Electrico Gomez"". The first is led by its gently plucked lead into a fog glimmering keyboards and evocative Vangelis soft focus, while ""Elastico"" is the album's drug rock cocktail, a mess of backwards guitar solos and desert heat drones. The subsequent ""Electrico"" skyrockets Gold's Me Decade muse to a feelgood pinnacle with two guitars dueling and a consistent build. It's like an ode to the art of Boris Vallejo. Subtlety can prove elusive for instrumental rockers, just as identifying them as such gets pretty redundant. Their lack of vocals somehow seems to qualify them for press that expects something very serious, or at least intellectual. From F-bombed monikers to loose-limbed referential jams, Gold lets The Fucking Champs and Trans Am get conjunctional, and focus on making music instead of upholding a concept.","Metalfist dual-guitar attackers The Fucking Champs once again team up with electro- ironists Trans Am for this new Drag City LP.

It was a two-record compilation from the mid-70s with all their hits, and for many years, was the only thing I knew about them. My sister also had a copy, so I could listen anytime I wanted. The artwork for Endless Summer featured a painted mural of big Beach Boys heads positioned in wavy jungle grass, and I spent hours looking at their grinning, bearded faces, imagining what kind of magic strangeness they were really up to behind ""I Get Around"" and ""Catch a Wave"". Later, I found a book about them, and again saw aged, beaten faces, with lots of hair, tacky, yellow pants and inappropriately overweight grown men. I hadn't even heard Pet Sounds yet, but was convinced these people were sad and interesting. And they usually smiled. Brian Wilson was the son of a songwriter. He was a naturally creative boy, though also prone to the same sunny interests and obsessions as his friends and cousins. He came of age just as thousands of other kids did at the time, learning that this place really could be the land of the free, home of love, peace, self-discovery and where everyone he cared about lived. He loved music. He still does, though at 61, despite the full mane of hair, he doesn't quite sound or write like the same boy who once scored the perfect soundtrack for an American summer. He was obsessed with George Gershwin and vanilla white harmony groups like The Four Freshman; he gave the world ""In My Room"" and Pet Sounds in return. Brian Wilson is touring Smile right now, with, they say, an unplugged keyboard and the same stiff onstage demeanor he showed during the ""Brian is back"" days. But then, performance has never been his bag. Wilson abandoned Smile, his painstakingly planned follow-up to Pet Sounds, in 1967 because he had a nervous breakdown. He was emotionally unfit to continue. He was 24, only a few years older than I was when I bought my first bootleg copy of the music. If you want to know the precise details about how he broke down, there are dozens of accounts available (including mine here at Pitchfork). The short end of it has to do with drugs, growing pains, a new cast of friends, and a dysfunctional family. Brian had too much of all those things in the mid-60s; working on what was supposed to be the greatest record ever made might not have been the most realistic endeavor. Or maybe it would have been, had he surrounded himself with more understanding people. Or fewer drugs. Or better drugs. Or been able to keep his overbearing dad out of the picture. And on and on and on, until being a fan of the guy is more exhausting than it is rewarding. I really don't blame him for staying in bed for the 70s. I first heard Smile when I compiled my own version of it. The Beach Boys' Good Vibrations box had just come out, containing the first ""officially"" sanctioned missing pieces of the album. I, like many amateur Beach Boys historians, used them, along with the best songs from the boots to make ad-hoc masterpieces. I'd read how ""Our Prayer"" was supposed to go first, and it seemed naturally to segue right into ""Heroes & Villains"". Then I had to decide which versions to use. I strung together the single mix with the ""Cantina"" version with ""Do You Like Worms"" (its cousin), using a complex system of cassette deck editing techniques-- that is, I got really good at using the ""pause"" button. I put Wilson's solo vocal and piano performance of ""Surf's Up"" last. It ended my tape on a bittersweet note, which I guessed was in the spirit of what Smile would have been. I was wrong. Sigh. A lot of us were. Darian Sahanaja was right. Wilson's wife Melinda suggested that Brian take Smile on the road, and Sahanaja, keyboardist and backing vocalist in Wilson's touring band (aka The Wondermints) took up the sizable task of organizing the project. He dumped every Smile song and song-fragment he could find onto his laptop, took them to Wilson's house and watched as Wilson proceeded to phone no less an authority than original lyricist Van Dyke Parks when he needed help remembering lyrics. They hadn't really kept in touch for a few years, but Parks was at Wilson's place within 24 hours-- and would stay for five days-- to settle past scores and finish the lost record. The trio made subtle changes to the music when necessary, and in the spring, Wilson headed to Studio One at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles to make his record. Just as he'd made the original ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes & Villains"" there, Wilson gathered his band, strings and brass to record the tracks, cutting the basic arrangements live while doing the vocals on the same tube consoles his old Beach Boys had. The end result is a great album, albeit one more lighthearted than its myth would suggest. The music I hear is like round pegs in square holes; it's just as insular and manic-compassionate as ""In My Room"" or ""God Only Knows"", but filtered through an amiable resolve. It sounds pleasant and assured, lacking the vulnerable, shy wave of hope drenching the old Beach Boys records. Yet, Wilson's voice sounds great. It's a bit lower, and his inflections have lost some subtlety over the years, but it still carries the weight of those angelic melodies (and when it can't, his band helps him out). And what of his band? The eight musicians who contributed to recording Smile with Wilson not only live up to the material, but also make possible what could not have been all those years ago. They are not the Beach Boys. There is no Carl Wilson. For better or worse, there is no Mike Love. But there is the music, and all concerned parties should be given some kind of musical amnesty award for managing to avoid the pitfalls of posthumous reworking and re-recording. This is no ghost record or bout of nostalgia. Rather than study the lonely, bittersweet passions of Wilson's youth, it celebrates the return of his muse and his gift to the world in the form of a ""teenage symphony to God."" Smile begins, as had been expected since Wilson first discussed the album in 1966, with ""Our Prayer"", combined with a short piece called ""Gee"", which is, in actuality, an overture to ""Heroes & Villains"". The choir-like group harmonies of ""Our Prayer"" are as beautiful as they had been, originally tacked onto the end of 1969's 20/20, but in this case, reveal only the tip of an incredible iceberg. ""Heroes & Villains"" begins identically to the 1967 single version, and Wilson's band tackles it with gusto. Wilson's lead vocal sounds markedly gruffer in places, though more telling is his complete lack of hesitation in the phrases. He isn't as sensitive as he used to be, but he makes up for it by nailing every complicated counterpoint line and inner harmony voice. After moving through the song's ""cantina"" section, the band segues into ""Roll Plymouth Rock"", which Smile historians will recognize under its former title, ""Do You Like Worms?"". The galloping tympani is no less a disorienting force here than it had been originally, but Parks' never-before-tracked lyrics (they are said to have been written during the sessions) suggest a clearer narrative rooted in manifest destiny: ""Once upon the Sandwich Isles, the social structure steamed upon Hawaii/ Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock roll over."" This leads to ""Barnyard"", replete with animal sounds and more new lyrics about chickens and pigpens. The short, sad take on ""You Are My Sunshine"" (coupled with ""Old Master Painter"") precedes the climax of Smile's first third, ""Cabin Essence"". This is the same version as appeared on 20/20, though in this context is euphoric where it had been unexpected before. The next section begins with ""Wonderful"", performed with harpsichord and understated orchestration (the brass, unfortunately, sounds synthesized) and Wilson's original arrangement of vocal harmonies. ""Song for Children"" emerges straight out of that, though fans will recognize it as the first section of a larger piece, ""Child Is Father of the Man"". That piece follows, and is more famous as the coda to the title track of 1971's Surf's Up album. Here, it wallows in ominous piano arpeggios and strings before introducing ""Surf's Up"", performed almost identically to Carl Wilson's 1971 production for the Beach Boys. Brian doesn't take the high harmonies on ""brother John"" anymore, but his voice is surprisingly nimble. Furthermore, Parks' lyrics, once considered too abstract by Love, now seem perfectly in accord with the surreal Americana of Smile. ""Canvas the town and brush the backdrop."" ""Carriage across the fog-two-step to lamplight cellar tune."" ""The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne."" The album ends with a suite of Wilson's most idiosyncratic music. ""I'm In Great Shape/I Wanna Be Around/Workshop"" form a kind of bizarre interlude for Smile, wherein Wilson pumps up the virtues of ""eggs and grits"" and wanting to be around when ""someone breaks your heart,"" over the strains of saws and drills. Things get odder as it flows in to ""Vegetables"", performed as a combination of the song from 1967's maligned Smiley Smile and the one heard on the Good Vibrations box. Wilson pulls out the ""Mama Says"" refrain (""Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy"") before moving into ""On a Holiday"". Fans will recognize this from various boots as just ""Holiday"", but Parks' lyrics (check the sea-chantey rap (?) of, ""Not the rum of Carib scum/ It's Port tonight, drink up and come/ Un-weigh the anchor yank and we will party!"") are new. ""Wind Chimes"" is the same version as first officially appeared on the Good Vibrations box, but like so many others on the album, seems perfectly suited to this context. When the band rips in during the wordless (but for ""do-do-do"" and ""ba-ba-ba"") chorus, I strain to hold back cries of glee. I haven't actually succeeded yet. This leads to the infamous ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow"" (also known as ""Fire""), the instrumental Wilson once thought so powerful as to cause fires around his city. It still burns with lysergic intensity, albeit refined and featuring none other than backing harmony vocals cribbed from Smiley Smile's ""Fall Breaks and Back to Winter"". Smile ends with ""Good Vibrations"", suggesting in no uncertain terms that Wilson aims to leave listeners grinning. I'll grin. I'll congratulate him. I won't wonder too much what might have happened had this been released way back when. And I'll let this record fall into the my still-churning impressions of Brian Wilson. Better late than never? Yes.","Finally: After 35 years, Brian Wilson solves the Smile puzzle, piecing together the fragments that fans have spent the last 3½ decades meticulously researching, speculating over, and attempting to assemble themselves. As the mythical follow-up to Pet Sounds, it delivers, and despite his age, Wilson's voice even sounds fantastic, still carrying the weight of these angelic melodies.

Little Heart's Ease,Royal City,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2bdc0084474cd0c00f3/1:1/w_160/54b92eea.jpg,2004-09-27 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6853-little-hearts-ease/,Rough Trade,"Saith the prophet: Take thou up a lamentation for Royal City. In an interview, singer/songwriter Aaron Riches recently compared 2001's demon-haunted Alone at the Microphone to Dante's ""Inferno"", and the new record to ""Paradisio"". Although Little Heart's Ease faithfully follows country-rock strictures-- from Sweetheart of the Rodeo to Magnolia Electric Co.-- even Dante couldn't skip Purgatory. Neil Hannon aside, my memory of The Divine Comedy isn't as sharp as it should be. Suffice it to say that Purgatory is a boring place to spend a thousand years, although the seven terraces for the seven deadly sins gives me an idea for a cool Kevin Spacey movie. Purgatory isn't terribly exciting over a 43-minute record, either. Royal City's latest has its charms, but Riches' songwriting seems to have lost a certain spark since emerging from his previous outing's acoustic fire-and-brimstone. Ostensibly taking its name from an Emily Dickinson poem, Little Heart's Ease follows the poet's example. ""Heaven does not change her blue,"" Dickinson wrote, ""Nor will I, the little Heart's Ease-- Ever be induced to do!"" In that spirit, the band sticks to a formula of ragged indie folk that could almost be mistaken for Palace or Smog. ""My Body Is Numbered"" is a slow waltz fit for a Gram Parsons B-side; ""Enemy"" busts out stoned harmonica and On the Beach guitar solos. But appropriate alt-country reference points can only make a band pleasant, not remarkable. Too often, the new record substitutes weighty, Biblical language for true heft. ""He will come,"" Riches says repeatedly on opener ""Bring My Father a Gift"". With a bassline that owes back royalties to Paul Revere & The Raiders, the song reminds me instead of someone else who ""will return"": Cherokee people, Cherokee triii-hiiibe. Ahem. ""That My Head Were a Spring"" folds over itself like a not-so-famous blue raincoat. ""Weep for me, O ye, O thee,"" goes ""Jerusalem"", a jangly midtempo number. Of course, Dante met Beatrice at the end of ""Purgatorio"". Little Heart's Ease occasionally foreshadows a bright future: the waltz of saloon love song ""Cabbage Rolls"", the harmonies of ""Ain't That the Way"", the plaintive descending chords of ""Can't You"". The poppiest song on the album is ""She Will Come"", which echoes the lyrics of the opener. Here, Royal City break from tradition for an ebullient, handclap-filled breakdown. They could be onto something. Alas, ""She Will Come"" also provides the moment when I first began to doubt the record. It's silly, but when Riches sings about dust hanging around ""every nape"" of a girl's neck (a neck has only one nape), I wonder if he just scribbled down words that sounded nice rather than writing proper lyrics. It's like when I realized that TV on the Radio were mispronouncing ""prescience"" and started to worry that Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes wouldn't be as brilliant as I hoped. (It wasn't.) These may be little things but they make such a difference, to paraphrase old Mozzer. Using words you don't understand isn't just the antithesis of rock 'n' roll, it's a move reserved for poseurs and music critics-- and, yes that's a pleonasm. But enough wailing and teeth-gnashing. Little Heart's Ease, like Purgatory itself, is just transitory. Royal City have always seemed on the verge of a truly great album; this is the first time they've just plain struck out. For a follow-up, Royal City could do worse than study band member Jim Guthrie's Now, More Than Ever, a 2003 indie-pop masterpiece that puts Royal City's latest to shame. Or they could look to their own non-album cover of ""Is This It"" to see what's really missing: strong melodies and distinctive lyrics. Amen.","The latest Rough Trade-released outing from these always-promising Canadian folk-pop troubadours marks their first actual strikeout.

I Com,Miss Kittin,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c56c5e6ef95969323aee/1:1/w_160/163eaa78.jpg,2004-09-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5608-i-com/,Astralwerks,"The fickle indie music scene swiftly makes outcasts of former loves. Trends seem to become passé overnight, and in 2004, few sounds have been more cold-shouldered than electroclash. Sadly, Caroline Herve (aka Miss Kittin) has had to bear that burden. Much of the credit for her previous work went to production partners such as Goldenboy, Felix da Housecat, and The Hacker, the latter of which provided the beats on the 2001 collaboration, The First Album. Despite often working as a co-producer, Miss Kittin has been inadvertently written off as the electroclash gal with the heathen voice, the vixen who rasped atop oily dance jams. Miss Kittin, however, is not only a deft producer in her own right, but through her cover-mounted Muzik mix, On the Road, and Radio Caroline, Vol. 1 she has also repositioned herself as an innovative dancefloor helmswoman. For her first solo studio album, I Com, Miss Kittin roped in The Hacker and another set of guest co-producers: Tobi Neumann of Peaches' fame and Thies Mynthier of the German poptronic duo Phantom Ghost. The record mixes bed-sweat techno, glaciered electronic wirescapes, and sang-froid sing/speak into a throbbing blend that saunter from desolate love hymns to heaving jams. ""Happy Violentine"" is a love song pulled inside out, a track that seems pleased to display its visceral heartbreak. Atop oriental strings and subtle electro-plinks, Kittin juxtaposes ethereal disconnect with cutting, ironic heartbreak, particularly when her detached voice lulls itself into the lines, ""Switch me in a stand-by mode/ Until someone presses play."" Retracing that duality, ""Allergic"" rides pacemaker beats and subtle, revolving synths underneath Kittin's whispered vocals. Gangrenous and toxic, the song straddles the line between tongue-in-cheek irony and outright stupidity, as Miss Kittin tracks the self-adoration behind self-loathing and declares she's ""allergic to [my]self."" The soft backdrop gives her room to reshape her strange secondhand-English wording, and it results in a glorious confusion that's as intoxicating as it is bewildering. Perhaps the album's highlight is the spunky ode to computerized pleasure, ""Icome.com"". Over dense synthlines and quiet, woodblock-beats, Kittin slithers through her pleasures and her foils in a cheap, dirty carol to technological solitude. Creative despondency and inter-wired frenzy collapse upon themselves in a testimonial to self-love, a world where the frameworks of release are flickering blue-screens and spent friction. Unfortunately, some of Kittin's lyrical deficits undercut her production. ""Requiem for a Hit"" stumbles out of the gate with the ironic plea, ""Show me your tits and let's make a hit,"" and the phrase doesn't get any funnier when it's repeated ad nauseam. One of the great failures of postmodernism is an inability to restrain our own sense of irony, but here's one shining example of why we must hold tight to that sense of proportion. ""Clone Me"" shoulders similar dead weight, as it's forced to carry leaden lines like, ""Look at me, myself, and I/ My world is mine so multiply,"" and, ""If my minds you can connect/ With myself I will debate."" In a moment of keen synthesis, the album's most banal production mirrors its lyrical void. Of course, for many who admire this French kitty's metronomic beats and elephantine sound, ca n'importe pas-- as the beats throb, the words seal into shape.","Some artists aren't suited to the album format: This electroclash progenitor's Astralwerks debut can't hold up to her excellent string of early 12-inches or genre-defining DJ mixes.

Trax Records: 20th Anniversary Collection,Various Artists,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8295e6ef9596932114a/1:1/w_160/db42696e.jpg,2004-09-27 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2054-trax-records-20th-anniversary-collection/,Trax,"Bare bones, rootless, and raw, early house was a slate-wiping sound. It allowed a group of mostly black and gay Chicagoans who grew up in the home of the Disco Demolition Night to both construct a unique, singular canvas and paint on that blank cloth a sensual and often sexual portrait of the struggle to assert and celebrate their uniqueness and individuality. That sense of community was found at a trio of influential clubs-- Frankie Knuckles' Warehouse and Power Plant, and Ron Hardy's Music Box. Knuckles and Hardy ruled over Chicago's early 1980s clubland environment, filling the post-disco dancefloor void with a mix of European synth-pop, Philly Soul, funk, and Italian disco, often splicing and extending sequences, mixing live with a reel-to-reel, and experimenting with rhythm tracks. Their devotees were so enthralled that, like the fabled reactions to The Sex Pistols' early UK performances, they maxed out their credit cards on musical equipment and led a DIY revolution. In the hands of these admitted amateurs, the typical laws of music-making and song structure weren't applicable. Instead, they fumbled about and created an alien sound; a few years later-- misusing the TB-303 drum machine-- some of these same artists created the then-eye-bulging but now-familiar squelches and burps that characterize acid house. Just as New Yorkers had abused the turntable and transformed the breakbeat into a musical science, these enthusiastic and mostly untrained kids smashed the rulebook and democratized the music-making process. When most of these new creations were finally put on vinyl, they were usually released on Trax Records, an infamous label typically known almost as much for its corner-cutting as its groundshifting output. Thankfully, that's being redressed with the revitalization of the label and the release of a series of compilations celebrating its role in the radical alteration of dance music. The best of these releases (which also includes Acid Classics and Queer Trax) is Trax Records: 20th Anniversary Edition, a three-disc collection of the label's best 1980s work. The first two discs are a pair of continuous mixes by Maurice Joshua and Paul Johnson; the third is a potentially superfluous unmixed collection of 12 of the label's best-loved tracks, each of which is also featured elsewhere in the collection. The discs boast both the minimal, lurching sound of track-oriented house and more soulful, disco-rooted, gospel-tinged, and usually female-vocaled song-oriented house, all grounded by the steady four-to-the-floor beat that still characterizes the genre today. The first disc hogs most of the big names and anthems (including Adonis' ""No Way Back"", Phuture's ""Acid Tracks"", Master C&J;'s ""Dub Love"", and co-mixer Maurice's ""This Is Acid""), while the second unearths some less-known but equally compelling gems. A uniquely Chicago sound, house was able to become a local sensation-- it elbowed its way onto nighttime radio playlists, and some singles sold upwards of 10,000 copies in the city alone-- without the meddling influences of either industry or celebrity culture. As a result, Knuckles' and Hardy's clubs weren't as quickly given over to the cult of exclusivity that had helped expedite the last days of disco a few years earlier. However, almost everything else that disco's detractors disliked about that late-70s sound was magnified by house: It's mechanical and sexual, and the early ""jack"" tracks-- house's version of dance-craze tunes-- could be seen as utilitarian. Were house lovers confronted with such accusations, they'd likely shrug or smile: Otherworldly sounds that mix the funky hedonism of Prince and the primal mechanics of Giorgio Moroder? Yes, please. The Second City has long celebrated its role in the creation and nurturing of jazz and blues, but until this summer's Frankie Knuckles Day has heretofore neglected to recognize its role in the birth of house music. It's a shame because, in many ways, house is a more purely Chicago sound than any of those others. Even in the days before the current Mayor Daley's beautification initiatives, Chicago's gorgeous skyline dwarfed cracked concrete and cold steel, serving as a reminder that, in the hands of architectural visionaries from Daniel Burnham to Mies van der Rohe, aesthetics and utilitarianism aren't opposing ideas and that elegance needn't be sacrificed to modernity. So just as Detroit-- Chicago's sister city in the 1980s electronic dance music revolution-- seemed a natural setting for techno's dystopian nightmares, Europhile escapist fantasies, and almost post-human (even post-apocalyptic) sound, house perfectly captures the beauty and beast qualities of Chicago's urban landscape. It freely embraces both crisp, modern sci-fi sounds and raw, unchecked sexuality and lurching beats, and, in some ways, is therefore perhaps the exception to the idea that ""dancing about architecture"" is perverse and/or impossible. In one sense, this collection is first and foremost a historical document, the first Trax-sanctioned compilation in the label's history. As a document of the development of one the world's best-loved musical genres, it demonstrates that groundbreaking music-- even when it's fairly minimal, almost basic-- is not necessarily rudimentary. The more song-based tracks-- the ones which carry the old remnants of diva disco-- are perhaps the most surprisingly appealing, especially because I've always preferred the track-y end of house and still do (and prefer it on this collection, too). Yet, as wonderful as the more raw, bare-bones sonics of tracks such as Mr. Fingers' ""Can You Feel It"" are, the version included here adds deep, rich vocals which turn it into a clarion call for togetherness and unity without spilling into melodramatics or empty bombast. As a result, claims that ""this song is all about life"" and ""I can see all my brothers/ Seated around a table of fellowship"" are wistful and urgent, hopeful but yet mindful of the improbability of the song's prophecy. Similarly, on one of the set's most muscular tracks, Marshall Jefferson's ""Bird in a Gilded Cage"" doesn't soar across an empty blue sky; instead it negotiates ambient jungle-and-animal sounds. Jefferson faces reality as he dreams of utopia. On this set, that tension blends into the release of Hercules' ""7 Ways to Jack"", again highlighting that when it comes to race and sexuality, the politics of dancing isn't just a catchy chorus. Racial and sexual dynamics are so linked in some elements of house that ""South Africa/Let My People Go"" and the Prince-like incantation, ""She brought me to my knees/ For love/ Made me beg and plead/ For love,"" share space on Knuckles' and Jamie Principle's ""Baby Wants to Ride"". Even the reality of life in Chicago (and New York, Munich, Berlin, Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, etc.) was harsh, a sort of utopia was within reach on the dancefloor, with the uniformity of that familiar 4/4 beat serving as a great leveler and the shared foundation of what became a worldwide community. Above all, then, this is a document of a sonic revolution, one that destroyed the notions of authorship, the empty claims of authenticity, and music crit's now-bizarre preference for linear histories instead of paradigm shifts. More importantly, it unleashed the world of possibility of electronic music onto the dancefloor, demonstrating that machine music isn't merely chin-stroking science-- it's also the body-shifting humanity.","Seminal Chicago house label compiles its best-known and most pioneering tracks on three discs. An essential document of the roots of dance music as we know it today.

Universal Audio,The Delgados,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9595e6ef9596932293c/1:1/w_160/773ef479.jpg,2004-09-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2269-universal-audio/,Chemikal Underground,"On Universal Audio, The Delgados have run from their past couple of albums. 2002's Hate flourished under the 70s-lite grandeur of producer Dave Fridmann, who positioned lead singers Alun Woodward and Emma Pollock as a modern-day Carpenters. The Delgados and Fridmann had dabbled with big set pieces in the past, but those were just diversions compared to their work on Hate, on which coursing melodies are buoyed by orchestration and every bold gesture has an even bolder swell to carry it. In a smaller way, Universal Audio sounds just as dramatic. On the face of it, The Delgados have recorded a stripped-down pop record, all guitar singles and piano ballads. But the album isn't ""raw"" so much as ""just right."" And although the record's generic and misleading first single, ""Everybody Come Down"", promises an album of buzzing guitar pop, The Delgados are actually more troubled and complex than ever. With fewer instruments to fight against, Pollock all but steals the show. Where Hate projected her into a 50s hologram, this time her voice is powerfully bare and introspective. Pollock opens the album with the defiant stand and unblinking guitars of ""I Fought the Angels"", but from there she's rocked and challenged, nearly surrendering on ""Come Undone"", then recovering with the gentle lilt of ""Sink or Swim"". The songs on which she takes lead vocals serve as a touching slideshow of the doubts that underlie her sweet, haunted voice. By contrast, Woodward's turns on the mic are bold and unflappable, and as such, his approach seems at odds with Pollock's. While the late-era XTC knock-off ""Bits of Bone"" sets up the gloom of ""The City Consumes Us"", there's an uneasy jolt to the Olympic fanfare of ""Girls of Valour"". Pollock follows that track with ""Keep on Breathing"" like a nagging mother. The sequencing of happy-to-sad isn't as disconcerting as the way each voice takes a side: Pollock sees the grim possibilities that Woodward refuses to acknowledge. ""Let's go out and fight forever!"" he declares; ""Watch how this city destroys us,"" she moans. ""This is how it feels to drown,"" Pollock gasps; Woodward suggests, ""Bang a gong!"" That disconnect confirms the suspicion that this is an album of singles. But even if Hate stands as their most visionary statement, Universal Audio has a subtler strength. As a result, its few moments of resolution-- such as when, on ""Girls of Valour"", Woodward unleashes Beach Boys harmonies on the chorus only to have Pollock slip in beside him-- hit that much harder. Her interjection simultaneously pulls him down to earth and tosses him back in the air, feeding him the poignancy that makes his confidence believable.","In contrast to last year's well-received Hate, this Scottish indie pop quartet's latest outing-- again produced by uber-decksman Dave Fridmann-- consists of relatively stripped-down pop, all guitar singles and piano ballads.

Travistan,Travis Morrison,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c56b5e6ef95969323aeb/1:1/w_160/e371b553.jpg,2004-09-27 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5607-travistan/,Barsuk,"Travis Morrison got his ass kicked. He tells the whole story here, about the random beatdown he suffered in front of a Gap, a humiliation so surprising he couldn't fight back. Even cracking jokes about it to friends doesn't disguise his embarrassment, or hide the hollow in his mouth where his teeth went missing. And that's not the only crisis in Morrison's life: After nearly a decade of leading The Dismemberment Plan to indie stardom, he's watched the band slowly dissolve, and now been thrust into a solo career by default. The D-Plan's XTC- and Talking Heads-derived spaz-rock had propelled the band to rarely met heights of underground glory, but it was Morrison's bug-eyed eloquence that sealed the deal. Their strongest album, 1999's Emergency & I, brilliantly nailed the post-collegiate urban anxieties of the young, frustrated and smartassed, fluent in ironic prime-time catchphrases and all too familiar with the sensation of finding adult freedom at last, only to waste weekends in a crappy apartment because they're never invited to the good parties. Did I mention he also turned 30? You might expect Morrison's solo debut to build upon the mellower sound he cultivated with The Dismemberment Plan on 2001's Change, and Travistan does occasionally flirt with it. But mostly, Morrison takes the record in a completely unexpected direction-- and when he does, he leaves the listener far behind. Travistan fails so bizarrely that it's hard to guess what Morrison wanted to accomplish in the first place; the guy who led sing-alongs to sold-out crowds can't find the words on his own album. I've never heard a record more angry, frustrated, and even defensive about its own weaknesses, or more determined to slug those flaws right down your throat. Morrison went into the studio with Chris Walla and Don Zientara behind the boards; John Vanderslice guests, and Death Cab for Cutie's Jason McGerr attempts to recreate Joe Easley's polyrhythmic drumming. The music Morrison's written for the project, however, is mostly undistinguished. Once again, his monotone winds through modulating melodies while synthlines unravel like ribbon candy or squeal to meet the harshness of his screams. On this familiar ground, Travistan starts with a relative bang: The first of the album's four (!) ""Get Me Off This Coin"" interludes can nearly be forgiven when Morrison kicks off ""Change"", whose rhythmic anxiety-attack, twisting hooks, and (of course) title cleanly evoke his previous work. But, following ""My Two Front Teeth, Parts 2 and 3""-- in which he relays that story about getting his face pounded-- we discover where Travistan fails: its lyrics. Throughout the record, Morrison seems dead set on sabotaging the music's few positive attributes with fatal dorkisms and a surprisingly dad-like sense of humor. Here, he reflects on his post-brawl aftermath in a mirror wondering, ""Why me?/ Why now?/ I look like Gordie Howe!""-- before breaking into the keening, repeated climax, ""All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth/ My two front teeth/ My two front teeth."" It worsens. ""People Die"" finds Morrison trying his hand at Shel Silverstein's dark-tinted child-poems: ""People Die/ It's the facts/ So there, I said it/ Now you can relax.../ People die/ La de da/ It gives the day a certain je ne sais quoi."" ""Change"" opens, ""Moses comes down from the mountain and he's pissed.../ He says, 'Y'all coulda built a boat/ If anybody had the guts/ While I was up there talking to trees and growing my beard to my nuts."" But those aforementioned ""Get Me Off This Coin"" bits seem to house the highest per capita stinkers. Each presents a former U.S. president protesting his likeness on American currency, and features a line like, ""I like my nations in constant revolution/ And my booty wide."" At times, Morrison's matter-of-fact lyrics and fascination with history actually recall Schoolhouse Rock. Can you identify each president in the ""Coin"" tracks? Which one smoked dope with black girls at Monticello? Which one had a town named after them in which no one is able to vote? Can you draw all of the animals he names on ""Song for the Orca""? A bigger problem with Travistan is Morrison's tendency to leave themes unresolved. In ""Che Guevara Poster"", he nearly seems ready to offer some sort of criticism or approval of the revolutionary figure's recent ubiquity, but then loses focus. The brutality from ""My Two Front Teeth, Parts 2 and 3"" returns on ""Song for the Orca"", in which he sings about zoo animals who dream of retaliating against masters who abuse them, but never makes it past the gruesome panorama. After years of turning hyper-detailed imagery into terrific stories, Morrison now seems to lack the sustenance or patience to provide closure on the books he opens. Along with the album's hidden track (a pretty blur of indietronica), the second half of ""Che Guevera Poster"" stands out as a rare exception. Here, Morrison relates his grandfather's tribulations as a union-employed immigrant in early 20th century St. Paul, detailing his hardships and personal flaws in a tone that's simple and sincere. Even his voice sounds different as he lets down his guard and begins to communicate, and maybe because the lyrics sound so genuine, the song takes on a more affecting air than his other two ballads. On the sub-Eels ""Any Open Door"", he tries to make lines like, ""Alone with my thoughts/ Yeah, alone with my cell phone,"" sound soul-searching. And the big finale-- piano ballad ""Angry Angel""-- never even gets off the ground: Morrison's thin, reedy throat was never at its best outside his signature sing/speak, and his decision to aim for soaring Disney ascension is grossly misguided, to put it kindly. ""I don't want to fight,"" sings Morrison at the end; ""I don't want revenge."" But as Travistan winds down into one final ""Get Me Off This Coin"", it doesn't appear to be quite that simple. By claiming to make peace with the corporeal blows he suffered in that Gap-front melee, he reveals not just the kernel of potential that's buried in this record, but also the very problem with it: Travistan only allows us to briefly glimpse a series of images and storylines, but makes no effort to help us understand them, or to see them through his eyes. Morrison makes a spectacle of his almost physical reaction to stress, as he faces a new crowd and a new phase of his career. We watch him take shelter behind the familiar, then launch into one bad idea after another with the faith that at least one of them might work. We all get there someday-- turning 30, feeling doubts, taking chances that might get us knocked down. But someone with Morrison's talent should communicate these insecurities, dissect them, and ultimately make them melt away. Listening to Travistan, it seems doubtful he can even do that for himself.","After a prestigious and fruitful career fronting D.C. spaz-rockers The Dismemberment Plan, T-Mo makes that difficult leap to solo artist. But fans of his previous band-- and indeed, of music in general-- have quite a shock in store with Travistan, one of the most colossal trainwrecks in indie rock history. The album cover is telling: We'd hide our faces, too.

Things Are Strange,PANTHERS,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb56abf31b7dc7155a7c/1:1/w_160/ac56b1b6.jpg,2004-09-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6152-things-are-strange/,Vice,"Between 2002's Are You Down? and 2003's Let's Get Serious EP, Brooklyn's Panthers really got their shit together. They softened up their heart-on-sleeve politico-art-rock shtick (or at the least drowned it in a miasma of guitar distortion), realized they were better mega-riffers than melody-makers, and most importantly, told drummer Jeff Salane that Panthers wasn't Orchid, the post-hardcore band he also drummed for. These minor adjustments alone made quite a winner out of Let's Get Serious, a record that openly exploited that tender garage-rock loophole that allows bands like this to succeed-- despite asinine lyrics, pisspoor melodies, the works-- simply because they rock so fucking hard. ""Thank Me with Your Hands"" alone rendered every other misstep they'd taken forgivable. That EP got them off the Dim Mak label and onto the starry-eyed Vice roster, but as Things Are Strange suggests, Vice's vote of confidence may have tricked the band into overextending itself-- to do more than just rock. The album's track-to-length density-- 9 songs, 50 minutes-- is the clearest indicator of Panthers' aspirations beyond their MC5'd total energy stooginess. It's a mistake, though: During the half of Things Are Strange in which the band keeps the riffs aplenty, there's another half that Panthers spend deep in the asscrack of uninspired post-rock snooze. Leadoff rockers ""Legally Tender"" and ""Theory Is Famous"" follow the band's anticipated trajectory: Guitar and basslines gel into one indistinguishable monolith, further compressing the drums and inning an out door for only the best of frontman Jayson Greene's horkheimered lyrics. ""Give me a book and I'll read the shit out of it,"" will be everyone's favorite quote on Facebook.com any day now. Both songs reach way past the three-minute mark with no problem, a testament mostly to drummer Salane's appropriate and on-the-dime switch-ups. The fat but jerky unison breakdown midway through ""Stroke My Genius"" captures Panthers' live energy most vividly, the band then riding out the movement's distorted Brancan overtones into a killer snare-on-one stomp. But 7-minute monsters demand more planning and better melodies for sustenance. All four of Things Are Strange's epic hopefuls-- from the death-by-napalm spaz-out that opens the otherwise limpid ""We Are Louder"", to the trick-or-treat, Murder She Wrote-esque ditty ""If You Were Once Young, Rage"", to the less pitiful but still predictable meandering of ""Weird Birds""-- fail from destitute melodies lost in a haze of so-called art and supposedly introspective passages. ""What's a riff"" and ""what's a melody""-- and even then, ""what's a good melody""-- are inevitably personal distinctions, but regardless: the melodies (or whatever) Panthers subjected to their slow broods simply aren't engaging enough on their own to make up for the band's rock-out time-out. Perhaps this is telling, but the two best tracks on Things Are Strange are re-recorded cuts from their previous releases. ""Thank Me With Your Hands"" wisely appears again here: Though a smaller aperture of production teases out more detail in the lead guitar line, Greene adds a whimsical falsetto to double the guitar at the end, and for the most part, Panthers play through the song transitions more confidently. ""Walk of Shame"", too, originally released on a late-2003 tongue-in-cheek split with fellow Brooklynites Japanther, plays host to the band's most virulent guitar hooks and the album's best preamble-- Panthers barely hold onto the song's reins, and the effect is just brutal and awesome. But there's a catch: The magic's over in two minutes, and for the next five, Panthers force a build that teases but never fully materializes. The track's lesson suits Things Are Strange as well: Panthers are best rocking us, not impressing us.","They're at their best when they bring the rock as directly as possible, but their Vice Records debut features several tracks in excess of seven minutes. Do the math.

Saul Williams,Saul Williams,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa4113d19756521399e0/1:1/w_160/730b31b9.jpg,2004-09-26 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8692-saul-williams/,Fader,"The hip-hop debut of unspeakably awesome slam-poet Saul Williams, Amethyst Rock Star, was a divisive work. Some critics were turned off by Williams' bombastic, proclamatory emceeing, which often made no pretense of rhythmic consistency or tonal variety. Yet despite a few bland passages, it was one of my favorite albums of '01. Williams' lyrical turns as a wise punster, revealing the subliminal messages and connections embedded in our language, approached the transcendent. A style that struck some as sterile fed others a powerful rhetorical fire, backed by violins and breakbeats. At the album's climax, on the DJ Krush collaboration ""Coded Language"", Williams fervently delivered an indictment of modern consciousness in an engineer's technical jargon, culminating in a rapid-fire postmodern jumble of historical figures. It remains an overpowering moment, delivered with the manic energy of a preacher. Williams often exalts the power of metaphor, and the cover of his new self-titled release-- a photograph of him driving in a truck, ready to shout through a bullhorn-- indeed allegorizes the music within. The messages of Saul Williams are still delivered with fervency, but the album is musically and lyrically aimed at a wider audience than his debut. Unfortunately, anything shouted through a bullhorn becomes distorted, and in a fast-moving vehicle, one's words must be kept simple and easy to digest. The music here moves away from Rock Star's adventurousness, to attempt a hybridization of his honed social/metaphysical perspective with a more populist sound. As he says on intro ""Talk to Strangers"": ""The earth is not a flat screen/ I ain't trying to fit in/ But this ain't for the underground/ This here is for the sun."" The recurring theme of Saul Williams is a resistance to egoistic obstinacy, through messages such as ""vulnerability is power,"" and ""God is change""-- a sentiment reverberating through his shifting musical style. Here, Williams often adopts the lineage built by socially conscious rappers Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine-- rap backed by a hardcore outfit. It's clear that he's after an atmosphere of turgid energy to match his calls to consciousness. There's little downtime, and the first half of the album maintains a consistently urgent feel. The dramatic piano and choir of his intro (written by System of a Down's Serj Tankian) gives way to ""Grippo""'s dissonant guitar, and a song that contains some of the album's best lines: ""I gave hip-hop to white boys when nobody was looking/ They found it locked in a basement when they gentrified Brooklyn.../ So substitute the anger and oppression/ With guilt and depression/ And it's yours."" ""Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare)"", which features guest vocals by Zack de la Rocha, connects America's involvement in Iraq to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: ""This one goes out to my man/ Taking cover in the trenches with a gun in his hand/ Then gets home and no one flinches when he can't feed his fam/ But Brutus is an honorable man."" The album's second half is spottier, containing more forgettable material. Williams' singing voice is too thin to carry his sometimes soulful melodies, and songs like ""Surrender (A Second to Think)"" can be difficult to listen to. But ""Control Freak"" is a catchy, concise track, and ""Seaweed"" recalls his more musically adventurous journeys of fantastical imagery, with a marimba sample and ethereal female vocals. Though most hip-hop albums strain at the temporal boundaries of a CD, Williams' is over at the 45-minute mark. Saul Williams' recent book of poetry, Said the Shotgun to the Head, is astounding in its use of type and font to imply vocal cadence and overall movement, but his recorded voice is sometimes less expressive. His efforts here to fit his spoken word into consistent old-school measures dilutes the power in his lyrics, where webs of internal rhyme are abandoned for A/B/A/B schemes. The best tracks hearken back to his original style. Sections of ""Telegram"" are reminiscent of Rock Star single ""Penny for a Thought"" in their rhetorical conceits and thematic focus on the enlightenment of hip-hop: ""We are discontinuing our current line of braggadocio/ In light of the current trend in realness/ Stop/ As an alternative we will be confiscating weed supplies/ And replacing them with magic mushrooms/ In hopes of helping niggas see beyond their reality/ Stop."" While the confines of form can help some artists with expressionistic originality, it's freedom that allows Williams' full impact to be made. Similarly, it's a welcome return to his trademark invocations made on closer ""Notice of Eviction"": ""Author of wind and change/ Phantom of the opera/ Tenor of the octave range/ Spews volcanic lava."" It's probably a frustration to artists like Saul Williams to feel as though they're preaching to the converted, when their message is one of widespread mental enlightenment. While the experimentalism of slam poetry is aimed at making complex or subtle emotions digestible to large audiences, musical experimentation tends to immediately alienate large portions of listeners. Still, Saul Williams is stuck between two conceits. To fulfill the huge potential inherent in his style, he's either going to have to find more abstract sonics and freer forms to compliment his equally liquid verse, or fully give himself over to writing some radio-friendly, MTV-ready material. Either would be a good move from a poet with the potential to fully embody the fiercely potent voice of right now.","Award-winning slam poet's second full-length teams him with Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha and System of a Down's Serj Tankian.

"More, More, More",Hurricane Lamps,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c14cea9e61561daa7d75/1:1/w_160/d71add75.jpg,2004-09-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3969-more-more-more/,Sonic Boomerang,"No matter what level of public exposure they work on, almost every band that lasts beyond a couple of albums eventually hits that point where they feel compelled to revisit their roots or return to the basics. Frequently, it's simply a chance for the band to try on something more comfortable after exhausting themselves with an especially prolific period or particularly ambitious record. The Hurricane Lamps fall under the latter distinction-- their fifth album, More, More, More, is an extremely basic and pared-down rock 'n' roll record, while their last, 2003's excellent Sing Me a Song, was a bright, ambitious pop record that lied a cut above any of their previous output in terms of sophistication and complexity. More, More, More, on the other hand, announces itself as a different animal even before the shrinkwrap is off. The orange squares featuring close-ups of guitars and drums on the album cover's austere silver background imply a lack of adornment and pretense, and the recording backs that up with exceedingly simple guitar/bass/drums arrangements played and recorded with the offhandedness of a band with nothing to prove. Singer/guitarist Eric Tischler announces the Who-ish opener ""Tell Me You Miss Me"" with a mid-fi guitar riff, and drops frequent but economical solos into the mix-- he's always given a little time to playing lead, but here he's an axe-wielding maniac, eager to strut and let bassist Greg Bennett and drummer Jason Merriman whisk him along on their bare-bones current. Part of what really distances this album from the two that preceded it (and unites it with their first two records, 1999's Tales from the Sink and 2000's You Deserve What You Want) is the raw, no-frills-whatsoever production treatment they've given it. Merriman's drums sound like they've got maybe two or three microphones on them and Tischler doesn't give his voice any protective armor like reverb or double-tracking, leaving it exposed in all its nasal, egg-headed glory. Every time I think his pinched tenor is perhaps a less than optimal vehicle for one of his sticky melodies, I try to imagine anything else working in this context, and it seems perfect again. On ""Everything Must Change"", he lays a strangely melancholy verse over a warp-speed arrangement, and it sounds like it could be your brother or your neighbor in the basement firm in the conviction that it somehow matters in the grand scheme of things. But does it matter in that grand scheme? That's impossible to say, but when Tischler sings, ""Sometimes you feel like you're drowning/ You're just dying for a breath of air/ Sometimes you feel you need some shelter/ And it's out there but you don't know where,"" it sure feels like it does, if only for a moment. And I guess that's part of the enduring value and appeal of simple rock 'n' roll like this-- it doesn't matter if it's heard by 20 people or 20,000 people, as long as it gets them all to forget their problems for a bit (even if they're singing along to someone else's problems). More, More, More hits on exactly that level, and while it's not my favorite Lamps record (that's still Sing Me a Song), it's still a strong reminder of the simple joys of a great song pared to the bare essentials and played with bucketloads of enthusiasm.","Fresh off last year's ambitious Sing Me a Song, D.C.-based pop/punks return to their roots.

Antics,Interpol,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97c13d197565213ae7a/1:1/w_160/84cf45ba.jpg,2004-09-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4116-antics/,Matador,"It's hard to imagine what spurred the density and gloom of Turn on the Bright Lights, an album that, in retrospect, sounds like a popular band reacting to massive overexposure; its masterful statement of bruised withdrawal begged to divide a large fanbase, not create one. There was nothing about Interpol's self-contained, visionary debut that might have suggested their subsequent eyebrow-raising catapult to fame, particularly given their aversion to the traditional single format. Perhaps Paul Banks' lucid expression of discontent and impending dread spoke to an increasingly frustrated audience inundated by a generalized threat. Or maybe Interpol's popularity is simply a case of viscerally powerful music confounding formulas of public taste, breaking through purely on the basis of songwriting merit. Either way, Bright Lights set an immeasurably high mark to follow, and its popularity has ensured equally high stakes: If the band stumbles, their humiliation will be very public. Fortunately, the members of Interpol understand what other bands take for granted: Careers aren't necessarily made or broken by second albums alone, and an ideal follow-up needn't engage the perceived potential of a defining debut or consciously redefine a pre-established sound in order to be effective. Redefinition, in particular, is a non-issue for Interpol, because one of the most enduring pleasures of their first album is its timeless singularity. Accordingly, it has been well understood that Antics wasn't going to be, nor could it be, Bright Lights 2. Bootleg versions of new material-- notably the live recordings of ""Narc"" and ""Length of Love"" that leaked last summer-- didn't suggest a radically altered aesthetic or faceless repetition, nor does Antics deliver either. Interpol avoid common sophomore pitfalls because they refuse to engage the immense weight that surrounds this release, and their tenuous position between shrewd self-consciousness and diversionary costume changing informs this album's openness and plasticity. Antics exudes a preceding aura of heaviness-- even the packaging is heavy; the album's cryptic liner notes consist of little more than stark grayscale photos and epigrammatic Morse code spelling out bits of song titles (""Length"", ""Narc"", ""Cruise"", ""Exit"", respectively). An image from the band's debut appears on the first single, ""Slow Hands"", and becomes a representative metaphor for the album as a whole: After reflecting on the aftermath of a soured relationship, Banks takes the ""weights"" described in Bright Lights' ""Obstacle 1"" from his ""little heart"" and projects them onto the woman who presumably put them there to begin with. Musically, however, the song is far removed from the layered density of Interpol's former material, exhibiting pristine, unmuddied production and a chorus (""We spies/ We slow hands/ You put the weights all around yourself"") that slithers and stomps with post-punk dance-floor swagger. Similarly, Antics casts off the weight of advance hype, stewing anticipation, and unreasonable expectations, and wisely distinguises itself as a strong collection of singles rather than as an immaculately cohesive album. And, where Interpol were once synonymous with emotive desolation, they here opt for an atmosphere of poignant resignation. Opener ""Next Exit"" is immediately jarring; a tranquilized doo-wop organ progression and spare percussion announce a very different band. It is explicitly clear that Interpol have changed, from the band's more casual tone (""We ain't going to the town/ We're going to the city/ Gonna track this shit around"") to new mixing techniques: Carlos D's bass and Daniel Kessler's guitar are relatively hushed in the mix to make room for Banks' underscored vocals, allowing him a range of expression previously unexplored and buoying the band's newfound pop leanings with lyrical eloquence. His vocals on tracks like ""Narc"" soar where they were once buried in the impermeable fog of their surroundings, and many who found his delivery in the past to be occasionally monotonous (company that includes Banks himself) will find his melodic range here to be a welcome change of pace. Although most songs evince a clear shift to singles territory, a natural progression of the band's sound is evident. ""Evil"" employs a Pixies-esque bassline and upbeat rhythm section to counterbalance its ambiguously bleak lyrical themes. The band demonstrates judicious restraint on ""Narc"", relegating a potentially overbearing blanket of synth strings and organ to a peripheral role while punching up Kessler's crisp guitar lines and Carlos D's almost imperceptibly fluid bass work. The syncopated funk bassline and disco-pop rhythm of ""Length of Love"" initially seem to be at odds with the song's lush orchestration, but these counter-intuitive touches add a dynamic element to the limited confines of the song's composition. The band hasn't lost its knack for exploration and epic construction, though; ""Take You on a Cruise"", ""Not Even Jail"", and ""Public Pervert"" steep the album's middle section in the kind of dark theatricality that distinguished their debut, while the expansive ""A Time to Be So Small"", with its deliberate pacing and depiction of ""cadaverous mobs,"" concludes Antics with unsettling macabre. Though Interpol couldn't be expected to surpass their previous heights, it's difficult to imagine a savvier or more satisfying second step. But the real revelation is that the band has wisely ignored a shortsighted perception of their career which dictates that where Bright Lights was an audacious plunge from a great height, Antics is the crucial landing. Even on those terms the band has succeeded. However, their liberation of form emphasizes the fact that, in the grand scheme of Interpol's career, this is only one in a series of great, if not Great, albums. Antics shows Interpol shedding the weight of their accumulated baggage and (hopefully) staying a while.","With their spectacular 2002 debut, Turn on the Bright Lights, Interpol set an immeasurably high mark to follow, and its popularity has ensured equally high stakes: If the band stumbles on this highly anticipated follow-up, their humiliation will be very public...

The Delivery Man / Il Sogno,Elvis CostelloThe Imposters,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6769d034d5c69bf353d/1:1/w_160/1c077cb1.jpg,2004-09-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11704-the-delivery-man-with-the-impostersil-sogno/,Lost Highway,"Over the past decade and a half, the man who calls himself Elvis Costello has proudly displayed a musical restlessness that borders on promiscuity: In between ""proper"" albums like Brutal Youth and When I Was Cruel, he has collaborated with an array of musicians whose own releases are rarely shelved in the rock section of your local record store. Often these pairings are one-album stands, as with The Brodsky Quartet (The Juliet Letters), Anne Sofie Von Otter (For the Stars), or smoky barroom jazz (North). Only occasionally has Costello allowed a collaboration to blossom into a creative relationship. He's recorded two records with Burt Bacharach (Painted from Memory and The Sweetest Punch, with Bill Frisell), and laid a foundation for continued collaborative songwriting with his wife, Diana Krall. There is, admittedly, an integrity to this ambitious quest: After more than 25 years, Costello's still trying to rouse some rabble, albeit through different means and towards different ends than on early albums like My Aim Is True and This Year's Model. On one hand, he's obviously following his own muse as he avoids the inevitable standards album that always seems to signals the creative death of aging stars like Rod Stewart and Cyndi Lauper (though he did cover Cole Porter earlier this year on the DeLovely soundtrack), and aside from a few missteps, he's succeeded in crafting a very diverse catalog. On the other, there's a hint of insecurity in Costello's ramblin' ways-- what, in relationship-speak, might be called a fear of commitment. The Delivery Man presents itself as a proper follow-up to 2002's When I Was Cruel (and its odds-and-ends companion Cruel Smile), as an album in the vein of Almost Blue or King of America. Regardless of its rock sound and the presence of his band, The Imposters, The Delivery Man is more or less just another collaboration-- the particulars of its creation are emphasized over its music. This time, however, Costello's collaborator is a place rather than a person. For The Delivery Man, he and The Imposters traveled to Sweet Tea Studios in Oxford, Mississippi-- not just the middle of the Delta but also directly between the birthplace and deathplace of Costello's namesake: Tupelo and Memphis. And though the disc began life as a concept album about a Southern delivery man seducing his female customers, Costello willfully worked away from that idea as the project progressed, and little of those origins remain in the final product, save the album title and the dilapidated truck on the album cover. Not that Costello has made an album of Delta blues or Sun Studio rockabilly: The Delivery Man is his idea of Southern music, a blend of pedal steel-drenched country and Dusty in Memphis professionalism. But it sounds best when it's at its most casual. The Imposters flex their muscles on barnburners like ""Bedlam"" and ""Needle Time"", proving themselves a dynamic band-- fierce but always controlled, musically inventive but never slick. While bassist Davey Faragher and drummer Pete Thomas kick up dust on the opener, ""Button My Lip"", Steve Nieve sneaks in a piano line from West Side Story, offsetting the rock rhythms with a self-consciously referential melody. Likewise, Costello's guest musicians add a distinctly Southern flair to the proceedings. Emmylou Harris sings on ""Nothing Clings Like Ivy"" and ""Heart-Shaped Bruise"", but Costello's best foil is Lucinda Williams, whose throaty, punkish snarl on ""There's a Story in Your Voice"" is a dynamic match for The Imposters' barroom ruckus, which only underscores how smooth and rehearsed Costello's own vocals sound. It's clear what The Imposters got out of this sojourn down South-- they sound like they're truly enjoying themselves-- but less so what Costello did. For starters, it sounds like he overpacked for the trip, toting along the polished lyrics and pristine melodies that sound so much more at home in New York. This can make for some dramatic juxtapositions of traditions, as on ""Country Darkness"", but often, Costello just sounds prissy and uptight in these more relaxed environs. Even his stuttering delivery on ""Button My Lip"" feels rehearsed and academic, as though he hasn't fully committed himself to the spirit of the endeavor. If The Delivery Man isn't enough of a departure for Costello, the classical Il Sogno, released simultaneously, at first sounds like perhaps too much of one: It's the score to a ballet adaptation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, commissioned by the Italian troupe Aterballetto and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas. With such a highfalutin' pedigree, it could be a parody of rock-star respectability, right down to the self-serious, auratic Deutsche Grammophon album cover and the ""Mystery Dance"" joke that's hidden in there somewhere. While there's something potentially zany about someone like Costello scoring a ballet, it seems too easy to decry a rock musician's pretensions to serious art. On some level, it makes sense to allow seasoned, adventurous rockers this kind of opportunity. So maybe it's Costello who's having the last laugh at rock critics who find themselves suddenly out of their element reviewing a ""classical"" album and who must struggle to form some sort of opinion that reads as more informed than ""it sounds like the hunchbacked love child of Copeland and Bernstein robbing Puccini's grave for leftover libretti,"" or, ""It put me to sleep."" However, Costello is still Costello (or at least still Declan MacManus), so there are passages that sound more rock- and jazz-informed, like ""Oberon and Titania"" and ""Puck 2"". The saxophones and drum sets create a jazzy, North-ern tone that sits comfortably among the more traditional orchestration. While this approach does break the score's airiness with some earthier sounds, it's still a risky decision that doesn't entirely pay off, and sometimes carries a whiff of novelty. Ultimately, on Il Sogno-- as on The Delivery Man-- Costello seems like a musical tourist, sending out snapshot postcards from exotic locales but never making his home there. ","One of the 20th century's greatest singer/songwriters makes his annual comeback-- this time with two albums, released simultaneously. The Delivery Man is a Southern barnburner with backing band The Imposters; Il Sogno is a classical work based on A Midsummer Night's Dream, performed by The London Symphony Orchestra.

The Litmus Test,Cut Chemist,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71cb1335d7bf1698fa5/1:1/w_160/6582b0a3.jpg,2004-09-23 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1781-the-litmus-test/,Quannum,"The mainstream hip-hop status quo makes Cut Chemist a progressive artist by default-- which is odd, given that he rarely samples any break off a record released post-1990. Lucas McFadden belongs to the now-""underground"" tradition of cutting high-fiber joints anointed with ""Funky Drummer""-era grooves that sound like house party highlights. His oeuvre is nakedly contrary to the MTV-sold, crunk bourgeoisie who downsize their music to stick-figured beats and loop Scarface-mused, orchestral arrangements ad nauseam. And no matter how often cynics attempt to bury hip-hop turntablism as a dead form, McFadden-- and a handful of worthy contemporaries-- still make the music feel timeless. And that's why The Litmus Test is such a frustrating tease. The collection is a ""mash-up"" of his solo tracks, remixes and collaborations with Jurassic 5, all serving as a public reminder of who Cut Chemist is before McFadden drops his new album next year. Litmus better qualifies as a medley on par with those hip-hop performances at the Grammys or BET Awards that are over-focused on dance choreography and cramming all the hits into three minutes. The 28-minute record serves as a decent primer for neophytes, but Chemist frequently interrupts some of his best moments before they complete their sentences. The Litmus Test opens not with just one, but three intro tracks. First comes ""This Is"", a massage-oiled, Latin-funk flavored teaser that sets the scene with street hustler chatter that eventually morphs into the album's actual ""Intro"" track. Then, McFadden turns a corner with an octopus-limbed drum break that introduces ""Bunky's Pick"", a brilliant survey of Stones Throw's excellent 2001 garage-funk comp The Funky 16 Corners. Jurassic 5's Cosby Kids-esque loitering anthem ""Concrete Schoolyard"" suddenly intervenes. Unsurprisingly, tunes from that ""positive rap"" group predominate The Litmus Test to the point that the record almost seems more like a J5 outtakes collection than a Cut Chemist statement. And while McFadden and fellow J5 DJ Nu-Mark's production on their ""Jayou"" has aged gracefully, Cut Chemist has done enough stronger work elsewhere that its inclusion here seems superfluous. Fortunately, there are a handful of worthy non-J5 inclusions here: Blackalicious tracks ""Chemical Calisthenics"" exemplifies what a perfect balance Chemist is capable of striking between experimental beatmaking and simply providing an emcee with something to spit over. On the Blazing Arrow version, he treated virtually every syllable Gift of Gab spat about the periodic table-- and the Litmus version improves that feat with an awesome, spy-flick brass break that wags its finger at the swinger lying in the gutter. Sadly, ""Alphabet Aerobics"", where McFadden tortured Gift of Gab's lyrical rundown of the alphabet with a sped-up, treadmill beat, is completely missing from this record. The hospital's burn ward is overwhelmed: J5's ""Swing Set"" is reduced to 46 seconds (halted by a bandleader asking, ""Do you want to dance?"", and being answered with a wiseass ""Hell no!""), their ""Lesson 6""s arithmetic jingle is almost completely obliterated, and the folksy violin solo performed on Chemist's own ""S.N.T."" (possibly the single best moment off Loose Groove's classic Funky Precedent compilation) has its plug pulled after one note. At least McFadden kept most of the levitating beats that enriched his greatest remix: Major Force's ""Re-Return of the Original Art-Form"". Now, some may say Chemist has a right to treat his own work like this, and he does.

A New White,Subtle,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6835e6ef95969320d62/1:1/w_160/1a4b46c7.gif,2004-09-23 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7779-a-new-white/,Lex,"If ""cool"" is making something out of nothing, then classic hip-hop epitomized it. With some scratchy LPs and a gorgeously organic lexicon, rappers hocus-pocused street corners into sovereign states, and transfigured fusty old soul records into musical artillery for sacking the cusp of the millennium. It was the culture in motion at 78 bpm: a panopticon you could pop and lock to. Rap has come a long way since breakbeats were revolutionary and samples were free. Like any unlegislated grassroots movement, hip-hop created its world piece by piece, and its cosmology could be limited to a city, a borough, a neighborhood, or an urban block. But with its irrefutable cultural ascendancy, hip-hop's wide-open aperture can now snap aerial photos of the entire world and freeze it in mid-spin. It's increasingly feasible that rap-- not rock-- will be the defining music of the American pageant, and like De La said: Stakes is high. Hip-hop is necessarily conversant with the genres it plunders for its hodgepodge purview. No longer content to scurry out like a bandit in the night, returning with a pilfered string section or bassline, hip-hop now expands its borders from within. Other genres aren't pillaged; they're utterly subsumed. That's why hip-hop is unstoppable: It can contain multitudes, ingest entire solar systems, until, if it continues to its logical conclusion, it will become the mega-genus of which all others are mere sub-categories. Like any popular genre, rap threatens to slip into ossification, but groups like the sextet Subtle (including core Them members Doseone and Jel) are diligently keeping its frontiers amorphous and supple. You probably want to know what they sound like. But how do you draw a picture of a shapeshifter? After releasing four seasonal EPs, Subtle's debut full-length is an chimera cobbled together from live and programmed drums, electronic strings, keyboards, samplers, guitars, woodwinds, and Doseone's chameleonic flows. From the throbbing pistons, bursting shards, and diabolical sing-along cadences of ""Song Meat"", to the Books-ian soundscape and muttered lullabies of ""I Love L.A."", to the cracked minor-key glitch-track and hypnotic incantations of ""Red, White and Blonde"", Subtle remains elusive: It's impossible to draw a bead on an erratically moving target. Since Doseone has long trafficked in enigmas, it's apt that subtlety both is and is not his modus operandi. On the surface, his bombastic word collages are as subtle as the proverbial bull in the china shop. But upon closer inspection, the rarified air of his understated murmurs, dramatic inflections, crisp enunciation, and striated polyrhythms breathe through earbuds with a rich palette of nuance. On the Doseone continuum, Subtle splits the difference between Them's austere, darkly glittering hip-hop, and cLOUDDEAD's densely layered, pastoral ambient drones. Subtle is not Dose's most innovative or complex project, but by the same token, it may be his most accessible-- a good point of entry into a dauntingly ambitious body of work. In ""The Book of Sand"", Borges imagined a book with an infinite number of constantly rearranging pages. The old metaphysician always dreamt of impossible libraries containing the sum total of language, or points in space that enclosed everything in the universe simultaneously. If he were alive today, I like to think he'd find a musical facsimile of his coveted Aleph in Doseone's bottomless oeuvre. While Subtle doesn't contain the endless depths of, say, the first Them album (which I've been listening to for years, and still exhume new wonders from), it's a far cry from punchlines and looped R&B; breaks, an expression of rap's unbounded potential. This is hip-hop as black hole, devouring everything its ever-expanding circumference touches.","Lex Records issues the debut full-length from this new experimental hip-hop sextet fronted by cLOUDDEAD's Doseone.

The Underground Spiritual Game,Fela Kuti,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc12c0084474cd0c29e6/1:1/w_160/5bfa67b2.jpg,2004-09-23 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4547-the-underground-spiritual-game/,Quannum,"Wide-eyed ravegoers have often told of the communal catharsis that can occur after several hours of dancing, and of the spiritual relevance surrounding their experience of simultaneous individual expression and total absorption within a crowd. Unfortunately, what often leaves these people ultimately disillusioned or feeling empty is the lack of ideological substance behind the power of the party. Modern American and European musicians have rarely figured out how to steer the positive, beat-driven galvanization that occurs on the dancefloor toward a larger purpose, such as political action. Our music of protest and revolution instead tends to be vague, preachy, or angry, musically stemming from folk or punk/hardcore influences. This trend originates in an inherent cultural bias that form should reflect content-- that music should sound as serious, sad, volatile, or important as its topic. Fela Kuti, the wildly successful Nigerian trumpeter, saxophonist, keyboardist and bandleader who passed away in 1997, grew from a different tradition. He pioneered the genre of Afrobeat, a mix of jazz and funk with traditional African themes. Much of Kuti's music was a call to action, criticizing his government for its injustices and corruption, and urging the poor of Nigeria and larger Africa to think and act independently. His popularity and effectiveness was such that he was jailed several times by the government, and his elderly mother killed by the army during a raid on his compound. Yet throughout his career, the most vital element in his work remained a constant affirmation of individual power through partying and dancing-- resistance through aesthetic opposition. The name of the political party he founded in 1979 was ""Movement of the People"", and one suspects he was referring to ""movement"" both in the broad and specific senses. The Underground Spiritual Game is an unbroken set of Kuti's music taken from throughout his career, meticulously compiled and mixed by Chief Xcel. Xcel is one half of Blackalicious, a hip-hop act that have themselves begun realizing the full potential of discourse inherent in their genre, and Xcel hopes to continue making his way through Fela Kuti's enormous output. Though touted as a ""remix"" of Kuti's work, The Underground Spiritual Game leaves the original sounds relatively untouched. Instead, Chief Xcel seamlessly melds selections from 11 of Kuti's tracks, occasionally adding effects, and inserting spoken snippets of Fela speaking. It's put together in a manner that stands as a testament to Kuti's political views, but pays equal homage to his musical impact. Fela's songs are built on repeated midtempo grooves, and structured around call-and-response sections between Kuti and his band. The jazz influence is readily apparent in the solos, as well as the hooks of his horn section. But the music centers on Kuti's espoused ideology of ""Pan-Africanism."" His songs are highly polyrhythmic, with several simultaneous meters often being kept by the percussion, bass, and guitar. Solos catch themselves in loops recalling those of traditional Mbira music-- circular melodies without beginning or end. The songs are sung mostly in Pidgin English, Kuti's voice howling and jumping, stressing unexpected syllables, and leaping over beats or extending phrases. The Underground Spiritual Game captures this nicely, making its way through several of his best-loved pieces, and closing with the popular 17-minute ""Africa Centre of the World"", inspired by Kuti's burgeoning interest in Afrocentric philosophy. Not even Kuti was safe from the cynicism that seems to befall most activists as they age, but even so, his took on a positive tone. As explained by friend Mabinuori Idowu in this disc's liner notes, the song ""Look and Laugh"" is Kuti saying, ""I've sung songs to confront the system. They burnt my house. I've sung songs to open your eyes. They put me in jail. I've done all these things to enlighten you. And what do you give me in return? You complacently do nothing, so I might as well sit back, look and laugh."" The seeming immutability of the world leads many toward nihilism. Kuti, however, accepted it with transcendence through absurdity, reflected in the song itself by ending with a deadpan ""ha ha ha ha/ hee hee hee hee"" refrain and ascending chromatic scale in the bass. The message of Fela Kuti's music was directed toward his countrymen, but applies to listeners world wide: Fight for change, but don't forget the joy of the life you're fighting for.","Blackalicious DJ/producer Chief Xcel seamlessly melds 11 of the Afrobeat pioneer's best tracks into one continuous mix.

"Discovered, Covered: The Late, Great Daniel Johnston",Daniel Johnston,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba1713d197565213afdc/1:1/w_160/da05607c.gif,2004-09-23 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4283-discovered-covered-the-late-great-daniel-johnston-compilation-and-tribute/,Gammon,"The very existence of a combination career retrospective/tribute album to Daniel Johnston, one of the great underground successes in the annals of independent music, presents a paradox: The same universal acknowledgement of honesty in his music that so often leads to an intense personal association with Johnston's oeuvre also invariably leads to an almost possessively purist attitude toward most of his work. It's ironic that a man often described as ""the most unpretentious artist of our generation"" has, in displaying no discernible artifice in his music, inspired a type of deep-felt admiration amongst his devotees that approaches exclusive worship. Johnston never wanted to be mythologized; he only wanted others to share and experience the music that he created so honestly and prolifically. His earliest career success resulted from handing out free cassettes of his home recordings (including the recently re-released Songs of Pain and More Songs of Pain) to anyone who wanted them, and whisperings of his mental instability, childish fetishes, and mysterious home life aided his rapid rise to local, and subsequently national, celebrity. But if a certain percentage of his following initially consisted of scenester rubberneckers intrigued by the possibility of an ""outsider"" peepshow, such sentiment has been gradually stamped out by the sheer quality and magnitude of Johnston's career output. It's no surprise that many contributors fervently praise his work in the album's liners, and comparably safe interpretations of Johnston's material would be a reasonable defense mechanism for most artists to embrace. There is, of course, a nagging suspicion that, given uninhibited freedom of expression and access to high fidelity recording equipment, many popular artists might actually improve on some of Johnston's originals, which were often recorded in embryonic stages of the songwriting process, and were sometimes melodically hindered by the same lo-fi recording techniques that simultaneously made the songs so endearing. It turns out, though, that most artists meet Johnston somewhere in the middle, extending and expanding his raw musical ideas while supplanting his inimitable delivery with their own established voices. The resulting covers, combined with a second disc of the originals, form a kaleidoscopic portrait of a challenging and beloved songwriter, constructed earnestly by the many artists touched and influenced by his music. Teenage Fanclub & Jad Fair's opener ""My Life Is Starting Over Again"" is a dead ringer for Johnston's weary assertion of renewal, and establishes a pattern of tactful mimicry employed frequently on the album-- particularly by low-profile artists. Prominent artists are inherently more recognizable, but are usually tasteful in their choices. Beck's ""True Love Will Find You in the End"" translates the underlying sadness of Johnston's naked optimism into home-fried Sea Change-style country. Guster racks up a few needed points of indie cred with a sunny cover of ""The Sun Shines Down on Me"", and The Flaming Lips & Sparklehorse predictably cut straight to the charming naivete of ""Go"", one of Johnston's most endearing ballads. The only tracks that substantially falter are either overly ambitious or fail to adequately recognize Johnston's music on its own terms. In the former category, Death Cab for Cutie stumbles with an overlong version of ""Dream Scream""-- Ben Gibbard is situated too far to the ""adorable"" side of Johnston's naive/disturbed dichotomy, and his sweet vocal interpretation unwisely eschews Johnston's creepy heavy breathing for genuine boyish charm. Calvin Johnson simply approaches ""Sorry Entertainer"" from the wrong angle: His decision to remove the song's crucial hook-- a demonic jack-in-the-box ""Peter Gunn"" riff-- robs it of its propulsive nervous energy. TV on the Radio take a major risk tackling the immortal ""Walking the Cow"", and unfortunately, fall flat. Tunde Adebimpe's multi-tracked vocals and tepid falsetto interpretation of the song's climax (""Really don't know how I came here/ Really don't know why I'm staying here""), along with a plodding piano approximation of Johnston's furiously ham-fisted chord organ arrangement, pale in comparison to the original's vivid starkness. Several tracks, however, come close to surpassing the limited scope of their progenitors. Clem Snide turns ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Your Grievience"" into a breezy pop number without sacrificing the song's complex fusion of Christian guilt and spiritual affirmation. Bright Eyes' ""Devil Town"" captures the central despondency of Johnston's paranoid vampire fantasy, while fleshing out the original a cappella arrangement with spacious alt-country flourishes. And Tom Waits adds his own blown-out ape shrieks and guttural blues delivery to Johnston's sprawling film synopsis/personal analysis ""King Kong"", striking the perfect balance between the two artists' distinctly separate but comparably mythological personas. The album concludes with the previously unreleased ""Rock This Town"", from Johnston's upcoming Lost & Found. The track is Johnston's own telling assessment of his general worth as an artist: In the song, Johnston takes his guitar to the ""heavy metal store,"" preaches the Golden Rule, and is promptly dubbed the ""laugh of the human race."" However, Discovered, Covered squarely refutes his emblematic self-deprecation. That Daniel Johnston's music has sincerely moved so many notable artists is a stunning testament to the undeniable power of his life's work, which, contrary to the compilation's sardonic title, continues to inspire new generations of followers.",,8.3,
American Idiot,Green Day,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfa1ea9e61561daa7aba/1:1/w_160/9f6ffeb1.jpg,2004-09-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3568-american-idiot/,Reprise,"Green Day were always innately suburban. THC and apathy themed their 1994 single ""Longview""; their breakthrough album, Dookie, was a precocious jumble of power chords and smart aleck prurience, a blend of The Descendents and flinty Buzzcockian spark. They didn't have any answers-- they just wanted weed and entitlement. That cul de sac selfishness and bratty pose carried through to the sugar-pap mallpunks Green Day spawned on the backslide of the 90s; unfortunately, the trio's undeniable early flair for songcraft did not. In 1999, pop-punk exploded with the arrival of Blink-182's Enema of the State, and the brand gleefully deteriorated from there, bottoming out in the young and hopeless days of a dollar-store post-millennium, where the suburban trash culture that Billie Joe Armstrong once dismissively skewered has blended dangerously with a shifty political climate, causing volatile upheavals in blue collar comedy and bicameral nimrods. Now Green Day are back to pull the pin on the grenade. 2000's Warning only scored the band two modern rock hits, and in contrast to the million-selling marks of previous records, was something of a commercial flop. By this point, their hit-making, image-cultivating offspring had bid them good riddance, and those disillusioned by Green Day's populist stature were no longer listening. If they had been, they'd have heard some of the grit and dynamics that gave birth to a much wider sonic palette on American Idiot, the band's first album since, and unquestionably their most ambitious to date. As a songwriter, Armstrong's penchant for economy is still present-- he'll never be a wordsmith or a magic melody maker. But Idiot's slicing power chordage reaches to Green Day's old English and Cali punk influences with tingling fingers, adds acoustic instruments without sounding forced or contrived, and lyrically grapples with the cultural predicaments and awkward shittiness of ""subliminal mind-fuck America,"" circa 2004: ""Now everybody do the propaganda/ And sing along in the age of paranoia."" Armstrong delivers the title track couplet like a command at the revolution day sock-hop, and its instrumental viciousness is enough to shatter punchbowl glass. Like Bad Religion, whose recent The Empire Strikes First was not only a reaction to U.S. politics and culture post-9/11, but a powerful return to cynical form, Green Day's dissent and frustration has inspired a new strength of craft in them as well. Armstrong's frustration comes out in seething anger: The ragged, rousing ""Letterbomb"" is both a melodic powder keg and a blaring bullhorn promoting the destruction of complacency, while the album's title track is energizing and provoking in the way effective punk revivalism should be. ""Nobody cares,"" Armstrong screams shrilly in ""Homecoming"", one of the album's two extended set pieces, and the line gets at American Idiot's greatest feat, besides its revitalization of Green Day's songwriting. Rather than preach, it digs out the fuse buried under mountains of 7-Eleven styrofoam trash, the cultural livewire that's grown cold in the shadow of strip-mall economics. Armstrong's characters are just misunderstood and disaffected individuals, told to get lost by a nation of fair and balanced sitcom watchers. They're apathetic suburbanite kids, grown up to find that life in the longview sucks. ""Jesus of Suburbia"" and the accompanying epic ""Homecoming"" are American Idiot's summarizing ideological and musical statements. Bookends, they respectively establish and bitterly conclude the record's storyline. Musically, they roll rapid-fire through vignettes of enormous drum fill rock, plaintive piano, Johnny Rotten impressions, and surprisingly strong harmonies. ""Suburbia"" references the melodies of ""All the Young Dudes"" and ""Ring of Fire""; ""Homecoming"" surveys both the Ramones and the Police's ""Born in the 50s""; and both songs owe their form and pacing to The Who. The album does drag on occasion-- the labored pacing of ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"" is a little too much, the price of ambition. But then there's ""She's a Rebel"", a simplistically perfect anthem of the sort the band's vapid followers (or their handlers) would likely muck up with string sections. For all its grandiosity, American Idiot keeps its mood and method deliberately, tenaciously, and angrily on point. Music in 2004 is full of well-meaning but pan-flashing sloganeers whose tirades against the government-- whether right or wrong-- are ultimately flat, with an overarching sense that what they're saying comes packaged with a spoil date of November '04. Though they do fling their share of surface insults, Green Day frequently look deeper here, not just railing against the political climate, but also striving to show how that climate has negatively impacted American culture. Ultimately, American Idiot screams at us to do something, anything-- a wake-up call from those were once shared our apathy.","West Coast pop-punks' first release in four years is the political concept album you didn't know they had in them. While never very lyrically insightful or poetic, American Idiot is certainly the band's most ambitious record to date, with a consistent narrative spun throughout its 13 tracks-- two of which boast runtimes in excess of nine minutes. Life-changing? Not a bit, but there's something to be said for having the balls.

EPS,Rah Bras,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30bb1335d7bf1698629/1:1/w_160/50035dc8.jpg,2004-09-22 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6928-eps/,Lovitt,"A Rah Bras performance is something of an epiphany. The air is buffeted by the malevolent cacophony of creepshow organs. People are wearing vaguely Nordic costumes and medieval weaponry. There's a lot of operatic caterwauling, zombie-porn moaning and general grab-assing about. Around the time the guy in a loincloth and horned helm climbs a Marshall stack and starts vamping with a broadsword, a moment of utter clarity descends, and you're struck by one of two revelations. It's either, ""Wow! I really enjoy art that revels in weirdness for its own sake and cuts through the monotony of daily life,"" or, ""Wow! This is really just a low-rent Renaissance Festival."" Listeners' appreciation of Rah Bras's music will hinge on their threshold for aggressively affected, recondite art that produces discomfort and uncertainty. EPS has enough substance to evoke physical and emotional responses, but its defiant oddness seems tailored to evoke a cerebral one as well-- the small voice of that bespectacled theory-wonk in the back of your head, muttering, ""Is it art?"" Which is a neat trick, considering that the impossibility of unraveling that question can prevent us from ever reaching the second, more pressing one: ""Do I like it?"" EPS collects three Rah Bras releases: two out-of-print EPs (originally released on Lovitt in 1997 and Vermiform in 1998, respectively), and a 2003 Lungcast Records EP recorded live in Japan. On their 2001 Lovitt LP, Ruy Blas!, Boo Rah, Jean Rah and Isabellarah Rubella demonstrably settled into a cohesive and discernible style. Their gibbering hybrid of beer-hall chants, dramatic pseudo-emoting, spooky synths, throbbing rhythms, and tortured, swirling arrangements remained multiform and strange, but were internally consistent. This consistency is displayed on the 2003 live recording: The warm, propulsive lines of ""Pancheerah"", the industrial-meets-New-Wave pulse of ""Skin = Chronized"", and the surprisingly faithful cover of the Isley Brothers' ""Conventions"" (here called ""Tokyo Bus Stop"") are all immediately identifiable as songs with inherent musical value. They're quite good: Imagine The Faint taking themselves a bit less seriously, with a rawer edge. But since the first two EPs, which comprise the bulk of this release, represent Rah Bras' formative years, it's not surprising that they're wildly inconsistent in terms of quality and style, as the band cast about in sundry directions without fully embarking on a single one. To find the good songs, you've got to wade through a bit of filler. Many of the pieces seem more like ideas for songs than completed compositions, and they veer erratically between being intriguing and completely uncalled for. Thus do homely little mutants like ""Nasty, Freak"", which sounds like CocoRosie aimlessly warbling over a 1980s Nintendo game soundtrack, jostle against excellent songs like ""R.C.M."", where some guttural Tom Waits jive talk rolls into a woozy, male/female electronic juke joint boogie in the vein of recent Fiery Furnaces as distilled into one potent minute. The first EP begins promisingly enough, with the Deerhoofian, melodic no-wave of ""FYC"" and the sort of cheesy but catchy enough synth-pop of ""Water Damage"", but the incipient momentum is broken by ""Bus Stop"", a grating collage of traffic sounds and detonating sonic shrapnel, and the meandering, demented sing-along ""Great Garden"". The second EP is more consistent, pinioned by the detuned synthetic piano, loose percussion and maniacal call-and-response vocals of ""Dead Bass Thing"", the dense, recessed prog and muttering oration of ""Jim, the Spelunker"", and the Rocky Horror-style cabaret ""Subtlights"", but it's also interlarded with questionable choices like the indistinctive minor-key dirge ""Poisson"" and the vexing synth-klezmer of ""Oui Oui Oui"". EPS is recommended to entrenched Rah Bras fans and those who want to frighten their parents, but newbies are encouraged to check out the more accessible and fully realized Ruy Blas! before venturing into these murkier, more treacherous environs.","Lovitt issues a collection of two studio EPs and a live one from these obscure but outlandish new-wave/industrial art-rockers.

Head Off,Moris Tepper,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88bb1335d7bf16992df/1:1/w_160/e04a07b0.jpg,2004-09-22 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8272-head-off/,Candlebone,"Moris Tepper proves a chameleon on Head Off, taking on and turning out the traditions of folk, blues, and brash, bleating exploration. Multiple avenues and dusty dirt roads intersect with Tepper's muse, which is fitting for a guy who played guitar with Captain Beefheart on Bat Chain Puller and has gone on to collaborations with types like Frank Black and Robyn Hitchcock. Head Off takes its time exploring those roads and avenues, guided at all times by Tepper's soulful groan, which itself transforms from Waitsian mutter (another past collaborator) to crumpled speaker cone whinny with steady-as-he-goes regularity. The result is a record that threatens to ramble but rarely does, and tempers its moves toward mature singer/songwriter territory with a handful of busted, freaky, and lurching howls. Lots of things come to mind during this flickering filmstrip. ""The Sky Was Grey"" is a few brief frames of plaintive, treated guitar and space-age sound effects, reflecting the shadowy new-century gothic of Jim White. Then there's ""Ricochet Man"", which, co-written with Mr. Don Van Vliet himself, offers two minutes of scatterbrained six-string, clattering, tumbling rhythms, and homemade vocal reverb. Here, all of a sudden, Head Off approaches the battered downtown sounds of Beefheart descendents Skeleton Key; Tepper holds it all together with an evocative vocal, and characters rendered just enough for us to imagine the scene. We might not know exactly what the Ricochet Man's going to do for us, but if his gifts are as potent as the song, then an ether bender isn't a far-flung possibility. It's this sharp songcraft that keeps the album's various parts rolling more or less succinctly down the pavement. While tense opener ""Bag of Nails"" seems sheared off the Pacific Northwest's noisier side, the resulting title track is a robust psychedelic country rocker led by harmonica and robust acoustic guitars. ""Why don't you stop thinking about it and take your head off?"" Tepper says, and it's good advice as the album rolls on. ""Mrs. Bodean"" tells a tale of bad blood and horse's bones; there's some morbid, sordid shit happening in its out-of-the-way places, but the tale unfolds on a melody full of both sadness and hope. There are no real facts, only clues left behind, but they're enough for some provisions and gas, to get us through Head Off's at once shuddering and graceful final act. The aptly-named ""Sourpuss"" and its accompanying ""Fast One"" mark the manic, noisier side of Tepper that the earlier ""Ricochet Man"" shakily pointed to. ""There's a banging in my head like there's something loose,"" he sings, as the electric guitars make sounds like chiggers and the percussion stomps and crashes. ""Fast"" employs loops and layered vocal personas from Tepper to suggest the disjointed thought process inside that broken brain. Still, as with the rest of Head Off, these exploratory pieces are played off gentle, evening-fire acoustic tracks. ""Any Left"" is one of these: Its coals fade to black shortly after it starts, but then a scratchy calliope whirs to life, taking Head Off out on a wistful, black and white note. It's like finding footage of fair goers dancing on the Midway at World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. Head Off might not bring everyone the same sort of imagery, but it will keep you guessing, and that trait is pure gold in Frownland.","Latest oddball release from a former collaborator of Captain Beefheart, Frank Black, Tom Waits and Robyn Hitchcock.

Vultures Await,Will Johnson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb415e6ef95969322b85/1:1/w_160/ef2358a8.jpg,2004-09-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4346-vultures-await/,Misra,"You can almost see the piano: It sits in some corner room of an old church in a small Texas town. It's an upright, with a finish that's scuffed and scarred. A few keys are yellowed and cracked, others are missing their ivories, revealing the diagonals of glue beneath. The lowest G-sharp key is gone. The pedals are loose, the upper registers stick, and the lower registers sound fuzzy, so the best-- or least bad-- sound comes from the middle range. This image is most likely false, a romantic projection of the piano's precarious tones. However it looked and wherever it stood, Johnson must have fallen in love with the instrument, as it's the centerpiece of the first three songs of his new solo album, Vultures Await. The piano is his only accompaniment on ""Catherine Dupree"", about a woman who burns down her alma mater, and the starkness of the arrangement works well with his bedraggled voice. ""Just to Know You've Been Dreaming"" fleshes out that sound with a full band, but that piano maintains its hold on your ear. But Johnson is a fickle artist, and by the fourth song, he's picked up his acoustic guitar again and left the piano alone. Next he falls in love with the sound of a violin, whose sweet notes curl around his vocals on ""Just Some Silence"" and ""Sleep a While"". Then he moves on to a drum machine on ""Closing Down My House"", whose coda layers programmed drums over real ones. The short ""On, Caldonia"" is just a simple melody plucked on banjo-- no voice, no words, just the instrument. You begin to wonder what he'll pick up next, until that piano returns in the penultimate ""Fly, My Sweet Dove"". Perhaps Johnson's fickleness stems from his prolific rate of production. Over a decade, the Texas-based musician has released an alarming number of albums, EPs, and one-off concert-only cassettes not just as a solo artist, but with three bands: Centro-Matic, The Foxymorons, and South San Gabriel. He works at a rate of approximately one or two releases a year, which, along with the untold number of songs that never fall on any one else's ears, amounts to an almost Pollardian output. So Johnson obviously finds his inspiration where he can and for as long as it lasts, whether in a piano for three songs or a drum machine for one. Vultures Await is the result of Johnson's musical restlessness, and it may be among his best-written and best-sounding collections to date. Gone is the garbled Americana pop of Centro-Matic and the sampled strings of his solo debut, Murder of Tides. In their place is a more fluid, flowing sound that draws more on typical alt-country structures and subjects; it may be more accessible, but it nevertheless seems sturdier and more disciplined. It could be Johnson's Heartbreaker, which may make long-term fans and anyone with a Ryan Adams phobia a little apprehensive. He still has a penchant for the overly poetic, and Vultures Await at times sounds exceedingly, almost obsessively dark. On ""Sleep a While"", he proclaims, ""The sea will not hold my soul/ The sky will not hold the stain."" He expresses such sentiments most effectively in the more fleshed-out songs, but when he attempts to put them across armed only with his guitar, as on ""Your Bulldozer"" and ""As Victims Would"", the darkness becomes something closer to dreariness and his normally confident melodies dissolve like ink on a rain-soaked letter. The final track, ""Nothin' but Godzilla"" offers the only moment in which he seems to be having a good time alone. Still, songs like ""Just to Know What You've Been Dreaming"" and ""Fly, My Sweet Dove"" are definitely memorable enough to anchor Vultures Await, and should attract new fans looking for music that is simultaneously sober-eyed and romantic, desert-dry yet saturated with emotion.

Night Piece,Shugo Tokumaru,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a888c0084474cd0c0e4b/1:1/w_160/c09123db.gif,2004-09-22 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8270-night-piece/,Music RelatedMusic Related,"There's not much information available about Shugo Tokumaru. Music Related, the small Japan-via-NYC label responsible for the release, says Shugo is from Tokyo and in his twenties and, perhaps inadvertently, suggests that the Beach Boys are his only influence. If anything, the two artists do share an affinity for bright, beautiful melodies: Shugo's hushed tenor and sparse acoustic guitar arrangements will also remind American indie-pop audiences of Sufjan Stevens, and the songs' unintrusive electronic embellishments recall Nobukazu Takemura and recent Fly Records releases from OMB and Tatsuya Yamada. Beyond that, there's not much of a gimmick to the songs on his debut album, Night Piece. Shugo doesn't seem to fit into the glut of bedroom IDMers and their sound-alike electro-acoustic alchemy, and in addition to an obvious geographical contradiction, Shugo is just way too melodic for the stateside free-folk scene. Really, Night Piece is ""just"" a pop album, short but dense and infinitely considered: No note seems unnecessary, and everything is in its right place. Fittingly, Night Piece starts at dusk. A million crickets drown out the night of ""Such a Color"" with sex-charged bug-buzz, when a sheepish Shugo begins to pluck out an equally fragile melody. The melody bursts. Shugo strums in resignation, and turns to a distant accordion for last-ditch support. The song congeals unexpectedly but beautifully, and Shugo quickly reclaims the melody for his voice, buttressing it with stringed confidence and, by the song's outro, a little bit of bravado. Other songs on Night Piece bear the same high degree of craftsmanship, but as the album presses on, we learn that Shugo has aspirations much larger than a string of catchy ditties. Through his prudent use of electronics, he begins to develop a strikingly unified worldview that Night Piece ultimately wills upon its listener. On ""Light Chair"", Shugo's guitar plucking stomps to a contrasting, docile woodblock melody before losing itself in winding arpeggios. ""Lantern on the Water"" shimmers as broad cello strokes are fed through a lo-fi sampler and percussive bell sounds try their best to harness the spectacle's majesty with an incidental beat. Shugo's sense of humor rears its head midway through Night Piece: The songs, which at times border on pastiche, somehow never undermine the album's cohesion. Taken together, these highly stylized compositions form something of a dream sequence: ""Sleet"" throws us into an 8-bit Dragon Warrior village, while the goofy ""The Mop"" drags our sudden spurs through the golden dust of the American West. Then, a chase scene: ""Paparazzi"" is Shugo's virtuosic take on the theme from ""The Benny Hill Show"", a cartoonish one-man mummer's parade that doesn't strut so much as run for its life, with an unexpected hammock-swaying break here and there between the ensuing fretted mischief. After covering so much musical terrain in only 23 minutes, Shugo finishes slowly and quietly with his unadorned lullaby, ""A Kite of Night"". The song doesn't take part in the world of Night Piece so much as consider it in retrospect-- it's the least evocative track on the album, but its most tender for that very reason. From its nakedness we realize just how rich a world Shugo has designed with Night Piece, and just how subtle his musical gestures are. So Night Piece is ""just"" pop music, but it manages to point well beyond itself, and regardless of who didn't influence it or what scenes it doesn't fit into, albums like this are always relevant, and always welcome.","Though Japanese names in Pitchfork pages most often point to experimental Powerbook artists or psych-rock freakouts, Shugo Tokumaru offers a wonderfully structured indie pop record, dense and infinitely considered: No note seems unnecessary, and everything is in its right place.

Grace: Legacy Edition,Jeff Buckley,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d79d034d5c69bf2f07/1:1/w_160/18d9d9a5.gif,2004-09-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/995-grace-legacy-edition/,ColumbiaColumbia,"Jeff Buckley was a diva. And a particularly fanciful one at that. I remember reading about the late soprano Maria Callas and Buckley fave Edith Piaf, the fragility of their demeanors, and the notion they were more precious, tender than the world around them; that every moment within earshot of their voices was like hearing the song of the most rare and beautiful bird in the world. In fact, Piaf as the ""Little Sparrow"" was the most obvious blueprint for Buckley's flighty, unabashedly emotional expression; in both cases, whether your reaction was to adore or abhor the often raw (but never adolescent) bouts of melo- and other kinds of drama, no one could say they held their hearts in check. Consequently, they needed lots of maintenance. In Buckley's case, it was a steady stream of collaborators, girls, gigs and an impressive reserve of torch songs from way back when. He really wasn't built for the strand of rock music borne of rebellion or release; he was a songbird, like the kind that used to receive roses and blown kisses from the debutantes in the balcony after performances. Unlike Callas and Piaf, Buckley grew up in an age when the chanteuse didn't need an orchestra or a symphony hall to get their message across. After having cut his musical teeth in Los Angeles, he came to New York in 1991 and soon hooked up with guitarist Gary Lucas, eventually joining his band Gods & Monsters. Lucas and Buckley established a partnership that produced some very good songs (including ""Mojo Pin"" and Grace's title track) in a very short time, but before they had a chance to make it out of the city, Buckley quit the band over a disagreement regarding his future loyalty. Afterwards, he played solo gigs, sometimes incorporating friend and bassist Mick Grondhal, and assisted by a growing legion of nighthawk fans, was soon signed by Columbia as a solo artist. 1993's Live at Sin-e EP gives the best idea of what Columbia's A&R; rep must have seen in Buckley at the time. At shows, he was the picture of a high diva: sprawling, boundless and with more than a pinch of self-conscious glitter. However, as he revealed in The Making of Grace, the behind-the-scenes feature that leads off the third disc DVD in Columbia's new ""Legacy"" edition reissue of his debut full-length, he needed a band. He already had Grondhal, met drummer Matt Johnson through Grace executive producer Steve Berkowitz, and, midway through recording the album, brought in guitarist Michael Tighe (who eventually contributed ""So Real"", to which Buckley added a chorus and put on the record in place of the bluesy ""Forget Her""). Producer Andy Wallace speaks on the documentary about his concerns over how much of the record should reflect Buckley's solo performances, but true to form, the singer wanted it all. Somehow, despite an overflow of ideas-- they needed three different band setups available at all times to accommodate Buckley's various moods-- the record got done. And it was released. And thousands of open-heart romantics heard their ship come in. As it happened, Grace was received with mixed feelings from critics who probably thought they were getting the next great alt-rock savior, and instead felt they'd received dinner theater for the moody crowd. They had a point: For all its swells of emotion and midnight dynamics, Grace was not a record to rally the post-grunge alternation. It made a jazz noise where a rock one was expected and a classical one where a pop one might have sold more records. MTV snagged ""Last Goodbye"", Grace's most radio-friendly song by a considerable margin, but Buckley was predestined for a cult stardom. Grace's strengths have been well-documented over the years: The flawless choice of cover songs, including the definitive reading of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" (that we learn on the documentary was actually chosen based on John Cale's 1991 version from the Cohen tribute I'm Your Fan); the mystic, blue textures of ""Mojo Pin"", ""So Real"" and ""Dream Brother"" that seemed as related to Led Zeppelin as to Scott Walker as to Buckley's father; Wallace's sympathetic, intimate production and the band's equally sensitive following of Buckley's lead. And of course, he sang the hell out of those songs. His voice turned upward songs that naturally leaned inward; his reading of Nina Simone's ""Lilac Wine"" transformed from misty cocktail lament into transcendental experience, and the unlikely recasting of English composer Benjamin Britten's ""Corpus Christi Carol"" into ambient lullaby. And, as this reissue proves, for every bit of lightning trapped in a jar, Buckley was willing to try his hand at many songs with which he held a weaker grasp. Firstly, he fancied himself a rock star, and the second disc of this set includes endearing, but ultimately inessential readings of the MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"", a pretty silly Screamin' Jay Hawkins impersonation on Leiber & Stoller's ""Alligator Wine"", and a speed-metal take on ""Eternal Life"". His version of Big Star's ""Kanga-Roo"" nails its weary grandeur, but goes overboard on the ensuing 11-minute jam session, effectively transforming it from intimidating wall of drone into a meandering, albeit unfinished and tentative giant. He sounds best interpreting songs like Bukka White's ""Parchman Farm Blues"", Simone's ""The Other Woman"", and Bob Dylan's ""Mama, You Been On My Mind"", though his own take on the blues-- the previously unreleased ""Forget Her""-- sounds comparatively pedestrian. So, the question becomes how frustrated you are willing to be with Buckley. His posthumous releases suggest what Grace did: that he was one of the most talented musicians of his generation, while also being one of the most impulsive and, often, maddeningly inconsistent. Is he really being served by the uncovering of outtakes, B-sides and live performances? Fans certainly think so, but I won't cop to listening very beyond his lone completed record these days. And it bears emphasizing that its rewards have lost nothing in 10 years. Grace remains one of the most engaging, inspired records ever made, and its 10 original songs serve as the best possible portrait of Buckley as a diva, songwriter and artist.","Ten years after its release, legendary vocalist Jeff Buckley's only proper full-length is given the expanded treatment. Like the similar edition of The Clash's London Calling reviewed earlier this week, it's been extravagantly repackaged and appended with two additional discs-- one an audio disc collecting non-album tracks, the other a DVD documentary spotlighting the recordings sessions.

Godfather Buried Alive,Shyne,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a682ea9e61561daa53ab/1:1/w_160/e971d0b7.jpg,2004-09-21 05:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7778-godfather-buried-alive/,Def Jam,"The image and presence of the American prison holds an unmatchable presence in hip-hop culture. As a significant piece of middle and upper class America's fascination with the black urban male, the prison serves as the proper denouement for the gangsta ethos-- the state-designated rejoinder to a life of crime and chaos. In hip-hop, prison time equals instant credibility. The quiet mass of incarceration outweighs even the deftest emcee's verbal posturing and childish braggadocio. Moreover, pop culture has tagged prison with a sacred monasticism; inmates enter as thugs and leave as poets. (Pac's opus All Eyez on Me, for instance, came off the heels of his incarceration.) Of course, the surge in street cred and gift of perspective come at a price-- namely, that you were once in prison. For a public starved for something more from commercial hip-hop than jewels, ass and titties, Jamal ""Shyne"" Barrow's sophomore release is welcome throwback, drawing listeners into harsh pulp fiction that invokes the criminal spirit of Chester Himes. Shyne the rapper and the person exist simultaneously as he backs his narratives with a 10-year sentence at Clinton Correctional and the public's usual anticipation for this album's release. Few could have foreseen that success and security of his eponymous debut would have vanished like Diddy and J. Lo's getaway car. Unfortunately, anyone hoping for ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail 2004"" will be kept waiting. Godfather Buried Alive exemplifies the limitations of the gangsta genre. Unlike magicians like Ice Cube or Biggie who repeatedly refitted their chronicles of violence and spawned a generational backlash, Shyne falls into a Mad Libs style of fill-in-the-felony lyricism. Over the haunting banshee vocals on the Kanye-produced ""More or Less"", Shyne drops wanting lines like, ""I'm living to die,"" and, ""Fuckin' big stars and big cars/ I can say I've seen it all and done it all."" When Shyne opens his material to a subject broader than dumping snitches in the river, he only manages tautological nonsense like, ""Hip-hop ain't responsible for violence in America/ America is responsible for violence in America."" ""Behind the Walls"" delivers more of Shyne's bumper-sticker gangsterisms: ""It's not where you from, it's where your gat at."" Even the slick synth strings and Ashanti's surprisingly in-key vocals on ""Jimmy Choo"" come off mismatched. Shyne's battle-hardened cries for a chick who can cook his drugs hardly match Ashanti's chirps of, ""Can't nobody touch me like you do."" The duo make a hard case for hip-hop's oddest couple, competing only with the Nappy Roots and Marcos from P.O.D.'s ""Aww Naww"" rock remix fiasco. Shyne's misgivings, of course, are not without contrast: His response to 50 Cent's Hot 97 diss is brilliant handbook for D.I.Y. beef. He dogs 50 over the telephone from prison. One more time: on the telephone... from prison. Scrap the presidential debates. Bush and Kerry should take their ish out over IM from Rikers. Moreover, Godfather's final cut, ""Diamonds and Mack 10s"", bleeds wrenching pathos and offers a profound, chilly cross-section of a Crown Heights black male. Shyne momentarily lifts the thug's facade to recount the characteristic nihilism of the gangster credo: ""I'm suicidal, can't take this pressure or this pain/ Too much for these young eyes/ Real g's don't die, that's a lie / 'Cause I'm dyin' inside, cryin' inside."" Shyne's ghostly stanzas ebb with intensity until his unnerving conclusion: ""I see demons."" While Godfather is not Shyne's strongest release, his return to the gangster narrative may well spark a new generation of truth-baring rappers to bring C. Dolores Tucker back from obscurity. While the J-Kwons and Juveniles enjoy the fruits of paradise and their Lexus helicopters, Shyne reminds us of the ones who didn't make it: the legions of his fellow Clinton inmates fighting to keep afloat under prison's psychic burden.","Scapegoat of P.

When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog,Jens Lekman,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd1abf31b7dc7156027/1:1/w_160/8ccc0843.jpg,2004-09-21 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4969-when-i-said-i-wanted-to-be-your-dog/,Secretly Canadian,"The brush of lips against a cheek, a few short phrases on a postcard-- pair these things with a plaintive melody, and you have the stuff that wet dreams about a young Mia Farrow are made of. Belle & Sebastian have made a tidy living at this kind of music, while types like Kings of Convenience prefer to put the kettle on and take the time to tell a quiet story. Jens Lekman offers a little bit of both approaches, as well as shared notches on the genealogical influence tree-- Morrissey, classic AM pop, self-examining folk, and the sardonic wit of Paul Heaton. But Lekman's real talent is remaining forever the optimist. He's Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock that's tearing from the wall, but still smiling at the ladies from beneath his snap brim. Let's have a hand for deadpan Swedish romantics-- they've got the grip to make the maudlin fun again. Lekman can be lovelorn. He's also been known to write keening song arcs about terminal teenager Rocky Dennis (whom you may recall as the tragic figure of the 1985 Eric Stoltz film Mask). However, he usually tempers his melodramatic tendencies with screwy tangents and truckloads of self-deprecation. That's the name of the game on When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog, his first full-length after a series of well-received EPs. The Rocky Dennis EP holdover ""If You Ever Need a Stranger [to sing at your wedding]"" includes Lekman's Moz-like resolution to cut off his arm in the name of true love. But this is in the context of a concisely hopeful, piano-and-whistling ditty that ends with Jens the wedding singer looking forward to the blind possibility of meeting his true love at the reception buffet table. ""Happy Birthday, Dear Friend Lisa"" is busier, its assembled scratch-pop lilt defined by skeletal bossa nova and Caribbean loops. They tickle Lekman's glowering vocal cheerily as Lisa blows out the candles and Jehovah's Witnesses knock on the door. He knows he can't kiss her, 'cause she's only a friend, but he knows God can't either, and that's a victory in his black book. Lekman also vacillates between caddish selfishness (he dumps his girl during a riot; like breaking it off in an upscale restaurant, it's one place you know there won't be a scene) and hazy romantic encounters with no strings attached. He can't help wanting more from his bedmate in ""Cold Swedish Winter"", but she just ""wants somebody to hold me through the night."" (The accompanying female vocal is also one of the album's prettiest melodies.) These dynamics and When I Said's spare arrangements lessen Lekman's Cute Factor, that frustrating, well-appointed nattiness that frequently mars Belle, Sebastian, and most of the rest of the twee establishment. His songs usually suggest some past melody or song (or at least Stephin Merritt), but their characters, situations, and Jens himself are represented with such casual seriousness that they're immediately endearing. Sleepy mandolins and love theme synthesizers team up for ""Psychogirl"", and the result is high comedy when Lekman imagines a meeting, budding romance, and ultimate breakup in the fleeting moments of a few half-thoughts. His grip is slipping on the clock, but he had to shift to get a better look at the filly in the office below. In the end, Lekman's greatest victory might be rhyming ""#2"" with ""coochie-coo"" and not causing fingers to reach down throats. The song, album opener ""Tram #7 to Heaven"", is three minutes of driving a Citroën up a billowy cloud staircase, where the climax lists the various trams and routes. Fun, love, misery, opportunity, life, and the ultimate ascent: The trams are Lekman's options, lined up and harp-twiddled in bittersweet and blistered-- but ultimately still optimistic-- relief.","Debut full-length from this Secretly Canadian singer/songwriter straddles the line between twee-pop and hushed Norwegian folk, but his lyrical ingenuity is this record's strong suit.

Oxeneers or The Lion Sleeps When Its Antelope Go Home,These Arms Are Snakes,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8879d034d5c69bf3a80/1:1/w_160/6aa8910d.jpg,2004-09-21 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8269-oxeneers-or-the-lion-sleeps-when-its-antelope-go-home/,Jade Tree,"Formed from the remnants of Botch and Kill Sadie, These Arms Are Snakes released their 2003 debut EP, This Is Meant to Hurt You, as a relatively accessible announcement of a notable new voice in punk music. Alternately melodic and inundated with noise, willfully abrasive and easily approachable, the EP raised expectations for the band's forthcoming full-length and backed up the band's steady opening spot on last year's Blood Brothers tour. The band has finally emerged from the buzz created from its previous release with Oxeneers, a challenging debut that sidesteps inflated expectations by staying close to the group's established sound while still demonstrating a flexibility conducive to future musical development. The album opens with an assault of rhythmic mechanical noise. Slowly, Erin Tate's methodical drumming imperceptibly melts into the cacophony, and an angular guitar riff obliterates the artificiality of the track's introduction. The resulting ""Shit Sisters"" is the most definitive example of TAAS's hybridization of diverse influences to date. The song blends Steve Snere's sullen screamo vocals, Ryan Frederiksen's math-rock guitar precision, a trademark prog breakdown, and seamlessly inserted bursts of noise into a concise, piercing, and melodic statement of purpose. The song also introduces the album's recurrent thematic strand of suffocating domesticity (""May there be porcelain/ 401K plans/ NASDAQ""), a theme further emphasized by Snere's conceit that most songs on the album were based on his experiences at a thankless check-cashing temp job. Snere admirably seeks to take back the potency of suburban decay as a compelling image system from the clutches of countless overnight pop/punk sellouts. His depictions of abusive domestic situations and tales of mental escape from oppressive middle-class environments are frequently harrowing and affectingly sincere. ""Angela's Secret"" pulsates with bleak energy, twisting a grimy bassline and militaristic rhythm into a moving portrayal of one woman's agony in trying to raise her children while working at an interminable dead-end job. Funereal ballad ""Your Pearly Whites"" uses a backdrop of sludgy guitars and sinister organ to aid Snere's disturbing oral-fixated reflection on the emotional scars of domestic abuse. TAAS's glaring weakness is their tendency toward disengaging academic indulgence. The album's subtitle, like the band's name itself, superficially hints at a certain pretentiousness that can be felt in the album's most over-exerted tracks. The largely instrumental ""Gadget Arms"", heavy with foreboding harmonic atmospherics, disorienting reverb, and affected noise, initially complements Snere's intimately graphic imagery (""Breathe on me/ Never spit your last tooth"") but grows tedious over the course of its 7-minute runtime. Interludes like the elegiac organ instrumental ""Tracing"" and found sound collage ""Oxeneers"" add texture to the album, but feel like labored artistic afterthoughts. The album's melodic underpinnings, however, are its unmitigated strong suit-- the most memorable material derives its power from the complex construction of succinct and simple musical ideas. The terse ""La Stanza Bianca"" fuses undisguised hardcore verses with a disconnected synth line and post-punk rhythm guitar, and the captivating ""Idaho"" forms several compelling elements-- a waltzing lo-fi organ progression, dueling math-rock guitars, and shifting time signature-- into a sprawling but rewardingly cohesive finale. Oxeneers adequately realizes the potential of This Was Meant to Hurt You, but the band could easily cut some of the prog-rock fat that intermittently hinders the album's momentum. These Arms Are Snakes is a promising venture of a group juggling several parallel engagements and side projects (including Minus the Bear), though the band occasionally stumbles in establishing a singular voice. Somewhere beneath the heavy exterior and detached indulgence is a jagged post-punk outfit screaming to be let free.","Jade Tree issues the willfully abrasive yet easily approachable debut full-length from this new hardcore five-piece formed from ex-members of Botch and Kill Sadie.

Offshore Presents: Troubled Waters,DJ Clever,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8feb335119a49eca74/1:1/w_160/62034db8.gif,2004-09-21 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2577-offshore-presents-troubled-waters/,Microcosm,"This year, Chicago's Metro-- the city's most famed indie rock club-- has often served as home to drum 'n' bass' old-timers circuit. It's telling, and even a little appropriate, that when artists such as Goldie, Grooverider, DJ SS, DJ Hype, Shy FX, and others have made appearances in Chicago, they've been booked into a venue best known for its ties to indie royalty than forward-looking dance music. After all, it wasn't until jungle had devolved from visceral hardcore and its forward-looking peak to its chin-stroking artcore dead-end that it finally began to play in Peoria. By the time drum 'n' bass crossed into indie consciousness, could newcomers be blamed for wondering what the fuss was about? For most of the past 10 years, a ""jungle night"" in America has more likely been held in a hipster tavern or a dimly lit lounge than on a sweat-soaked dancefloor-- it's no wonder that most of the genre's devotees abandoned it for garage or hip-hop or a revitalized house. But perhaps more surprising is that it's making a comeback-- and not only turning the heads of hardened old-timers, but also providing a way in for those whom missed it the first time around. One of the best ways to engage with contemporary drum 'n' bass is Troubled Waters, a DJ Clever mix culled from the 12-inch releases on his Offshore Recordings label. Clever's mix doesn't so much recover jungle's fumbled ball and run with it as it does survey the sound's peak. In that sense, Troubled Waters is a primer on the best of d'n'b circa 2004, which reflects the best of d'n'b circa 1996. With only a handful of releases in the Offshore recordbox, Clever doesn't have the luxury of choosing tracks based on compatibility or a shared sense of style, but the record is oddly better off for it: Clever's unusual transitions provide variety and personality, as he blends leftfield drum 'n' bass that lurches from crisp, microscopically chopped beats to more soul-jazz-style excursions. Deep Blue (of ""Helicopter Tune"" fame) contributes two tracks and nicely represents the jungle vanguard, but most of the offers are from young, largely unknown producers. Appropriately absent, then, are many of the old cliches and templates-- ""Amen"" breaks, drug-heightened post-rave anxiety, pre-millennial tension. Indeed, many of these are no longer even applicable. In their place isn't, to the possible dismay of some, a baton-pass to some new tech-driven reemergence of the cult of progression or the hyperkinetic, playful ""all killer, no filler"" that has characterized the ragga-jungle revival. Instead, up-and-comers such as Sileni, Paradox, and Intex Systems seem trained on a balance between texture, intricate drum patterns, and noise in a way that recalls glitchy IDM and techno more than most of contemporary jungle's jazz-prog snorers. Fairly abstract and scatterbrained, Offshore's output boasts lush washes of cinematic pleasure (Seba's ""Make My Way Home"") and ping-ponging excursions into sound (Sileni's ""Twitchy Droid Leg""), and even has a pair of almost purely rhythmic tracks appropriately titled ""Drum Track 1"" and ""Drum Track 2"". Clever keeps things fresh and well-paced by skipping across a constantly shifting landscape rather than aiming to extract a mix's typical ebb and flow from a pool of tracks which don't seem to offer him that possibility. In the early to mid-1990s, the sheer speed with which jungle progressed almost inherently kept all but its most dedicated devotees at arm's length. Its quick turnover in vocabulary, style, and sound-- particularly considering these were the dark pre-Internet days-- made it one of that era's more clique-y and obsessive genres. Each shift in style was so on the heels of the one before it that even largely uniform sets seemed thrilling to The In Crowd, even if they were monolithic to those peering through the windows. Troubled Waters acts as a something of a second chance for those window shoppers. Even Offshore's playful sleeves-- with Pete Fowler-esque characters which are reminiscent of the ghost, boy, and bird that serve as mascots for Ghostly International and Spectral Sound-- are warm and inviting. So while Troubled Waters is a lifeline to the contemporary underground for those set adrift on their blissful jungle memories, the record is also, more importantly, a lifejacket which finally allows toe-dippers to dive in at the deep end.","With jungle and drum 'n' bass experiencing a renaissance of late, Offshore labelhead DJ Clever offers a primer on the best of the current crop.

Niño Rojo,Devendra Banhart,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20eea9e61561daa4947/1:1/w_160/2dfee453.gif,2004-09-21 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/550-nino-rojo/,Young God,"It's funny that Young God founder Michael Gira should make a point in the press release for Niño Rojo that his role in Devendra Banhart's career was merely to release his music, that everything else took care of itself. I imagine Gira felt strongly about Banhart from the get-go, and his pleasant surprise that the rest of the world (inasmuch as Banhart's newfound popularity translates to the ""rest"" of anything) has since come to agree is equally understandable. Yet, I wonder if, like me, Gira gets the feeling that Banhart has arrived at a place where he's independent of Young God, himself, or his press. Journalists are often accused of hubris, wherein they're supposed to believe the things they write about are necessarily benefited due to increased publicity. In fact, musicians can benefit from this, but if I'm to believe Gira (and I do), Banhart's success is due more to people responding ""honestly to his music."" The last time I wrote about Banhart, regarding his Rejoicing in the Hands album from earlier this year, I emphasized how removed from contemporary context his songs felt. His music seemed to me neither superficially ""odd"" nor caught up in what my fellow music writers call ""freak-folk"" (despite the fact that Banhart's compilation Golden Apples of the Sun assisted greatly in defining the term). His music felt like the impressions of one person, stopped along the way to record things he saw or thought, and that even when I had no idea what he was talking about, the conviction at the heart of the songs would resound a long, deep chord. Almost two seasons later, things feel different: Like it or not, Banhart no longer sings for just one person (either himself, or whomever is hearing him) and, more than with any other artist, I'll identify him with 2004. How's that for context? Okay, so for the first fallacy in my revelation: None of the songs on Niño Rojo are any more or less intrinsically bound to 2004 than those on Rejoicing in the Hands. They were recorded at the same Lynn Bridges-coordinated sessions that produced the prior album, and in fact will be released as a single double-vinyl set with Rejoicing soon. I could take a very easy way out and assume that over time, these records will blend into one experience, in all likelihood becoming the definitive collection of Banhart's songs. However, where I formerly praised the singer/songwriter for taking me back to a time before MP3s and compulsive music consumption, I now believe that his preferences for surreal list-songs and lazy sing-alongs are simply an excellent counterpoint to these modern extravagances. And counterpoints are reactionary; they never exist alone. The second fallacy is that by admitting that Banhart's music seems to have a different audience or status within whatever group he's supposed to speak for, despite not actually ""changing,"" is that I assume he was ever speaking for anyone-- even scarier, that his music should necessarily be judged by whichever way the wind is blowing. Personally speaking, that's a sickening thought, but one that I take for granted in most mainstream music analysis. Gira talks about honest responses to music, and mine is that Banhart's songs are now as typically, idiosyncratically ""him"" as ever. I have the faint impression of a returning traveler, despite knowing these pieces aren't actually ""new."" However, it's not spring anymore, and few who hear this record are going to be in the same frame of mind they were last April. Perhaps that's a good argument for originally releasing Niño Rojo with Rejoicing as a double-CD set. It's no judgment against Banhart, but my gut says this music will be received slightly less enthusiastically than his prior work. That said, the music, fittingly, inevitably speaks for itself. The most interesting to me are the songs that suggest Banhart could become some kind of mythical roots-rocker, as on ""We All Know"" and ""Be Kind"". There, I imagine a very informal meeting of the minds in Memphis, where the ghosts of Richard Manuel, Gram Parsons and a drunk Joe Strummer bark out the choruses in Banhart's half-euphoric, half-tossed off songs. But he's preoccupied with other things: ""The light of this whole world and mind aligns your legs to time."" I think that means he has a crush on CocoRosie's Bianca Casady, to whom ""Be Kind"" is dedicated. He gets even more to the point on ""A Ribbon"", with his most straightforward request, ""I'd like to sleep with you if you'd like me to."" However, Banhart's disinterest in obvious narratives is, for now, his greatest strength. Even when, as on ""Ay Mama"", his statements would be clear, he obscures them. ""Ay Mama, no hay que llorar,"" repeated over delicate, finger-picked acoustic guitar figures, serves as mantra-- all the better not knowing he's trying to persuade his mother that it's not necessary to cry. Would the song have more emotional weight if I didn't have to google the translation? Banhart, throughout Niño Rojo, demonstrates that it wouldn't; the whimsical non-sequiturs of ""We All Know"" (""Like the type of tongue that roots from your breast/ And it shakes your pretty little clavicle""), the zoological parade of ""Little Yellow Spider"" (where Banhart pays tribute to pigs mating with men, crabs turning to crab-cakes, and white monkeys who figured out something he couldn't understand) and the poetic depictions of ""Owl Eyes"" (""Semilla/ Owl Eyes unwinding/ Asia/ All your little diamonds, all your little diamonds"") reveal little beyond the impressions of dusty, old calm and the American surreal. Banhart covers Ella Jenkins' ""Wake Up, Little Sparrow"" as the opener to this album. The 80-year-old Jenkins has a made a career of creating children's folk music with an educational and inclusively moral bent, and perhaps lends Niño Rojo its best context: Over time, beyond cultural movement and sociological or musicological phenomenon, Banhart's record makes the most sense at the mercy of simple pleasures and the young at heart. You want truth? Beauty? They're here, in basic forms. Progress and relevance are very different concerns, and ones I'm willing to leave to historians with a better advantage. And as all Gira had to do was release the stuff, at the moment, I'm content to listen in turn.","Freak-folk progenitor Devendra Banhart's second full-length this year offers a separate collection of songs recorded during the same sessions as this spring's masterful Rejoicing in the Hands, effectively serving as its counterpart.

London Calling: 25th Anniversary Legacy Edition,The Clash,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e9ea9e61561daa524d/1:1/w_160/cafd6cc6.gif,2004-09-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1490-london-calling-25th-anniversary-legacy-edition/,Epic,"The 25th anniversary reissue of The Clash's London Calling is satisfyingly thick and protected by a thin plastic sleeve. The package sits fat at three stories high; the spine is broad, smooth and silver. Pennie Smith's unfocused, emblematic cover shot remains intact, with Paul Simonon's bass hovering, vertical and doomed, between Elvis-baiting pink and green text. Stacked inside are three separate discs: the original 19-song album, a 21-track disc containing rehearsal sessions for the record (""the long lost Vanilla Tapes""), and a DVD of The Last Testament, Don Letts' 30-minute, after-the-fact documentary about the making of London Calling. Here, neatly lined up: preparation, realization, hindsight. Finally. This is how they did it. For those who came of age in the late 80s and early 90s, calling The Clash a punk band was (and remains) more a matter of affect than honesty-- in 2004, wholly and completely divorced from a context that never fully resonated with a global audience, The Clash are a rock band, and 1979's London Calling is their creative apex, a booming, infallible tribute to throbbing guitars and spacious ideology. By the late 70s, ""punk"" was more specifically linked with rusted safety pins, shit-covered Doc Martens, and tight pink sneers than any steadfast, organized philosophy; The Clash insisted on forefronting their politics. This album tackles topical issues with impressive gusto-- the band cocks their cowboy hats, assumes full outlaw position, and pillages the world market for sonic fodder and lyric-ready injustice. A quarter-century after its first release, London Calling is still the concentrate essence of The Clash's unparalleled fervor. As always, London Calling's title track holds steady as the record's cosmic lynchpin: Horrifyingly apocalyptic, ""London Calling"" is riddled with weird werewolf howls and big, prophetic hollers, Mick Jones' punchy guitar bursts tapping little nails into our skulls, pushing hard for total lunacy. Empowered and unafraid, Strummer reveals self-skewering prophecies, panting hard about nuclear errors and impending ice ages. He also spitefully lodges some of the most unpleasantly convincing calls to arms ever committed to tape, commanding his followers-- now, then, future-- to storm the streets at full, leg-flailing sprints. Even if The Clash were more blatantly inspired by the musical tenets of dub and reggae, ""London Calling"" unapologetically cops the fury of punk's blind-and-obliterate full-body windmilling, bypassing the cerebral cortex to sink deep into our muscles. From ""London Calling"" on, The Clash do not let go; each track builds on the last, pummeling and laughing and slapping us into dumb submission. And now, we get to watch how it fell together: Using only a Teac four-track tape recorder linked up to a portastudio, The Clash inadvertently immortalized their London Calling rehearsal sessions at Vanilla Studios (a former rubber factory-gone-rehearsal-space in Pimlico, London) in the summer of 1979, several weeks before the album sessions officially opened at Wessex Studios. One set of tapes got left on the Tube. Another got crammed into a box. The intricate (and generally convoluted) mythology of the ""long lost recording"" is embarrassingly familiar to rock fans-- even non-completists are awkwardly prone to chasing down bits of buried tape with insane, eye-bulging intensity. With precious few exceptions, the anticipation of a hidden, indefinitely concealed secret generally supercedes the impact of the actual artifact. Still, the possibility of stumbling into transcendence keeps the search heated, and sometimes stupidly dramatic. Earlier this month, Mick Jones bravely explained to Mojo's Pat Gilbert exactly how he uncovered the tapes: ""I sensed where they were and that took me to the right box. I opened it up and found them... It was pretty amazing."" Snicker all you want at the supernatural, sixth-sense implications, or at the idea of Jones' third eye blazing hot for misplaced Clash recordings-- the 21 tracks that the constitute The Vanilla Tapes are just revealing enough to justify all the smoky mysticism. The tapes feature five previously unheard cuts-- ""Heart and Mind"", ""Where You Gonna Go (Soweto)"", ""Lonesome Me"", the instrumental ""Walking the Slidewalk"", and a cover of Matumbi's version of Bob Dylan's ""The Man in Me"", plucked from Dylan's 1970 album New Morning and reproduced in full reggae glory-- and together they reveal producer Guy Stevens' influence on the final sound of London Calling: muddy, raw, and insistently vague, The Vanilla Tapes see The Clash working hard, but also grasping for a muse. Professionally, Guy Stevens was best known for ""discovering"" The Who and producing a handful of Mott the Hoople records, but it was his recreational exploits that carved the deepest cut into Britain's collective pop memory. With a frenzied halo of tightly curled brown hair and a penchant for destroying property, Stevens came to rule Wessex Studios, hurling chairs and ladders, wrestling with engineers, and famously dumping a bottle of red wine into Strummer's Steinway piano. Fortunately, Guy was far more concerned with encouraging ""real, honest emotion"" than with achieving technical perfection (true to form, London Calling has its fair share of slipped fingers), and consequently, the band's determination at Vanilla, coupled with Stevens' shitstorming, led to London Calling's odd and glorious balance of studied dedication and absurd inspiration. And if The Vanilla Tapes aren't enough to satisfy your voyeuristic tendencies, there's more. For The Last Testament, documentarian/DJ Don Letts (also responsible for Clash on Broadway and Westway to the World) weaves together bits of live footage, interviews with punk pundits and band members (they spout tiny clarifications between snickers and cigarette huffs), promotional videos, and a few small, grainy glimpses of the band recording at Wessex. The studio shots were culled from footage that, like The Vanilla Tapes, had been unknowingly cardboard boxed for years-- in early 2004, former manager Kosmo Vinyl up a crate containing 84 minutes of hand-held footage of the London Calling sessions. Most of the film turned out to be unusable, but Letts salvaged some revealing shots of Stevens in fine form, wrestling with ladders and banging around chairs, in a curious reversal of classic producer/band hijinx. As an instruction manual, the 25th anniversary edition of London Calling offers up bits of helpful, ordinary wisdom (he who fucks nuns will later join the church, no one gets their shit for free-- and ""Balls to you, big daddy!"" is an infallible exit line), but the album's biggest lesson is still spiritual. Like a bit of good gossip or a dog-eared copy of On the Road, Clash tapes tend to get passed around, and wind up forming countless intimate, enduring, and cathartic bonds. That Joe Strummer's handwritten lyrics and modest scribblings have finally been tucked into the liner notes is only appropriate: London Calling is just as precious. ","A quarter-century on from its 1979 release, The Clash's London Calling remains one of punk's defining documents. Now it's been given its proper due from Epic, who today are releasing an expanded three-disc edition that covers the original LP, a set of 21 demos (including five previously unheard tracks), and a DVD containing The Last Testament, Clash documentarian Don Letts' film about the album's creation. And that's not even getting into the set's lavish fetishist packaging.

Let's Bottle Bohemia,The Thrills,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7985e6ef95969321002/1:1/w_160/383ef66c.jpg,2004-09-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8038-lets-bottle-bohemia/,Virgin,"Jeff Bridges' character in The Big Lebowski listens to Creedence and hates the fuckin' Eagles because he's a Northern California Dude in the City of Angels. On their eagerly sun-spattered debut So Much for the Cities, The Thrills sidestepped such internecine quarrels by delving a bit deeper into the state's complex psyche than, ""San Diego, hey, that's where all the kids go."" No one minded much, thanks to achingly low-key pop gems like the gorgeous debut single, ""Big Sur"". But somewhere between there and here, these Dubliners must have stumbled through Watts; lost innocence hangs over their sophomore release like San Fernando Valley smog. Instead of Santa Cruz or Hollywood, The Thrills' continuing travelogue takes us through ""New York Cit-aaaaay"" (rhymes with ""committ-ay,"" at least when you're imitating the Stones' faked American accents). That's when singer/songwriter Conor Deasy's narrator isn't going down in flames, burning bridges or dry-humping on dancefloors. Meanwhile, the record was made in Los Angeles, and ""the city"" looms large and desolate as the songs' backdrops. ""I guess that everybody went to a better party,"" Deasy whines. Good for them. Of course, So Much for the City wasn't exactly a day at the beach, either, despite the deceptively upbeat arrangements, which softly but deftly evoked The Beach Boys and Byrds. Musically, Let's Bottle Bohemia opens with a big fake-out: a killer distorted guitar riff worthy of AC/DC circa High Voltage. If this were Jet or The Vines, an exaggerated, phony scream would punctuate the second-hand rebelliousness, but instead, Deasy elegantly leads the band into a shiny midtempo rocker much like the debut's ""One Horse Town"". The crucial difference is the newly jaded swagger in Deasy's ever-almost-breaking voice. ""The streets aren't paved with gold,"" he concedes, but he fights to hide how much that hurts. Largely absent are the spacey Grandaddy synths that occasionally lent the band's debut a pleasant jolt of modernity. Instead, ""Not for All the Love in the World"" infuses the proceedings with a heady rush of Coldplay melodrama. Against the odds, its deliberate pacing and understated lyrics (""She didn't realize, that's a lot of love"") make for a subtle highlight. Lead single ""Whatever Happened to Corey Haim"" is the real surprise, sounding like K.C. & The Sunshine State with absurd Three Degrees strings backing a melody fit for Ben Folds' solo work. ""Just don't change a thing,"" Deasy pleaded on the debut's ""Deckchairs and Cigarettes"". The Thrills didn't, and neither did new producer Dave Sardy, despite a resume that includes production work for Marilyn Manson, Slayer, and (shock!) Jet. But something changed them. ""You can take the city,"" Deasy sings on ""Faded Beauty Queens"", which features tasteful guitar work from R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and tells one of the album's many stories of broken dreams and vanished glory (ahem, Corey Haim). They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. The Thrills didn't find it to be that, exactly. But their forlorn, polished California pop is like the sprawling Valley suburbs: nice enough, if that's your sort of thing.","Ireland's only California sunshine pop band ups the bombast on their follow-up to last year's So Much for the City.

The Heat Can Melt Your Brain,Viva Voce,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a237ea9e61561daa49af/1:1/w_160/9ce18cc5.jpg,2004-09-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8520-the-heat-can-melt-your-brain/,Minty Fresh,"There's a repeating scene in my house in which one member of the household will ask the other, ""Anything you want to do this weekend?"" and the asked will respond with something along the lines of, ""I dunno. Was there anything you wanted to do?"" Ultimately, a weekend itinerary is cobbled together off the cuff, bike rides and drives to Evanston sandwiched around chores and weekend work. It's not a perfect system, but it works okay and leaves room for spontaneous frozen custard runs. In the house of Anita & Kevin Robinson of Portland, Oregon, I imagine the conversation goes more like this: Anita: ""What do you want to do this weekend?"" Kevin: ""I dunno. Cut a record?"" Anita: ""Sure. Let's set up the living room."" The couple makes their music a part of their domestic life, recording as a duo in their own abode-- their Big Pink if you like. Their music doesn't really betray their personal relationship to one another in any specific terms, but it definitely has that home-cooked feel that announces its humble origins, even as their third album, The Heat Can Melt Your Brain, enters moodier, more dramatic territory than its predecessors. The Robinsons are nothing if not ambitious, and their songs have blossomed into involved, thoughtfully arranged opuses that easily fold bells, celeste, saw, kazoo and surprisingly complex backing harmonies into their varied sections. The Heat Can Melt Your Brain opens with ""Alive with Pleasure"", which sets a crunching burst of frazzled fuzz bass and bowed saw against the airy sing-song melody that Anita swings between weightless and propulsive passages. This all leads up to a nasty guitar outburst-- one of many showcases Anita's supple playing receives throughout the album, from the backward slashes that cut the inky funk of ""Business Casual"" to the spacey eagletoned interjections on ""The Center of the Universe"". The latter is one of the album's finest songs, as Kevin's verse vocal echoes over watery organ and thumping drums, building to a strident, majestic chorus. He also manages to squeeze in one of the album's most openly sentimental verses: ""The center of my heart is a beautiful girl/ One tear from her face could destroy the world."" Kevin gets the lead on ""High Highs"", as well, a smoothly funky tune with a simmering, R&B-inflected; chorus, and one of the duo's most adventurous songs to date. That it's wedged between Anita's floating guitar freakout ""The Lucky Ones"" and the mellotron- and synth-drenched indie rock thump of ""Daylight"" is a stark illustration of the band's range, which extends even further on closer ""They Never Really Wake Up"", a gauzy interstellar lounge cut stuffed with wordless vocals and a bass part that Air by all rights should have included on Moon Safari. It's hard to say exactly where Viva Voce ought to be filed, as they've more or less slid out of any one category on The Heat Can Melt Your Brain. This, however, is an asset in my book, and a sign that Viva Voce's conflation of domestic and creative life is working wonderfully.","Husband/wife duo's charismatic indie pop takes a darker turn as they jump from Sufjan's Asthmatic Kitty imprint to the Chicago-based Minty Fresh label.

My Mama Never Taught Me How to Cook: The Aura Years 1978-1982,Annette Peacock,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1815e6ef959693201ce/1:1/w_160/d711a1de.gif,2004-09-20 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6552-my-mama-never-taught-me-how-to-cook-the-aura-years-1978-1982/,Sanctuary,"Every line that Annette Peacock sings has a target. Though her voice has limits she often pushes, it's uniquely expressive: Whether persuading you about an esoteric political stance, holding you with a monologue like a captive at a dinner party, or wracking you with the problems lined up in her mind, Peacock is as serious as stone. And she's just as powerfully feminine. Her seductiveness doesn't sidle up to you so much as stare you down, and even a crooning whisper falls like a decision to marry. None of her records-- even the few that are still in print-- capture Peacock's singing as clearly and thoroughly as this collection, which reissues her most commercial efforts out of a lifetime of difficult art. Throughout her career, she stayed in the background or worked behind one man or another. She started her career as a singer, pianist and composer in the 60s, when her marriage to bassist Gary Peacock led her to take the stage with Albert Ayler; she wrote ballads made of heavy notes with wide spaces between them, and Paul Bley, her second husband, recorded definitive versions of several of them. But Peacock only started in jazz. She and Bley talked Bob Moog into lending them one of his early synthesizers, and they were among the first people to drag one onto a stage, putting up with the 20 minute delays to patch it for the next song. David Bowie was an admirer, and she turned down an offer to appear on Aladdin Sane, only to sign with-- and be strung along by-- Bowie's management. A session with Brian Eno also fell apart, but she won over Bill Bruford, who appears on this record and who invited her to sing on Feels Good to Me. You can also read accounts of her topless show at New York City's Townhall, or a holographic performance with Salvador Dali on Broadway. But that's another story. This collection, consisting of material released on the Aura label in the late 1970s, documents some of her few sessions as a group's unequivocal leader. It includes the complete X-Dreams and The Perfect Release albums, plus two rare outtakes that were mastered from badly worn vinyl. ""My Mama Never Taught Me How to Cook"", the first and strongest song from X-Dreams, creates a give-and-take between bluesy riffs and lurching disorder as Annette Peacock sings, speaks and wails the lyrics. Our modern ears are accustomed to hearing a song lurch like a ship at sea, but something about Peacock's delivery still ducks categorization. This is a song about family politics, with sly puns intimating brother/sister sex, next to accusations that her parents didn't encourage her, and didn't prepare her to be any better than she is. But her real attitude is as elusive as the guitars (are they improvising, or under firm, Captain Beefheart-like control?), and so she gets her message across in a song that's as ambiguous as a relationship. On ""Real & Defined Androgens"", Peacock delivers an almost-spoken word piece over a harsh prog jam with chopping guitar chords and squalling sax. But the later recordings on X-Dreams settle down: Peacock had relocated from New York City to England, where she assembled a strong funk-rock band that features Bruford, Mick Ronson, and Chris Spedding, and here she writes colorfully wistful ballads like ""Questions"", and also leads the band through a total reinvention of Elvis Presley's ""Don't Be Cruel"" that updates the song for the age of big lapels. Peacock took an even smoother, almost disappointing turn on The Perfect Release. The first four tracks from that disc are catchy funk-pop played by members of the Jeff Beck Band and sweetened with steel drums and a tweaky pitch-bending synthesizer. They've aged about as well as ""Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"", and the background remains static, failing to provide any nuance to Peacock's political/astronomical musings. After those first tracks, the set moves on to a reggae single, the seductive monologue-over-music of ""The Succubus"", and the 14-minute ""Survival"", a jam that never overheats and nearly runs to tedium until Peacock abruptly ends it with a jazzy quote from ""Silent Night"". Still, The Perfect Release is a step down from X-Dreams: Dated in many ways, especially lyrically, it sounds more one-dimensional than almost anything in Peacock's catalog. It delivers flat, clear messages, and that had never been her goal before. That album's commercial failure just added insult to injury, and Peacock has never tried to sound this ""pop"" again. (On her latest disc, 2000's An Acrobat's Heart, ECM led her back to austere balladeering.) Many artists today-- not least Björk or PJ Harvey-- have crossed artistic experimentation with commercial appeal by wandering in new directions and then nailing down the discoveries and making them popular. There are many reasons why Björk's idiosyncratic work has made her a star while Peacock never attained the fame that she aspired to in the 70s-- and that she firmly turned her back on in the 80s. But one clue is that Peacock never built up an obvious identity. She looks so different from photo to photo in the liner notes that you could almost be looking at sisters. For such a powerful performer, Annette Peacock has never been a diva. She never shied away from letting her man take the spotlight, never sounded squeamish about mangling her own voice in electronic effects. It was easier to sound mysterious in the 70s, when your career, the story behind your career, and the subtext under everything you did weren't put under a microscope. But even by those standards, Peacock's a cipher: She lets the work speak for itself, when it so chooses.","Envelope-pushing, Bowie-affilated vocalist is given her own anthology, much of which sees her backed by King Crimson drummer Bill Bruford and Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson.

My Parade / Remix Collection,Ellen Allien,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17bb1335d7bf1698281/1:1/w_160/95852169.jpg,2004-09-20 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11651-my-paraderemix-collection/,Bpitch Control,"Creatively speaking, last year's Berlinette must have taken a lot out of Ellen Allien. For now, the Bpitch Control labelhead seems to have taken a break from the boards, making 2004 both a year for administration-- the label has issued more LPs and 12-inches this year than any before-- and, in the cases of her new Remix Collection and DJ mix My Parade, a year for archival and personal introspection as well. ""Personal"" is used somewhat broadly here. To a large extent, Allien is Bpitch Control, and the label maintains such a distinct identity, despite its growing roster of new artists, precisely because her own trajectory dominates. And so My Parade lays out Bpitch's pre-history as much as Allien's: the beats 'n' breaks tradition of early 90s UK techno. Allien identifies with some familiar tracks-- Midi Rain's 1991 track ""Always"" kicks off the mix with dense synth melodies and a fierce (though somewhat dated) 16th-note drum loop, and Plaid's 2001 offering ""Squance"" is a nice throwback to the group's early singles-- but curiously spends a lot of time spinning B-sides. If Allien was looking to align herself with early 90s Warp, the Blueprint mix of Wild Planet's ""Electron"" does not seem the most definitive choice. Then again, this is not The Parade, but My Parade, and perhaps Allien pays tribute to these artists not simply as her influences, but as artists themselves: B-sides often house the more difficult or experimental offerings of 12-inch releases, and by using them so exclusively in My Parade (10 of the album's 13 tracks are flips), Allien might be nodding to what she considers her tradition's more introspective releases. The new Bpitch releases that Allien includes on My Parade, however, are not presented as UK techno's most highly evolved specimen. Instead, Allien stuffs them together in the middle of the mix, as if to tease out Bpitch's debt even more graphically. Allien's ""Bang Bang"", like the front side of My Parade, is more rhythmically than melodically interested, as the track convulses in a stew of percussive sounds. Modeselektor's ""Rave Anthem"" follows, though into slightly more melodic terrain. Apparat's schaffel gem ""Cheap Thrills"", however, stands out from the Bpitch pack, clamoring limply through a storm of noise and fat rain. After this brief Bpitch showcase, the heretofore dark and gloomy My Parade finishes out with a string of bright instrumentals. Allien pays particular tribute to CJ Bolland's 1992 bright trance anthem ""Mantra"" by following it with her own Plaid-does-trance number ""Dresden"", one of her earliest releases. If My Parade is Allien's frank homage to her influences, Remix Collection proves how distinct of an identity she has developed despite those debts. The compilation chronicles much of Allien's career, from her 1996 heavy house remix of Gut-Humpe's ""Butterfly"" to a 2003 reconfiguration of Berlinette lead-off ""Alles Sehen"". Much like Matthew Herbert's 2002 remix album Secondhand Sounds, Allien's Remix Collection works well as an album precisely because each remix so clearly bears her fingerprints: particularly her uncompromisingly dark, rhythmic displacements of source material. Allien's reworking of Sascha Funke's ""Forms and Shapes"" understands the melancholy that neither the original nor any other of the song's several remixes could fully grasp, while her take on Gold Chains' ""Let's Get It On"" proves that she knows when to lay off a bit-- the song's memorable vocal and synth hooks remain completely intact. Same goes for French duo OMR's ""The Way We Have Chosen"": Allien maintains the original's key ""Here Come the Warm Jets"" guitar melodies, and concentrates her influence in the song's breakdown, which even features her own glitched-out vocals. Remix Collection's most historically popular cuts-- the remixes of Barbara Morgenstern's ""Aus Heiterem Himmel"" and of Golden Boy with Miss Kittin's ""Rippin Kittin""-- are unsurprisingly the album's brightest spots, too. The sheer vitality of Allien's Morgenstern remix flat-out embarrasses the lounge-y, Gainsbourgeous original, while Allien's subtle enhancements to the electro-snorter ""Rippin Kittin"" give the song's hook (""Daddy/ Can I go out and kill tonight?/ I feel/ I feel like taking a life"") remarkable chill. It's a wonder people didn't feel more awkward dancing to Allien's version (the remix was a relative club hit in 2002), but that's further testament to Allien's talent: Given both its tact and personal energy, Remix Collection could just as accurately been titled My Parade, too.","Noir electro mastermind and founder of the prestigious Bpitch Control label issues these two stopgaps while she works on the proper follow-up to last year's brilliant Berlinette.

As Far as I Can See...,The Zombies,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab50c0084474cd0c1354/1:1/w_160/15986349.gif,2004-09-19 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8960-as-far-as-i-can-see/,Rhino,"Well, I fell for it. In a year of highly touted reunions by everyone from the Pixies to Mission of Burma, I wanted to believe that The Zombies' first album since 1968's psych-pop masterpiece Odessey & Oracle would be a first-class tour de force. ""We haven't come together cynically, or to make a buck,"" songwriter and keyboardist Rod Argent assures us in the liner notes. LIES! Argent and singer Colin Blunstone have been touring together for the past few years, and even released a disc together under their own names, 2002's unremarkable Out of the Shadows, that should have served as a stern warning. But their new record gets the Zombies name, Argent writes, because it has a ""group"" sound, and because all the songs were written with Blunstone's voice in mind-- presumably including ""I Don't Believe in Miracles"", originally from Blunstone's 1972 solo record Ennismore, which here gets the 80s soft-rock treatment, ""Rose for Emily"" piano intro notwithstanding. It's depressing and embarrassing to talk about the actual music, because to do so reveals not only what happens when preternaturally unhip music geeks age (eep!), but also that I actually listened, critically, for several hours, to this dross. Nevertheless: The album sets abysmally banal lyrics of love (""I get so cold without your flame"") and psychedelia (""catch the wind and kiss the sun"") atop overwrought 1980s MOR, replete with melodramatic string arrangements. Something about ""Wings Against the Sun"" reminds me of treacly 1975 mellow-gold hit ""Dance With Me"" by The Orleans. Opener ""In My Mind a Miracle"" (how does that jibe with ""I Don't Believe in Miracles"", anyway?) grooves like Stephen Schwartz's Pippin, without the Bob Fosse choreography. Worse, it includes the following lyric: ""In you I found my Odessey & Oracle."" I can't follow that. As a result, I've spent the day listening to better Zombies-related efforts, from dazzling singles like ""She's Not There"" to Blunstone's solid 1971 solo debut, One Year. That helps me escape from a tune about needing you ""like flowers need the rain"" (""Together""), which could pass for a lesser Jonathan Richman cut if not for the prog-rock vocals and utter self-importance. But it can't blot out the lyric booklet in front of my eyes: ""It's time to move/ It's time to roll/ Feel it in my heart/ Believe it in my soul."" Blunstone shows off his prodigious pipes there with some fake soulfulness, while the band attempts what would pass for garage revival if it didn't sound so much like late-period The News (of ""Huey Lewis &"" fame) fronted by the dude from Dream Theatre. Then there's ""Memphis"", which goes all out with keyboards fitting for a Peabo Bryson single out of an early 90s Disney flick. If you've read this far, you fell for the ""Zombies reunion"" gimmick, too. You should have saved your time for worthier indie-pop efforts, plus figuring out how you can avoid getting this lame when you inevitably grow old, too. If Argent and Blunstone aren't in this for a cynical buck, they've merely lost all aesthetic sense. That happens, I suppose.

Mary Had Brown Hair,Gary Wilson,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa45b1335d7bf169963c/1:1/w_160/fa074600.jpg,2004-09-19 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8696-mary-had-brown-hair/,Stones Throw,"If you're new to the Gary Wilson experience, here's a brief history: Back in 1977, the talented but eccentric Wilson went down into his parents' New Jersey basement and recorded what would become one of the most legendary self-released ""real people"" albums ever made: You Think You Really Know Me. The record sounded as though it was aiming for some kind of Steely Dan/Shuggie Otis electro-funk fusion, but the uncomfortable intimacy and passion of Wilson's performance instead rendered the album a bizarre personal portrait of one man's lust, loneliness and inner turmoil. Despite the limited original pressing of You Think You Really Know Me, the album managed to take on a life of its own via word-of-mouth and non-commercial radio. Many listeners who were originally attracted by the substantial comedy value of songs like ""6.4 = Make Out"" and ""Chromium Bitch"", and were further drawn in by Wilson's crazed white-man soul and not inconsiderable musical talent. Over the next two decades, the album was issued several times by various labels, its small but fervent following-- which included fans like Beck (who name-checked Wilson on ""Where It's At""), Matt Groening, and The Roots' ?uestlove-- growing with each release. But nobody was really sure what had ever become of Gary Wilson himself. Curiosity about Wilson hit a sort of critical mass following the latest reissue of You Think You Really Know Me on Motel records in 2002. Though Motel released a collection of stray Wilson recordings as Forgotten Lovers in 2003, nobody realistically expected to hear anything more from him until Stones Throw Records' Peanut Butter Wolf finally tracked the man down in California. At the time, Wilson was reportedly working at an adult video store and regularly gigging with a jazz lounge act, and was unsurprisingly delighted to learn about the acclaim his old work was receiving. It didn't take much cajoling to convince Wilson to finally deliver a true follow-up. So here we are with Mary Had Brown Hair, which sounds more like 27 days have passed since You Think You Really Know Me than 27 years. There are more drum machines this time around, as well as chirping Doogie Howser, M.D. synths and treated vocals reminiscent of early Ween. These ""modern"" touches, however, cause the album to lose a bit of the swank, mustachioed 70s vibe of its predecessor. There's also an increased emphasis on conventional pop songwriting; although that's speaking relatively-- these songs resemble actual pop radio hits the way basset hounds resemble lake trout. Otherwise, Mary Had Brown Hair surely delivers everything that Wilson enthusiasts could have hoped for, perhaps even too much so. Erotic obsession and small-town alienation remain the central themes of Wilson's work, and as on his debut he here performs songs like ""Gary Saw Linda Last Night"", ""Our Last Date"", and ""Debbie, Debbie"" with an unnerving introspective intensity. (I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that somewhere along the way Gary's caused some women to change their phone numbers.) Fixated, adolescent love songs like ""Linda Wants to Be Alone"" (""She was writing a note to my parents saying that I was bothering her"") that were borderline creepy in 1977 are downright alarming now that the guy is legitimately in his 50s. Scariest of all is ""Gary's in the Park"", which features a menacing Wilson intoning the lines, ""Gary's in the dark/ And you know I'll be waiting for you..."" The possibility exists, of course, that this whole troubled ""Gary Wilson"" persona is just a fictional construction of an artist that's simply giving his audience what they want to hear, a theory given credibility by the fact that, throughout the album, the singer refers to Gary Wilson in the third person as though it's just a role he's playing. This illustrates what has always been the big conundrum regarding outsider music: If the artist is as lacking in self-awareness as he seems to be, it risks putting the audience in a condescending, ""let's all laugh at the freak"" position. Or is Gary Wilson's whole weirdo-loner shtick an elaborate affectation meant to dress up what is otherwise nice but pretty mundane synth-pop? Can he really have changed this little over the last 27 years? Whatever the truth is regarding Wilson's methods and intentions, there's no doubt that Mary Had Brown Hair is one of the oddest and most baffling musical artifacts you're likely to get your mitts on in 2004-- one that raises more questions than it answers. How much you'll actually want to listen to it over the next 27 years is a question you'll have to answer for yourself.","On the heels of the acclaimed garnered by the recent reissue of his now-legendary You Think You Really Know Me LP, 70s cult nerd Gary Wilson drops a newly recorded follow-up.

The Manifestation,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42e13d1975652138c62/1:1/w_160/e7bbb94c.gif,2004-09-19 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7202-the-manifestation/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"To those familiar with the music of Six Organs of Admittance in its more song-driven incarnations, the sprawl of The Manifestation will come as a surprise. Originally appearing in 2000 as a one-sided vinyl release, it's now manifest in the form of a two-song CD single. The first track is a reissue of the original music, the second new material; both are 22-minute pieces with their thematic attention turned toward the heavenly bodies that govern our lives. That's right-- they're about the cast of ""The O.C."" No, sorry, they're about our solar system. The title track is an ode to the sun in the body of a raga-inspired epic-- a form suited to its topic, as the movement of melodic notes around an established tonic conjures images of planets rotating around the star. Ben Chasny's acoustic guitar mimics the ringing metallic tone and microtonal bends of a sitar, with tabla-style hand drums in the background. The drone is partly sustained by a rhythmically plucked mouth harp, which bends and expands to paint a shimmering, warped surface; Chasny's use of non-western scales, as well as the general aura of mysticism maintained throughout, evoke ritualistic sun-worship. The piece begins with a rumbling incantation, falling into a steady groove. On top enters Chasny's vocal line, unencumbered by any time signature, and layered with a female spoken word part in the style of Gong. About 12 minutes in, the piece is overtaken by a formless, atmospheric drone of the sort early Tangerine Dream used to evoke the vastness and slow unfolding of large-scale cosmic events. A slowly rotating LFO synth replaces the rhythmic oscillations of the mouth harp, and high, metallic string tones fall. In its third section, the piece lands into a melancholy return with a reestablished tonic and some layered guitar/autoharp picking. ""The Six Stations"" is a more subdued work. It's ideologically based in The Music of the Spheres, the ancient Greek concept (popular amongst romantics throughout the ages) that harmonic ratios evident in intervals pleasing to the human ear have counterparts in relative interplanetary distances and bodies. Chasny's original vinyl release of The Manifestation contained an etching of the sun by Mike Mills on its non-playing side; here, Chasny aurally recreates that side by making the ""drone"" of this piece the sounds of a record needle playing over Mills' etching. Thus, Chasny pays homage to his original ""side B,"" and also lays down a sonic representation of the sun upon which the other musical ""planets"" can interact. Of course, none of this is evident in the recording itself, meaning that many listeners will hear what seems mainly to be an intentional obfuscation of the music. The amplified vinyl clicks and pops combined with Chasny's guitar work, plucked in grouped torrents of notes, initially give the impression of a modern piece of cut 'n' paste laptop collage. Mercury and Venus are represented by acoustic jams in two different keys and scales, before an unaccompanied monologue from David Tibet divides the piece with its depiction of Earth. From there, the planetary divisions are a bit more vague-- Chasny engages in some more major-key meanderings before segueing into a pentatonic scale, his guitar now taking on the characteristics of a Koto, backed by the sound of muted rain and distant thunder. Though it's an interesting journey in light of its Sun Ra-style theoretical basis, its lack of attention to aesthetic execution makes it a less engaging listen. The Manifestation, for better or worse, can be described in terms of trends from 30-40 years ago. Its basis in Indian music points to the Ravi Shankar influence that, coinciding with the proliferation of psychedelics, prompted many American and European artists to experiment with new scales, tones, and song lengths. And, in the same way that evoking medieval chant or century-old blues necessarily conjures a sort of historical exoticism, The Manifestation's success is partly due to its contextual throwback to a mysticism and wonder foreign to modern counterculture. What makes this recording successful, and allows it to be captivating and transformative, is its obvious sincerity. There's value in the wisdom of the now burnt-out, and The Manifestation's best moments are borne of that spirit. Chasny's wide thematic scope is refreshing in a musical landscape dominated by personal soul-bearing. Our relationship to the extremes of the outer world deserves as much attention as do the subtleties of the psyche, and extended pieces here set a frame for listeners to consider the space between themselves and the vast beyond.","Originally issued on one-side vinyl, SF experimental folk artist Ben Chasny's 20-minute paean to the sun gets reissued by Strange Attractors, backed by an all-new response piece.

Up Against The Legends,The Legends,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd3eb335119a49ecf61/1:1/w_160/00c7bdd0.jpg,2004-09-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4971-up-against-the-legends/,Lakeshore,"A quick Google search for Up Against The Legends only reveals how little is out there on the upstart Swedish nonet The Legends. The few early online reviews of the group's debut, Up Against The Legends, reveal none of the band members' names, and websites for their American and European labels are similarly mum on the group's background. This we know: There are nine individual Legends (although some sources and photographs claim only eight). The band formed in early 2003. They had a gig opening for Stockholm-based Radio Dept. before they even had a committed line-up. The principle players-- Johan Angeråld of Club 8 may or may not be among them-- recruited friends, and friends of friends, some of whom had no musical experience and had to learn to play their instruments. It's unclear which band members, how many, and which instruments; there's a big difference between teaching yourself guitar or drums and learning tambourine. Obviously, The Legends are a concept-driven band. The group was born as an idea that had to be fleshed out with actual flesh, so taking the name The Legends is apparently not an act of Hives-like audacity, nor does it appear to be a forward-looking mission statement. Hiding behind their collective identity and withholding biographical information and even their individual names, The Legends live up to that name in the most mythological sense of the word. Even the pictures of the musicians on the album cover are collages, rendering them literally as cardboard cutouts. Whatever ends this strategy serves are debatable, but The Legends' rigorous anonymity, however suspicious, would seem to blur into the music, at least superficially. Up Against The Legends traffics in a brand of retro-minded indie pop that borrows just enough from current garage-rock trends to put movement in the music, but not enough to garner any meaningful comparisons to fellow Swedes like The Hives or Sahara Hotnights. They're more beholden to The Jesus & Mary Chain's fuzzed-out style and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound than to Nuggets or The Stooges. Still, given these sketchy outlines, their debut should be at best merely forgettable and at worst actively bad. After all, pop doesn't always reward the DIY ethic the way punk does. And songs like ""There and Back Again"" and ""Trouble Loves Me"", on first listen, do sound too trendy and maybe a little generic-- the product of genre formula rather than musical imagination. The atmosphere of ""When the Day Is Done"" (featured on the Wicker Park soundtrack) sounds too studied to be as chilly as intended. Seemingly handicapped, Up Against The Legends could have been lost in this year's overflow of surprisingly good albums by like-minded artists like The Concretes, Jens Lekman, Camera Obscura, and Saturday Looks Good to Me. The first impression is that of an acceptable, if not stellar, example of a particular style-- maybe a high 6 on the Pitchfork rating scale. So then, what separates it from the pack? Perhaps it's due to Up Against The Legends incredible resilience: It grows on you like ivy. With each subsequent listen, the album reveals more and more of itself through small, unexpected flourishes of sound that gradually accrue more than enough personality to fill the band-shaped hole. Up Against The Legends is heavily layered with hand claps, tambourines, soft-focus background vocals, and melodies that never seem to go where you might expect. Someone's subtle, pulsing organ races alongside someone else's one-note bassline throughout ""There and Back Again"", adding a nice tension to the 50s-romantic guitar riff and the pleading, static vocals. Whoever's playing the acoustic guitar theme on ""When the Day Is Done"" drops in a few extra notes at the end of each line, turning the melody back on itself. Coupled with lyrics that describe the aftermath of a petty romantic argument, that small filigree drops the temperature a degree with each listen-- and the album is crammed with similar enlivening flourishes. Up Against The Legends is that rare pop album that doesn't immediately pop: It's less concerned with the present than with the future. And who knows? Perhaps whatever success attends this album's release will prompt the individual Legends to leave their hiding places and introduce themselves to their listeners. But then, who The Legends are is so much less important than what their debut is: a solid, surprising album whose rewards are commensurate with the time you spend with it.","Scandinavian nine-piece invoke the lush, jangly indie pop of the 1980s, from The Field Mice to The Jesus & Mary Chain.

Phantom Phorce,Super Furry Animals,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5cbc0084474cd0c07e4/1:1/w_160/ff5a8482.jpg,2004-09-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7603-phantom-phorce/,Sony,"Super Furry Animals showed their first grey hairs on last year's Phantom Power. It wasn't quite a Humbert Humbert freakout, but the signs of aging had finally become visible. For me-- and if you check the archives here you'll find the opposing point well-represented-- Phantom Power showed a band giving into time. Continuously pushing boundaries throughout their decade-long run, it seemed the band had finally worn themselves out, and maybe grown a bit too content with their resting place. A full-fledged return from the polyester soul nadir of Rings Around the World, Power saw the band massaging their trademarked Beach Boys glow into pastoral psychedelics and warm, salty epics. But even so, its moments of unbridled experimentation and musical excursions were far less common than on their masterpiece, 1999's Guerilla. The tacked-on electronic bewitchery at the end of ""The Piccolo Snare"" exemplified the change: In contrast to its fellow album cuts, it was detectably forced-- just a tossed-off nugget for the tech-heads that SFA has always depended on. So, following Phantom Power, perhaps it's only proper for a band so dependent on rebirth to allow others a chance to succeed where they've failed: in distorting the past. First released last year on their own Placid Casual label, Phantom Phorce is narrated by Kurt Stern, the original's executive producer. Using glib allusions to fictional turmoil during the recording sessions-- complete with a reference to the whole debacle eventually appearing in Mojo-- Stern attempts to fuse these very separate, individual tracks together into a cohesive whole. Unfortunately, he gets in the way more than he helps, and by album's end, you're likely to consider redubbing it without his contributions. Though far less dynamic than its predecessors, Phantom Power was still home to a number of remarkable soundbytes, which offered this record's remixers plenty of manipulable material through which to embolden the original works, yet also retain the Furries' signature wit. Killa Kela turns ""Golden Retriever"" into a spastic funk jam, choked-up with thudding glitch-beats and carnivorous beat-boxing. High Llamas rebuild ""Valet Parking"" as a Beatlesque symphony, sifting past soft Day-Glo flutes and clouded strings, and channeling four orchestral transitions. Perhaps the best cut-and-paster of the lot, Four Tet, applies his apple-coring talents to ""The Piccolo Snare"", so that the resulting track stumbles on funky, lock-step rhythms and a repeated chime-loop to combine the moonlight-boxed psychedelics of his own work with the plump grace of the original. Yet, when the remix artists lose track of the Furries' source material, the results often bear more resemblance to faceless IDM than any of the band's untreated songs. Wauvenfold's take on ""Sex, War and Robots"" falls in love with its own glitch-cutting, and winds up a jarring, unrecognizable mess that makes the most frenzied Mouse on Mars' tracks seem tame by comparison. Likewise, Mego noise terrorist Massimo's ""Venus and Serena"" ditches every scrap of the original song except slight vocal fragments, falling flat with gurgling electro beats and a grinding guitar. Any song titled after America's favorite tennis twins can't afford to lose that sense of humor. Here, Massimo freezes it into a Martian soundscape, and thus allows it to escape his grasp in an unremarkable skyjacking. In the end, how much you make of Phantom Phorce will be related to your love for Super Furry Animals. It's the burden most remix albums have to bear. To hear the group's material tweaked into schizophrenic tantrums and hymns to the echolalia of technology is certainly worth enduring the album's more watered-down inclusions-- even Kurt Stern's boring narration. Plus, there's always the hope that seeing their material in the hands of some of the world's young contortionists might prove to be just the jolt the Furries need to send them back into the throes of prime creativity. But then, does anyone really want to hear them as inspired by Boom Bip?","On a path of continual reinvention, Super Furry Animals allow some of the best electronic artists going today-- including Four Tet, Mario Caldati Jr, High Llamas, etc-- full access to rework and reinterpret their music. And we've done some reinterpreting of SFA's catalog as well...

Ta Det Lugnt,Dungen,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8a13d197565213b0f0/1:1/w_160/529d4150.jpg,2004-09-16 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2573-ta-det-lugnt/,Subliminal Sounds,"Despite the constant influx of catchphrase-coordinated marketing campaigns that would lead you to believe that life-affirming records are released daily, it's forever rare to stumble upon one as consistently mind-blowing and aesthetically far-reaching as Dungen's Ta Det Lugnt. Because of this scarcity, when such an unexpected (and immediate) discovery does take place, it's like being struck by indescribable melodic lightning: Unlike discs that warrant facile disses or mediocre passing grades, the countless reasons for its boundless successes remain ineffable and shadowy despite repeat late-night close-listening sessions. Simply put, Dungen exhibit all the signs of legitimate, hard-won staying power. Ta Det Lugnt is an exceedingly triumphant psych-pop oddity that evokes Keith Moon's drum fills on The Who Sell Out, the wraiths of unsung bedroom psyche celebrants, and the acoustic sustain and harmonizing of The Byrds' Younger Than Yesterday, Ta Det Lugnt feels less like a new release than some ancient tome, a fully formed masterpiece dropped unexpectedly on corduroy laps from some blue-brown sky. It's so aesthetically tight, jangly verdant, and musty that even carbon dating insists that it could not be post-millennial. To be sure, there's a major difference between retro and somehow embodying your parents' vintage zeitgeist: It's damn-near impossible to believe that the humming tubes, crackling drums, smoky backdrop, and complexly interwoven melodies on Ta Det Lugnt were birthed in a quick-fix iPod age. But perhaps even more impressive is that, despite the music's headiness and intricacy, its anachronistic results feel unusually effortless, earnest, and unpretentious: Dungen seem driven to this sound not for bloodless cred points, but out of a very sincere devotion to the music from a bygone era. Accomplished beyond his years, 24-year-old Swedish multi-instrumentalist Gustav Ejstes is the pin-up mastermind behind Dungen's vibrant polish. For the full duration of his third album's 13 bracing tracks, he perfectly inhabits-- and then expands upon-- his homeland's late-60s/early-70s acid-rock scene. Ta Det Lugnt particularly taps into the expansiveness of his Swedish psych predecessors, Pärson Sound, while maintaining a murky rocker edge: Imagine that band colliding with The Kinks, or Amon Düül II with Olivia Tremor Control, or Comets on Fire with The Zombies on their way to Terrastock. Interested in pushing pop glitter to its limits, Ejstes doesn't go as far afield into psych-pop cliches like chirping birds and hippie atmospherics as his elder brethren, but his equally vintage garage sound allows a definite space for ethereality in the form of funereal dew-drop strings, free jazz breakdowns, brief whiffs of AM radio tuning, flute minuets, lushly cascading pianos, prog time changes, florid medieval chimes, sky-melting freakouts, church organs, fuzz-guitar jousts, doubled mountain-top whistles, roaring six-string solos, and autumnal instrumental interludes. It's obvious his songs are painstakingly arranged with a sense of depth, gradations, and tonal three-dimensionality redolent of something as off the charts as Pet Sounds. Continually, there's a perfect push-and-pull between catchy melodies, roaring solos, and spaced-out dramaturgy-- the band's output is consistently upbeat even when heartbreakingly tranquil and melancholy. ""Gjort Bort Sig"" flutters and drifts, reaching for the outer realms, before catching a subtle hurricane of quicksand spirals behind doubled astronaut vocals. The sweet arboreal folk of ""Festival"" appears straightforward until it unleashes an echo-chamber bridge that absolutely shimmers. And the title track feels like chamber-pop expanded to include a psych history lesson. Because I took Latin and not Swedish in high school, I have no idea what Ejstes is singing about, but I like the verbal opacity-- the way syllables meld to the Hammond, flute, violin, bass, drums, guitars, and the way it masks any potentially subpar lyric that might detract from such brilliant arrangements. Indeed, as the summer finally turns to dying leaves, Dungen's lush palette of mystical earth tones and trade winds seems the ideal soundscape. This has been one hell of a year for psych, folk, et. al., but even with such fine releases as Animal Collective's Sung Tongs and Comets on Fire's Blue Cathedral, I doubt 2004 will birth a more blissful sonic encounter than Ta Det Lugnt.","Despite the constant influx of catchphrase-coordinated marketing campaigns that would lead you to believe\n\ that life-affirming records are released ...

Summerland,Nedelle & Thom,by: Stephen M.

In 2004, however, Nedelle & Thom sound not at all ironic, but rather very serious and sincere on their debut Summerland, whose flowery pop blooms with bright melodies and summery harmonies meant to offset the dark bitterness of their lyrics about romantic turmoil and disappointment. Nedelle is an Oakland musician who released her solo debut, Republic of Two, on Kimchee Records last year. Playing Sonny to her Cher is Thom Moore, who is one half of The Moore Brothers. They founded their friendship and eventually the group on their mutual love of Burt Bacharach. He plays guitar and some keyboard; she sings. Rounding out the group (on Summerland, at least) is the rhythm section from Boston-based Karate. On the album's opener, ""You Take Me You Break Me"", Nedelle sings about romantic betrayal and public humiliation-- her guy shows up at her party with another girl-- but her voice sparkles with such precise, prismatic clarity that it becomes a fed-up anthem. 10 uniformly chipper ditties follow, only two of which exceed three happy-go-lucky minutes. The wistful ""In Time It Snows"" and the plaintive ""Care for Me"" have nice moments-- a catchy chorus or genuinely lovelorn lyrics-- and Thom's guitar adds simple but effective flourishes to ""It's Up to You"". However, most of the time, Nedelle & Thom get lost in their own nostalgia. On tracks like ""You Know"", ""Sun in My Eyes"", and the unfortunately titled ""Puddle at Your Toes"", they try to re-create a particular sound down to a tee, even though they seem to realize they'll never match the silkiness of Dionne Warwick or the naturalism of Burt Bacharach's arrangements. At times, Nedelle & Thom sound as if their ultimate aim is mere mimicry, as if they were painters copying the Old Masters brushstroke by brushstroke. Unfortunately, their color palette is garish and their technique only underscores the distance between their abilities and their inspirations. As a result, these songs sound more like Captain & Tennille than Brill Building pop. When they do try to imprint themselves on the music, Nedelle & Thom come across as aloof and elusive, with an insularity that stops just short of smugness. Like the masks they wear on the album cover, they use their slavish devotion to their source material to conceal themselves. If Summerland were part of some ironic joke, at least it would be trying to connect with an audience. For all their earnestness, Nedelle & Thom sound like they're singing just for and to themselves-- an inside joke between two friends or a guess-you-had-to-be-there story.","Kill Rock Stars issues this collaboration between Kimchee singer/songwriter Nedelle, The Moore Brothers' Thom Moore, and the rhythm section of Boston post-rockers Karate.

Winds Take No Shape,Call and Response,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e89d034d5c69bf3191/1:1/w_160/f3fc01d4.jpg,2004-09-16 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1250-winds-take-no-shape/,Badman,"First, let me state that I personally feel that naming your band Call and Response implicitly binds you to an agreement of including some rousing ""You say [blank]!/ I say [blonk]!/ [Blank]!/ [Blonk]!/ [Blank]!/ [Blonk]!"" action on your records. The absence of such on their newest album, Winds Take No Shape, is a little disappointing. Please don't tease us, Call and Response. I wouldn't name my band Wicked Bridges and then fail to constantly deliver wicked awesome bridges. Still, while their name doesn't refer to any crunk motifs in their music, it does aptly describe the shift evident in their newest release. Winds Take No Shape seems to be the response to critics who called for more depth and less of the wide-eyed cuteness rampant on their self-titled debut. Their music is still lighter-than-air, but a newfound strain of wistfulness brings it closer to earth. Rather than presenting a fluffy, glossed-over reality, the songs here dance around the tug of melancholy. And as predictable as it is that ""sadness"" should be linked to ""importance,"" and ""seriousness"" with ""maturity,"" this album proves that bias too inherent to ignore-- Winds Take No Shape's relative soberness works to give Call and Response's breezy sound some weight. Lyrically, the band has turned from their former themes of summertime teenage innocence to late fall, haiku-like imagery-- a move reflected in their transformed sound. The lyrics of Winds Take No Shape continually evoke the revolution of the seasons and resulting impermanence of things, and these themes are embodied in the band's propulsive, syncopated arrangements. The twists and turns of Carrie Clough's melodies, and their interplay with Simone Rubi's backing vocals paint the swirl of fallen leaves caught in the breeze. Intertwined in her phrases is the rhythmic and melodic counterpoint of Daniel Judd's picked guitar, as the drums and bass unpredictably shift the upbeat. The clearest precursor to Call and Response's current sound is mid-era Stereolab; the similarity of Clough's singing to Laetitia Sadier's goes beyond having the same detached air to include sharing melodic themes, and the propensity to stress awkward syllables. Also present are Stereolab's penchant for mid-song shifts, slightly swinging meters, and avoiding obvious chordal resolutions for surprising major-seventh turns. And yet, Winds Take No Shape seems derived of its own inspiration, and atmospherically seeks something apart from the Lab's sometimes sterile polemics and exotic instrumentation. Call and Response still fall into pop hooks, and the swing can give way at any point to the plodding bass drum of a soft and muted disco chorus. Though the songwriting here points toward more ornamental possibilities, the arrangements on Winds Take No Shape remain within the standard band format. The tracks are occasionally augmented with a cello or synth line, and elsewhere, keyboard washes and sparsely placed pieces of production add atmosphere. The backing vocals are carefully attended to, with several layers of harmonies present in the excellent ""Silent Chill"". The band works thoughtfully with what's there, and the album feels inspired in its standard parameters, but fails to completely maintain the momentum it builds. The second half is less focused than the first-- the songwriting on ""Landscapes"" doesn't meet the standards set elsewhere, and ""Station"" feels meandering. Still, it closes well with ""Silhouette"", one of the album's strongest tracks. The value of a work as album and unimposing as Winds Take No Shape is most easily determined when it's not being played, by the urge one has to visit it again. This work's warm sound and above-average complexity in arrangement have brought me back repeatedly, and future releases will hopefully see them refining their new sound. Call and Response have a lot of promise to fulfill. Including a certain implicit promise made by a certain ambitious band name. Ahem.","Stereolab-inspired indie pop five-piece show a marked improvement since the unpolished sugar-twee of their 2001 Kindercore debut.

Lead Singer,Flössin,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bea313d197565213b77f/1:1/w_160/e99b3fe2.gif,2004-09-16 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3322-lead-singer/,Ache,"You grow up thinking ""noise"" is the sound of rage and destruction, of dishes smashing against the wall or screaming voices or cars hitting telephone poles. But outpourings of joy can just lead to chaos and extreme volume. Noise is simply what happens when there's ""too much,"" when containers are filled and things spill over the edges. The actual feelings and sensations involved are wildly variable. Freewheeling noise is what Flössin is up to, which is surprising considering who is at the center of the band. San Francisco guitarist Christopher Willits spearheads Flössin, but this outlet is miles away from the focused and meditative micro-music he makes under his own name (the best of which is on the excellent 12k label). Here, Willits collaborates with Miguel Depedro (better known as Kid606) on computer and Zach Hill (of Hella) on drums for an improv project in which the trio serve up an unholy racket with a smile. Word is that Flössin may one day involve a different set of players, but Hill definitely dominates on Lead Singer. Fans of Hella will have no trouble picking out his style, which manages to be both nimble and heavy, but here, he applies his considerable chops to something more loose and unpredictable. At first, Hill sounds like he's soloing constantly, stringing one insanely complicated roll onto the next like Moon's ""My Generation"" outro extended to album length, but upon repeated listens, patterns in his sound emerge that are sympathetic to what Willits and Depedro are up to. Though Hill's role is easy to ascertain, with Willits and Depedro it's hard to tell who's doing what. Since Willits typically plays with his guitar processed via laptop, his tone can go anywhere at any given moment, and Depedro seems content to fill space with drone and assorted sound effects. On the third track (titles appear on the sleeve, but they're crossed out with a sharpie), his guitar becomes a singing sword-- something like Fripp tunneling through Eno's delays-- and his mournful extended tones against Hill's triple-time hits make for an effective contrast. The fifth track contains some speedy atonal riffs that definitely sound ""guitar-like"" inside a gray cloud of feedback, and then Depedro sets off-kilter loops of machine noise against Willits' anti-guitar heroics. Highlights come when Depedro and Willits lock together to spin out vaguely discernable melodies that somehow get broken in all the excitement. Occasional clusters of CD skips appear to remind us that there is computer software in the room, but Lead Singer sounds strangely analog and most certainly live, with a strong dose of room ambience and a recording with such heavy bleeding it may as well be mono. Most importantly Lead Singer sounds bashed out for the sheer pleasure of it, and the thrill is contagious. If loud, rough, and noisy music once seemed an outlet for anger, bands like Flössin show how much happiness there can be in unbridled sound.","San Francisco guitarist Christopher Willits teams with Kid 606 and Hella's Zach Hill for this intense noise outing.

Open EP,Channels,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71b9d034d5c69bf36ef/1:1/w_160/e65f2570.jpg,2004-09-16 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1780-open-ep/,DeSoto,"Ubiquitous producer J. Robbins first made his mark in the early 80s, as the bassist for D.C. punks Government Issue, and then as the frontman for seminal post-punks Jawbox. After an EP and two LPs of powerful ""proto-emo,"" as DeSoto dubbed it, Jawbox left Dischord. Amid a minor flurry of puritanical hand-wringing during the indie boom of the early 90s, they signed to Atlantic Records to release their finest album, For Your Own Special Sweetheart, and a glossier, self-titled swan song, before disbanding in 1997. When Jawbox folded, Robbins reunited with Government Issue drummer Peter Moffett and Jawbox guitarist Bill Barbot to form Burning Airlines, whose Mission: Control! and Identikit, sanded the rough edges from his former band's songwriting, and attempted more traditional lyrical and musical structures. And now there's Channels, consisting of Robbins on vocals and guitar, his wife Janet Morgan on vocals and bass, and drummer Darren Zentek. A logical progression from Identikit's blend of jagged pop and brawny rock, their debut EP, Open, posits itself as the culmination of Burning Airlines' aesthetic: big hooks, bell-clear vocals, a smoldering and serrated pop sensibility (think Jawbox's ""Iodine"" or Burning Airlines ""The Surgeon's House""), and Robbins' most discernible and politically charged lyrics to date. The first track, ""Disconnection Day"", audaciously imagines 9/11 as a future holiday that commemorates the death of critical thinking. It begins with a wafting arpeggio and Robbins' distorted, submerged singing, before the vocals burst into the foreground and the guitars blossom like fireworks over the irregular peaks of Zentek's drumming. Robbins' voice has accrued polish and nuance over the years, and his trademarked ""aaaayyys"" soar majestically over the mix. The disjointed anthem ""Storytime (In the Street of Spies)"" has an aggressively circuitous guitar line that collapses into more spare and effective breakdowns, where the lyrical turn ""surveyor for new maps of hell"" shines through, representing Robbins' more forthright (at least, forthright for the author of enigmas like ""FF=66"") mode of expression. The driving, staccato ""Chivaree"" continues the murder-by-wordplay dogmatic attack, with the opening lyric, ""Kill all the copyrights and loosen my tongue,"" a cunning call for artistic freedom. However, a reworking of John Cale's ""Fear"" is the EP's most striking song. Swirling acoustic guitar amasses toward a chorus that just begins to erupt before stopping short and beginning the upward trek anew. Janet Morgan's dulcet vocals make their first appearance on this duet, and are ably ballasted by Robbins' resonant baritone. Morgan also closes the EP with ""Win Instantly"", a trebly, chiming lullaby on which her vocals are pleasant but benign-- one wishes for a harmony to enliven them, but nevertheless, their juxtaposition with the tortured dissonance of the chorus works passably well. Robbins has shed Jawbox's raw power and abstruse tendencies, and reinvented his writing in a manner befitting these more intelligible songs. I'm not going to pretend that I like Open as much as For Your Own Special Sweetheart, but there are few albums I do like that much. Jawbox is now distant enough that Robbins' records must be judged on how well they stand upon their own feet. Channels squarely does.","With Government Issue, Jawbox and Burning Airlines all behind him, J. Robbins forms Channels with wife Janet Morgan and Kerosene 454 drummer Darren Zentek.

They Make Beer Commercials Like This EP,Minus the Bear,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5585e6ef95969323ac6/1:1/w_160/4119a321.jpg,2004-09-15 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5325-they-make-beer-commercials-like-this-ep/,Arena Rock,"Minus the Bear is something of an anomaly in indie rock. The Seattle-based hybrid group, known for absurd song and album titles that suggest a playful imagination rarely evidenced in their music, have maintained indie rock prominence for a little over three years, with only one proper album (2002's Highly Refined Pirates) and two previous EPs to justify their existence. Their musical development is practically nonexistent-- the group's spacey, synth-spiked brand of hypercharged guitar rock has remained basically unchanged for years. With no more material than Sufjan Stevens could muster in a week, or Robert Pollard in 12 minutes, the band has still built a substantial following. On They Make Beer Commercials Like This, Minus the Bear expands its sound somewhat from its characteristic quasi-prog guitar noodling, embracing a more diverse sonic palette, from the punchy electrobeat post-punk of ""Fine and 2 Pts."" to the Change-era D-Plan emulation of ""Let's Play Clowns"". But Jake Snider, singing in his typical low-key deadpan, pretty much sums things up on the disc's opening track: ""Our basic program is the same."" The band's precise dual guitar work and complex but unobtrusive choruses are strikingly similar to the music on the band's other releases. The EP's best tracks avoid easy pigeonholing. ""Dog Park"" establishes a distinctive verse consisting of airy synths and a meticulous repeating guitar pattern before dissolving into a reverb-drenched keyboard interlude, then doubling back into an animated chorus. ""Pony Up"" overcomes its ponderous lyrics (""how can we claim that we know ourselves"") with some of the record's most compelling musical arrangements. A few simple mixing tricks, like acoustic and electric guitar patterns pushed to opposite stereo channels, or the following channel-to-channel crash-pan of a rapid-fire guitar riff, are fairly obvious but nonetheless effectively dizzying sonic gimmicks. The most ludicrously titled tracks are, perhaps counter-intuitively, also the least memorable. ""I'm Totally Not Down with Rob's Alien"" immediately meanders with a pair of go-nowhere guitar figures that resemble Incubus' sludgy, shapeless alt-rock, while ""Hey! Is That a Ninja Up There?"" seems to have expended all its cleverness on its title. The track is an indistinct muddle of weak guitar hooks, irritating sweeping synth tones, and tedious vocal melodies. The shifting time signature initially distinguishes the track, but the song goes in too many directions and eventually splinters. The prevalence of so much filler on a six-song EP is discouraging, and marks this EP as just another placeholder in a career long sustained primarily by placeholder EPs. The disc effortlessly slips into Minus the Bear's modest discography, but shows about as much progression in the band's career as beer commercials have shown in the proliferation of women's rights.","Third EP from these unremarkable math-rockers offers more of the same: wacky titles, not much else.

All Good Things EP,George,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfe0abf31b7dc7156394/1:1/w_160/792ff96e.gif,2004-09-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3621-all-good-things-ep/,Lejos,"Sometimes there's a place in music, in a song, where you realize that you aren't experiencing the verses and choruses anymore, but have rather entered into your own experience. This doesn't always happen, of course; generally only in something you've given yourself a chance to digest, perhaps heard a few times on the way to school or work, at the computer or as you sit on the train with nothing better to distract your eyes than the backdrop of other people as they're consumed with something totally apart from the song you're hearing. This place, your experience, is different from the one initiated by music because the meaning of its words and implied direction of its strains are less inherently meaningful than they are impressionistic suggestions for whatever is most meaningful to you. I've read how this is supposed to happen all the time, but I think it's rarer than that. Birmingham, UK duo George specializes in music that triggers the hyper-subjective experience for me (and a few others): Their 2003 full-length debut, The Magic Lantern, sneaked into Pitchfork's Top 50 albums list, and found a place in the hearts of folks I once called the ""midnight romantics,"" saving their most intense confessionals for the hour furthest from contact with any other person. Suzy Mangion and Michael Varity make music with guitar, old organs and any percussion you can play with just your hands, and come out sounding less twee-poppers than Salvation Army hymn leaders. Mangion's vocals are gentle, with an earthy timbre suited perfectly for singing homemade arias on the front porch; when she fills the back of George's songs with harmonies, I strain to find words other than ""angelic"" and ""graceful"" because they've already been hastily applied to less deserving singers. They're good words for her. All Good Things is a four-song EP released on the small Spanish label Lejos. Its brief runtime necessarily prohibits it from working up the same wistful, dew-covered conceits as The Magic Lantern, though its most engaging moments would have fit nicely into that record. The opener ""Wait"" is the best: Beginning with Varity's guitar arpeggio, moving in what Leonard Cohen once described as the ""major lift"" and a ""minor fall,"" Mangion enters with a soft solo vocal describing a being who looks down from the clouds as the rain falls on people who would be wise to find shelter. Her protagonist is spreading ""gloom too soon/ 'Too soon,' they said,"" though during the chorus, as her own backing vocals drench the song just as the rain in her story does, she finds ""wives giving shelter"" and laments not being able to do more than watch the rain come down. Were I looking for a narrative obviously applicable to myself, I'd be out of luck. Were I looking for a beautiful piece of music, I'd have found it. Varity takes the lead on ""My Blue Room"", a melancholy take on Brian Wilson's brand of bedroom symphony. His vocals are thinner than Mangion's, but the track succeeds on the strength of its modest use of organ, tambourine and sleigh bells in Wilson's style, and a vocal arrangement that recalls the Beach Boys, albeit simplified to suit George's considerably more modest presentation. There's also a brief instrumental, ""Man Taking a Stroll"" (apparently starring clip-clip percussion as the man), and another short song, ""For the Last Time"", that ends the EP on a down note, moving forward in dirge-like fashion under its weighty church organ and Mangion's whisper-vocals. Practically speaking, All Good Things is a stopgap. Fans will certainly want more, and I'd advise anyone unfamiliar with the band to start with The Magic Lantern. However, George's strengths are clear here, and my own reaction follows suit. The hidden place, where expression becomes impression and the outside world folds inward, is still here.","Following their beautiful 2003 debut LP The Magic Lantern, British duo George present another handful of wistful, dew-covered tracks.

Mystery Spot,Chris Richards,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30ab1335d7bf1698624/1:1/w_160/12c3ad64.gif,2004-09-15 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6927-mystery-spot/,Jam,"My wife's grandmother is afflicted with advanced Alzheimer's disease. It's devastating to watch the disease take its snowballing toll, as the faces around her become less familiar, and recent events fail to take hold. It's as though her memories are being erased in reverse order, leaving only her childhood. The disease also eventually robs the sufferer of contemporary coherence, as sentences unravel before they've had a chance to even come together, which makes it all the more fascinating that she remembers, with astonishing thoroughness, the words and melodies to hundreds of popular songs from her youth and is able to sing them clearly and accurately. The music she grew up with was certainly memorable-- the AABA forms and gracefully sculpted melodies of the Gershwin and Porter songbooks, Tin Pan Alley showtunes, traditional hymns and Vaudeville numbers-- but that it's remained with her even as everything else fades never ceases to amaze me. The thing I've noticed about most of the songs she sings is that the words themselves aren't particularly memorable-- it's actually the melodies that give them weight in her mind. Indeed, many of the words might have even been interchangeable with other verses set to the same music back in the day, and who remembers words on their own terms? The average person could likely sing you hundreds of songs, but how many Tennyson and Byron or even Ogden Nash poems do think they could recite on command? I don't think it's any secret that good melodies make mundane words ring somehow more meaningful with us-- check ""Yesterday"" for a good example-- but the fact is still endlessly fascinating. Since we've mentioned The Beatles, we might as well steer this thing where it's ultimately going, to an obvious disciple of theirs, one Chris Richards, a Canadian power-pop practitioner who makes especially good use of the power of melody to carry words that wouldn't read well on a page deep into our psychological recesses. Take ""Don't Forget About Love"", for instance, which is a damn fine, sing-along-the-first-time heap of harmonies and ringing guitars that manages to make a line like this seem life-affirming: ""Can't you see?/ Woo hoo hoo/ Baby's with me."" Is it the way Richards' nasal voice draws out the first syllable of ""baby"" that makes it work so well? The way the subtle backward guitars squirm just under the surface? Is ""who cares?"" an acceptable answer? Because I'm just excited that it works, and Richards sounds like he is, too. Aside from a clutch of 13 knockout melodies and harmonies sweeter than dried mango, it's little things like that downplayed wash of backward guitar on ""Don't Forget About Love"" that really elevate Mystery Spot beyond a possible fate as just another Killer B's (think Beatles, Beach Boys, Byrds, Burrito Brothers...) homage. The whole album sounds great, in fact, the production ringing with clarity, but not overdone or slick. Richards backs up every rubber cement vocal with a catchy guitar part, and the tandem is tastefully backed by understated backing by a small cast of skilled friends. The opening pair of songs are two of the most ingratiating, as opener ""Is There Anybody Else?"" sinks its hooks in immediately with a charging guitar riff and backs it up with a massive chorus. Really, though, the quality is pretty uniform across the album, and though almost all of it-- including the pedal steel-tinged ballads-- could be easily summed up with references to ringing guitars, buoyant harmonies, killer hooks and infectious energy, that doesn't give proper credit to how well the songs are differentiated and how memorable each is on its own terms. Indeed, Richards has been incubating these songs for quite some time now, and his patience makes for one cherry bomb of a debut. On return trips from visiting grandma Kuzmickus, I sometimes wonder what songs from my youthful halcyon days I'll be able to sing for my grandkids one day, and just how ridiculous a cappella renditions of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Get Out of My Dreams (Get Into My Car)"" will sound. I'm not saying Chris Richards is Cole Porter or even close, but it's not too hard to imagine ""Your First Mistake"" or ""Gracefully"" standing up in the memory banks even as other things fade, and on a record like this, that's the highest compliment.","Canadian power-pop practitioner makes especially good use of the power of melody to carry words that wouldn't read particularly well written on a page.

Is All Over the Map,Giant Sand,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf20ea9e61561daa79f0/1:1/w_160/91507164.jpg,2004-09-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3445-is-all-over-the-map/,Thrill Jockey,"If you're a recent convert to what has been dubbed the New Weird America, permit me to fill you in: Howe Gelb's been living here for years. Both as a prolific solo artist and with his long-running combo Giant Sand, Gelb has created a fascinating and meandering series of footprints across the landscape. His work has never acknowledged any borders that might theoretically exist between mariachi waltzes, psychedelic guitar rock, uptown piano jazz, or dusty improvised C&W; and without squinting much, one can easily discern reverberations of his travels in such freewheeling roots-conscious acts as Califone, Jackie-O Motherfucker or even in the more countrified moments of Sunburned Hand of the Man. Giant Sand Is All Over the Map is roughly Giant Sand's 53rd album, give or take an authorized bootleg or five, but it's the group's first record of original material since 2000's elegiac Chore of Enchantment. (The entertaining but uneven cover album Cover Magazine appeared in 2002.) The album's title-- a phrase which has undoubtedly appeared in dozens of Giant Sand reviews over the years, maybe even including some written by me-- is here intended literally, as these songs were recorded at various locations around the globe with the assistance of one-time PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish. The biggest and most obvious change here is the departure of the group's longtime rhythm section of bassist Joey Burns and drummer John Convertino, who have left to focus on their work as Calexico. One can't help but notice the loss of two such subtle and dexterous instrumentalists, but Gelb takes their absence in full stride. I can't say for certain whether or not it's due to the exit of his former bandmates, but something has certainly got him all riled up here. Throughout the album, he sounds as ornery as javelina in an undersized cage, and the result is some of the rowdiest Giant Sand music since the near-grunge of 1992's Center of the Universe. The opening acoustic shuffle ""Classico"" sounds restrained enough until suddenly Gelb kicks his boots up on the piano and lets fly an electric guitar solo that sounds like miles of abandoned telegraph wire getting shredded by a twister. This apparently puts the taste of blood in his mouth, because he then proceeds to lead the (predominantly European) ensemble through some of Giant Sand's most satisfying Crazy Horse-derived rockers ever, in the form of ""NYC of Time"", ""Flying Around the Sun at Remarkable Speed"" and ""Remote"", which features bone-rattling back-up yowls from Scout Niblett. The record even includes an appropriately chaotic take on ""Anarchy in the U.K."" (here titled ""Anarchistic Bolshevistic Cowboy Bundle"") with charmingly imperfect vocals supplied by Gelb's daughter. However, it wouldn't be much of a Giant Sand album if they just stuck to the main road, and as usual, they don't. Side trips here include the cowboy poker parlor instrumental ""Rag"", the Latin-tinged bolero of ""Napoli"" and the sardonic narrative of ""Hood (View from a Heidelberg Hotel)"" which finds Gelb wittily tormenting the maids of a hotel who ""mostly can't pronounce its name."" (You've also got to wonder whether he's addressing Calexico on this track when he sings, ""The way I'm feeling about the brotherhood/ Has me feeling down and up/ To no good."") Some of these digressions occasionally cross the line and simply become irritants, particularly if you're someone who wishes that Gelb could just once give us a linear trail to follow. But Giant Sand has always been about the journey rather than the destination, and I for one am certainly not going to begrudge Gelb his ambition to spread his distinctive style of American weirdness worldwide.","The recent departure of rhythm section John Convertino and Joey Burns (now better known as Calexico) has surprisingly not hurt Giant Sand a bit-- this new release features some of frontman Howe Gelb's best material in ages.

It's the only way to make the dead horse speak-- jab its flank with a Linda Perry hypo and first-team production values. Neptunes, The Matrix, whoever. The decision to go Big Empty probably won't score you any Shortlist Prize nominations, and Jay-Z might never toast you in the VIP, but your ridiculous gasbag of an album will make a few Coconuts endcap trollers happy, and will maybe even rock the exurbs for a few more blips of summer. Sure, you'll just be another link in the wallet chain, but at least you'll be platinum. And MTV2 will shake your hand at the Billboard Music Awards, offering you a folded-up sawbuck and a job as a presenter. Who's laughing now, right? Taking that route to the rotting top of Mt. Smart Aleck would be laughable, yet acceptable, for a guy like Har Mar Superstar. It's a living and all that. But this portly Minnesota vice hasn't made any of those kinds of career-boosting concessions. Rather, he's kept his sound... well, pretty much exactly the same. Once again, The Handler mostly offers service industry beats and the Minneapolis kid's same old jag of groupies' panties stories. But there is at least one new wrinkle: Har Mar occasionally steps up the proto-electronic prattle of his past from its unsultry soul-jam roots to Chingy-style pop-rap. Opener ""Transit"" travels without moving to a geeky Stevie Wonder falsetto while banal disco bumps at midtempo in the background, finally culminating with you-know-who leading a girls-on-boy call-and-response of which he is naturally the center of attention: ""Har Mar is so sexy! Har Mar is so sexy!"" Right, we heard that before, and it still isn't true. Not that The Handler doesn't have its notable moments: If you wanna hear Karen O pretending to pork a fat fuck, she and Har Mar huff and puff over a splooging 80s pop retrofit called ""Cut Me Up""; ""DUI"" (""Dialing Under the Influence"", natch) is a harmless enough distraction for white college kids to hook up to; and sooner or later, Har Mar gets around to teabagging Holly Valance: The Aussie hottie appropriately tarts the Missy Elliott reset ""Back That Camel Up"". But the record is still mostly filler-- a hook for the gaudy live show-- proving again that there wasn't much to the Har Mar joke to begin with. Do you miss the maudlin keyboard pacing and foofy harmonica sound of 1985 soft-rock, best typified by ""That's What Friends Are For""? Then by all means, invest some time in The Handler's ""Sugar Pie"". Perhaps you want swishy raps about Freaky Freezies and public nudity, pinned halfheartedly to Taco's take on Irving Berlin's ""Putting on the Ritz""? ""As"" has an endless supply of tan lines, popsicles, sun block, and flip-flops. But then, even Taco himself got that kind of action at the peak of his fleeting fame skid. If Har Mar Superstar had taken his catchphrasing and ponce-preening to I Get Wet levels, The Handler might at least flaunt some radio-compressed hooks, Pink and DMX guest shots, and more songs like ""DUI"" that hug the line between Beck and dreck. But these productions are skeletal at best, mainstream kitsch-pop on a Casio budget. As such, The Handler only meagerly amplifies what he was already doing, probably pleasing his no doubt respectable cadre of core followers, but handily turning off the rest of humanity. Seriously, dude, put your pants back on.","Third (and perhaps final) album from the world's most hateable R&B; jokester features guest appearances from and/or duets with Yeah Yeah Yeahs' frontwoman Karen O and guitarist Nick Zinner, and Australian singer Holly Valance.

Miad, its compilation of predominately Miami artists, succeeds as a solid primer to a fertile scene, yet much of its music is so derivative that regional significance is rather moot-- it could've been mistaken for either an international compilation or a bootleg of Kid606 and AFX B-sides. Regionalism has never much mattered to music whose software is the same regardless of locale, but increasingly generic elements are in full effect here: tweaked frequencies, drum machines falling down 20 flights of stairs, microtones and vocals time-stretched to a drill, and kiddie-Nintendo melodies ironically superimposed on hip-hop and jungle beats all schtuped-up before getting too placid. Fortunately, most of the tracks still amuse. Miad opens with the brief, digital rainfall of Duster's ""Intro"", which drifts asleep and forgets its name by the time Captain Marmalade's ""Finding Out That You're in Love in the Seventh Grade"" kicks in, pitting a struggling novice drummer with a sweetened synth ballad. The momentum picks up with Clapan's ""Shopping Cart Rmx"", which employs the same synth patch but chirps along to a classic Miami bass jaunt while Osiris takes such jeep beats to their self-immolating logic. Xanopticon turns out crack-addled jungle on ""Retrn"", inviting Venetian Snares to a gentlemen's duel-- a good show that leaves only a few droplets of blood on the floor. Meggablockx, meanwhile, baffles with ""Angel"", a downtempo ballad garnished with a synth-pop hook reminiscent of the Reading Rainbow theme, accompanied by snippets of what seems to be a LSD-laced bride reciting her vows at a new-age wedding. Subjex's ""Subslaughter"" is fine, coagulated glitch-hop, while his remix of Phoenecia's ""Can Recall"" is spiced with moribund jungle beats and demonic crickets that hide in the bushes outside your house. However, Cliquetpar is the standout with ""Elico in the Sea"", featuring Childisc's Elico Suzuki enjoying choral orgasms over stoopid, algorithm-abusing drill 'n' bass. Miad's major misfires come with Beatwife's ""Random Bass Pach"", which seems to be a re-titled Richard D. James Album outtake, and Duster's ""Outro"", which is absolute filler, a 19-minute interval of silence before blurting a snippet from a death-metal demo tape.

Intensifications,Gene EstribouJean-Paul Pickens,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf1ea9e61561daa75cb/1:1/w_160/af637fdb.gif,2004-09-14 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2905-intensifications-with-jean-paul-pickens/,MEAMEA,"""Incidentally,"" Locust Music owner Dawson Prater tells me, ""I've been having some really nice back and forth with Gene Estribou. He's dazzled by the sudden appreciation his music is getting."" Of course, it's all Prater's doing. Sure, acoustic guitarist Estribou recorded the Grateful Dead and released their first single in 1965. But that's hardly enough to keep the man on even the most detailed of musical maps, let alone earn a dazzling level of popularity. Jean-Paul Pickens is also one of popular music's many footnotes, a banjoist in Bay Area poet David Meltzer's psych/folk-rock outfit Serpent Power, who could claim to be among the pioneers of Hindi modes-meets-Western pop ""raga-folk."" But that's a boast that could also be made by John Fahey or Sandy Bull or Robbie Basho-- all of whom worked at nearly the same time as, and were more innovative than, Pickens. And so it follows that Intensifications, Estribou and Pickens' split LP of solo improvised instrumentals, fell by the wayside. Intensifications is not and never was groundbreaking-- even at its most extreme, the improvisations are still relatively normal given the Basho-weirdo benchmark. But the album is solid, and, amidst the current free-folk love affair, is certainly relevant and worthy of its remastering, re-release, and reconsideration. To an extent, improvised solo instrumentals are less about a song and more about the player's technical ability, so showboating factors heavily into one's appreciation of these virtuosic displays. And despite the album's split nature, Estribou and Pickens complement each other well. Estribou's conceits are primarily tonal and less rhythmic. The raga opener, ""You Know, the One You Played Saturday Night"", is somewhat dogmatic, beginning high and ghostly before settling into breezy strums and high noon modal ebbing. Slide picks and Delta blues licks dominate Estribou's tense double-plucked meanderings on ""Amalgam"", whereas ""Metathanks"" seems decidedly more guilt-free, structured and countrified. Estribou's last cut, ""Eeee Minor"", is at once his most musically and rhythmically energetic piece, as he carefully fits his most abrasive dissonances alongside dactylic jitter. Pickens' portion of the record smokes from the start. On ""Coo Coo Bird"", Pickens begins with a wash of strings before launching into some swift and hyper-rhythmic but still remarkably melodic Americana banjo. Burner ""Shady Grows"" sounds like a Celtic woodwind ditty performed at Rescue Ranger speeds, albeit also with a high degree of melodic retention. And the sprawling ""G.R."" is Pickens' answer to the variety of playing styles Estribou displays on ""Eeee Minor"", as he places non-gimmicky rubato one-liners between dense, swift packets of terrific strumming. In a fictitious world where virtuoso folk guitarists contest for title belts, ""G.R."" would cinch Pickens' victory over Estribou.

Nostalgialator,Mike Ladd,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc64c0084474cd0c2a9f/1:1/w_160/3071ac25.jpg,2004-09-14 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4623-nostalgialator/,!K7,"Deep in the afterfuture, when Armageddon has rendered the world a cold, dead place, the surviving few will yearn for a time before the cataclysm, when things were brighter and people knew how to party. And in order to quench that yearning, the people will turn to the Nostalgialator, a great machine on treads perhaps constructed from melted plastic soldiers that brings the sounds and sensations of the past to the huddled masses. Watch it, though: It occasionally snaps and sucks off history's sugarcoat to reveal what that time was really like. If I gather correctly, this is the general conceptual arc along which hip-hop's strangest operator, Mike Ladd, has designed his first three solo albums. It's almost as awesomely pretentious as his concurrent trilogy revolving around the struggles between the underground Infesticons and mainstream Majesticons. Nostalgialator is constructed in two halves, the first stuffed with interstellar electrofunk for the party at the end of the universe, the second a downtempo chill session that presumably signals a malfunction in the titular machine. It groans to life with a collage of smooth beats, swelling crowd noise, coughing synths and barely intelligible shoutouts from the stage called ""Dire Straits Play Nuremburg"", and the air already feels charged with electricity. Ladd flexes every muscle he has over the next 40 minutes, Bollywood horns blasting at the corners, sound sweeping into great, kinetic waves as Ladd raps, croons, speaks like the mental offspring of Gil-Scott Heron, shouts, and cranks up his falsetto. He works that odd, scratchy falsetto on the spacey R&B; single ""Housewives at Play"", mingling with the slinking synths and thumping beat and a De la Soul-ish breakdown that repeats itself into an echoing wah guitar figure that's positively out of this world. His background playing in punk bands comes to the fore on ""Wild Out Day"", a frenetic blast of Mumbai hardcore that kicks Minor Threat in the face with a cartoon horn break while Ladd loses his shit barking out the verses. The album flips in head-spinning fashion through British Invasion guitar breaks, organic drum explosions, crunching electro, and Ladd's slippery raps, the best of which might be ""Black Orientalist"", with its tumbling cadence, his viscous voice flirting with melody and teasing words into referential tangles to mince and mix Vietnam, colonialism, the war on terrorism, and black identity into a single, sweeping blur. The album's second half flows with Ladd's stream of consciousness, as he waxes Gil-Scott on the title track in a swirling analog texture with a meditation on Ben Franklin and electricity: ""He discarded letters and chess for fire from clouds/ Delving in the games of gods, basking in new decadence beyond women in Paris and the death of Indians/ Something supernatural/ The harnessing of energy."" Ladd's knack for imagery is breathtaking, as he spreads Franklin, ""thunderstruck junkie, fiend for sky crack,"" across history into the board room of ComEd and the wallet of the consumer dropping their check for the electric bill in the mail. The instrumental ""How Electricity Really Works"" takes this shift away from the first half's funkiness into extreme realms, mimicking 20th century classical music and ambivalent soundtrack music. But it's the closer, ""Sail Away Ladies (Traditional)"", that takes Ladd furthest from the man we know, as he croons in a milky baritone over a sort of sci-fi country & western backing. By this point, the whole Nostalgialator concept has been swept clean aside by the wave of Ladd's 21st Century musical assault, and that's perfectly fine-- the last thing I'd want to hear him do is compromise his mastery of wordplay and sonic trickery in the name of advancing some arcane plot. As much as Ladd continually references the past, from Dr. Livingston and Picasso to Minor Threat, Funkadelic, and De La Soul, he moves the air with a beat that's entirely his own, the sum of too many parts to reflect any one too prominently, and his perceived role as a prankster on the sideline of hip-hop doesn't do his innovation or skill any justice. Nostalgialator closes the book on an epic cycle of three loosely linked albums, and I can't wait to see what crazy glue seeps out of Ladd's head to hold together the next series.","Highly experimental underground hip-hop artist transcends genre on his latest release, drawing from everything from R&B; and C&W; to Gil-Scott Heron and Minor Threat.

Connected,The Foreign Exchange,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bea113d197565213b77c/1:1/w_160/6609b0dc.jpg,2004-09-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3321-connected/,BBE,"Until early this year, North Carolina emcee Phonte (Little Brother) and Dutch beatmaking sensation Nicolay had never met, or even spoke on the phone. Making their acquaintance on the webboards at Okayplayer, the two took The Postal Service's album-by-correspondence technique to heart: Nicolay instant messaged beats to Phonte, who dropped verses, and then the Holland native mastered the product. The result, Connected, is a sweltering, improbable 14-track symphony teeming with potent lyricism and subtle, lustrous rhythmatics. In today's hip-hop landscape, the organic and emotive qualities of classic soul are often bastardized (cf. Jagged Edge) but rarely duplicated. To wit: In its Hit Factory days, Motown churned out classics faster than Beanie Sigel garners arrest warrants. So either Nicolay is a musical genius who simply understands the language of classic R&B; better than most stateside producers, or a Stax Records jetliner crashed in the Netherlands, spilling thousands of LPs on his thatched abode when he was a toe-tapping toddler. ""The Foreign Exchange Title Theme"" kicks Connected off with a syncopated harmony, while the welcoming voice of D.C.'s YahZarah wafts, ""Thank you for the music, thank you for right now."" That ""right now"" bit is telling, too, as the record revels in the glory of the moment: Urgent, immediate, instant gratification is one of Connected's calling cards. ""Nic's Groove"", for example, is equipped with sleepy brass, delicious harmonies and a booming bassline. It's like standing in the street during 5 minutes of the dopest house party you weren't invited to-- and when you dare to peek in the window, Nicolay hits his apex on ""The Answer"", bowling the crowd over with an ephemeral thunder while Oddisee, Ken Starr, and Phonte rock the crowd, the latter claiming, ""I applied for the job of rap nigga, but I was overqualified."" But Connected is more than fluid construction and a unique backstory. Embedded in the layered vocal arrangements and popping rhythms are the seeds of a quiet rebellion. While crews like Mash Out Posse or Cocoa Brovaz may alienate newcomers with the furious intensity of their experiences, The Foreign Exchange delivers their triumphs and tragedies with silky surreptitiousness. Connected reads like the diary of the young, black hip-hop hopeful, as Phonte reminds us of the thousands of struggling MCs who sit in the shadow of The Source. He walks us through his money woes on ""Happiness"" (""Writing mad checks that might as well have 'Spalding' on them""), his girlfriend's pregnancy on ""Be Alright"" (""My girl was throwing up this morning/ I pray it was something she ate""), and his parents' disapproval of his life on ""All That You Are"" (""They can't understand how I feel when I'm on the track board turning the knob switch/ My moms keep talking like get a real job shit""). Despite The Foreign Exchange's transatlantic relationship, the record's stripped-down approach is reminiscent of the days when kids hijacked streetlamps to power their block party turntables. Amazingly, this album seamlessly flows without not only that street-level intimacy but without even the assistance of a shared studio. The result is enough to make the most heartbroken cynics fall in love with independent hip-hop all over again.","Little Brother emcee Phonte and Dutch beatmaker Nicolay team up via internet to create one of this year's finest underground hip-hop releases.

Wet from Birth,The Faint,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd23ea9e61561daa7647/1:1/w_160/57f1b2b5.jpg,2004-09-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2952-wet-from-birth/,Saddle Creek,"At last, America's ADHD scourge has its definitive product. Wet from Birth, the fourth proper full-length from Omaha new-wavers-gone-goth-rockers The Faint, is a hyperkinetic and confused soundtrack for wanderlusted, deficient attention spans, suffering from enough overactive production flourishes and inexplicable instrumental touches to obliterate the band's addictive dance jams. So pick up your scattered crayons, kids, and sharpen their tips against the walls. The Faint share your unfocused consciousness and are ready to commiserate. The Faint's last release, Danse Macabre, was a tenfold leap beyond its synth-pop predecessor, 1999's Blank Wave Arcade; the band's decision to target the techno-goth introvert in us all, rather than to further embrace the wider appeal of 1980s retro-futurism, made clear that they cared not one whit for their audience's expectations. And yet, even considering that album's novelties, few could likely have predicted the level of bewilderment that lies in store on Wet from Birth. Almost all traces of the band's early new-waving are gone; rather, The Faint gorge themselves on synthesized strings and junkyard static, while limber dance-bass struggles in vain to retain any semblance of low-end against the harsh treble of their production's greasy, Plasticine coating. The experimentation feels forced from the outset: On opener ""Desperate Guys"", a mounting string section (the album's most prevalent and unnecessary addition) slams headfirst into caustic bass-waves before Todd Baechle's signature wire-sharpened vocals join the pulse. Simply busying up an otherwise very straightforward groove, these effects add little to the song, and in fact seem to serve no purpose other than to provide some transparent veneer of forced artiness. Here, for the first time, it feels as though The Faint have lost faith in their previous strengths. ""Southern Belles in London Sing"", too, falls victim to mismatched instrumentation. Subtle horns creak from enveloping static before becoming lost in an overbearing string arrangement. Its rugged, Depeche Mode-esque bassline gives way to rapturous Siren singers in one of the album's great what-the-fuck moments, adding one more cacophonous element to a song already suffocating in density. Though more tightly arranged, ""Erection"" and closer ""Birth"" make the unforgivable mistake of calling attention to Baechle's horrendous lyrics. The results are two bona fide contenders for worst song of the year, and could find themselves in a lonely race. Limited to a bug-zapping bass and mechanized handclaps, ""Erection"" never builds from its repetitive drone, instead buzzing shapelessly for nearly three minutes as a bawdy in-joke. Rough-riding on an anarchist's punch of muddy guitars and doomsday percussion, ""Birth"" opens with the observation, ""In the beginning, there was semen,"" before dishing still more tired shock-value imagery and finally arriving at, ""I should have noticed the beauty/ And not how it hurt/ Wet like a cherry/ In the blood-bath of birth."" Yes, we get it. Unfortunately, Baechle's grin can't excuse his trite Reznorisms. The real misfortune is that these hyperactive misfires hide Wet from Birth's central joys. When not indulging in childish grossout humor or overstuffing their tracks with studio gimmickry, The Faint still prove powerful songsmiths. The more stripped, simpler tracks here-- those scraped reasonably clean of tangential instrumentation and kitchen-sink decoys (""How Could I Forget"", ""Phone Call"", ""Paranoiattack"")-- rank among their best work. Indeed, beneath their frenzied effects and miswired production sense, they still chronicle America's black-lit dancemare and exhume the cheap thrills of 80s synth-pop with the best in their field. Their mistake is in forcing too many ideas into every possible second, and that kind of overstimulation always ends the same way: Faint, say hello to the time-out corner.","Fourth proper album from these Omaha-based new-wavers-gone-goth-rockers further slants toward the darker Depeche Mode territory explored on 2001's Danse Macabre.

Stealing of a Nation,Radio 4,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e513d1975652138736/1:1/w_160/e8a09b90.jpg,2004-09-13 05:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6651-stealing-of-a-nation/,Astralwerks,"Brooklyn's Radio 4 seem to have stopped caring about music midway through the recording of 2002's Gotham!. Through 2000's debut, The New Song and Dance LP and 2001's ""Dance to the Underground"" 12-inch, Radio 4 followed their neo-Clash/Gang of Four tendencies into a more indie-danceable context, and it just about worked. Meshies dropped ""Radio 4"" in the same breath as The Rapture and !!!, and none of them were shocked when the band asked the DFA to produce their sophomore effort. The first half of Gotham! showcased the band's live energy with smart but spare embellishments, and preserved the grassroots vitriol that gave at least some credence to their incendiary political lyrics. The second half, however, felt like an afterthought: Its production is noticeably heavier on what are infinitely less compelling songs, as the DFA frantically lipstick and sunglass Bernie Lomax to conceal the album's rigor mortis. Despite it all, Astralwerks signed the band in 2003. Most would think Radio 4 would use this budget upgrade to trudge up some fresh material-- by now it had been two years since the band recorded Gotham!-- but they still couldn't muster the energy. Instead, we got the Electrify EP, which included a barely distinctive re-recording of 2001's ""Dance to the Underground"", and 6 consistently awful remixes. Radio 4 had written itself in water: That quickly, they'd become has-beens, and from there, any headway made would go toward reclaiming lost ground. Stealing of a Nation is the polar opposite of monumental. Its 12 songs brutally follow the modus operandi of Electrify, in that all are simply thinly disguised re-recordings of ""Dance to the Underground""-- each more obscene than the next. What's worse, the band doesn't have the indie-dance acumen of James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy to fall back on anymore: Instead, there's Martin ""Max"" Heyes, whose dated Primal Screamisms drown out the band's already feeble melodies and political agenda. Radio 4 can be commended for at least trying to move past the purposeful lo-fi of Gotham! and into fresher territory, but there's no bell or whistle in the world that could energize the utterly impotent songs at the core of Stealing of a Nation. While Radio 4 whine about bands moving to New York for the wrong reasons (The Scene!) on album single and opener ""Party Crashers"", the band crashes a party themselves-- the pilled 'n' thrilled, screamadelic one across the pond that's been shut down for 13 years. The change of direction is not at all accidental-- even the title Stealing of a Nation aligns the band with New Order (who recorded both ""State of the Nation"" and ""Shame of the Nation"") and all of Manchester's post-New Order antics-- but come on, does every song after ""Party Crashers"" have to rip Happy Mondays' ""God's Cop"" and Primal Scream's ""Don't Fight It, Feel It"", too? Of course, the similarities between Radio 4 and producer Max Heyes' previous clients would be a less pressing issue if the band had any charisma whatsoever. It's difficult enough for frontman Anthony Roman to convincingly rally the troops against The Man and The Machine on ""(Give Me All of Your) Money"" and when his voice is swaddled in the purple robes of high-gloss production, but his lazy three-note melodies couldn't even start a lunchroom food fight. Meanwhile, guitarist Tommy Williams and keyboardist Gerard Garone trade equally malnourished riffs on 9/11-by-numbers ""State of Alert"", and Heyes' insistence on the drum machine on ""Transmission"" and ""The Death of American Radio"" keeps live drummer Greg Collins from contributing anything more than a credit in the liners. Two songs that Radio 4 intended as clear homage to their influences only further indict Stealing of a Nation. ""Nation"", which the band openly modeled in sound, political agenda, and track placement (right in the middle) after The Clash's ""Straight to Hell"" on Combat Rock, neatly reiterates all of Stealing of a Nation's shortcomings, from Heyes' outmoded soundboards to Roman's unconvincing, merely observational politics to the entire band's inability to write remotely compelling melodies. And then, right before the aptly titled closer ""Coming Up Empty"", Radio 4 dub-stomps with unusual swagger through ""Dismiss the Sound"" with unmistakable similarity to ""Albatross"" by Public Image, Ltd., from whose song (""Radio 4"") the band takes its name. But of course, Roman hardly skims the depth of Johnny Lydon's conviction, and Radio 4 sells off PiL's atonal confession for glitzy and insubstantial chorus effects. Like the rest of the album, the song's slickly produced fancy face also becomes its muzzle, robbing Radio 4 of any bite it could have had. Stealing of a Nation truly has nothing to offer musically, nor does Radio 4 urge anything of note politically, sticking to the trite ""America Is Fucked!"" hogwash that any seventh grader with a blog and a dial-up could piss out in an afternoon. Never has a band been so undeserving of its own name.","One-time dancepunk contenders ditch the DFA for Astralwerks to turn out one of the year's most humiliating misfires.

Folker,Paul Westerberg,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa055e6ef959693214fa/1:1/w_160/5c3f3b56.jpg,2004-09-13 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8633-folker/,Vagrant,"Throughout his career Paul Westerberg has always done his best work when expectations were lowest. Back in the fabled early days of The Replacements, his abundant songwriting skills always shone brightest whenever his audience was most justified in expecting a full-fledged drunken implosion. However, things went south for Paul once listeners began to recognize his genius and demand that he fulfill it by delivering unto us a tour de force, or at the very least a big record with hit singles. Record companies got into the act and threw him huge recording budgets and trips to the studio with the likes of Don Was, and our man buckled and began to poop out lifeless mediocrities like Don't Tell a Soul or Eventually. So in a way it was only too predictable what would happen after the commercial and artistic nadir of 1999's Suicaine Gratifaction chased off the remnants of his audience. With nobody listening and all pressure lifted, he went down to his basement and reclaimed his mojo on 2002's unvarnished double Stereo/Mono release and hasn't looked back since. Perhaps in part to further minimize the demands put on each individual album, Westerberg is now following one of Bob Pollard's most cherished songwriting axioms: If you can't always dazzle them with brilliance, stupefy them with productivity. (The idea being that it's a lot easier to forgive the occasional ""Silver Naked Ladies"" if you haven't waited three years to hear it.) Folker is Paul's fifth album of new material in the last two years, which is more output than he managed in the preceding 10. Adhering closely to the formula established on Stereo, the album again finds Westerberg all alone down in the rec room, muffing lyrics, gloriously airmailing guitar solos, playing the drums like he's doing the dishes, and generally having a fine time. In fact, there are moments when Folker reaches Vampire on Titus depths of fidelity, which probably qualifies it as his sloppiest recording yet, Grandpaboy or no. By now, though, we've all learned that if a Westerberg tune can't cut it in this environment, there's no amount of studio polish that'd have been able to fix it anyway. Things get off to an inauspicious start, with the banal one-note joke ""Jingle"" (""Buy it now, buy it now/ This is my single/ This is my jingle"") lasting at least twice as long as necessary despite its one-minute runtime. Thankfully, Westerberg recovers to settle into a nice hitting streak, bashing through effortlessly catchy songs like ""Looking Up in Heaven"" and the very GBV-ish ""As Far as I Know"" with an ease seldom heard since ""Waitress in the Sky"". There's a disarming simplicity and artlessness to these and other highlights like ""23 Years Ago"" and ""Gun Shy"", with an increased emphasis on persistent pop melody over crafty wordplay. This is fortunate since Folker is not Paul's strongest effort lyrically, with the quotable gems (""Bring a thimble and I'll pour my thoughts out"") just barely outnumbering the groaners (""I promise not to bug you/ Only just to hug you."") That's not to say the album is entirely without thematic heft. On the contrary, the album's emotional centerpiece is ""My Dad"", a tribute to Westerberg's recently deceased father that stands among the most nakedly heartfelt he's ever written. In hands less deft, a number like this could've become unbearably maudlin, but Westerberg's wry humor and painterly eye for detail (""He's never seen me play/ But he gets a kick from the newspaper/ When he sees the family name"") make it a stirring and poignant elegy, and when it closes with him repeating, ""My dad I love,"" it should bring a lump to the throat of even the most jaded ironyhound. Not even Westerberg's classic albums have been free of filler (unless you can honestly say you still get a kick out of ""Gary's Got a Boner"") and Folker has its fair allotment of pointless misfires like ""$100 Bride"", with its unfortunate chorus of, ""I promise not to leave the room/ Even if I've gotta vomit."" It's tracks like this one that'll drive you insane if you're deluded enough to think that Paul still has that flawless masterpiece in him somewhere. But if you've resigned yourself to the fact that we're always going to have to accept his periodic pearls of brilliance with a healthy side portion of flies in the sherbet, Folker should meet and possibly even exceed your expectations. ","Poorly titled new outing from the former Replacements frontman offers enough strong tracks to redeem a handful of terrible ones.

Sphere,Landing,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9813d197565213b36f/1:1/w_160/bdaa4177.jpg,2004-09-13 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4673-sphere/,K,"If there's a harder genre to find distinction in than IDM/electronica, it's assuredly slowcore, with its foundation of stern concrete dirges and black-holed soundwaves. Bands like Low and Slowdive have to work that much harder to wedge distinguishable characteristics into their sound given that the genre's glacier-paced dynamics allow for much less melodic wiggle room. The destinations for a slowcore song are limited: Blissful transcendence and candlelit gloom can coincide for only so long before they dissolve into Requiem for a Dream, all hopping-refrigerators and funereal paranoia. At least with garage rock or three-chord teenie-punk, you give the people what they want: Melodic anthems to shout along with in the Zippo-light. Slowcore's dank, dark niche is the sole place the music even finds voice, and there are only so many Rorschach reads in the void. Steadily, former BYU grads Aaron and Adrienne Snow, the married couple that forms the core of ethereal quartet Landing, have released four decent, if unspectacular, albums of waxy soundscapes that fit quite cozily in the genre. For better or worse, their fifth record (and second for K), Sphere, finds them treading the same tepid water. Subdued beats and lunar synth washes paint these 10 tracks shades of empty space. They ask only to subside into their meandering guitar lines and Jetson-streaked atmospherics, leaving nary a trace of their passing. A quick look at the track titles, autumnal claims like ""Fluency of Colors"", ""Into Silence"" and ""Gravitational"" provide an apt summary of the album's desired effect. Still, these multitudinous names are misleading; more appropriate would have been a single epithet and 10 roman numerals, as the uniformity here leads to its generally anemic quality. Most of the tracks seem content to wallpaper your Sunday mornings, as you sift through the smoky split-ends of your Saturday night and free your thoughts for pre-coffee tasklessness. Little is required of you, and even the subtle tensions offered by Landing have the feel of microwave warmth: crisp, mechanical and perfect for auto-defrosting. In the few places where the listener is jarred out of his relative ambivalence, the music gurgles up beyond its vague, ritualistic glow to form gauzy imprints on the surroundings. The aforementioned ""Fluency of Colors"" opens with toothpicked drumbeats and chiming electric guitars, deftly mounting into an epic lead-off. As it sputters out into an acoustic-guitar stroll, the song captures the wandering excitement of a city recovering from blackout and streaming into the streets to revel in the rare comfort of dark hours. Sadly, the album fails to live up to its insistent desires. Along similar lines, on ""Filament"", Adrienne Snow's warm voice subtly collides with its stumble-drunk drums and aspirined synths to provide rarified atmosphere from a work that seeks just that. As Snow's Siren-drift distills itself into the song's vibrating guitars, it's one of the few moments where Landing seems to fully understand that there must be some return from escape, that something must tug you back from spaceless jamming to ground you against the psychic drone. By the end, it's clear that Sphere is ably managed if not particularly accomplished. As leaves curl yellow and the air sours grey, fall will cool into a time for the year's wistful contemplation. Landing is willing to streak this period with the appropriate violet hues and entombed daylight if you give them a chance. But take them up on their offer, and you may quickly understand the solemnity of summer's failed growth.","Pacific Northwest dream-rockers' latest LP for K is pleasant enough as a mood-setting backdrop, but its lack of variety holds it back.

Fingathing and the Big Red Nebula Band,Fingathing,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bea0abf31b7dc7156191/1:1/w_160/55dcbb19.jpg,2004-09-13 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3320-fingathing-and-the-big-red-nebula-band/,Grand Central,"Principal Fingathing members Peter Parker and Sneaky aren't content with concept albums. They're going for a cohesively conceptualized oeuvre: a pulpy sci-fi epic serialized to music. The latest Fingathing LP picks up where they left off in the most literal sense imaginable: Not only does it continue to fine tune and flesh out their glitchy astral-funk, it resumes the intergalactic adventure yarn that's been unfolding over the course of their entire career. After faking their deaths at the end of their last record, our heroes are racing through space in metal coffins on a collision course with the sun. Of course, en route to their true demise, Parker and Sneak slip through a rift in the space-time continuum (in the genre of sci-fi that Fingathing pay lip service to, space and time seem to rend as easily and frequently as cheap nylons) and wind up in The Red Nebula. And that's just in the first track, ""Walk in Space"". With the homage to the Star Wars cantina band on its cover, its unabashedly kitschy geek-chic concept, and its blend of twitchy IDM, instrumental hip-hop, and gaudy sound effects, Fingathing and the Big Red Nebula Band seem born for anime kids, suburban B-boys, and Adult Swim message boarders. It's funk as a musical metaphor for escapist fantasy, rather than for sex. Not that the concept is so distinctly discernible from the songs. I'm not sure how one would glean that the bombastic, vocoded club cut ""Walk in Space"", which plays like a crunk M83, has anything to do with space coffins and inter-dimensional travel without access to the album's press release. Besides some diced up one-liners like ""walk in space"" and ""it looks great up here"" that serve more as rhythmic fodder than narrative devices, there's no inkling of the storyline. Except that once you know, it's a soundtrack for careening through space, which you might figure out by diligently studying the mural in the liner notes with pictures illustrating the action each track represents, the concept dovetails so seamlessly with the music that it seems plain as day. As ""Walk in Space"" shucks and jives through sinuous keyboard lines, syncopated drums, sweeping synthetic strings, and elastic bass, hairpin-turning on picturesque breakbeats, one can vividly imagine peering though a porthole as the cosmos rockets by, exploding with supernovas, seething with varicolored vapors, whirling with galaxies. The pattern holds for the remainder of the album: The concept is imperceptible from the songs, yet makes intuitive sense regarding them when you're aware of it. ""Reanimo"", in which a giant robot of the same name frees Fingathing from their coffins, is a grimy, minimal bounce track of Neptunes-baiting electro soul with shifting permutations of snap and drone. The shambling ""Open a Door"" is less rigid than the preceding tracks: 90 seconds of clangorous noise, deep throbs, and mounting solar winds. It rolls without a hitch into the fluid, Morricone-meets-Boards of Canada shimmy of ""Themes from the Big Red"". Also worth noting are the prog-hop alarum ""Rock the Whole Planet"", the amped-up death march ""Big Bang"", and the weepy, orchestral suite of ""Music to Watch Aliens By"". Fingathing and the Big Red Nebula Band closes with the sleek and triumphant bravado of ""Return to Earth"", a more soothing space muzak to bear Parker and Sneaky home. The thread will surely be picked up, however obliquely, in the next installment of Fingathing's interplanetary romp. The American release of the record also includes a bonus disc called Time Capsule, a collection of five songs culled form their Main Event and Superhero Music LPs, which evince a more traditional instrumental hip-hop style and emphasize the major leaps in technical proficiency, spacious production, genre variegation, and sheer propulsive force Fingathing has achieved. The story remains the same-- wildly improbable and allusively rendered-- but the music has inflated and deepened in a manner befitting the giant robots, imploding planets, and freaky cast of thousands it contains.","With its unabashed geek-chic concept and blend of twitchy IDM, instrumental hip-hop and gaudy sound effects, Fingathing seem born for anime kids, suburban B-boys, and Adult Swim message boarders.

N'ecoutez Pas,Fly Pan Am,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bddbea9e61561daa77c5/1:1/w_160/b1a452bb.gif,2004-09-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3121-necoutez-pas/,Constellation,"Led by Godspeed You Black Emperor! guitarist Roger Tellier-Craig, Fly Pan Am are but one of many storefront operations spun off from that multi-limbed Montreal-based behemoth. And, as has been the case with other branch offices like Set Fire to Flames, Do Make Say Think, or A Silver Mt. Zion, Fly Pan Am have experienced some difficulty establishing an identity distinct from their parent organization. Due primarily to Tellier-Craig's instantly recognizable playing style, the angular instrumental art-funk that predominated the group's first two albums too often resembled a pared-back, less engaging GYBE! But that all changes dramatically on N'Ecoutez Pas (which, unless my pidgin French has failed me, translates to ""Don't Listen"".) Here, on their third full-length, Fly Pan Am complete a Black Dice-caliber personality shift, abandoning all previous formulae and pushing their sound outward in all directions. For the first time, they incorporate vocals into their attack along with an unruly array of electronics, keyboards, and field recordings-- all of which results in their finest and most fully realized work to date. The album is erected around the twin pillars of ""Autunt Zig-Zag"" and ""Trés Trés Retro"", two 11-minute showpieces that give Fly Pan Am enough elbow room to flex their suddenly considerable Krautrock-nourished muscles over massive hunks of terrain. ""Zig-Zag"" is Fly Pan Am's noisiest and perhaps best piece yet, combining layers of hissing electronics with a wriggling edifice of distorted guitar worthy of My Bloody Valentine, all while garbled voices whisper and conspire malevolently. In French, no less. Eventually, the fog lifts enough to reveal the charred tree stumps that pass by your railcar window as countless little bug-sized motors chug away ineffectually. ""Trés Trés Retro"" is a somewhat simpler affair, and its stuttering drums and hypnotic, loping bass hearken back to Fly Pan Am's 1999 debut, on which they dabbled extensively with minimalism and the beauty of repetition (most memorably when Tellier-Craig at one point plucked the same simple chord repeatedly for over 10 minutes). Here, though, the band gives the rhythm section plenty of traffic to weave through, with blinking stoplight keyboards and strange cut-up vocal edits constantly emerging to ensure that you don't get too mesmerized by that centerline. The shorter tracks assembled around these two epics are something of a motley bunch, though impressive in their scope and variety. The handsomely dissonant opener ""Br\xFBlez Suivant, Suivante!"" brings Fly Pan Am about as close to conventional song structure as they've ever been, calling to mind Evol-era Sonic Youth. The jagged, muttering ""Pas à Pas Step Until"" should cause Boredoms fans to crane their necks. Less successful are brief electronic morsels like ""Buvez Nos Larmes de Métal"" (translation: ""Drink Our Metal Tears"") or the burbling, appropriately titled ""..."" which, at best, functions as a palate cleanser. So while N'Ecoutez Pas might not be the most consistent record you'll ever hear, at its best it finds Fly Pan Am approaching peaks of intensity and ragged splendor that few bands even acknowledge, let alone attempt to scale. Even better is that the whole thing is too damaged sounding to even remotely resemble GY!BE: For the first time, Fly Pan Am soar on their own wings.","Godspeed You Black Emperor! guitarist Roger Tellier-Craig's latest project becomes one of the first GYBE! offshoots to find an identity completely removed from its parent group.

Garden State,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fdea9e61561daa54ba/1:1/w_160/dec2fb78.jpg,2004-09-13 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7891-garden-state/,Sony,"Garden State is a movie very suspicious of drugs, whether recreational or medicinal. Its protagonist, Andrew Largeman, has popped Prozac, Zoloft, and a whole smorgasbord of mood-altering and -enhancing medicines for most of his life, all prescribed by his well-meaning psychiatrist father. These drugs allow both men to overlook the central tragedy in their family-- the accident that left Andrew's mother paralyzed-- but as a consequence, Andrew is never able to experience the emotions that he comes to realize comprise an identity. When he takes ecstasy at a party, it only disconnects him further from himself and others. Scoring this trip is ""In the Waiting Line"" by Zero 7, which sounds exactly how Hollywood thinks a drug trip sounds: languid, midtempo beat; sampled sitar; vaguely psychedelic atmosphere; and what sounds like a bong hit during the bridge. As partygoers try to talk to Andrew and he begins to question his experience, Sophie Barker sings, ""Everyone's saying different things to me.../ Do you believe what you see?"" It's an overly obviously choice, as is much of this soundtrack. On one hand, these 13 tracks, all of which are available on other albums or compilations, seem genuinely to be music the characters would pick to soundtrack their lives. On the other, the songs all tend to comment too directly and too blatantly on their situations and motivations. For a movie that manages to locate subtle humor and pathos in its visuals (all those shots of Braff standing square in the center of the frame, as if looking into a mirror), Garden State lets the music do too much work. Coldplay's ""Don't Panic"", with its universal chorus (""We live in a beautiful world""), scores an early scene in which Andrew is driving to work amid all the maddening traffic of Los Angeles. This use is plainly ironic, but still work better here than it did in Igby Goes Down, where its earnestness was overkill. Nick Drake's ""One of These Things First"", however, speaks all too clearly to Andrew's identity problems: ""I could have been a sailor/ I could have been a cook/ A real live lover/ Could have been a book."" And the film's final song, Frou Frou's ""Let Go"", buzzes trippily to its chorus, ""There's beauty in the breakdown,"" but its title and lyrics could have been written expressly for the movie's anti-drug message. For Garden State, drugs are clearly not the key to a better life; Natalie Portman is. Barring that, try music. ""They'll change your life,"" Portman's character, Sam, remarks of The Shins as she passes Andrew a pair of headphones playing ""New Slang"". She's almost right. The Shins' two tracks on Garden State (including ""Caring Is Creepy"") are both recreational and medicinal: Drawing on 20 years of college, alternative, and indie rock, they are musically playful and subtle enough to be emotional Rorschach tests-- each listener will draw a slightly different shade of meaning from them. Similarly, the soundtrack's best songs are those that don't have such a direct connection to the story, that could have come randomly on the radio and just happen to fit the scene. Braff makes good use of tracks by Remy Zero, Thievery Corporation, and former Men at Work singer Colin Hay, whose song ""I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You"" is a surprisingly effective barroom lament. When Andrew and Samantha have their first kiss (after literally screaming into the abyss, another testament to the movie's lack of subtlety), Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" blares out of nowhere. It could be a sly nod to The Graduate, to which Garden State has been compared, but the song communicates a few very particular ideas about loneliness and connection without ever overstating them. Later, Iron & Wine's cover of The Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights"" plays as the camera pans slowly up the length of a bed to show Andrew spooning post-coitally with Sam. Sam Beam slows down the tempo and substitutes only his guitar for Jimmy Tamborello's beats, in the process turning Ben Gibbard's whimsical, sometimes saccharine lyrics into soft-focus images that unfold patiently and tenderly. Because its lyrics have little do with the action on the screen and its music supports the mood, Braff has created through character and image, ""Such Great Heights"" may be the most evocative song on the soundtrack-- refurbishing an upbeat song that sounds like a public declaration of love's exclusivity, this version sounds more like a whispered, consoling promise. Perhaps due to the movie's basis in Braff's New Jersey childhood, or to some kind of film debut jitters, Garden State the movie tends to overexplain its characters' motivations, as if they're not already apparent in the images and performances. The final 10 minutes, for example, could have been shot with no dialogue at all, and not only would the meaning have still come across, it might have even had more impact. Garden State the soundtrack similarly spells out its intentions all too clearly, leaving little to the viewer/listener's imagination. The songs may be memorable-- some of them may even change your life-- but as a soundtrack for a movie that barely needs any music to convey its message, they end up being something less than their sum.","Soundtrack to Zach Braff's directorial debut is an indie-friendly pastiche of heartstring- tugging pop, with an occasional dab of dated electronica. Features Nick Drake, Coldplay, The Shins (twice!), Simon & Garfunkel, Bonnie Somerville, and Iron & Wine covering The Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights"".

Dangerous Dreams,Moving Units,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c56aeb335119a49ed9d3/1:1/w_160/c5da02b3.jpg,2004-09-12 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5606-dangerous-dreams/,Palm,"Now that the dance-punk revolution has passed into trend obsolescence, it's easier to assess its fallout from a more objective standpoint. Moving Units were, in fact, there from the beginning. That is, the Los Angeles trio started making danceable post-punk way back in 2001, before ""House of Jealous Lovers"" was helping turn any Brooklyn dive bar willing to buck the Cabaret Laws into a slapdash club. But while Moving Units' style falls in close proximity to their brethren, they've always managed to exude a more anachronistic vibe. Dangerous Dreams is dance-punk, simple and unabashed, and the album wins points for its sincerity. Opener ""Submission"" thrives on understated vocals (Nic Offer take note) and facile mixing. If anything, the band owe more to jam rock than the DFA in both their instrumentation and recording techniques, avoiding excessive digital adornments and laying down loose, man-made grooves. ""Going for Adds"" follows a similar tack, dry-heaving angular guitar riffs over an accommodating bassline. Again, each instrument is performed live and the song is seemingly unalloyed by digital processing or other tinkering. But this approach can wear tiresome, as the ensuing 10 tracks prove. Texturally, the group only does so much with their stabbing rhythmic guitars and faux-slapbass grooves, and most of the time their melodies aren't strong enough to sustain the monotonous instrumental tracks and lack of textural variety. By comparison, !!! are vastly more successful at creating and sustaining intrigue through an insatiable penchant for sonic experimentation. ""Hello? Is This Thing On?"" may be static for the majority of its 7\xBD-minute runtime, but its devolution into a placid synth build behind Offer's discomfiting caterwauls is a refreshing take on the genre's increasingly rigid standards. By contrast, Moving Units are dishearteningly buttoned-up and their bass-heavy romps quickly lose their vigor and grow oppressive. Of these 12 songs, only on ""Between Us and Them"" do Moving Units churn out an indelible pop hook. Sadly, it's the album's sole glimmer of emotion. And choruses like ""Emancipation""'s ""You control me/ I'm your slave"" will probably never sound sweet without at least a tinge of irony. Dangerous Dreams is plagued by a pervasive feeling of been there/done that, and the album ultimately sounds like the same two or three tracks on repeat. Moving Units may not be directly responsible for dance-punk's fustiness, but they can't help but suffer from it.","Unfortunately late to the dancepunk game, Moving Units fail to stand out among their more distinctive contemporaries.

Are We There Yet?,The Citizens,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71ab1335d7bf1698f9e/1:1/w_160/6c90298b.gif,2004-09-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1779-are-we-there-yet/,Yellow Ball,"Are We There Yet?, the debut from New York's The Citizens, is an album-lover's album. Well-paced and cleverly sequenced, it is, in many ways, a throwback to the great records of the 1970s, and fresh enough not to sound like one. Y'see, the album is a tough thing to perfect, and few bands really ever develop the consistency and variety necessary to flesh one out properly-- to make a record you'll want to hear in its entirety-- which makes the fact that this is The Citizens' first shot all the more impressive. Opener ""What's Happening at the Seams"" puts the band's best foot forward. It's a dramatic melody swelling in fields of reverb, the band doing their best to create an Eno/Lanois sense of largeness around the song's tightly rhythmic arrangement. The track also lays out several of the band's general strengths, from their keen sense of dynamic tension to keyboardist/vocalist Mark Lesseraux's high, soulful tenor. It's followed by one of the album's several rambunctious pop tunes. ""Blusher"", with its oohing backup vocals, melodic bassline and insanely catchy hooks wrapped around oddball lines like, ""Sally got smacked with a blue knapsack/ Just before she passed out from blood loss and boredom,"" is an avalanche of melody, the best of the songs that follow the band's power-pop muse. The other uptempo songs run the gamut from raw, brash rock 'n' roll like ""Catch You on the Way Down"" to twisted, vulcanized boogie like ""In B for Backward"", which shifts meters and grooves with near-Dadaist abandon, as if John Bollinger's drums were a raucous blast from the 1920s. However, the meat of the album isn't comprised of those songs. Instead, it's built on a backbone of sweeping ballads, a strategy that sinks a lot of albums. Fortunately, The Citizens largely avoid the pitfalls, mostly because Lesseraux can sing his ass off and isn't afraid to do it. For evidence, look no further than the keening chorus of ""Kaleidoscope (Do You Recall?)"", on which he brings the high honey as the band constructs a desert expanse around him. The Citizens have some obvious jazz and cabaret references, and most of their other ballads play to them in one way or another. ""Deck Full of Jokers"" is listless and heaving, sounding like the band has kept on playing well into the night after the doors have closed and the audience has gone home with stray snare hits falling arrhythmically, guitars squeezing out ugly notes as violins play mock fanfares in the deep background. Lesseraux trades verses with guest Felicity Fenton on ""You Might Be Right"", with the two sharing a haunting melody over creaky acoustic guitars. But then, Are We There Yet? does have a few problems-- ""Clementine"" just doesn't kick into gear quickly enough, the spoken vocals on ""Mussolini's First Crush"" are a bit awkward, and of course, there's that regrettable cover photo (love the hats, though). On the whole, though, this is an extremely solid debut by a band with all of its pieces very well in place. If they can stick it out, it's easy to imagine them achieving great things.","The debut from New York's The Citizens is an album-lover's album-- well-paced and cleverly sequenced, it throws back to the great records of the 1970s, but is fresh enough not to sound like one.

Antologia 69-03,Caetano Veloso,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a931ea9e61561daa59c1/1:1/w_160/f031e435.gif,2004-09-12 06:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8430-antologia-69-03/,Interscope,"It's striking how analogous the layout of one's local record store can be to modern U.S foreign policy. Mmm, okay, not exactly striking, but consider it; while acts from Iceland, France, or Japan are gladly filed under ""rock,"" most modern artists from the Southern hemisphere are relegated to the rarely visited ""world music"" category. There, they're paired with the folk and field recordings, where they're not too apt to receive the foreign aid of a customer's purchase. There's something a little imperialist about filing away the attempts of ""third-world"" artists who mix rock with their own language and indigenous musics, while keeping Paul Simon's Graceland in full stock. And though some releases, such as the Putamayo compilations (proposed motto: ""Tastefully ethnic for the upscale eclectic"") are happy to play into the sense of exoticism this division engenders, an artist like Caetano Veloso is well past due for some greater recognition. Handed the reins of popular Brazilian music from bossa nova godfather João Gilberto in the 60s, Caetano Veloso and lifelong friend Gilberto Gil founded the revolutionary ""tropicalismo"" movement, bringing influences of psychedelic rock, garage, and art-music into their still distinctly Brazilian songwriting. Since then, Veloso has continued to expand his musical influences and worldwide recognition. He has remained creative and vital in a way that's escaped most aging Western rockers, avoiding the trappings of ego as his popularity has grown. In relation to his cultural role and import, he's been dubbed the ""Bob Dylan of Brazil."" Of course, that comparison begs a few differences. For one, though they're only a year apart in age, Veloso still appears respectable while Dylan bears an eerie resemblance to The Abominable Dr. Phibes. For another, as Zimmerman returned to a Greenwich loft after singing his tales of poetry and upheaval, Veloso was writing them while under house arrest in 1968, imprisoned and censored by Brazil's then-military dictatorship for his subversive lyrics, musical experimentation and general encouragement of bohemian/hippie ways. It can be hard to imagine that such a light melodicism as Veloso's could have been considered dangerous, but he writes from a cultural tradition that pairs lyrics of revolution and struggle with, to western ears, innocuous grooves. Along with Gil, the popular Veloso was exiled in '69, living in London and expanding his musical language until his return home in '72. The ""definitive"" collection of such a prolific, globetrotting artist is inevitably going to be shaped by an availability of materials, as copyrights are sure to be held by a multitude of parties in various countries. Last year, Nonesuch attempted to compile The Best of Caetano Veloso, complete with liner notes predictably contributed by a certain pale, wide-eyed man whose name rhymes with ""Mavid Fyrne."" While a solid collection, it borrows heavily from Veloso's recent, easily accessed Nonesuch releases, with no representations of his revolutionary early sound. Antologia: 69-03 is a more career-spanning two-disc set (up until now only available as an import) which offers an admirably comprehensive representation of the artist's phases and styles. Antologia nods to Veloso's history of cross-Atlanticism in placing his beautiful cover of Italian Nina Rota's ""Que Nao Se Ve"" as its opening track. The piece highlights an oft-overlooked facet of Veloso's musicality: So much emphasis is put on his brilliant songwriting that it's easy to forget what an excellent and subtle performer he is, as demonstrated here in his gentle falsetto. Throughout his career, Veloso has worked in styles ranging from avant-garde tape experimentation to Afropop, and rather than taking a chronological approach, Antologia demonstrates his eclecticity in its sometimes jarring leaps of style. Disc One throws together dramatic choral interludes, pieces of syncopated 60s rock, and more traditional works that gesture back toward bossa nova. Veloso sings often about politics, but never fails to take the emotional and aesthetic angle on such topics, humanism trumping ideology. The popular ""Haiti"", from his celebratory 1993 collaboration with Gil, Tropicalia 2, combines subdued, dark spoken word that points to the aesthetics of political unrest and life in the Haitian ghetto with a beautiful, sleepy chorus. The tracks of Disc Two are even more uniformly excellent, highlighting Veloso's most adventurous side. ""De Palavra Em Palavra"", is built from multitracked backwards voices and throat sounds a la Luciano Berio; ""Doideca"" is a dissonant ballad halfway between samba and Schoenberg; and ""Tonda de Luna Llena"" sounds like a piece of Philip Glass opera with rhythmic accompaniment. Veloso's arrangement skills are on display in the fantastically orchestrated, compact ""Enquanto O Lobo Nao Vem"", while the song ""Maria Bethania"", named for his sister and collaborator, is a propulsive English-sung ballad that ends in a slew of nonsense syllabics and strings. And one of the collection's highlights is Veloso's sparse, syncopated version of Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"", a cover surpassing even Devo's ""Satisfaction"" in so totally reinventing its subject. Many of the best tracks on Antologia are Veloso's solo acoustic songs, where the tranquil surface of his gentle melodies belies musical waters as deep as the listener chooses-- Veloso makes musical complexity sound simple, and philosophy sound beautiful. Antologia demonstrates how cognizant he has remained of North American and European music over the years, thoughtfully considering the methods and consequences involved in evoking dual cultural influences. This album introduces listeners not only to the artist's prodigious output, but to a worldview in which the cross-cultural melding of styles is so natural as to be unconscious.","Two-disc retrospective of the Brazilian experimental pop icon whose distinctive blend of psych-pop, garage and traditional South American styles has hugely influenced the American rock landscape.

Funeral,Arcade Fire,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a8c0084474cd0bfe6a/1:1/w_160/2099047d.jpg,2004-09-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/452-funeral/,Merge,"How did we get here? Ours is a generation overwhelmed by frustration, unrest, dread, and tragedy. Fear is wholly pervasive in American society, but we manage nonetheless to build our defenses in subtle ways-- we scoff at arbitrary, color-coded ""threat"" levels; we receive our information from comedians and laugh at politicians. Upon the turn of the 21st century, we have come to know our isolation well. Our self-imposed solitude renders us politically and spiritually inert, but rather than take steps to heal our emotional and existential wounds, we have chosen to revel in them. We consume the affected martyrdom of our purported idols and spit it back in mocking defiance. We forget that ""emo"" was once derived from emotion, and that in our buying and selling of personal pain, or the cynical approximation of it, we feel nothing. We are not the first, or the last, to be confronted with this dilemma. David Byrne famously asked a variation on the question that opens this review, and in doing so suggested a type of universal disaffection synonymous with drowning. And so The Arcade Fire asks the question again, but with a crucial distinction: The pain of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, the enigmatic husband-and-wife songwriting force behind the band, is not merely metaphorical, nor is it defeatist. They tread water in Byrne's ambivalence because they have known real, blinding pain, and they have overcome it in a way that is both tangible and accessible. Their search for salvation in the midst of real chaos is ours; their eventual catharsis is part of our continual enlightenment. The years leading up to the recording of Funeral were marked with death. Chassagne's grandmother passed away in June of 2003, Butler's grandfather in March of 2004, and bandmate Richard Parry's aunt the following month. These songs demonstrate a collective subliminal recognition of the powerful but oddly distanced pain that follows the death of an aging loved one. Funeral evokes sickness and death, but also understanding and renewal; childlike mystification, but also the impending coldness of maturity. The recurring motif of a non-specific ""neighborhood"" suggests the supportive bonds of family and community, but most of its lyrical imagery is overpoweringly desolate. ""Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)"" is a sumptuously theatrical opener-- the gentle hum of an organ, undulating strings, and repetition of a simple piano figure suggest the discreet unveiling of an epic. Butler, in a bold voice that wavers with the force of raw, unspoken emotion, introduces his neighborhood. The scene is tragic: As a young man's parents weep in the next room, he secretly escapes to meet his girlfriend in the town square, where they naively plan an ""adult"" future that, in the haze of adolescence, is barely comprehensible to them. Their only respite from their shared uncertainty and remoteness exists in the memories of friends and parents. The following songs draw upon the tone and sentiment of ""Tunnels"" as an abstract mission statement. The conventionally rock-oriented ""Neighborhood #2 (Laika)"" is a second-hand account of one individual's struggle to overcome an introverted sense of suicidal desperation. The lyrics superficially suggest a theme of middle-class alienation, but avoid literal allusion to a suburban wasteland-- one defining characteristic of the album, in fact, is the all-encompassing scope of its conceptual neighborhoods. The urban clatter of Butler's adopted hometown of Montreal can be felt in the foreboding streetlights and shadows of ""Une Annee Sans Lumiere"", while Chassagne's evocative illustration of her homeland (on ""Haiti"", the country her parents fled in the 1960s) is both distantly exotic and starkly violent, perfectly evoking a nation in turmoil. ""Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)"" is a shimmering, audacious anthem that combines a driving pop beat, ominous guitar assault, and sprightly glockenspiel decoration into a passionate, fist-pumping album manifesto. The fluidity of the song's construction is mesmerizing, and the cohesion of Butler's poignant assertion of exasperation (""I went out into the night/ I went out to pick a fight with anyone"") and his emotional call to arms (""The power's out in the heart of man/ Take it from your heart/ Put it in your hand""), distinguishes the song as the album's towering centerpiece. Even in its darkest moments, Funeral exudes an empowering positivity. Slow-burning ballad ""Crown of Love"" is an expression of lovesick guilt that perpetually crescendos until the track unexpectedly explodes into a dance section, still soaked in the melodrama of weeping strings; the song's psychological despair gives way to a purely physical catharsis. The anthemic momentum of ""Rebellion (Lies)"" counterbalances Butler's plaintive appeal for survival at death's door, and there is liberation in his admittance of life's inevitable transience. ""In the Backseat"" explores a common phenomenon-- a love of backseat window-gazing, inextricably linked to an intense fear of driving-- that ultimately suggests a conclusive optimism through ongoing self-examination. ""I've been learning to drive my whole life,"" Chassagne sings, as the album's acoustic majesty finally recedes and relinquishes. So long as we're unable or unwilling to fully recognize the healing aspect of embracing honest emotion in popular music, we will always approach the sincerity of an album like Funeral from a clinical distance. Still, that it's so easy to embrace this album's operatic proclamation of love and redemption speaks to the scope of The Arcade Fire's vision. It's taken perhaps too long for us to reach this point where an album is at last capable of completely and successfully restoring the tainted phrase ""emotional"" to its true origin. Dissecting how we got here now seems unimportant. It's simply comforting to know that we finally have arrived.",,9.7,
Siren Song of the Counter Culture,Rise Against,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a309ea9e61561daa4bb1/1:1/w_160/8253f508.jpg,2004-09-09 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6926-siren-song-of-the-counter-culture/,Geffen,"Dear Mr. Nader: I didn't understand why you were running for President again this year until I heard Chicago hardcore group Rise Against. Their major-label debut is called Siren Song for the Counter Culture, a title which seems to share your present level of subtlety and humility. As with you, their over-the-top bloviating for true believers is matched only by an eagerness to please their new corporate paymasters. Which reminds me: Do you think Ben Stein and his Republican friends could sponsor these guys, too? I'm sure you're already quite familiar with the lineage of punk rock. Nevertheless, indulge me for a moment. My Pitchfork colleague Rob Mitchum once wrote that punk split into two camps: the ""goofy"" punk of Green Day and Sum 41, and the political punk of Bad Religion or Propagandhi. It's a two-party system, see? That said, Rise Against are the Optimus Prime of modern punk, combining the adolescent yearning of Blink-182 with the self-righteous snare drums of Minor Threat, or something. You'll love it! Rise Against are Political! That much is clear. You can tell because the first track is called ""State of the Union"". A blistering hardcore number it is, too, with vocals reminiscent of the last time I forgot the all-important ""liquor before beer before all-you-can-eat Chinese"" rule. ""Please secure your place in Hell,"" one of the band's two singers helpfully puke-sings. On the next track, ""The First Drop"", Rise Against earnestly remind us just how Political they are, with lyrics that always seem to end in exclamation points: They scream until their voice is gone! They've had enough! ""Can't you listen to what we have to say?""! I'm sure somewhere in there they actually say something, but it's hard to tell. Of course, Rise Against are also Lovers! They can play the wounded adolescent just as skillfully as Saves the Day or former Fat Wreck Chords labelmates The Ataris. ""Never have I felt so cold,"" they emote. Since you no longer have a party, Mr. Nader, I bet you're feeling lonely, too. You can imagine the sheer catharsis of ""Paper Wings"", with its soaring pop/punk chorus over the usual four chords from ""Dammit"". Apparently, there's this girl, the train isn't waiting for her, ""and neither am I."" The cheap teenage anguish is enough to make me want to break out my old MxPx records, until the Cheap Trick solo and gratuitous acoustic guitars remind me this song must be The Single. Nothing like greenbacks to wipe away your tears, whether caused by the green-eyed monster or just the Green Party. Rise Against are so multi-dimensional they offer a Jars-of-Clay-fronted-by-Gavin-Rossdale moment that proves what Chris Carrabba does actually takes talent: ""Swing Life Away"", a drearily unpoetic acoustic weeper about minimum wage and holding hands. How fucking hardcore is that, man? ""Rumors of My Demise Have Been Greatly Exaggerated"" swipes the perfect Morrissey song title to proclaim, ""It's life that scares me to death."" Whoa. But the band's true ""siren song"" is ""Give It All"", which sums up their big problem (and my main question about your candidacy). ""There's a reason why I sing,"" they sing. ""And it's these reasons that belong to me."" So they're singing... why, again? I leave it to you, Mr. Nader.","Geffen Records debut from this long-running Chicago-based hardcore band offers empty political sloganeering and crybaby bullshit.

Fireworks on Ice EP,By the End of Tonight,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4635e6ef95969320870/1:1/w_160/216a339e.jpg,2004-09-09 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1127-fireworks-on-ice-ep/,Temporary Residence,"If By the End of Tonight's music career ever goes south, the band have a fallback: Their website advertises a vast selection of custom AOL buddy icons, which could be put up for sale if the Alvin, Texas quartet were in a pinch. The designs are mostly Kid Pix-like in their apathetic simplicity and garish color schemes, but at a time when cellphone ringtones are a multi-billion dollar business, there's surely a market for these lurking somewhere. For now, By the End of Tonight are more likely to profit from their music. Instrumental post-rock field isn't exactly a lucrative field, but the folks at Temporary Residence have made a run at industry monopolization, building a formidable roster of the genre's most prominent slog-rockers. Joining a fray that already includes Explosions in the Sky, Cerberus Shoal, The Anomoanon, and Lumen, By the End of Tonight are set to succeed just by dint of good company. It may help that they play high-energy, low-maintenance variations on established post-rock and speed-metal mores that should appeal to fans weary of Explosions' static soundscapes or Lumen's proggy grandiosity. Fireworks on Ice, the group's debut EP, is a wildly uneven four-song collection, full of mammoth peaks, sheepish lows, fatuous showmanship, and unfettered enthusiasm. ""Sleeping While Driving Prevents Old Age"" reconciles two different approaches the band explore individually elsewhere-- slapdash metal and melodic post-rock-- and is probably the most accurate representation of where By the End of Tonight are headed with their sound. It's also the album's shortest track, one that underscores the band's mercurial style: For nearly three minutes, the song dabbles in transient guises, heavy on competent but confrontational riffs that fail to take hold. Then, feigning exasperation, the band begin to fall apart and fade away before coming together again for a transcendent denouement that both surprises and elucidates. It's worth mentioning that drummer Jeff Wilson plays a toy drum set-- not an entry-level knockoff, mind you, but the kind of quasi-instrument given as Christmas presents to ignorant toddlers. For such a skilled timekeeper, it's unlikely that Wilson chooses to use inferior equipment out of necessity but, though the approach may smack of gimmickry, he nevertheless manages to coax powerful beats from his ramshackle cans. More often than not, Wilson transcends his limitations, ripping dexterous tom rolls redolent of Billy Cobham in his Mahavishnu Orchestra years. Unfortunately, the drums do present a problem on ""Delirious"", a boxy, somewhat shrill piece that utilizes spare, dissonant guitar lines. In contrast to other tracks, the band here sound pitifully thin, as a surfeit of double bass riffage detracts from the stark guitar interplay, asphyxiating all semblance of melody. ""Delirious"" may demonstrate that By the End of Tonight can't always control their impulses, but the rest of Fireworks on Ice is full of promise. Least ambiguous of the collection is ""Video Games in the Desert"", which is closer in proximity to bands like Converge than By the End of Tonight's Temporary Residence brethren. Here, the kickdrum flourishes and the gargantuan tom fills that hinder ""Delirious"" actually complement the interlocking guitar melodies, which vacillate between unabashed metal noodling and discordant arpeggios that trace directly back to Daydream Nation. But the unquestionable highlight is the nearly 11-minute closer, ""It's Christmas Time Again..."", which owns all the aforementioned qualities and hints at the band's fantastic potential. Unlike the other three songs on the disc, it features less high-wire speed-metal monkeyshine and more martial unison maneuvers, monolithic guitar fronts, and agile transitions. Over the course of three distinct movements, it becomes clear that if By the End of Tonight helm their strengths and become more forthright with their melodies, they'll be a sure boon to a stagnating post-rock field.","Instrumental post-rockers have come a bit late to the game with their Temporary Residence-released debut EP, but on occasion glimpse greatness.

Sit Down for Staying EP,Charmparticles,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a718b1335d7bf1698f9b/1:1/w_160/147ca222.gif,2004-09-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1778-sit-down-for-staying-ep/,Childstar,"Guitar-based shoegaze records are tough sells these days. With increasing ease, laptoppers such as M83 and Ulrich Schnauss churn out the lush vibes of permanently influential tri-force My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive, but always fall short of their vitality. Artists obsess over Kevin Shields' gonzo production ethics but forget his equally impressive ear for melody, and without the cherry-colored hooks, shoegaze is a land of gimmicks: cute but stupid, talking loud and saying nothing. On last year's Dreams Top Rock, Pluramon (aka Marcus Schnitzler, and a favorite of PFM's dean of writers, Mark Richardson) managed a pretty fine balance between traditionally uncompromising shoegaze melodies and potentially distractive recourse to iBook'd trickbags. Mush IDM artist Clue to Kalo debuted quietly but promisingly with Come Here When You Sleepwalk, which boasted similar (though less successful) attempts at offering shoegaze a legitimate second wind. Both acts nailed the hooks and ambience, but Portland-based quartet Charmparticles is one of the few bands looking to recreate the rock energy of early 90s shoegaze. As on their late 2002 debut, The Scenic EP, the band essentially adds nothing new to the genre with their latest Sit Down for Staying EP, but to its credit, quenches its nostalgia with some remarkable melody-driven songs. A mammoth guitar solo that comes at the end of ""A/O"" forms a curious midpoint for the Sit Down for Staying EP. Before the solo, songs like ""Sixty-Four"" and ""Stand Up for Leaving"" stick to midtempo instrumental pleasantries with little bite, as if to keep listeners focused on Pamela Rooney and Adam Wayne's gorgeous vocal melodies. At times, the chord changes are a tad too predictable to handle such bright hooks-- Charmparticles can sound like Coldplay covering The Cocteau Twins covering Coldplay-- but for the most part, there's always a passage like the washed introductory drones of ""A/O"" that keeps these first few songs from eating themselves. After the solo, Charmparticles rush headlong into riff central. The crisp, punchy ""Gas Gauge"" benefits from Sarah FitzGerald's string of bright ninth strums and drummer Nathanael Merrill's last-second two-beat recoil. ""Solvent"" at first seems a little too alt-rock for its own good, but then Charmparticles strike a crunchy, tom-heavy break and a ghostly, single-plucked guitar line whose timbre will surely bear its share of Interpol comparisons. ""Phone and Finder"" and its kind tambourine jangle bring the Sit Down for Staying EP full circle, incorporating the lessons of the album's two ""sides."" It's Charmparticles' hardest and softest song to date, on their most ambitious and least ambitious effort to date. For a band that so effortlessly pulls off convincing facsimiles, it's a shame Charmparticles can't muster up a little more ambition.","Portland-based shoegazers add nothing new to the genre, but do manage to quench its nostalgia with some excellent melodies.

Loverock,Guitar Wolf,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c001eb335119a49ed302/1:1/w_160/ba8a615f.jpg,2004-09-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3651-loverock/,Narnack,"Seiji. Billy. Toru. Take heed, bubby! These are not the names of your next artfully angular Ikea shelving components. No, these duosyllabic runes are the calling cards of those smashers of everything plastic, that beaten leather trio on the lunatic fringe, the only rock combo to ever tour Argentina on the seat of a black motorbike: Ladies and gentlemen and Kung Fu Ramone, put your fists in the air for Tokyo's own Guitar Wolf. And with that, the commotion begins anew. Returning from 2003's UFO Romantics, Guitar Wolf whips up Loverock, their latest bout of cement-cutter gutter-rock. Their site awesomely refers to the unit as ""Japanese Greatest 'Jet' Rock 'N' Roll Band,"" a description which is deadeye accurate, since it illustrates the flair in Japan's popular culture for attaching heaps of haughty cool onto seemingly normal or even played-out things. Alyssa Milano and fanatical kiddy toy trends aside, Japanese music often finds an eminently workable intangible at the delta where the traditional meets the confessional. Behind his guitar and sweaty microphone, Seiji's denim-leather-and-sunglasses look is far less than new: It's even older than his band's revved up Ramonesabilly freakery. But on Loverock, the sound again seems fresh and vital, from the glorious power chords and craptone recording of ""Demon Card"" to ""Blood Splashed Sky""'s unhinged bass guitar rumble. Remember how cool Carl Perkins fanatic Masatoshi Nagase looked in Mystery Train? Is it any surprise that noted style whore Quentin Tarantino tapped The 5678s' twitchy Cramps camp for Kill Bill, Vol. 1? Everyone knows the truth: American signifiers are just cooler in Japanese hands. And that hand is curled into devil's horns and thrust over the head of the motorcycle hoodlum inside Loverock's cover art heart. There's an argument here for generalized style over fibrous songwriting substance. Diehards will scoff, but Loverock's 27 hyperactive tracks tend to blend into a long snake howl, singeing the air inside a big-busted amp cone. And anyway, do you want subtlety from three guys who once wrote a song called ""Kawasaki ZII750 Rock 'n' Roll""? That shit's just not made to go slow. Seiji, Billy, and Toru understand. The opening title track features a winning riff, ringing true through the international language of static and feedback. Each spin of ""Jet13"" destroys one copy of Get Born. This is the sound of un-ironic rock, the parallel universe to The Datsuns' market-researched shtick. Guitar Wolf encourages you to get free of that and book a one-way black train ticket to the ack ack love gun smog of ""Katsumiya Tobacco City"". The band does find some time for, er, hooks, particularly on ""Time Machine of Tears"" and the swaggering ""SF Tokyo"". (Somewhere, 800 kids just yelled its chorus.) But mostly Loverock is what you'd expect: bleating, bleeding, and brief blasts of splatter grease and shotgun garage, with a lot of front-end torque and little solos that sneak up behind. (Bass gets into the act, too-- the Bass Wolf/Billy-penned ""Black Hawk"" is one of the album's most visceral stretches.) Guitar Wolf have been at this for well over a decade and the point of their blade has yet to draw blood, so it figures that there's precision and craft behind the creaking, screaming, and trash. Even when Seiji is at his most psycho-- the reverberating surf 'n' psychobilly sleaze of ""Cosmic Space Girl"", for example-- you sense he knows exactly what he's doing. After all, according to band lore, he's the actual Guitar Wolf, the interstellar cave dweller giving lesser rock types teeth chattering night terrors. But he's also a traditionalist, committed to finding the jewels that remain in rock's aging chasm, even as the rust flakes and the bad habits keep maligning the damn brand.","Insane Tokyo rock 'n' roll violators continue to make kick ass records after a stint with Matador in the mid-90s.

Rubber Factory,The Black Keys,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e7c0084474cd0c0159/1:1/w_160/cbd8de75.jpg,2004-09-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/767-rubber-factory/,Fat Possum,"Now that The Black Keys have solidified themselves as ranking contenders in the garage-blues tag-team division (a recognized and surprisingly competitive weight class), they've got a whole field of challengers to fend off. I'm thinking primarily of me, the critic, looking to measure their latest effort against its vaunted predecessors, counting the faults, tallying the improvements, making a decision. But the band has garnered a sizable fanbase indifferent to prior allegiances-- mud-caked Bonnaroo jam fans, NPR-driven blues boosters, and fist-pumping hard rock loyalists have all been trampled under The Black Keys' roots-chewing corduroy stomp. So really, it makes little difference what I have to say; most of you have already decided these guys are the real deal. Those who haven't, however, can rest assured that, in judging The Black Keys' budding discography, Rubber Factory beats their previous two by TKO. That's because it picks up right where Thickfreakness left off-- outside the bar in the gravel parking lot, swinging aggressively with Dan Auerbach's ferocious six-string and Patrick Carney's cymbal-and-snare seizures-- and brings the noise one step further. There's more of an album feel to Rubber Factory, a conscious song-by-song progression rather than the visceral, overwhelming vibe that forged their debut, The Big Come Up, into a seething wrecking ball. When Auerbach settles down with a lap steel on ""The Lengths"", it's no mere diversion-- there's true conviction behind his country blues balladry. In its rosy tenderness, ""The Lengths"" is the biggest departure from the band's studied template. Auerbach sings, ""Please yourself/ You don't have to be afraid,"" and it seems obvious he's convincing himself that he and Carney have carved out a niche deep enough they can break out of it with confidence to deliver something totally unexpected and achingly sweet. ""The Lengths"" isn't the album's only curveball-- The Kinks cover ""Act Nice and Gentle"" finds The Black Keys tuning into the FM side of the dial. Where Ray Davies' original is twangy, sugary pop, The Black Keys give it a honky-tonk swing, as Auerback plies the slide and Carney's fireworks fade to a gentle sizzle. ""Grown So Ugly"" is a tragic prison blues penned by Robert Pete Williams and covered in the 1970s by Captain Beefheart. Auerbach tears into the standard with typical grit, but halfway through, pulls back into a short-lived vocal break that merits his position in the Fat Possum pantheon. Those three tunes stand out as impressive tangents that skillfully mediate the rest of the album's oldtime Black Keys thunder. Songs like ""Stack Shot Billy"" and ""Girl Is on My Mind"" show the memorable songwriting that made Thickfreakness a standout. ""When the Lights Go Out"" opens Rubber Factory with a Bonham-esque bass pulse and an ominously pealing guitar, while closer ""Till I Get My Way"" lays one line of primitive Auerbach distortion over another more genteel melody until the two eventually swim together beneath Carney's splashy cymbal work. And then there's ""10 A.M. Automatic"", Rubber Factory's first single and easily one of the most radio-ready indie anthems of the year, next to Modest Mouse's ""Float On"". It's the song most likely to show up in a Guy Ritchie flick next summer, a cool-as-fuck, hormone-laced dose of rock 'n' roll ecstasy. Here, Auerbach's voice attains that archetypal blues fever that induced the birth of rock 50 years ago; melody and rhythm mesh into a primal force that's raw and pure. The Black Keys have consistently sought to keep their distance from modern blues, calling themselves a rock band above anything else. But we all know the blues resides at the core of rock 'n' roll. Rubber Factory sways back and forth almost imperceptibly between the two idioms, revitalizing the essence of both.","Third full-length from these garage-blues tag-teamers exhibits a newfound confidence that results in their first truly ambitious and carefully planned release.

Waves Are Universal,Rachel Goswell,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c000ea9e61561daa7b46/1:1/w_160/398173ea.jpg,2004-09-08 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3650-waves-are-universal/,4AD,"For 15 years, Rachel Goswell has been known first as a member of Slowdive and then as one-third of Mojave 3. In the first group and on the latter group's 1996 debut, Ask Me Tomorrow, Goswell shared vocal duties on 9 songs with frontman Neil Halstead, but on the three albums that followed, Halstead sang every song but one-- ""Comin' Home"" from Excuses for Travelers (which he wrote). Goswell's willowy, expressive voice always seemed like a potentially dynamic counterpart to Halstead's understated whisper, but it was mostly an underused asset. Instead, she usually hung back on bass and only occasionally supplied backing vocals, certainly to the frustration of fans desperate to hear more from the woman who gave ""Love Songs on the Radio"" its elegiac elegance. So Goswell's own solo debut, entitled Waves Are Universal, seems not just long overdue, but, more critically, freighted with the high expectations of a horde of eager listeners. On the album's lead-off track, ""Warm Summer Sun"", Goswell meets those expectations head-on. Over a gentle guitar strum, she sings about falling over from lack of forward motion and decides not to ""waste my time on things that stop me feeling."" Drums and guitar kick in for the second verse and the song builds gradually. SPOILER ALERT: Then traditional Irish uilleann pipes come in loud and jarring, like a Shyamalan twist ending that completely reframes everything that preceded it. Suddenly, the song is not just a smell-the-roses reaffirmation, but a statement of career resolve. If the beginning seems like a distillation of Mojave 3's strengths, the pipes serve the same purpose of Slowdive's droning guitars: Goswell has found the hidden connections between her current group's pastoralisms and her former band's shoegazerisms. Unfortunately, little else on Waves Are Universal lives up to the promise of ""Warm Summer Sun"", though a couple of songs do come close: ""Deelay"" overlays loping rhythms with one of the album's most evocative melodies, while ""Coastline"" and ""Save Yourself"" churn with eddying guitars whose raggedness contrasts nicely with Goswell's crystalline voice. But the rest of the album dispenses with the murky guitars in favor of burbling percussion, tasteful acoustic strumming, and occasional flourishes like the birdchirp samples and breathy harmonium in ""Gather Me Up"". Producer David Naughton incorporates a dizzying array of instruments-- shakers, Wurlitzer, vibraphone, bongos, letterbox bells, and rain stick. Three songs even credit Mother Nature on Thai waves, rain and ambience. Such inventive accompaniment, however, often overcompensates for weak song structures, lackluster lyrics, and a general lack of focus. Over 12 tracks, Goswell undertakes a range of musical approaches, from quiet folk to more conventional rock to jangly pop, but not all of them work equally well. Softer, midtempo songs like ""Thru the Dawn"" and ""Shoulder the Blame"" lag with inertia, and ""No Substitute"" is polished to a characterless AOR sheen (she can sound startlingly similar to Shawn Colvin). ""Hope"" expresses the frustrations of city life, but the banal lyrics (""You give me space to live in/ You give me hope/ And that's just fine"") and Naughton's overproduction-- especially the chorus of back-up singers-- buff away the music's texture and tension. The result is a warm summery sound that's agreeable, if not very exciting. Goswell proves she's more than just another pretty voice, but too often Waves Are Universal sounds less than confident, almost timid. The album's ambition is rich musical diversity, but it sounds less adventurously eclectic than simply scattershot, less assertive than merely restless, eager to try anything but not always sure what works and what doesn't.","Longtime Slowdive and Mojave 3 member Rachel Goswell strikes out on her own with this 4AD-released solo debut.

Florida,Diplo,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8713d197565213b0e8/1:1/w_160/d0ef56a6.jpg,2004-09-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2570-florida/,Ninja Tune,"It's hard to talk about up-and-coming turntable composer Diplo's first full-length without referencing the original godfather, DJ Shadow, and current champion Rjd2. From the outset, Shadow's chiaroscuro hip-hop draped a decidedly somber shroud over the genre he christened; even his most unbound, overdriven stomps emphasize the down in downtempo. Rjd2's Deadringer and Since We Last Spoke followed suit, stubbornly dejected albums that drew much of their soul from sadness. And the thing is, this marriage of and technique works beautifully: A sense of apocalyptic uncertainty and dramatic tension emerges from minor chords stirring pastiche beats and ghostly vocals haunting overcast arrangements. So, Diplo. Short for Diplodocus, the tragic prehistoric behemoth, large beyond comprehension, invincible but doomed, felled by that silent predator called evolution. The Diplo in question is actually a tall, skinny kid from Mississippi that's established a home with Philly's streetwise Hollertronix crew. For a couple years now, Diplo and his partner Low Budget have run Hollertronix as a sort of crunk Underground Railroad, stealing away big-balled, white label southern rap into the seemingly sophisticated environs of the Northeast. He's built a reputation as a party-starting, rabble-rouser DJ, fearlessly mashing Prince into New Order, greasing up Nirvana with Lil Jon. But with Florida, Diplo takes a cue from his lauded predecessors and forgoes the debauchery for melancholy. The album's downcast gaze frequently finds nuance in minor tempo changes, intersecting instrumental lines and well-placed vocals. Diplo also shows the same reverence for vintage soul samples as Shadow and Rj-- slinky Rhodes lines abound here-- and, at least for the first part of the album, puts a lot of stock in a unique thematic cohesiveness. Initially, Florida is wrought by heavy string and woodwind sections and a slow, cinematic pacing that oozes with brackish mystery, but eventually, Diplo abandons this sticky, vivid sensation for more self-conscious stylistic diversity. Diplo spent part of his childhood in Florida, and the Sunshine State's flat, muggy landscape and wide skies are present in ""Big Lost"", the album's first proper song. Coming after an abstract intro, it stands as its most identifiable track, embodying Diplo's steamy Jurassic funk vibe. But there's no brontosaurus bass or weird caveman chants-- this instrumental gallops in on regal, repeated strings and garage-soul organ. ""Sarah"" rides a similar mood infused with a fuzzy, Tony Iommi-ish guitar line and tranquil piano for some dizzying contrast. But after that, Florida stalks out of the swamp and hits I-95, speeding north with no particular destination in mind. Vocals by UK it-chick Martina Topley-Bird are rendered abstract and murky, squelched beneath backwards horn samples and a lackluster beat, while the orchestral brass of ""Way More"" gives in to shivering electrobreaks. And though ""Diplo Rhythm"" benefits from a tight rundown from Jamaica's Vibez Cartel and Brazilian crew Pantera Os Danadinhos, its shallow jungle rhythm is too studied. Still, even while these tracks fail to impress in light of the album's first third, they reflect Diplo's ambitious (if unfocused) compositional skills. Later, Diplo manages to pull things back on track with ""Indian Thick Jawns"", a tabla 'n' bass sizzler manhandled by the underrated P.E.A.C.E., formerly of Freestyle Fellowship. Scratching out one of rap's best monotones, P.E.A.C.E. is something like a West Coast ODB, half-singing/half-speaking his lunatic spiel. And finally, ""Summer's Gonna Hurt You"" revisits the seminal track off Diplo's Epistimology EP, its languid strings and soulful male vocals returning to the quintessential evening hues of Shadow and Rjd2. If a finale can be both warm and chilling, this is it. More concerned with the thrill of the hunt than putting up the trophy, Diplo's Florida safari never quite bags the big game, but it often comes close.","Drawing from atmospheric turntablists DJ Shadow and Rjd2, this recent Ninja Tune signee shows a reverence for vintage melancholy soul samples.

Dogs,Nina Nastasia,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a5eb335119a49ed76c/1:1/w_160/76cc6b3b.jpg,2004-09-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5714-dogs/,Socialist,"On Dogs, Nina Nastasia sings about dogs, as a symbol of the pursuit of love, or a metaphor for the easy life, but also as a colloquialism-- ""your dogs are tired,"" on ""The Long Walk""-- or to set up, by way of the cat/dog dichotomy, a clever pun, when Nastasia admits that ""curiosity kills me."" She also makes a musical pun when the cello quotes the ""give a dog a bone"" line of ""This Old Man"". Nastasia doesn't fixate on the animal as a formal concept for the record-- it's more like a recurring gag. Dogs pass through as easily as the fleeting smokes, or the beers that she and her friends half-heartedly throw back outside the high school, or an unsurprising string of bad relationships. With its snarky cover shot and the salutation (""Thank you, comrades"") on the back sleeve, Dogs seems more light-hearted and somehow ""younger"" than Nastasia's other records, and for good reason: She recorded it five years ago, and is now re-releasing it for the fans she gained with The Blackened Air and Run to Ruin. In her work since, she's honed an elusively grim atmosphere, and her albums are stronger for it-- not because they need moodiness to prop them up, but because the moods draw out the nuances of her frank but graceful songs. On Dogs, she sounds more like a standard singer/songwriter, and it's hard not to treat this as a prelude to her better albums. Nastasia has an understated voice with a limited range, and on several of these ballads, you can hear her drift into its limits, accepting a whispering tone as the cost of expressiveness; on her later albums, she sings more confidently, or lowers her voice to a warning. The arrangements on Dogs are also a simpler precursor of The Blackened Air, where the strings and saws drift in on an autumnal gust, or the striking textures of Run to Ruin. Steve Albini, who has engineered all of her albums, plays the part of creating an objective as-is document, but he and Nastasia have a good idea as to where to put the focus. The recording makes impressive use of vintage instruments, whose birthdates and makers are detailed in the liner notes. (Who knew that Nastasia was a socialist and a gearhead?) The strings augment Nastasia's ballads without sweetening them, and Stephen Day's cello smoothly complements her voice. But the delicate arrangements hold back louder songs like ""Nobody Knew Her"", on which a surprisingly powerful guitar deserves more room. Nastasia has said she practices in the bathroom of her apartment, and Dogs has the ease of a performance that you're catching as you sit in the shower stall. The songs here include some of the best she's written, but they're also some of the most unexpected. Without this reissue, we could have forgotten that she has an ear for big guitar riffs, or that she sounds beautiful just playing straight on an acoustic guitar. And who would have remembered that she has a sense of humor?","Known for her dark production and striking vocals, singer/songwriter Nina Nastasia offers this prequel to her two Touch & Go full-lengths.

Secondary Inspection,Terrestre,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a886b1335d7bf16992d9/1:1/w_160/a83819b7.gif,2004-09-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8268-secondary-inspection/,Static,"The microscopic beats at the center of the minimalist dance music that's become prominent in the last decade has, not surprisingly, tended to focus on the rhythms prominent in Western club culture. Microhouse is the only genre name to gain any real traction in this area because house music is the primary template in which these artists choose to work. Which means there's still plenty of room for experimentation. Metro Area's full-length from last year, for example, was interesting in part because it took Latin disco rhythms that were used as accents in trad 4/4 house and pushed them to the foreground. It was exciting to hear stripped dance music with that much space that didn't have a steady kickdrum making time. Tijuana's Fernando Corona is known more these days for the music he's making under his experimental and high-art leaning Murcof alias, but as Terrestre, Corona puts the beats first and foremost. His stated goal for Terrestre is to take the sounds he hears on the street in Tijuana and reflect them with the kind of cracked and convex mirror only the computer can provide. His unfairly overlooked split album with Plankton Man, reissued last year, was filled with cut-up samples of wailing voices, horns, nylon-stringed guitars, and other signifiers of traditional mariachi bands. These easily identifiable fragments were affectionately inserted into catchy and fluid dance tracks, a combo that was inspired and original to say the least. For Secondary Inspection, Corona ditches the overt Mexican folk references and loses himself in rhythm. ""Botas de Oro"" immediately establishes that Secondary Inspection isn't going to be another exercise in dry minimalism. Its syncopation seems designed more for marching than dancing (in gold boots, presumably). It's not hard to imagine a drum corps doing a faithful cover of ""Botas de Oro"" and the exacting and well-rendered cymbal and snare patterns sound live, but then unexpected production touches-- like drum hits that echo, dub-style, into the distance-- remind us that's we're listening to computerized dance music. ""Secondary Inspection Theme"" is, as its title would indicate, an even more expansive encapsulation of Terrestre's sound. The album's best track, it's a terribly exciting musical melting pot as cowbells, tin cans, congas, a snare, wood blocks, and an eerie, screeching background drone arrange themselves around a rhythm that blends Mexican, Caribbean and African elements into a European dance context. Terrestre's ""Theme"" is the sort of music where you wonder if the 3/4 upbeat coming through the syncopation references dub reggae or polka that found its way over from a border-town Tejano band. But then, that's a question for musicologists; most important, ""Secondary Inspection Theme"" is eminently danceable and cuts across traditional boundaries. It's a floor-filler for drum circle hippies and urban clubbers alike. When Corona dials down the syncopation, he delves into darker atmospheres. ""Ejido del Terror"" is a weird blend built around a tech-house pulse, with added conga hits and a scraped fish giving an extra boost to the upstroke hi-hat, while the percussion in the fast, polyrhythmic ""Alushe's Night Out"" is heavily processed, with individual creaks and glitches sharing time with the hand-drum fills. Both of those tracks have eerie, otherworldly synth squelches that impart a feel of both Western desert melodrama and a post-apocalyptic cityscape. When Corona says in interviews that he sees Secondary Inspection as informed by a post-9/11 sense of paranoia, these are the tracks to which he's referring. Melody is not a primary consideration here; at the heart of Secondary Inspection is Corona's uncanny beat sense. There is elasticity to Corona's programming that recalls Thomas Brinkmann's work as Soul Center-- an unusual timing when sequenced elements trail a hair behind, paradoxically fostering a sense of relentless forward motion I can only describe as ""swing."" Though it fits comfortably with essentialist house and techno, Secondary Inspection pushes the music in a highly personal direction, integrating rhythms and textures from Latin America to create precise and hypnotic dance tracks that rip.","Tijuana's Fernando Corona is best known for his high-art leaning Murcof alias, but his goal as Terrestre is to reflect the music of his native country with the kind of cracked and convex mirror that only a computer can provide.

Future Soundtrack for America,Various Artists,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8279d034d5c69bf398e/1:1/w_160/64cdc1c3.jpg,2004-09-08 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2052-future-soundtrack-for-america/,Barsuk,"How does one ""review"" a political fundraiser? Harshly criticizing this compilation's individual tracks would be like complaining about the stitching on a PBS tote bag. And, should I encourage others to purchase the record, I am essentially advocating donations toward the causes of organizations like MoveOn.org, Music for America, and The League of Pissed Off Voters. Unavoidably, politics takes center stage to the music on Future Soundtrack for America. That said, Future Soundtrack for America is a predictably mixed grab-bag of B-sides, live numbers, and previously unreleased material, though to the credit of all parties involved, the vast majority of the music is excellent. OK Go kick off the record with ""This Will Be Our Year"", a straightforward Zombies cover that could only be recontextualized as a partisan rallying cry by some great stretch of the imagination. David Byrne's ""Ain't Got So Far to Go"", though, wastes no time getting to the point: His contribution is a folk narrative about a society's revolution against a ""kingdom in chaos."" Most artists, however, settle for mild status quo boat-rocking. Death Cab for Cutie's ""This Temporary Life"" is a bittersweet reflection on middle class ennui. R.E.M. and Sleater-Kinney both contribute tracks (""Final Straw"" and ""Off With Your Head"", respectively) with titles more scathing than their content. And on ""Going for the Gold"", a live acoustic recording spiked with ethereal slide guitar, Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst avoids overt political commentary to spin a characteristically miserable tale about winning the ""gold medal for idiots"" by fashioning his unspoken guilt into a structured song at the behest of malevolent coffee shop patrons. Meanwhile, They Might Be Giants-- whose John Flansburgh, with Spike Jonze and McSweeney's Dave Eggers, was instrumental in the creation of this project-- continue to mine their treasure trove of historical gimmicks with ""Tippecanoe and Tyler Too"", a lively, vaguely reggae-inflected ""cover"" of an 1840 campaign song. Unexpectedly, the compilation's biggest risk-takers are also among its lowest profile. Mike Doughty demonstrates a low-key acoustic direction in his post-Soul Coughing solo career, and offers the most articulate expression of the album's ever-present but undefined drive for governmental change on ""Move On"". He also presents a discernible platform, albeit in a language of generalities: ""I believe the war is wrong/ I don't believe that nations can be steered."" Ben Kweller wipes the Ben Foldsian smirk off his own face with the blistering ""Jerry Falwell Destroyed Earth"", a stripped-down mid-fi screed against the values of the far right. Later, Clem Snide contributes ""The Ballad of David Icke"", a haunting a cappella number both virulent and sad in its paranoid depiction of a loved one stolen away by the ""secret rulers of the world."" Laura Cantrell's tear-stained barroom country cover of John Prine's ""Sam Stone"" is comparably powerful. The song, a devastating story of a soldier's disillusioned homecoming and subsequent descent into morphine addiction, is made newly powerful by Cantrell's disjointedly sweet interpretation. And then there's the stitching. Jimmy Eat World's shockingly competent paint-by-numbers cover of Guided by Voices' ""Game of Pricks"" is initially a head-turner, but the song is only notable in comparison to the band's pre-existing mainstream pop-punk image. Elsewhere, Blink-182 and Yeah Yeah Yeahs bog down the album with mediocre rehashes of older material-- the inclusion of YYY's live number ""Date With the Night"" is particularly perplexing, as its poor sound quality makes the song difficult to endure. The Flaming Lips' rethinking of ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots"", with its unadorned piano accompaniment, is so bland that even Wayne Coyne seems to get bored; toward the end of the song, he inserts an in-joke that undermines his sincerity for a self-satisfied giggle. Fortunately, the fundraiser's organizers have wisely saved the best for last with Tom Waits' previously unreleased ""Day After Tomorrow"" and Elliott Smith's ""A Distorted Reality Is Now a Necessity to Be Free"". Waits' guitar ballad has the intimate feel of a home recording, and his portrait of a young soldier's ambivalence toward war and his all-consuming homesickness transcend a simplistic anti-war message to evoke the hard universal truths of All Quiet on the Western Front. Smith's song is a perfect choice for the album's conclusion; his tactful, immaculate indie pop production provides the background for a touching account of struggle in a deranged world. Future Soundtrack for America is a time capsule from one of the most divisive periods in the country's history. That it barely touches on the exasperation of the young audience it aspires to reach is not a weakness of the album, but rather a statement of just how desperate our political situation has become. A certain faction of Pitchfork's readership may not appreciate the partisan qualifications and editorial moralizing that go hand-in-hand with the advocacy of progressive causes, but all citizens, regardless of taste in music, have political responsibilities.","Proclaiming that ""every cent of our profits from this CD will go to non-profit progressive organizations,"" this MoveOn.org-sponsored compilation boasts 22 previously unreleased tracks from some of the biggest names in indie rock: Elliott Smith, The Flaming Lips, Tom Waits, R.E.M., Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Death Cab for Cutie, David Byrne, Sleater-Kinney and Bright Eyes, to name just a few.

Day Two,Endochine,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf7c0084474cd0c2bd0/1:1/w_160/9c469304.jpg,2004-09-07 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2910-day-two/,Fresh Tracks,"Little scribbly lines zigzagging and arcing over a black background, a TV with the message ""I hate you"" repeated on its screen, a little electrical schematic with ""Endochine"" scrawled in the middle, a partial fingerprint... let's not beat around the bush. This is Radiohead, Jr. album art at its most facile and unimaginative. Its Photoshop 5.0 throw-together look functions nicely as a microcosm of just how grossly Radiohead have been misinterpreted by their legion of imitators, and while Endochine themselves don't fare as badly at it as, say, Marion, Palo Alto, Ours or Cardia, their debut makes crystal clear that baby's got The Bends and has memorized every note of it. The Austin, TX quintet (don't let the occasional Oxford inflection fool you) are capable, even superlative musicians, and the two-part harmonies of guitarists Casey McPherson and Nathan Harlan broaden the band's post-Britpop scope, even as they shoplift their melodic tics from Thom Yorke and pinch their falsettos from Coldplay's Chris Martin. ""A New Beginning"" parachutes a Martin-ish croon into the middle of a shuffling, piano-dirge stew (complete with mellotron choir) with a melody that borrows almost every one of Yorke's signature moves, including those little slurs into dissonance he does so well. Most of the album charges harder than that song, as the band shoots for epic anthems and sometimes come close to hitting the mark. ""Breadline"" rides thumping drums and blaring guitars, but then the band fall prey to the obligatory stereotyped drug references (""Shooting up in the mainline/ I'll get my fix"") and sunnyside preaching (""You must keep on holding on"") that plague so many bands operating in this territory. Though Harlan and McPherson try their damnedest, delivering those kinds of lines with conviction doesn't make them any more meaningful. The two deliver some of their best harmonies on ""Music to Drive and Cry To"", sounding a lot like Doves with bigger guitars, and achieving a sort of epic sweep as they plow through the reverb with big, buzzing riffs. But that's the overarching problem with the album-- the whole thing has a kinda-broad sweep and a sorta-epic feel, yet never quite reaches either goal, ultimately coming off as an attempted masterpiece that lacked the substance to hit home. This is actually symptomatic of a lot of the post-Radiohead rabble, and while they frequently manage to get things right on paper-- the soaring melodies, the bold, jagged guitars, the odd synth or drum loop here and there-- it always lacks the risk that made Radiohead's original item work so well, and there's nothing different happening here. Endochine certainly have potential, but they need to let their assets coalesce in their own way first if they're ever going to realize it.","Another set of Radiohead copyists sink into the bottomless abyss of rabid Yorkophiles that will forever litter the world's used bins.

Through the Sun Door EP,White Magic,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa9dea9e61561daa5c07/1:1/w_160/407eacfe.jpg,2004-09-07 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8780-through-the-sun-door-ep/,Drag City,"The cover of White Magic's debut EP, Through the Sun Door, sports a carefully arranged collage of graying occult kitsch: skulls of various sizes and colors, a yellowing palmistry chart, dice, feathers, a pentagram, a Celtic cross, a peace button, glass-encased roses, pictures of eyeballs, a Buddha, a stuffed black cat wearing a gold chain. Obviously fine-tuned to reflect White Magic's bizarre goth-folk aesthetic, the assemblage flits endlessly between the personal and the peculiar: part-head shop, part-attic trunk, part-seasonal Halloween store buried in the back of the suburban mall. It's an impressive display-- weird and comforting at the same time-- and as a visual representation of the band's music, it succeeds remarkably. White Magic's rambling freak-folk is somehow perfectly reflected in each petrified rose petal, waxy skull, and scorpion-set-in-amber: a quirky, vaguely intriguing mix of Delta Americana and Euro-gypsy, tossed together with care. Despite only having only six songs (and clocking in at 22 minutes), Through the Sun Door can seem inconsistent and half-cooked. Still, the EP manages to show plenty of promise: There's a moment on the otherwise benign ""Keeping the Wolves from the Door"" during which vocalist Mira Billotte's voice seems to reach its outer limits, tottering for a few glorious seconds on the edge of total dissolution. Mostly, Billotte howls like a dreamier Eleanor Friedberger, forsaking The Fiery Furnaces' gruff, trilling proclamations for blissed-out bits of campfire verse. But the potential for apocalyptic breakdown remains at a continual high for White Magic, and when Billotte's throaty strains become heavy with that danger, the exhilaration she emits is both palpable and oddly inviting. Perhaps unsurprisingly, White Magic occasionally meander a bit too close to the knight-guarded edges of their local Medieval Times fairgrounds: The band tends to blindly embrace the same kind of awkward, barefoot spirituality that goes hand-in-hand with gnawing on giant chicken legs and wearing three layers of princess robes (see ""Plain Gold Ring"", especially). While not totally unconvincing, the band's gentle strummers tend to be far less engaging than their richer, slightly-less-directed romps. The record's two strongest tracks, ""One Note"" and ""The Gypsies Came Marching After"" are both centered on bizarre (and entirely out-of-tune) piano melodies, with guitar clangs, thick percussion, and Billotte's unhinged warbling running in a bunch of weird, paranoid circles. It's a dizzying turn, but ultimately worth its weight in stubbed toes.","Drag City debut from these freak-folk up-and-comers who contributed a standout track to Devendra Banhart's acclaimed Golden Apples of the Sun compilation.

"Flesh of My Skin, Blood of My Blood",Keith Hudson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c14a13d197565213bb95/1:1/w_160/ea37cb60.jpg,2004-09-07 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3967-flesh-of-my-skin-blood-of-my-blood/,AtraAtra,"From the blurry B&W; cover shot of our man doing something as self-effacing as picking peaches beneath skeletal, blood-red text, dentist/producer Keith Hudson's 1974 solo album Flesh of My Skin, Blood of My Blood looks as if it could fit somewhere between Jandek's Nine-Thirty and Telegraph Melts in the mysterious Texan mumbler's shadowy discography. But Hudson's outsider reggae music still sounds human, even if Leroy Sibbles' thumping bass is distorted beyond recognition and Augustus Pablo is made to blow steely harp instead of plastic melodica, the results of which sound like Stevie Wonder's work on the harmonica. This is another welcome step in Basic Replay's reconsideration of the erratic (and mostly out-of-print) discography of ""The Dark Prince of Reggae."" Last year, the label issued Hudson's delirious penultimate showcase Playing It Cool and Playing It Right-- here's hoping that Torch of Freedom isn't far behind. The man's catalog is notoriously diverse, and even within these 12 tracks, the erratic Hudson swerves all over the place. Opener ""Hunting"" is a tropical instrumental filled with the sound of rustling leaves, painfully modulated bass, Pablo's terse harmonica lines, and trickles of single-string guitar, birdcalls and rain patter, all mixed into a jungle haze. The album's four instrumentals are less dubs than ways to allow the soupy soul of ""My Nocturne"" or ""Blood of My Blood"" to stew just a bit longer, making them taste less like roots music and more like a drugged concoction cut from the run out grooves of There's a Riot Goin' On. ""Darkest Night"" is an original rhythm and is a seething, hypnotic drive down the heart of darkness highway (revisited to even more devastating effect on Playing It Cool) with dissolving congas, heavily wah-wah'd guitar, and beckoning siren calls from Candi McKenzie in the opaque, humid night. From there it's unsteady as, through the murk of the tape, Hudson cracks up on ""Testing of My Faith"", claiming he ""can't hold back these anxieties"" while lamenting aloud: ""Why can't I be like any other man?"" Even more telling is the amorphous croak-croon he unfurls on Woodstock hymn ""I Shall Be Released"". Just as Dylan and The Band scoffed at acidic, ""pie in the sky"" explorations during the Summer of Love, Hudson dodges simplified Rastafarian rhetoric to dig for something deeper and darker. His hands plunge into the dank earth, and much like The Basement Tapes, he pulls up eternally black roots, weird gibberish, and the worms that writhe in the mud of the shared mind.","Newly reissued, this bizarre 1974 album from ""The Dark Prince of Reggae"" is among his darkest and most tortured releases.

Guru Man Hubcap Lady,Homelife,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c163ea9e61561daa7d8c/1:1/w_160/2361ba4a.gif,2004-09-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3991-guru-man-hubcap-lady/,Ninja Tune,"Ninja Tune went looking for the legendary kitchen sink and found it in Homelife. Guru Man Hubcap Lady is an ingenious, overachieving experiment, a pushing away from the pack, a search for untrodden, unprecedented ground. The ever-evolving project of Manchester madman Paddy Steer, Homelife has lurked in the Ninja Tune dojo for years and still hasn't been pinned down to a formula, moving between leftfield disco jazz, digital torch song soul, and goony electronic funk. Surprisingly, in all its diffuse, foppish meandering, Guru Man leaves a sincere, wonderfully enigmatic impression, like an organic version of Wagon Christ's galactic travels as finger-painted during a cannabis-enhanced Advanced Jazz Band afterschool jam session. If playfulness is profound, then Homelife have spoken the Gospel. Steer fills out album's mix 'n' match eclecticism with a 15-strong rotating cast that includes 808 State multi-instrumentalist Graham Massey on clarinet and saxophone and co-conspirator Tony Burnside on guitar and vocals. A host of strings, keys, vocals, and cornucopia percussion keep Homelife's juicy heart beating, but Steer's intuitive, interwoven arrangements stitch it all together. The result is a kind of loopy, groove-drunk Frankenstein's monster that happily ricochets between the cerebral and the silly. The album's sequencing is shrewd, completing a graceful arc that literally starts with a bang and ends with a whimper. It all gets underway to the sound of distant fireworks that pepper the woozy, horn-smeared opener. Those lead right in to the ridiculous title track, with nearly indecipherable lyrics sung by what sound like Alvin & The Chipmunks' Swedish be-bop cousins. Backed by tub-thumping bass drums and greasy keys, and littered by shards of broken electronic bleeps, the title song sets the tone for the weirdness that follows. Well, almost. As weird as the song is, things immediately take a turn for the downright bizarre. The female-vocaled ""A Casa (The House)"" plays like the Tatooine Cantina Band doing Sun Ra and the Family Stoned before turning into a chime and banjo raga breakdown. Coursing along on Tony Burnside's casual vocals, ""Harder"" builds one of the most mesmerizing, head-swinging, caught-you-dancing workouts I've heard all year. The song is five uproarious minutes of slick, four-on-the-floor, blue-eyed Afrodisco that culminates with wiry organ and banjo tickled by choppy guitar, maracas, and a Dumbo-sized bassline. It's hard to describe, probably harder for you to imagine, and impossible to sit still to. The whole disc dips in and out of dimensions, running through the spin cycle but never rinsing out its debauched, impeccable sense of adventure. Hazy ambient musings, Flamenco-flavored balladry, junkyard jazz poetry, Spaghetti Western psychedelica, and tweaky IDM math-rock are all shuffled into Homelife's trick deck. And without sounding too fey, it does come together almost like magic-- loose but not sloppy, visionary but tangible, smart but not uptight. The emotional distance between the sassy Superfly string melody of ""Lowdell Is Missing"" and the loungey vocal caress of album closer ""Strangers"" is large, but the eclectic three-song transition that spans it is natural, logical, almost perfect. I often have a difficult time finding meaning in any work that's overtly fun, as if melancholy is the only path to enlightenment, but Homelife's crazy light reveals itself like a train. I've been hit.","As evidenced by its title, this new Ninja Tune release encapsulates the junkyard aesthetic, effortlessly shifting from leftfield disco jazz to digital torch song souls to goony electro-funk.

Showtime,Dizzee Rascal,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9aaeb335119a49ec836/1:1/w_160/d4c2767c.jpg,2004-09-07 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2346-showtime/,XL,"Ah, moaning about celebrity. Even when the complaints of the rich and famous are valid, they're still often insufferable. It's no surprise that films about the horrors of being chased by the paparazzi or how awful it is for poor Julia Roberts to sit through media junkets fall flat on their egos. And musically, negative responses to the klieg and camera lights haven't been much better. Tracks about the pitfalls of celebrity culture or the trappings of wide-scale admiration and fabulous wealth-- from Pink Floyd's ""Money"" to Pink's ""Don't Let Me Get Me""-- are often patronizing and grating. There are exceptions, of course: Eminem has been playing a compelling game of cat-and-mouse with his persona, fans and critics ever since he first hit the charts, and Kurt Cobain's wrestling with both self-hatred and a success he simultaneously courted and recoiled against are well explored on Nirvana's In Utero. When Dizzee Rascal was promoting his debut record, 2003's trenchant Boy in Da Corner, he famously cited In Utero as his favorite record of all time. Perhaps then it's no surprise that follow-up Showtime often deals with the London savant's fishbowl life as he negotiates both the expectations of those who hope he swims and the sharpened knives of those who wish he sinks. Rascal's level of fame isn't close to any of the above artists-- he thanks the 100,000 people who bought his debut, and he's still pleased just to open for Jay-Z rather than throwing rocks at Jigga's now-abdicated throne-- and that's part of his problem. ""Still Dylan the villain from around the way,"" Rascal is big enough that his detractors want to bring him down and small enough that they probably can. So while a multiplatinum seller like Nelly can wonder, ""What good is all the fame if you're not fucking the models?"", Dizzee is not only mercifully teased by a woman on Showtime's ""Face""-- she calls him a one-hit wonder and mocks his thin wardrobe and low-budget video before ultimately wishing a Jay-Z promo is on MTV Base-- but her words hurt. ""People are going to respect me if it kills you,"" Dizzee mutters on the follow-up track, and if that's the central goal on Showtime, he's likely to accomplish it. The album naturally lacks the shock of the new, the jolt of Boy in Da Corner-- instead, it's a consolidation of his strengths, lyrically and sonically, and a more satisfying listen than its predecessor. Musically, Rascal continues along many of the same paths-- explorations into orientalism and modal composition; the lurching, clattering futurerattle of jungle, dancehall, and hip-hop echoing through concrete tenements-- although the finished product is much more muscular and confident. Lyrically, he balances his paranoia with the spoonfuls of homespun advice and dew-eyed rallying cries that colored both his debut and Treddin' on Thin Ice, the solo bow from Wiley, another Roll Deep vet. In short, Rascal is keeping his feet on the ground, reaching for the stars, and looking over his shoulder for those who want to lay him in the gutter. Single ""Stand Up Tall"" has its finger on ""Pulse X"" and the exuberance and immediacy of Boy's ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"". ""Hype Talk"" ice dances with glitch-pop better than anything on Vespertine. ""Imagine"" takes fleeting elements of emo and the ""Girl/Boy Song"" to somehow magical results. ""Learn"" demonstrates that Rascal can do orientalism as beats-and-banger instead of just minimalist soundtracks to introspection. He also looks further afield to Jamaica (""Face"") and America (""Everywhere"", ""Flyin'""), and gets playful on the one-two combination of ""Dream"" and ""Girls"". The latter features the Kano-like cadence of Marga Man as he and Rascal wink and whistle at women over the track that sounds most like it could have tumbled off of Boy. The former is the song that will likely receive the most attention, and could be the make-or-break point for Showtime fencesitters. Taking its sing-song, Casio-tinkling chorus from Rodgers & Hammerstein via Captain Sensible's ""Happy Talk"", ""Dream"" is the record's most overt Jay-Z reference (it's a close cousin to ""Hard Knock Life"") and could become its commercial equivalent to ""Dry Your Eyes"", a recent UK #1 for The Streets. ""Dream"" has a loopy charm and simple philosophy, and Dizzee's infectious exuberance for the track leaves him unable to resist adding his off-key vocals to the central lyric: ""You've got to have a dream/ If you don't have a dream/ How you gonna have a dream come true?"" Even when something doesn't exactly work, there are other elements to buttress the missteps: ""Knock, Knock""'s central lyrical conceit is propped up by the track's tea-kettle sighs as it moves at night down Jefferson Avenue (it's much too slow for the Autobahn). The female vocal on ""Get By""'s chorus (which is more indebted to Kanye than the thug/diva duet template) has a bit of a square-peg/round-hole quality, but the song contains some of Dizzee's most quotable lyrics. ""If I can't find my around/ I'll find a way across/ And if I can't find my across/ I'll bore straight through,"" Dizzee insists on album closer, ""Fickle"". Not a Smiths reference (""fame, fame, fickle fame""), the track is perhaps the record's highlight, and the best example of Rascal's approach-- a mix of pragmatism and optimism, of demonstrating bravado without denying his vulnerability. Rascal's is a three-dimensional world, then-- not black and white, us vs. them, me against the world, me against the music, playas vs. hatas, underground vs. mainstream, or mo money, mo problems. There are elements of each of those cliches in his tracks, but he's smart enough to seek the nuances and contradictions in each of those supposed dichotomies rather than approach them as absolutes, an either/or, or a matter of right vs. wrong.","On the heels of last year's groundbreaking debut and his subsequent signing to Matador, the king of UK garage issues his wildly anticipated follow-up.

Poison Arrows,Communiqué,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a717c0084474cd0c0aef/1:1/w_160/409565d4.gif,2004-09-06 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1777-poison-arrows/,Lookout!,"Ah, amiable West Coast indie rock. In the past year, the California region has produced its fair share of seemingly effortless, vaguely generic pop, ranging in quality from pretty good (Dios) to pretty damn good (Rogue Wave). The spectrum for potential success within the regional genre is limited, though, precisely because of the inherently amicable nature of the music itself. Accordingly, it's nearly impossible to seriously knock an album like Poison Arrows, whose utterly harmless brand of rock is so airtight in its calculated construction that even the inevitable half-hearted smile and head-nod is justification enough for the album's existence. Communiqué formally departed from their CA-based punk roots (as American Steel) last year, when the keyboard-intensive pop sound of their 2003 EP A Crescent Honeymoon garnered some attention from MTV and a few high-profile music publications. The addition of a keyboardist, Corey Gowan, didn't exactly support lead singer/guitarist Rory Henderson's conception of the group as ""punk,"" but enabled the band to openly embrace a pop aesthetic at odds with the tone of their previous work. Poison Arrows is the fruition of the band's new direction, but the results, while intermittently catchy, are largely unremarkable. The album opens with ""The Best Lies"", which, with its buzzing synth bassline and indistinct, treble-heavy guitar muddle, turns on a dime from Cure-on-Zoloft verses to positively textbook pop choruses-- even the lyrics (""All the best lies are sealed with a kiss"") are suspiciously inoffensive. ""Evaporate"" is driven by a cheesy organ progression and weak new-wave dance beat, leading to a chorus nearly identical to that of the first track; unimaginative repetition, particularly in choruses, is the group's most consistent offense. ""Dagger Vision"" is one of many songs to employ a recently ubiquitous stock Cars synthline. ""Perfect Weapon"" drips with imitative disco-pop affectation, ""Strays"" effectively streamlines The Shins' unique brand of ambiguous 60s quotation, and ""Death Rattle Dance"" is a spirited, straightforward rock number, though lyrics like, ""I wanna scream and shout/ Let it all out,"" cut a bit close to teen movie soundtrack material. At some point during the unassuming closing ballad, ""Rattling Bones"", a distinct numbness sets in as the faint memories of every other song on the album slowly dissipate. Poison Arrows is the very definition of pleasantly forgettable: For further proof, one need only reference Rolling Stone, who, perhaps portentously, have labeled Communiqué's music ""rock at its finest."" Well, no. But again, how negative can one's attitude be toward this stuff? Communiqué straddles the retro-crazed Shins vs. Strokes divide so successfully that their sound is practically anonymous. Paradoxically, by pandering to every conceivably fashionable contemporary musical trend, the band transcends universal accessibility and becomes something of a non-entity. There's literally nothing that distinguishes this music from anything that a plethora of other marginally credible aspiring mainstream artists have to offer. Still, Poison Arrows retains a certain chameleonic charm. Generally agreeable and eager to please, Communiqué make a concerted effort to push no boundaries, offer no hidden pleasures, and suggest little potential for future musical development. Which is to say, of course, that they should do just fine.","Ah, amiable West Coast indie rock. In the past year, the California region has produced its fair share of\n ...

In Rock,The Minus 5,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5525e6ef95969323ab6/1:1/w_160/e6dc85ec.jpg,2004-09-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5320-in-rock/,Yep Roc,"Back in early 2000, Scott McCaughey took the stage of Lounge Ax in Chicago with Wilco standing in as his backing band and barreled through a set of quickly composed and completely unrehearsed songs in one of the vaunted venue's very last sets. A few days later, while the Ax was closing its doors for good, McCaughey was back in Washington state spending a day in the studio with one of his typically intriguing assemblages of mid-level rock stars. A core band featuring McCaughey, John Ramberg, R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and ex-Ministry drummer Bill Rieflin hammered those same songs into shape in roughly the amount of time it takes to bake beans in a slow-cooker, and then allowed the resulting album, awkwardly titled In Rock, to disappear into collector-geek obscurity: He pressed 1000 copies and sold them all at a single show. But such a fate was not what those songs deserved, and thankfully, McCaughey and Yep Roc Records realized this. The version of In Rock they've now dropped on the world at large isn't exactly the record that hardcore indie-pop fans have been overpaying for on the internet auction circuit-- McCaughey has cut two songs and added four new ones. The liners don't bother to point out which of these tracks weren't a part of the original release, but it hardly matters; the material all melds pretty well and everything is played with spontaneous abandon, as befits these sickly sweet confections, several of which rank among the finest McCaughey has placed on a Minus 5 album. Most of these songs are short and to the point, laced with McCaughey's trademark wit and served with a short stack of harmony vocals and a lot of fuzzy guitar. Opening instrumental ""Bambi Molester"", named for the Croatian surf band with which Buck and McCaughey have recently associated, nearly drowns in that fuzz, its surf beat and Dick Dale-ish guitar lines completely subverted by distortion. ""Where the Wires Meet the Skies"" uses a buzzing, frenetic SoCal backing to the advantage of McCaughey's great vocal melody-- about the only thing the song's missing is a big, blaring horn section, an absence they've filled with backing vocals and Big Muff-laden guitars. The tumbling ""whoa-oh-oh-oh""s of ""Courage Is the Smallest Bird"" stick to the roof of your brain like rubber cement, while ""The Girl I Never Met"" hits the lounge with acoustic guitars fluttering. Lounge Ax gets a direct mention in ""The Night Chicago Died Again"", a jokey song about a terrible flood that hits Chicago, though the Ax stays open. Over a Georgia Satellites-ish backing, McCaughey gets in his best lines detailing which members of the band Chicago were killed in the disaster: ""Among the casualties/ Daniel Seraphine, Cetera, Lamm & Pankow/ Not Terry Kath, but the guy who replaced him."" If that song skirts the edge of goofball overkill, though, ""Dr. Evil: Doctor of Evil"" crosses it entirely with its new-wave stomp and motormouthed spoken verses. The song also manages to directly quote The Youngbloods' ""Get Together"" in its breakdown, one of a litany of moments that could've been danced to in the 60s (or the 70s-- McCaughey predicts you'll ""do the strand"" on ""Cosmic Jive""). After this year's earlier, darker I Don't Know Who I Am: Let the War on Music Begin, Vol. 2 and the strangely lackluster Down with Wilco, In Rock is a hugely welcome blast of pure pop mayhem from one of its finest practitioners. It's basically everything you'd want in a modern, self-aware power-pop album, proudly referential of its influences, but never reverent toward them, and insidiously catchy for all but a few of its 35 minutes. And to think, most of us nearly missed a chance to hear it.","Longtime R.E.M. cohort and former Young Fresh Fellows frontman Scott McCaughey's latest release as The Minus 5 was originally issued as a tour-only LP in 2000, but contains some of his best work.

Acoustic and Electric Hard Cell Live,Tim Berne,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28113d19756521388b7/1:1/w_160/eced7941.gif,2004-09-06 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/665-acoustic-and-electric-hard-cell-live/,Screwgun,"With its raw sound and straightforward title, Electric and Acoustic Hard Cell Live feels like a bootleg. If you ignore Steve Byram's fantastic cover art, it's easy to imagine this as a cassette labeled in handwritten scrawl: ""these are the good parts."" Many of Berne's releases on the Screwgun label have looked like bootlegs-- live sets with his bands Bloodcount and Paraphrase came in cardboard sleeves-- but this recording of the Hard Cell trio feels and sounds rough. Two of the four tracks were captured by ""an ordinary person in an orderly manner"" (code for a guy up front with a mp3 recorder?) and Berne is basically advertising this disc as a chance to hear his bandmates blow the roof off. Berne has been generous with live releases of his projects, especially those from bands that never made it into the studio (again, Bloodcount and Paraphrase), and in the half-dozen live discs that he's issued on his own, he has yet to ship a dud. On the free improvisations of Paraphrase's Please Advise, the trio roamed like kids in a haunted house, slamming open new doors every few minutes. Ornery People, Berne's live duet with Michael Formanek, had the knotty diplomacy of two brothers arguing over a check. Almost none of Berne's compositions runs less than 10 minutes, and the players can race across the map a different way every time, banging through the structures with a spontaneity that merits alternate takes. Berne also has a knack for picking combustible performers. In addition to the bandleader himself, the Hard Cell trio includes keyboardist Craig Taborn and drummer Tom Rainey, each of whom played on Berne's 2001 recording The Shell Game. When you add guitarist Marc Ducret, you have the band that released Berne's most recently acclaimed studio disc, 2002's Science Friction. (Did you bring your scorecard?) Indeed, the repertoire on Hard Cell Live will be familiar to anyone who has heard Science Friction, but the compositions are only part of the focus: As previously mentioned, Berne wants to showcase his bandmates. Taborn and Rainey play each piece staccatissimo as they rattle together like rutting marionettes, switching from hammering patterns to improvised splashes while Berne squalls in the middle as the fulcrum. Even when Berne tries to angle a piece into a pensive section the other guys won't let him go, keeping him trapped in their crosscurrents. It's rare to hear Taborn play piano on this material, and the wood-and-wire sound knocks well against Rainey's tapdancer cymbals. The random blast of electric noise on ""Huevos"" is also a nice shock. All three men have played this aggressively before, but they've never cut an entire album at this pace. A recording of a complete show would have more archival value-- and Berne's bands are often as rewarding in the ebbs as the flows-- but that's not the point. The listener has the same experience flying through this record that the musicians had making it: How fast can we take this? What's around this corner?","Avant-garde leader of the extreme experimental free-jazz bands Bloodcount and Paraphrase issues this raw live document that, despite its beautiful packaging, plays like a bootleg.

Supergrass Is 10,Supergrass,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5dfea9e61561daa5233/1:1/w_160/05014dd8.jpg,2004-09-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7626-supergrass-is-10/,Capitol,"In American English, collective nouns usually take a singular verb. In British English, the same nouns generally use a plural verb. As a result, you can't debate the relative merits of Radiohead versus Blur without first determining whether Blur are or merely is. Now, Supergrass aren't (isn't?) the most self-conscious bunch of apemen, but the title of their new ""best of"" collection clearly adopts the Americanized diction. While this Oxford trio will never pass for American, they're not trying to. A decade after ""Caught by the Fuzz"", Supergrass look to break the surly bonds of Britpop and establish themselves in the rock 'n' roll pantheon, borders and oceans be chuggered. What's striking about Supergrass Is 10 is its revelation that, despite the occasional stabs of Parklife rhythm guitar and music-hall tinges, Supergrass never really belonged to the scene from which they sprang. Liam and Noel wanted to be The Beatles. Damon wanted to be admired. Jarvis wanted to be clever. Thom wanted everyone else to be miserable, too. Meanwhile, the Cornelius-faced Gaz Coombes, the man with the mutton chops? He just wanted to feel ""Alright."" So while Noel attempted rewrites of Abbey Road and Menswe@r became the punchline to this joke, Supergrass built up a catalog of raucous, jubilant, unrepentant unpretentiousness-- influenced by The Kinks and Buzzcocks, yes, but increasingly tapping into the swagger and immediacy of early rock and Delta blues, as channeled through the Rolling Stones and T.Rex. ""I'm a rock 'n' roll singer in a rock 'n' roll band,"" Coombes declares in ""Seen the Light"", his voice strangled in an apparent Elvis impression that makes Graham Coxon's American accent for Blur's ""Rednecks"" sound authentic. The song's scraggly boogie could serve as an object lesson for more recent Bolan adherents like The M's. ""Strange Ones"" is a bizarre, brilliant mash-up of British punk and obscene blues. Old ""Lenny"" B-side ""Wait for the Sun"" is dead-on acoustic Zep. Even ""Pumping on Your Stereo"", the closest thing Supergrass had to an American hit, sounds more like the faux-Southern rock of ""Rocks Off"" than ""Common People"". The band's more Britpop-tinged hits hold up, too. The punky sturm-und-drang (and goofy backing vocals) of ""Caught by the Fuzz"" are still worth getting arrested over. The sublime ""Moving"" glides comfortably along like the Acela Express, with sleepy strings that might have appeared in Mancini's score for Silver Streak, before bursting into its brilliantly jerky ""chorus"" (if that's what you'd even call it in a song that doesn't really have verses, per se, just hooks). ""It's Not Me"" provides one of the album's rare respites; its electronic burps and effects sound more like Moon Safari than I ever realized. And what of new single ""Kiss of Life""? Well, it won't resuscitate the group's stardom, which apparently is waning in the U.K. (they never really broke the States). The song sees the band reborn under punchy percussion, as the funky jam of cleverly sequenced preceding track ""Sun Hits the Sky"" gives way to the new one's Talking Heads-style polyrhythms. It could be great, too, if the best lyric weren't ""your love's like a heart attack"" and if Bono hadn't already used the verse melody in ""Mysterious Ways"". The other new song, ""Bullet"", is a dark bit of Goth about, uh, bullets, that has Coombes wondering, ""I'm in a world of marching soldiers and who am I?"" Hey, didn't we just slam Joan of Arc for that kind of nonsense? If you already own the original albums, Supergrass Is 10 runs a bit long at 71 minutes. And there's no reason it couldn't be in chronological order, really. The American edition will add a live disc, but it will be tough to improve on the album's defining track, ""Richard III"", from In It for the Money. Yes, it's the most blatantly British title on a collection that I've just said proves Supergrass's significance beyond cloistered Britpopdom. But listen: It starts slow-- just some warm-up sounds-- before exploding into stern alarums of distorted guitar and a barbaric ""whoop!"" from Coombes. The melody is as catchy as ever for this group and then something happens, something otherworldly. Is that a... theremin? Somewhere in those good vibrations, Supergrass become one of the funnest bands of the 90s, singular or plural.","Singles-driven Britpop greats are given a retrospective compiling the best tracks from their decade-long career.

"A Manual Dexterity: Soundtrack, Vol. 1",Omar Rodriguez-López,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3069d034d5c69bf2d1e/1:1/w_160/a93217c6.gif,2004-09-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6924-a-manual-dexterity-soundtrack-vol-1/,GSL,"A Manual Dexterity - Soundtrack Volume 1 is half of a pet project that Omar Rodriguez-Lopez (At the Drive-In, De Facto, The Mars Volta) has been recording since 2001. In its entirety, it will comprise the soundtrack for Rodriguez-Lopez's film of the same name. That this project steps back from the structured post-prog of The Mars Volta and bends more toward the esoteric experimentalism of De Facto is unsurprising-- it takes its title from the opening track of De Facto's 2001 LP Megaton Shotblast. What is surprising is that an undertaking of such magnitude and rich detail remains so shrouded in mystery. There have been few concrete details revealed about this project; most of the information is fragmentary at best. Cryptic message board posts, befuddling repetitions, frustrating omissions, red herrings and blind leads accrue-- either no one knows anything about this project, or they just aren't willing to say. When queried, GSL Records founder Sonny Kay replied: ""The film is 90 minutes long and will be out in the spring. That's all I know."" Factual glimmers from the digital rumor mill maintain that the film is fictional and is nearing completion in Los Angeles, and that Rodriguez-Lopez collaborated with numerous friends on the soundtrack, including John Frusciante and members of De Facto and The Mars Volta. Between these shadowy spires of dubious information, a vast lacuna remains. The word ""shambolic"" appears with startling frequency in reviews of A Manual Dexterity, Vol. 1. It's a good word, with a robust utility that belies its seldom-used stature (my word processor's spellchecker is trying to convince me that it doesn't exist), but one wishes ""rambolic"" and ""fumbolic"" were words as well. The record opens with ""Around Knuckle White Tile"", the title's abstract word collage representing Rodriguez-Lopez's lyrical tendencies, which are almost entirely absent from this mostly instrumental recording. The track's initial ambient rustles and haunted house sounds take a couple of minutes to set the scene, before morphing into a dim, lounge-y fugue with spinning traces of incandescent guitar. Freeform drumming enters to impose order upon the 7-minute walkabout as it assembles itself with subtle shadings of tone and color. ""Dyna Sark Arches"" spends a full minute establishing an aura of receding, minimal atmosphere before collapsing into prickly, staccato funk embellished with crystalline string bends and solos that are strikingly reminiscent of pre-Good News Modest Mouse. ""Here the Tame Go By"" drops a sizzling cluster of prog-guitar into the center of an immense expanse of arid atmosphere. Fans of The Mars Volta should take note of ""The Palpitations Form a Limit"", the record's only foray into standard rock dynamics and vocals. A ""deus ex machina""-- literally ""God from a machine""-- is a narrative device employed to resolve an inextricably tangled plot (e.g. ""And they all died in an avalanche""). As such, it typically arrives at the end of a work. Rodriguez-Lopez placed his deus ex machina-- a standout track with that name-- in the center of his record. The song is a seamless fusion of foundational dub, digital glitz, and unadulterated Latin jazz, a moment of pop lucidity amid all the abstruse avant-gardism. However, since the denouement of this review won't truly resolve until the film materializes, I'll close with a divine intervention of my own: ""And the Internet, crumbolic bastion of misinformation, subsided at last beneath the digital sea. The end.""","GSL finally issues the highly anticipated and widely discussed solo project from this co-frontman of The Mars Volta, At the Drive-In, and De Facto. Volume two is due early next year.

Happy Happy,Capitol K,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a514c0084474cd0c063c/1:1/w_160/fa33460d.jpg,2004-09-02 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1292-happy-happy/,Faith and Industry,"Take off your indie goggles and look around: We are surrounded by a million lap-pop artists, a billion of their half-assed records, and two billion of their mostly terrible live performances. No matter how great something sounds on record, we still want to see something happen when we go to concerts. We want to be entertained, and we want an experience beyond what the record already offers. Rock stars have it easy: They do a couple kicks once or twice in the middle of a sweet riff, or they tear off their t-shirt with their teeth and bam-- instant respect from the crowd. But laptop-based acts have to go the extra mile to keep the audience engaged. Matmos have done it well-- their Chance to Cut routine involved a live video feed of MC Schmidt drilling himself with an acupuncture needle while Drew Daniel manipulated sound in real time. Many other acts offer elaborate visual projection to bolster their show's energy. But if you don't have the cash to throw down for a projector, there's one other way a solo lap-pop act can up his stage cred: Get more people up on stage and play some live instruments. Manitoba did it for his Up in Flames shows in 2003, and now tourmate Kristian Craig Robinson (Capitol K) has followed suit. Robinson's third album, Happy Happy, carries that live band dynamic into the studio, adding his lycanthropic protege Patrick Wolf to the mix, along with drummer Adam Stringer, Jo Apps on bass, synths and co-vocals, and the heady Leafcutter John Burton on guitar and laptops. Robinson still handles most of the vocals and provides the songs their typically unpredictable IDM backbones. But if the new approach lends Happy Hour a sense of cohesion, it surprisingly lacks energy. As if purposefully contrasting his old sound with his new one, Robinson performs Happy Happy's first four songs by himself. Opener ""Love in Slow Motion"" is the best of this bunch, its glitched-out, guitar-led rock drive successfully mining the same territory as Lali Puna's Faking the Books, though without that record's sense of restraint. However, Robinson butchers the title track-- another solo effort-- with an irritating ""Happy! Happy!"" that aims to sound like The Stone Roses but ends up more like Weird Al. Robinson is joined by his collaborators on ""New York"", which rides its jam-bandy undercurrent with occasional recourse to synthy Cure-isms, as Leafcutter John riffs his way through the half-baked slosh. The beginning of ""Glorious"" falls into the same rut with a ""made to sound live"" production that begs for Phish bootleg comparisons and bead-in-hemp necklaces from Pac Sun. The song then takes a sharp turn into the trip-hop mezzanine, pimping a dark and slinky bassline reminiscent of Chris Corner's production work with Sneaker Pimps. Unfortunately, trip-hop is clearly not Capitol K's ""thing"": ""Revolution"" may be the worst song I've ever heard. Two songs on Happy Happy are so good, so full of life, that you have to wonder what went wrong with the others. The dark piano melody and female swoons that haunt the synth-popped ""Tiger"" eventually give way to a truly inspired Gainsbourg groove, one punctured by Kristian and Jo Apps' doo-doo-doo syncope across the pan. And ""Prayer for Peace"" is Happy Happy's hot metal Doberman, sporting Leafcutter's cyborg guitar rant and a wild dub groove complete with flute flutters and lumbering octaves in the low end. Both songs work because they are, if you will, ""band songs"": Capitol K The Band is not so forcedly trying to bulk up the laptop-based compositions of Capitol K The One Guy. The Band is playing to its own strengths here, and, for what it's worth, maybe Robinson's laptop experiments would be best left for post-production.","Third LP from lap-pop artist Capitol K finds him backed by a band featuring his protege Patrick Wolf and Planet Mu's Leafcutter John.

Business Casual,Beep Beep,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a461c0084474cd0c0497/1:1/w_160/e785726a.jpg,2004-09-02 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1126-business-casual/,Saddle Creek,"Beep Beep is the latest addition to the Saddle Creek roster, one that seems like an attempt at diversification. Of the Saddle Creek roster, Beep Beep come closest to the horny electro-rock of The Faint (indeed, Joel Peterson plays bass for both bands), but while this group piles on the guitars and scrimps on the keyboards (The Faint inverts that ratio), they're a far cry from Bright Eyes, Cursive, Rilo Kiley, or any of Saddle Creek's other signature bands. Instead, Beep Beep are accumulating fair if superficial comparison to Wire, XTC and Gang of Four. They echo XTC's brimming atmospheres and sculpted production as well as the anthemic post-punk tendencies of Gang of Four and Wire, but their compositions aren't lean enough for the comparisons to stand up under close scrutiny. If anything, it might be fair to say Beep Beep sound like two or three of those bands played simultaneously. The group is comprised of the core guitar/vocal unit of Eric Bemberger and Chris Hughes (who played in The Magentas with Conor Oberst and The Faint's Todd Baechle), bassist Katie Muth (who has since ditched the band for grad school and was replaced by Petersen), and drummer Mike Sweeny (who is also a member of Criteria, a band fronted by ex-Cursive guitarist Steve Pedersen-- Saddle Creek keeps it in the family). Bemberger, Hughes and Peterson also played together in an obscure band called Gabardine, which released one EP before disbanding in 1998. That Bemberger and Hughes have been collaborators since long before the advent of Beep Beep is apparent in the skillful, confident instrumental interplay on Business Casual. But even the well-honed dynamic fails to fully compensate for the overplayed, cluttered arrangements. While impressively rendered, they are often, put simply, just too much, and as such, the record's expansive sonic palette seems more imposing than engaging. I'll look forward to seeing Beep Beep perform, as the record sounds as if it would absolutely lay waste in the live setting, but a softer touch and sparer arrangements might have been more palatable for the recorded format. Business Casual opens with ""I Am the Secretary"", an exploding cluster of the digital flux, percussive muted strings, jagged guitar shrapnel, and theatrical, Sick Lipstick-ish singing that dominate the album. Note that Business Casual's lyrical themes are touted as explorations of ""office culture, as well as religious, environmental, and sexual deviance,"" and are often undecipherable. But the deviance, if nothing else, shines through the affected caterwauling. ""Oh No!"" is a standout, with the same driving rhythm as the rest of the album, but a starker and more discernible peristaltic thrust-- one that breathes new life into the tired formulation ""angular."" ""Giggle Giggle"" rolls out a staccato funk reminiscent of The Natural History over a ping-ponging electronic bass tone and, as the fourth song on the record is accompanied by a burgeoning anxiety stemming from the unremitting onslaught of strobe-light changes and vocal tomcatting. One can't accuse Beep Beep of being lackluster or uninspired. Business Casual is fierce and competent, and evinces the rippling of powerful musical muscles. But its affectations are so grating that it's tough to make it through it all in a single listen. I'm not averse to abrasive, nerve-testing music, but I'd prefer more contrast. Beep Beep's songs have a certain keening shrillness that will leave all but the hardiest nerves frazzled and jangling.","These new Saddle Creek signees, of which The Faint's Joel Petersen is a member, veers more closely towards that band's electro-rock than the label's sensitive roots.

Juxtaposition,Radian,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e2ea9e61561daa48e2/1:1/w_160/6aab9459.jpg,2004-09-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6648-juxtaposition/,Thrill Jockey,"Although exquisitely composed and painstakingly constructed, your appreciation of Radian's third album, Juxtaposition, will almost solely depend upon your appetite for instrumental, electronic-based post-rock. If you've had even trace amounts of it in your diet the past few years, it's unlikely that you'll find anything new or overly exotic here. So the only question is: Do you have room for more? Hailing from Vienna, Radian is comprised of bassist John Norman, drummer Martin Brandlmayr, and keyboardist Stefan Nemeth. As with 2002's Rec.Extern, the trio has brought in John McEntire from the Tortoise Institute of Percussive Arts (TIPA) to serve as engineer and midwife. In an apparent effort to sweep away all audio footprints, the group recorded and edited the electronic portions of these tracks in Vienna, then recorded the live bass and drum parts in Chicago with McEntire before stitching together the entire creature. It's a bit of a riddle why they bothered with this time-consuming technique, since it hasn't appreciably altered their sound from past efforts. One has the nagging suspicion that for Radian-- as has too often been the case with IDM acts-- the process has become more important than the product. Regardless of what procedures they used, the results sound just fine-- if somewhat familiar to fans of Tortoise, To Rococo Rot, Pan American, or Radian's previous work. Despite the three musicians' activities in improv and free jazz, very little seems to have been left to chance on Juxtaposition. Each track is a deliberate layering of textures and elements, with every microtone sounding as fussed-over as the sculpted icing on an elaborate wedding cake. With the origins of all sounds well obscured, ""Shift"" kicks the album off with what could be the promo music for a troubled TV news broadcast before the bass and drums join hands and finally settle into a satisfying lumber. ""Rapid Eye Movement"" begins with what sounds like the rhythmic whirr of a malfunctioning refrigerator, and then cycles through a pulsating series of ominous chords and steel wool abrasions. Elsewhere, they make pleasant use of a marimba (or the electronically manipulated approximation of one) and everybody seems to be getting along just famously until the finale ""Nord"" dumps you off unceremoniously at an undisclosed waterfront location while a black-suited man with a mysterious attache case keeps drawing closer and closer. You're finally exited with a gradual hiss-out to silence. I don't know how much of the credit goes to McEntire, but the album's production is flawless. The drums in particular were recorded with an almost pristine clarity, and the bass' supple warmth keeps the finicky proceedings from getting excessively sterile. In fact, Juxtaposition is so well put together as a package that I would like to be able to recommend it without reservation. And for everyone who hasn't already had his or her fill of Radian's well-executed but too-familiar brand of amusement, I'll gladly do so.","Produced by Tortoise's John McEntire, these Austrians' latest IDM/post-rock fusion is just fine, if you like that sort of thing.

She Loves You,Twilight Singers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84713d19756521395fc/1:1/w_160/468cfce5.gif,2004-09-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8212-she-loves-you/,One Little Indian,"It was all a matter of time: Over the past 18 years-- first with The Afghan Whigs and then as The Twilight Singers-- Greg Dulli has covered several anthologies' worth of songs on stage and on singles. Musically, Dulli is omnivorous, devouring everything from Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" to Hole's ""Miss World"" to New Order's ""Regret"" to Prince's ""When Doves Cry"". A covers album was inevitable. Reflecting Dulli's range of interest and influence, She Loves You covers a lot of territory in just 11 songs: R&B;, showtunes, classic rock, jazz, blues, soul, and Björk. For some artists, this line-up-- which includes songs by Hope Sandoval, John Coltrane, David Holmes & Martina Topley-Bird, Lindsey Buckingham, and Marvin Gaye, among others-- might appear too willful and calculated in its range of styles and genres, but Dulli's precedent-setting live performances and B-sides deflect that criticism. Diversity, however, is never an end in itself, and fortunately, The Twilight Singers evince an understanding of these songs, resulting in some intriguing interpretations. Dimming the lights and spreading them out on satin sheets beneath the mirrored ceiling, Greg Dulli-fies these songs, translating them into his particular brand of dark-end-of-the-street, soul-derived rock and, at his most brazen, altering their meanings. Unlike the four cover songs on Afghan Whigs' 1994 EP What Jail Is Like, this is no one-night stand. Rather, She Loves You treats each song differently while still being carefully sequenced so that its tracks cohere into a narrative of love and loss, resulting in a record that manages to sound as if its tracks were the product of one mind. (Although, in fairness, Dulli's musical mind was itself formed by many of these songs, which prompts a chicken-or-the-egg conundrum). The Dulli who sings the edge-of-the-precipice ""Hyperballad"", for example, could be the same one who wrote ""Be Sweet"" or ""Something Hot"". On Fleetwood Mac's ""What Makes You Think You're the One"", Dulli loses the original's regimental march tempo, allowing the song to sprawl and stretch as he mimics Lindsey Buckingham's slurred vocals. ""Too Tough to Die"" merges Topley-Bird's dark Americanisms onto a New Orleans piano shuffle, and on ""Real Love""-- first recorded by Mary J. Blige-- he builds on the jump-rope rhythms of the original, letting a sawing guitar drive the chorus. Elsewhere, the Gershwin Brothers' classic ""Summertime"" sounds new, darker. Over a 70s-soundtrack guitar flourish, Dulli sings ""hush, little baby, don't you cry"" like a sexual predator, his voice sounding pack-a-day ragged. It's sinister and not a little unnerving, but he makes it fascinating just the same, mostly because his interpretation doesn't stray from the original, just re-frames it. That approach doesn't necessarily work across the board: Dulli's biggest misfire on She Loves You is ""Strange Fruit"", popularized by Billie Holiday but written by Abel Meeropol, a white, Jewish, Communist schoolteacher. Vividly describing a Southern lynching, it has become canonical, among the first popular songs to address American race relations. Its specific descriptions of seemingly tangential details only add to the inherent horror of its topic, and even Holiday's version sounds slightly eroticized by the tactile descriptions (""scent of magnolia sweet and fresh"") and the chiaroscuro contrast between that pleasure and sheer pain (""then the sudden smell of burning flesh""). Dulli and occasional Twilight Singer Mark Lanegan make the sensual lyrics sound desperately sexual: The line ""black bodies swaying in the summer breeze"" here evokes images of lovers, not corpses, and ""the bulging eyes and the twisted mouth"" describe the body in orgasm. It's a brave, if facile, read, completely disregarding political correctness as it plumbs the song for other issues. Dulli goes for obvious horror-show theatrics-- lumbering guitar lines, Sturm-und-Drang pace, tortured vocals-- which cheapen the song's devastating metaphor. Simply put, the song looms too large for him; he cannot manage to wrap his persona around its gruesome subject matter and deep history. While ""Strange Fruit"" aims for intense psychodrama, Dulli gets more impact out of the simple do-do-do's on Marvin Gaye's ""Please Stay"", the sadomasochistic subtext of ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"", the vertiginous emotions of ""Hyperballad"", and the hope in the face of heartache on Mary J. Blige's ""Real Love"". They may not be as ambitious as ""Strange Fruit"", but they do remind us why the earth moved for Dulli in the first place.","Former Afghan Whigs frontman Greg Dulli's third album with Twilight Singers indulges his fondness for the cover song, reinterpreting 11 songs originally performed by John Coltrane, Billie Holiday, Marvin Gaye, George & Ira Gershwin, Mary J. Blige, Hope Sandoval, and Björk, among others.

Album of the Year,The Good Life,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15fb1335d7bf169823c/1:1/w_160/c24aa20f.gif,2004-09-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3646-album-of-the-year/,Saddle Creek,"""I was reading Fante at the time/ I had Bukowski on the mind."" In the midst of the opener on The Good Life's latest album, the cheekily titled Album of the Year, lead singer Tim Kasher is name-dropping his taste for curb-front cult faves. Now, I hate to be a quibbler, but perhaps Bukowski's more applicable to the emotional thrashing in Kasher's other group, Cursive. The more appropriate literary one-off for this record might be Nelson Algren, whose resurgent castaways could settle quite comfortably into the spoon-fed healing and isopropyl fumes of Kasher's newest songs. Whereas Cursive has made a career of pleading for catharsis through bruised, over-the-top emoting, The Good Life has always detailed Kasher's lonely nights; he formed the group for the material that would have sounded too sleepy alongside most of Cursive's ranting and raving. Adopting soft, shadowed hues and more rounded arrangements for his confessional tales, Kasher's The Good Life project has made steady progress from its Cure-esque first two albums to more crisp, autumnal sounds. Album of the Year's premise is somewhat ungainly: to document the passage of a year in 12 songs, one for each month. But, to appreciate its stark, lovelorn poetics, you need know none of this. The songs are instantly welcoming, flickering with enough hope and tenacity to outlast Kasher's heartbreak. It's not enough to revel in your own melancholy without understanding what's being gained through its endurance. Augmented by Mike Mogis' best production of the year (and manning the boards for a label like Saddle Creek, it's been a busy one), each song seems to hover in fathomless space, but interacts with an effortless synthesis that belies such separation. ""Night and Day"" is a trapeze-wired waltz that shuffles along on a broken accordion and Mogis' starlit Wurlitzer. In three dizzy minutes, it makes you uncomfortably familiar with the forlorn vagrants that populate Kasher's world. ""You're No Fool"" adds to this circus-tent feel by combining a lonely saxophone line with a bar-soaked piano, painting a dark tale of exes incapable of losing former lovers. The strong, almost insolent saxophone returns you to Kasher's ability to wallow in sorrow without sinking under its weight, the redemption of the past through its seemingly insufferable passage. Here, Kasher again reminds one of his kinship with Algren, as the track would have fit perfectly alongside Elmer Bernstein's jazz score for the film adaptation of The Man with the Golden Arm. On ""Inmates""-- the one track where Kasher allows someone else to voice his heartache-- Jiha Lee steps in without missing a beat to add a seductive, mesmerizing shyness. Atop a soft acoustic guitar, distant bongos and tingling electronics, both Lee's voice and the epic track build before Kasher turns the song into a duet and electric guitars grind out the transcendent ease. By the time ""Inmates"" ends with Lee's pronouncement that ""she can""t be your prisoner,"" the song seems to have packed an entire relationship's worth of tempo shifts and transgressions into its 9-plus minutes without ever sounding bloated. The complaints with the album are worn-in with old caveats, namely the ""emo"" tag. Those unfamiliar with Kasher's songwriting could mouth that forbidden word after the album's initial sad-eyed glance. One might hear the hysterical strains of Ben Gibbard or Chris Carraba in Kasher's reckless emoting. But remain calm and it will pass: The vibrant productions and transient lyricism will pull you through that knee-jerk response. Kasher has turned his pissings and moanings into grand, translucent tales that typically avoid the isolation of self-indulgence (occasional slip-ups like the sugary bleating of the title track to this year's Lovers Need Lawyers EP only prove how adeptly most of the album is handled). He might tell you otherwise, but like Isaac Brock, he knows that it's tough to live like Bukowski. Instead of seeking spirituality in pocket-change or San Franciscan street-grime, he's after the sudden comprehension gained from nights spent alone and stories that translate the open pitfalls of the heart.","Cursive frontman Tim Kasher's third album with The Good Life ditches the Cure-informed bent of their past two LPs for its own vision.

The Same as a Flower,Nagisa Ni Te,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39313d197565213bd6d/1:1/w_160/817e034c.jpg,2004-09-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5699-the-same-as-a-flower/,Jagjaguwar,"The American importation of modern Japanese music used to insinuate a strange sort of neo-orientalism-- one that, rather than exploiting the foreign and exotic ""other,"" reveled in their exotic and foreign reflection of us. The mix of familiarity and strangeness in Japanese imitations of American forms produced an equally hazy mix of sincerity and novelty in enjoyment. But through experimentation with an ever-growing number of Western underground genres, the Japanese have moved in their own, enviable direction. Lo-fi experimental rock is popular with the kids overseas (hence The Microphones' recent ""Live in Japan""), but there are only a handful of reciprocal acts that have made it over here so far. Osaka-based duo Nagisa Ni Te are one, immersed in 60s/70s American psych-folk and a lo-fi connection to the natural world via imperfect multitracking and distracted guitar strumming. Despite being billed as Japanese avant-folk, The Same as a Flower subsists on relatively standard, slow, guitar-based songs. Fortunately, Nagisa Ni Te avoid sounding derivative, and some unique characteristics set them apart as worthy of attention. The strongest of these is a pervasive aura of childlike innocence and wonder, usually an unconvincing pose when coming from American musicians. Shinju Shibayama and Masako Takeda's direct, unprocessed and imperfect singing strikes at a deep and sincere place. Some of their simple melodies are possessed with the placidity of lullabies, as in ""A Light"", while others run along the traditional pentatonic scale, such as in ""Thread of Souls"". Nagisa Ni Te's songs balance a home-recorded sense of creation and experimentation with a propensity to swell into grand orchestral finales. Yet while the mood remains wistful and appealing, the songwriting on The Same as a Flower is not that strong, offering few musical moments that linger beyond the immediate. This forgetablilty works on some level in their favor-- the album as a whole comes across as a wispy piece of lazy late-summer listening. But overall, that lightness is what prevents the record from the transcendence to which it aspires. Because of the duo's generally unremarkable songwriting, the album's best moments occur when Nagisa Ni Te get creative with arrangement and production. ""River"" creates a big piece from a small idea, propelling a simple melody into rounds and canons that imitate the flowing, winding object of the song's title. ""Wife"" layers plucked, detuned guitars over a percolating organ beat, offering an instrumental island before the 12-minute centerpiece ""Bramble"", which culminates in the album's most dense and distorted moment. The slide guitars and ending strings and harmonies of ""After a Son"" embody the blooming psychedelia that Nagisa Ni Te hint at elsewhere. And the sparse, acoustic closer ""Hope"" creates one of the album's most beautiful places, exemplifying the intimate, minimal sound that they're able to realize quite well. The Same as a Flower didn't make much of an impact the first time around, but it drew me back to repeated listens, and grew grander each time. After the standard melodicism and fairly reserved sound, there remains something undeniably appealing about this male/female duo's unpretentious yet confident delivery. If they can start writing songs that meet the standard of the musical stage they set, then we'll have a take on some classic genres that itself is worthy of imitation.","With freak-folk reaching a fever pitch, this Japanese folk duo would finally seem to have a shot at breaking through.

Viscous Solid,Aeroc,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a6b1335d7bf16982f4/1:1/w_160/367de6e3.jpg,2004-09-01 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/451-viscous-solid/,Ghostly,"The pin drops inside a minimal techno clean room. A technician is there to hear it, and he captures the resulting tic on his unidirectional mic. The speck of sound spikes on a nearby monitor, and soon it's been tweaked and expanded like digitized grey matter silly putty, permuting beats and dot-matrix melodies into a new orchestral maneuver that bumps with quiet dignity from a dark and inviting future. Geoff White is versed in this pinprick aesthetic. Under his own name (for Force Inc., amongst others), he's produced quiet techno that shimmers like an echo in a subway tunnel, but is also stippled with the steely signature of sparks flown. Both rigid and poseable, his tracks are like robots with swivel-arm battle-grip. Debuting for Ghostly International as Aeroc, White leans back from that approach. Instead of wrapping plastic rhythms in expansive, fleecy melodies, Viscous Solid approaches glitch through the point of a guitar pick, and takes its time at the crests of its deep breaths. Whereas even minimal techno relies on a rhythmic framework, Aeroc dives headlong into doctored sounds without borders for restriction. Word on the street says a manipulated acoustic guitar was responsible for the majority of Viscous Solid. It's definitely a factor in opener ""My Love, The Wave Break"", where repeated strums coast over consistently percussive smudges. The untreated acoustic adds welcome warmth to the track's more traditional underpinnings, giving it the quality of a hologram in the midst of a particularly leisurely daydream. A brief, windblown surge leads into ""Mahy"", where that familiar ping-pong tickle travels parallel to the guitar's gentle ramble. Here, however, it's almost too far away from the foreground beat. Aeroc could be ruminating on the static effect of technology on organics, but he likely just got carried away with the echo pedal. Aeroc uncovers weight in the quietest of places. ""Fall First"" pits the hums of dueling industrial refrigerators against a downed power line's threatening pops and clicks; the result is a pulsing channel of eerie, creeping gloom. However, this song is also the corridor into Viscous Solid's holding pattern center. ""Wish Eyes"" and ""Vio La"" drift into a tonal experimentalism that's effective, but somewhat banal next to tracks that blend their formless, swirling approach with subtle yet expressive rhythms. ""Enter""'s layered bass tones ooze like black jelly, filling in the divots that line its backbone blips and cut-up acoustic chording. One of the album's strongest songs, ""Enter"" blends minimal techno's engaging, subtle rigidity with Aeroc's own penchant for six string-derived eclecticism. Viscous Solid actually grows stronger as it moves along, even with the occasional stall in momentum. The sunny, layered guitars of ""Onward... Upward"" are almost unexpected when they finally arrive, but that doesn't prevent the track from conjuring images of a Zip drive named Gordon Lightfoot playing a concert for out-of-work CPUs. And emerald grass grows from between his microcircuits. ""Summer's Almost Over"" closes things out with its insistent, stuttering plinks and channel-shifting swells. Sticking around until its halfway mark brings a flurry of rangy acoustic snippets that surface trebly and flat, field recordings floating over what's become a multi-part rhythm when no one was watching. That's how, in its best moments, Viscous Solid is like plugging an electroencephalogram into the pickup of a Guild.","Ghostly International issues this new full-length from former Force Inc artist Geoff White, which dives headlong into doctored sounds without borders for restriction.

Highways,Lanterna,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca9ea9e61561daa7516/1:1/w_160/acecc36f.jpg,2004-09-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4689-highways/,Badman,"Over the past year, I've come to know a rare and elusive breed of music fan. This breed is in their late 20s to early 30s, pale, tall and fragile, notably anti-indie-rocker, and stands quietly askew to their soul-patched, aging ""alternative"" siblings. Their taste is built quite specifically upon the dream-rock lineage of the shoegazers and the goth-tinged ambient pop stemming from the Cocteau Twins. These figures have slowly figures infiltrated my musical knowledge-- a Jamie who burned me a copy of Slowdive's beautiful, impossible-to-find Pygmalion; a Steve who introduced me to the output of Azure Ray; a kindly record store employee who repeatedly insisted I listen to This Mortal Coil. Firm believers in the most beautiful, emotional, human sounds to come out of the late 80s and early 90s. Having seen Lanterna's Henry Frayne play live a few months ago, I can comfortably conclude that he fits the physical and musical profile of these listeners. A towering, soft-spoken man who began playing unannounced as he stared at the pedals by his feet, his delayed guitar soon filled the room with slow melodies set to the dramatic beats emanating from his laptop (the modern equivalent of shoegazing being, of course, screenstaring). As Lanterna, Frayne has been producing a consistent strain of guitar-based instrumental music for several years now-- one that largely ignores any apparent influence from the past 10 years. On new album Highways, he replaces the programmed beats of his past releases with live drummer Eric Gebow and ""tape effects"" from Mike Brosco, altering his increasingly honed sound. A new listener might be tricked by opener ""Clear Blue"" into thinking Highways a Windy & Carl-derived textural work, until ""Brightness"" bursts in with the clean-reverbed chords of an Eno-produced U2 song. Lanterna is usually spoken of in terms of ambient; in fact, I found him filed under ""new age"" at my local record store, though the closest Highways comes to that territory is with a few Spanish-sounding guitar licks in the beautiful ""Adriatic"". The live drums and ambient pop guitar tone actually bring Highways closest to instrumental, distortion-free dream-rock. The songs maintain standard arrangements and known forms, confident in their chordal simplicity. It's really a logical extension of the genre-- a lot of shoegazers hated writing lyrics anyway, and despite all their talk about keeping vocals low in the mix to render them ""another instrument,"" many were probably more afraid of the commercial implications of making purely instrumental music. Not so for Lanterna, who lets his delayed arpeggios speak for themselves. The term ""cinematic"" is often applied to vocal-free work in describing the spaciousness inherent where no human voice or lyrics exist to grab focus or give specific meaning to the sound. Here, however, ""cinematic"" is applicable to Lanterna's sense of the dramatic as well. The bent, western guitar melodies of ""Canyons"" or ""Brooklyn"" convey sweeping visual impressions. Frayne is not after the dark emotional ambiguity of beatless drones, and his generally major-key melodies avoid the sinister, conveying a subdued and hopeful feel. The album's brick wall is its lack of substantial textural exploration. Frayne has found a sound he likes, and ventures outside of it little, aside from occasionally changing the speed of his delay. While instrumental outfits like Stars of the Lid are intent on mutating their guitar sound through manipulation of attack and decay, Lanterna's not of an experimental mind. Yet when he does exceed his standard parameters, the results are worth the effort. My favorite piece on the album is its closer, the title track, in which Frayne transforms sparsely plucked guitar notes into deep oscillating drones. It seems cliched to call an album like Highways ""good driving music."" But its title doesn't exactly resist the connection of this sort of sound with the blur of landscapes whizzing by, mind both open and numb, body immersed in and removed from the surroundings in that perpetually transitory state. And after all, the most consistent tempo on Highways is a propulsive pace that would most accurately be called ""driving."" So I guess we'll just have to keep this album handy for those late afternoon country car trips necessitating a soundtrack, when feeling runs deep enough to render words unnecessary.","Third full-length from these shoegazer revivalists replaces the programmed beats of past releases with a live drummer and tape effects.

San Francisco's STILL Doomed,Crime,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a716ea9e61561daa54e7/1:1/w_160/e72923ec.jpg,2004-09-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1776-san-franciscos-still-doomed/,Swami,"In 1975, Frankie Fix and Johnny Strike played together in a glam band called Space Invaders. When bassist Ron ""The Ripper"" Greco and drummer Ricky Tractor (who went on to play in Flipper, and was replaced by the drummer for most of this reissue, Hank Rank) joined up, they abandoned glam in favor of punk and became Crime. But San Francisco's self-proclaimed ""first and only rock 'n' roll band"" was too punk for punk: They considered it a sanitized and media-sanctioned description unsuited to their anarchic music. Given such a defiant creed, one would imagine said music to be dauntingly strange, but surprisingly, San Francisco's STILL Doomed sounds downright traditional compared to many of Crime's peers. Essentially, it's sneering, overdriven, classic rock 'n' roll-- and I'm talking classic classic; Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, rollicking, bass-heavy 1950s classic, inflected with R&B; and rockabilly, with a first-hand memory of the blues from which it came. Even buried under sheets of ambient noise and abrasive distortion, it's immediately recognizable as rock 'n' roll. Imagine what The Animals would have sounded like if they were literally on fire, howling in pain. What's remarkable about Crime, then, is their ineffable ferocity, which must have been doubly outrageous emanating from four anti-punks in greaser-noir and S.F.P.D. uniforms. It's said that Crime was the first punk band on the West Coast to release their own single-- ""Hot Wire My Heart"" (which Sonic Youth would cover on Sister) b/w ""Baby, You're So Repulsive"", in 1976. This was followed by 1977 single ""Frustration"", b/w ""Murder by Guitar"", and an infamous performance for the inmates of San Quentin, which is starting to sound like an okay place-- I mean, I've never gotten to see Johnny Cash or Crime in concert, and I'm a (mostly) law-abiding citizen. Crime disbanded in 1981, after their third single (not included on this collection) earned the approval of critics, but alienated fans with its fashionable new-wave tendencies. They left behind a lot of unreleased material and legends of flagrantly self-defeating behavior, from canceling a gig with The Damned because they refused to open, to promoting a show at a bisexual club with a Hitler poster that prompted the club's owner to pay Crime $100 to not play, to telling Seymour Stein of Sire Records that The Ramones were ""hippies that should cut their hair."" Swami has re-mastered and re-issued Solar Lodge's 1990 release San Francisco's Doomed, which was a CD document of two late-70s rehearsal sessions. Swami's version is essentially identical, except for additional versions of ""Hot Wire My Heart"" and ""Baby, You're So Repulsive"" from the band's original 1976 incarnation. It marks the closest we'll ever come to a proper Crime album, and, at least until Revenant Records' plan for a box set and DVD comes to fruition, the most faithful document of a band heretofore remembered through murky bootlegs and a credit in Sonic Youth's liner notes. San Francisco's STILL Doomed is a torturous, detuned and feedback-laced stomp through rock 'n' roll standards. While many punk bands got by on weirdness, employing maneuvers that were a metaphor-conjuring wet dream for critics, Crime relied less on innovation than on furious, strident rhythms. From the demented boogie and blazing leads of ""Frustration"", to the droning, halting guitars and mobile bass melody of ""Crime Wave"", to the plodding dissonance of ""Murder by Guitar"", the 1978 session is an exercise in strenuous distortion, damaged riffage and disintegrating classic rock. The 1979 session, meanwhile, evinces a greater emphasis on rockabilly (including a song called ""Rockabilly Drugstore"", natch), but doesn't hint at the new-wave mishaps that would tarnish Crime's last days. The new versions of ""Hot Wire My Heart"" and ""Baby, You're So Repulsive"" are a bit rawer, but really aren't stylistically different from the subsequent sessions, and demonstrate that Crime was most effective when, instead of trying to fit in or react against, they defiantly locked on to primal rock archetypes and rode them hard into infinity.","Forming in 1976, Crime were among the very first West Coast punk bands, but released just three singles before disbanding in 1982. Now, Swami Records offers the definitive document of the band's career, bulking up their 1992 anthology to 22 tracks.

"Joan of Arc, Dick Cheney, Mark Twain...",Joan of Arc,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0beb335119a49ec934/1:1/w_160/55b0ef87.jpg,2004-09-01 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4271-joan-of-arc-dick-cheney-mark-twain/,Polyvinyl,"One might think that Tim Kinsella, the outspoken shit-magnet/revered frontman of Joan of Arc, Make Believe, Owls, Cap'n Jazz, Friend/Enemy, etc., might have something to say about the current national and global political landscape. And so he does: In recent interviews, Kinsella's commentary on the state of things has ranged from understated irony (""I'm still a 'feminist'"") to pointed anti-Bush administration railing (""I'll line up wherever I can against their fundamentalist doomsday plan""). The title of Joan of Arc's latest concept review waiting to happen, Joan of Arc, Dick Cheney, Mark Twain..., suggests that Kinsella might finally be prepared to hang up his dubious title of dadaist indie lightning rod to make an album statement of some political import. Let's find out: ""If D.C.'s streets make a neat pentagram and every dollar bill brags God's behind our plan/ Who am I to have any idea who I am?"" Ouch. Yes, Tim Kinsella just turned a potential indictment of Bush's ""crusade"" into a personal statement of his existential crisis. The rest of the album follows suit-- hints of Kinsella's criticism of the reigning machine are buried within awkward stabs at soul-searching and meandering character studies. In fact, Dick Cheney is invoked only once, on ""The Title Track of This Album"", when members of the band blankly repeat the phrase, ""Joan of Arc, Dick Cheney, Mark Twain,"" over electronic noise from a drill. That's some biting commentary, all right. I'm all for confrontational absurdism as a means of personal exploration in experimental rock-- Xiu Xiu has been doing it successfully since Brent DiCrescenzo got his last piece of Kinsella brother flame mail. But there's a thin line between expressing unspecific political frustration (I believe it was Nic Offer who ordered the president to, er, fellate him) and embracing empty nihilism to avoid the task of forming a valid personal ideology. The group's blindly cynical mud-flinging is best represented on ""80s Dance Parties Most of All"", where Kinsella, smart-ass to the core, argues (with tongue in cheek) that Internet porn, grammar, 24-hour days, Friendster, and global warming are all ""conspiracies."" Like the historical figures in the album's title, these things are listed arbitrarily, leading to an unavoidable question: What's the point? Therein lies the fundamental flaw of the album: There isn't much of a point, and in view of our current political climate, Dick Cheney isn't a name to be dropped frivolously. Likewise, irony for irony's sake doesn't carry the same hipster-courting, smirk-inducing weight it might have back in the halcyon days of the late 90s, when an Al Gore concept album full of lyrics like, ""There's politics to dressing warm/ And it has a subtext of muscle,"" and my personal favorite, ""I've only one question left unanswered by both Sid Viscious [sic] and my mother-me-who?"" could have been conceptually hilarious, if not exactly insightful. In 2004, however, the baseless pessimism that pervades most of these songs comes across as lazy and irritating. ""Apocalypse Politics"" is particularly telling; the line, ""With the earth agreed a circle/ Any and all points can each be the center simultaneously,"" is essentially a variation on the elliptical Zen premise of Modest Mouse's ""3rd Planet"". The crucial difference is that in Isaac Brock's version, the universe's profound circularity is humbling, reminding us that eventually all things will ""end up where [they] were."" Kinsella, on the other hand, crudely concludes that the ""world continues ending in its infinite variable speeds."" Kinsella's manic rhetoric has often been a divisive feature of Joan of Arc's output, but here the superficiality of his simple end-of-the-world theatrics is transparent. The album's saving grace is the surrounding music, which almost, but not quite, makes up for Kinsella's constant barrage of tiresome non-sequiturs. Most songs exhibit a further expansion of the band's subdued post-rock inclinations explored on 2003's So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness, replacing the often formless compositions of their earlier work with relatively structured acoustic experimentation. ""Queasy Lynn"" finds its foundation in thundering carnival atmospherics, ""Onomatopoeic Animal Faces"" is a spare piano dirge, and the aforementioned ""Dance Parties"", with its muted cowbell-driven beat, quickly works into a dynamic, perpetual acid-folk groove. Fragments of spastic acoustic instrumentation, such as the discordant piano figures in ""Questioning Benjamin Franklin's Ghost"", follow their own loose internal logic, and even abstract electronic experiments like ""Deep Rush"" demonstrate welcome restraint and concrete structure, further distancing the band from the shapeless music of The Gap and Live in Chicago, 1999. The band's overall sound has arguably never been more cohesive, thanks in part to Tortoise producer John McEntire's mixing efforts, and their development as a collective is promising. Still, the music, though admittedly provocative, almost always plays the role of sonic backdrop to Kinsella's ridiculous tangential meditations, which ultimately sink the album. The despicable legacy of Dick Cheney & Co. deserves more consideration than a passing ""go fuck yourself"" in the form of a meaningless title reference and unflattering album cover portrait, and that seems to be all Kinsella has to offer.","Seventh full-length from these infamous Chicago-based art-cocks attempts to work political commentary into frontman Tim Kinsella's elliptical nonsense.

Flamingo Honey,Whirlwind Heat,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa0f13d1975652139980/1:1/w_160/485fd416.jpg,2004-08-31 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8643-flamingo-honey/,Dim Mak,"Back when Whirlwind Heat was still fresh from Jack White's teat, their muse was a squawking harpy communicating to the scene dwellers through David Swanson's yowling mouth and Moog squawk. A bit older now, and with their rep attaché bulging, the trio has issued Flamingo Honey. But apparently enamored of their own hype aura, they've spelled out ""too cool for school"" in wracked and twisted pipe cleaners and call the tangled and spiny mess a second album. It's presumptuous and irritating, this recording of 10 one-minute songs. Presumptuous because at least two of those minutes are cocktease throwaways resting crumpled at the feet of Beck and Thurston Moore. Time wasters. Irritating, because a few other of these minutes gleam with something compelling, only to yank the rug right as we get our footing. Types like The Locust get away with brief encounters of the weird kind 'cause their little songs are dense brutes or folded-up epics. On Flamingo Honey, Whirlwind Heat have only given us ideas, random thought bubbles full of pickup sticks shaved to points and the notion that this all seemed like a hoot that day in the studio. Opener ""The Bone"" is a warbling ellipsis at the end of Sonic Youth's Sister; ""The Meat Packers"", its noisy neighbor, is just insulting. But then comes ""The H Is O"", and ""A Worm's Coat""-- both steps in the right direction. These build kicky dance-punk rhythms in the style of the moment; Swanson's Moog isn't overbearing, and he almost sounds like Ben Kweller on the latter. There might even be some influence from Flamingo co-producer Brendan Benson. But then they're over. The opposite of a one-joke Saturday Night Live sketch stretched to tedium, Whirlwind Heat tells us something good and takes it back just as quick. Whirlwind Heat's primary influences (Devo, Brainiac) were adept at leaving just the smallest amount of space for melody. The band tries that trick here, building ""Flamingo Lawns"" around a loping vocal and a cool Brad Holland drum beat. But as it's obscured by Moog freakery around the 23-second mark, and a harmonica appears for some reason, the song becomes like an annoying ringtone on the bus. Put that shit on vibrate, Whirlwind Heat! And next time, have enough respect for the listener to make something whole from the fun of ""H Is O"" or ""Lazy Morning""'s bittersweet melody and lonely whisper quality, because right now, it feels like you're coasting on self-congratulatory vapors.","Riding an extremely short-lived wave of hype last year as the first band signed to Jack White's Third Man imprint, Whirlwind Heat's atrocious second album fares no better than their abominable first.

Not Going Anywhere,Keren Ann,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a55e6ef95969320229/1:1/w_160/0f8cf07d.jpg,2004-08-31 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/450-not-going-anywhere/,Blue Note,"Keren Ann Zeidel's new album, Not Going Anywhere, is so dainty it may leave you craving a vat of fries from a corporation toward which the French are notoriously prone to arson. Zeidel isn't French; she's everything but. Living and working in Paris, the singer/songwriter looks as though she devoutly avoids all forms of bad cholesterol. Likewise, the songs on her third album are lean any way you slice 'em, varying from prudently understated to downright malnourished. Yet, Not Going Anywhere brims with spotless pop melodies. The question is whether listeners will grasp such airy, unadorned fare. Zeidel is no chanteuse; rather, she's a chirper, and a beautiful one at that. Her voice lays soft and low over Not Going Anywhere, gently touching down now and then, only to flit off after a few hushed syllables. At times she's frustratingly reticent; over ""Polly""'s spare opening, she warbles when she ought to belt. Other times she's nearly inaudible. But then a certain artlessness is this album's vibe; it's best taken at face value as a comely collection of modest pop songs working nicely within their narrow dynamic confines and exploding with detail upon more careful examinations. While it may be tempting to call this a folk record, its instrumentation is generally too ornate for that genre appellation. Yet the title track (a strong if somewhat misleading opener) is unalloyed save a few coruscating string swells, and that's to Zeidel's benefit. Her voice carries a lone acoustic guitar better than it would a lavish orchestra, and is easily smothered by overzealous production. Hasty, soft-spoken verses on ""Sailor & Widow"" are weighed down by a tepid blues vamp (though the track is salvaged by a massively catchy chorus), while ""Polly"" climaxes with a surfeit of gilt horns and tip-toeing glockenspiel, bearing an otherwise perfectly acceptable song toward kitsch. While Zeidel seems to have abandoned her penchant for pasteurized trip-hop (aping Portishead and Massive Attack at best; at worst, a middling Dido impression) and nodded off toward a more traditional breed of songwriting, Not Going Anywhere deserves no adult-contemporary belittlement. She's too sincere, her stylistic breadth too broad, her songs too emotive and endowed of too long and storied a history to invite that branding. ""Sit in the Sun"" and ""By the Cathedral"" tug at opposing emotions, at once jocund and unsettling. There's also a nagging spirituality to Not Going Anywhere, more secular than devout. Children's choral intonations on ""End of May"" add to the aloof, otherworldly aura. The young throats appear again, accompanied by a mildly stilted harpsichord on ""Right Now and Right Here"", to slightly less moving effect. Still, these songs are thoroughly engrossing, and the world Zeidel bears the listener through is affable and beatific, if occasionally soporific. On ""Seventeen"", she sings, ""Life is a mellow dream, almost unspoken,"" and it somehow resonates beautifully: The song is the album's most somnolent, replete with lulling harp, bleary strings, and soft, almost undetectable wind instrument flourishes. Stay awake if you can, and notice the scrupulous attention to detail that makes Not Going Anywhere such a pleasant listen.","Francophile singer/songwriter Keren Ann's third full-length ranges from prudently understated to downright malnourished.

""Could you be so kind as to perform some pigeon abatement on the front of your residence?"" the landlord notice-like sheet requests. ""Birds [particularly pigeons] and their feces dust are THE main source of the human disease MAC [microbacterium aviary complex]... Walking past your residence, we are forced to not only breathe the excrement dust blowing about, but also be physically bombarded by the pigeons roosting above."" And yet, when good health is perpetually endangered by the mundane, there is cause for celebration. The EP's cover is adorned with Pigeon Funk's construction paper-cut, high school pep rally-stylized logo photographed on a sidewalk splot of pigeon dung. The microhouse aerobics session heard on the record (supposedly inspired by how pigeons ""dance""), also finds bliss while the MAC fever kicks in your head. Pigeon Funk is the side-project of Bay Area laptop-noise stalwarts Kit Clayton, Sutekh and Safety Scissors. ""Dorkcore"" could be the possible definition for their sound: a hybrid of noisecore and coagulated microhouse that typically hits the disco floor and falls down laughing after attempting to dance. Is there an issue of life-threatening intoxication? Possibly, but there's also an odd innocence at play here. It reminds me of how an acquaintance spent 20 minutes telling people how the Empire State Building trumps the Transamerica Pyramid in size at San Francisco's Chinese New Year parade. Pigeon Funk's eponymous debut could serve as dorkcore's Rosetta Stone. The opener, ""Pied-billed Grebe"" awakens that genre with a digital-dub melody spraying forth in the air while bloops and blops scatter like leaves. The Berlin-dub element (reflecting Clayton's solo flotation-tank meditations) reappears elsewhere in the levitating rhythms of ""Opposite of Opossum"", and how ""Anotherp""'s synth gloss paints the evening stars that can be barely seen through the ganja haze. However, Pigeon Funk finds little need to break bread with Jah when the Saturday morning cartoons are on. ""Pigs on Fun"" sets this spirit with rickety toy-synth percussion and an electro-dancehall melody that jabbers with 20 tablespoons of sugar in its mouth. Those same calories fatten ""Fly the Coop"" and its Pokémon-disco piece that spills cheap beer all over the carpet. ""Pom Pomp Po P"" is the most accomplished moment, where contorted house number nearly sounds like a field recording of a financial district-block party with its slickly reverberated beats. True to the oeuvres of Pigeon Funk's members, the minute-detail-per-second ratio is so high that the music demands several listens before noticing every bit of digital detritus. The overall impact may be too busy and demanding for idle club listeners, but there's so little solemnity here that the bewildered needn't be too worried. Here you have the Zappa-esque collage piece ""Pombo Doente"" that superimposes a NPR-dry voice instruction track about injured pigeon rescue techniques over a black market bazaar of FM radio-dial recklessness, nose-blowing, and disco breaks for kindergartners. To rationalize the connection between aviary care and such cacophony would be just a wee bit pretentious, mind you. However, the album's prime weakness is its homogenous, glib emotion that can grow wearisome over the course of 50 minutes. Fortunately, the closer, ""Poule Bossa"" leaves listeners with a moment to take to the heart with a sleepwalking bossa nova tune that walks around the block until it gets falls into an open sewer and ascends through clouds of heavenly distortion toward the after-life. Dorkcore is taking bodies.","Underground electronic artists Kit Clayton, Sutekh and Safety Scissors team up to bring their ""dorkcore"" to the masses.

The Dirty South,Drive-By Truckers,by: Stephen M.

It's four-lane now, but years ago it was only two lanes of blacktop over steep hills and wide curves. Along this road were located both of the county's high schools, about 12 miles apart. Often, before or after school, students would race from one to the other, and several graduating classes were absent at least one student killed along this road. If you were fast enough, you could make it in eight minutes, but it depended on the absence of cops, and you had to have a good car-- like a Corvette, the kind Sheriff Buford Pusser crashed on the same stretch back in 1974, a little over a year after the first biopic of his life, Walking Tall, was released. Before he died, Pusser, a former wrestler, had earned his infamy ridding the county of the State Line Gang, which ran prostitution, drugs, and gambling rings as well as countless backwoods liquor stills. Legend has it that he accomplished this moral purging wielding only an axe handle. A historical placard now marks the spot where his car left the highway. Pusser is part of what Patterson Hood calls ""the Mythological South"" in the liner notes to the Drive-By Truckers' sixth album, the inevitably titled The Dirty South. The band has explored this mythological South on previous albums, most notably their double-disc Southern Rock Opera, and like Buford with his stick, they've busted up the larger-than-life myths of figures like George Wallace and Ronnie Van Zant. Similarly, this album doesn't reify or even demonize the late McNairy County sheriff, but simply demythologizes him. As Hood announces at the beginning of a three-song suite about Pusser's legacy, ""This is the other side of that story."" On ""The Boys from Alabama"" and ""The Buford Stick"", Hood relates the stories of the small-time shiners who lost their stills and their livelihoods to Pusser, who they claim was ""just another crooked lawman."" In between, Mike Cooley sings ""Cottonseed"" in the voice of one of the State Line Gang who feels the burden of having dispatched so many souls to their Maker. Neither Hood nor Cooley takes a side in this rural turf war, but they try to reveal another facet of the story and empathize with the people vilified by Pusser's legend. For the Drive-By Truckers, black-and-white aggrandizement is much less interesting than gray-area truths, and in a sense, The Dirty South rescues the flawed man from the ideal perpetrated by the movies. All of this would be dryly academic if the band's music wasn't so sturdy and solid. As on previous albums, the Drive-By Truckers back their ambitious, word-dense songs with down-and-dirty Southern rock that's direct and bare-boned, yet often explosive. The three songwriters-- Hood, Cooley and Jason Isbell-- are also three rowdy guitar players, and their triple-prong attack instills songs like ""Where the Devil Don't Stay"" and the live staple ""Lookout Mountain"" with a raw intensity. Shonna Tucker, who replaced Earl Hicks on bass, and drummer Brad Morgan form a confident rhythm section, accommodating gritty guitar solos and letting the songs sprawl and stretch in unexpected directions. Though rooted in countless major influences-- from .38 Special to Skynyrd to The Band (as explained on Isbell's ""Danko/Manuel"")-- the Drive-By Truckers' Southern rock always sounds homemade, and like liquor from a still, it's extremely potent. More crucially, they marshal this dynamic not only to tackle the South's icons, but more importantly to construct a sober, solemn view of everyday Southern life, whether through family histories like Hood's ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" or story-songs like Cooley's racecar drama ""Daddy's Cup"". ""Puttin' People on the Moon"" is an Alabama version of Springsteen's ""Atlantic City"" with higher stakes: Instead of escaping on that cross-city bus, the narrator loses his wife and friends to cancer (presumably from NASA testing) and lives out his life in inescapable drudgery, dealing drugs out his front door. Isbell's starkly devastating closer ""Goddamn Lonely Love"" recounts the torture of a long-distance relationship; although this is only his second album as a Trucker, already he can hold his own with his seniors. Granted, The Dirty South doesn't play on the band's brash humor like Alabama Ass Whuppin' or Pizza Deliverance, and it isn't nearly as personal an album as last year's Decoration Day: There are only one or two songs about the band members' own exploits and tragedies, so at times it lacks its predecessors' unshakable urgency and tough-mindedness. On the other hand, aside from the Pusser suite in the middle, The Dirty South is more consistent and cohesive song-for-song, its wide scope more public than personal. Rummaging through the iconography of the South, the Drive-By Truckers distill Southern Rock Opera's myth-breaking and combine it with Decoration Day's family photo album, and the result is a uniquely regional morality. All of these people-- from legends like Sam Phillips (""the only man Jerry Lee would still call sir"") to family like Hood's grandfather (""He believed in God and country, things was just that way"")-- are points on a compass of good and evil, strong and weak, outraged and complacent, through which the Drive-By Truckers are seeking a true north. Despite the recent resurgence of Southern rock, this quest for a populist sense of Southern identity-- as it applies to a community and not just to a woman or the rest of the band-- seems rare these days. It's not just self-aware regionalism or Southern-by-the-grace-of-God cockiness, but something deeper: On these 14 songs, the Drive-By Truckers find the connections between these larger-than-life figures and the life-size experiences that shaped them. For them, the South is a stretch of highway where many have died, an ordinary place made extraordinary by human tragedies. The Dirty South is their homemade roadside memorial.","Latest full-length from the Southern rock revival's flagship band attempts to demythologize some of the American South's best-known figures.

Cathedral,Castanets,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a714b1335d7bf1698f90/1:1/w_160/9366db1b.jpg,2004-08-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1774-cathedral/,Asthmatic Kitty,"In 1975, the Irish poet Seamus Heaney published a small collection of verse, aptly titled ""Bog Poems"". Heavily nuanced and intensely personal, the book carefully contemplates the bizarre recovery of 2000-year old human bodies-- preserved with horrifying perfection-- from Denmark's massive bogs. Unsurprisingly, Heaney had written about these bogs before, often cataloguing the stalled, ancient objects that had been dug up, wholly unchanged, from their weird, sludgy depths. San Diego's Castanets, whose non-CDR debut has just been released by the Asthmatic Kitty imprint, express a similar fascination with swamp-culture, and the contemporary repercussions of age-old traditions. Nodding briefly to Six Organs of Admittance and the No-Neck Blues Band, the band leers large at American country's longstanding definitions: For Castanets, country music should sound like death, and more specifically, death-by-murky-submersion. Frontman Raymond Raposa moos his deep gothic ballads like he's dog-paddling backwards through big Florida swamps, banging his knees on knobby cypress roots, ruffling pools of duckweed and featherfoil, desperately digging Spanish moss out from his nostrils, battling hard for buoyancy. The process is slow, the water explicitly thick and unapologetically sinister, easing a dim, wet descent into Earth's impenetrable goo. But the bits Raposa brings back-- quivering promises, deadpan defeats-- are, like Heaney's un-antiquated artifacts, startlingly real. With the help of his bandmates, Raposa's hollow, boxy vocals are set against spare funeral dirges (""Cathedral 2""), stompy guitar throwdowns (""Industry and Snow"", the outstanding ""Three Days, Four Nights""), and planes of free-folk ping (""You Are the Blood""). Still, Raposa's candlelit pipes are inevitably centered, shaking with loneliness and dread-- even guest vocalists Brigit DeCook and Liz Janes' murmurs and screams sound like they're coming from another room, their pale shouts muffled and heavy with desperation, chasing Raposa's grief. Raposa does manage to pack in a few chances for air: ""As You Do"" takes a more traditional stab at classic, Americana-fed melancholy, with warbling slide guitar, sweet acoustic strums, and gentle percussion. Consequently, ""As You Do"" transforms into a gentle, rolling lament, more wheat fields than swamp scum. Closer ""Cathedral 4 (The Unbreaking Branch and Song)"" is fed by a sparkling backbeat and cute guitar noodles-- clocking in at just under 2\xBD minutes, it's a fleeting glimpse of solid land. Raposa is reportedly working on a novel that will expound on the themes of Cathedral, and such literary aspirations aren't particularly surprising, given then poetic weight of the record, which nobly grapples with issues of faith, death, splitting synapses, eating breakfast, spirits, and landscapes. And, like any good book, Cathedral the album is best suited to awkward late-night consumption, to be devoured while hiding under the sheets, clutching a flashlight, breathing heavy and deep.","Evoking everything from prime Black Heart Procession and Will Oldham to The Decemberists, vintage Luna and Phil Ochs, San Diego-based Castanets' murky, swamp-funeral laments are garnering acclaim from all sides: Sufjan Stevens sang their praises in his Pitchfork interview, while members of Pinback, Rocket from the Crypt, Tristeza, and Black Heart Procession have lent their talents to the band's aching creak and pop.

Young Forever,Aberfeldy,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299f545e6ef9596931fe14/1:1/w_160/ef18bc23.jpg,2004-08-30 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1-young-forever/,Rough Trade,"Aberfeldy recorded their debut, Young Forever, using a single microphone. Good for them. In that spirit, I'll cut short my obligatory introduction and bring you straight to the Edinburgh group's lovelorn, unfortunately still-beating heart, exposed by the oh-so-unadorned production: ""Love is a verb and a noun as well
You find it in the dictionary under 'L'"" That little witticism comes from ""Love Is an Arrow"", written and sung by Riley Briggs. Based on one photo, Briggs looks like a young Anthony Michael Hall, though his vocals chart a fairly standard indie course, borrowing from Neil Young (""A Friend Like You""), Ben Gibbard (""What You Do"") and plain-spoken sensitive guys everywhere. Listen, some of my best friends are plain-spoken sensitive guys. Some of my favorite albums consist of campfire singalongs by bands with modest acoustic guitar chops, cute names and still-cuter accents. But those lyrics! No band that would sing such words deserves the easily made comparisons to fellow Scots Belle & Sebastian or even Camera Obscura, let alone those earnest Aussies, The Lucksmiths. (Compare them to twee progenitors like The Pastels or Talulah Gosh and you owe me your cardigan.) Of course, with a moniker nipped from a Scottish vacation destination, Aberfeldy practically beg for such name-dropping. But there's no need to encourage them. Throughout the record, Briggs shows a predisposition toward bungling the old English teachers' motto: show, not tell. This may be the result of a medical condition, like dyslexia, in which case we should hold our snark. Still, it seems like this guy can't open his mouth without saying nothing. ""So sad you're leaving,"" he sings on ""Out of Love""; ""I'm so lonely now she's gone,"" he adds on ""Tie One On"", which teems with such vivid storytelling. He goes on to rhyme ""sacred"" with ""wasted"" and ""reasons"" with ""leaving"" until somewhere the editor of a rhyming dictionary loses her job. As is so often the case, Aberfeldy are at their best when they stumble beyond trite infantilism. First single ""Vegetarian Restaurant"" lopes along with winning ""Tangled Up in Blue"" guitar strums, accented with subtle fiddles and lovely boy/girl harmonies. What Briggs is seemingly aiming at on the album is a cheerful, unpretentious look at the everyday; here, he finally makes the everyday interesting. ""I like the way that you dance when you're in the kitchen,"" he says, and I'm willing to see where the dance takes him. Then he proclaims, ""Sometimes I can't believe you're even human,"" and I duck for cover. Speaking of aliens, ""Heliopolis by Night"" is the record's next-strongest track (and incidentally, its second single), a whimsical spaceship song complete with nose-held vocals. It's not perfect, but it's unique. So yeah, Young Forever was recorded on one microphone. And yeah, that means the warm acoustic pop heats up my headphones like a veritable heliopolis. I can't help but root for an album that begins ""I love everyone,"" because the last thing the indie world needs is another batch of sullen, well-dressed scenesters. Yet, as in any relationship, just because you love someone doesn't mean they'll love you back. ""There is nothing in the world as beautiful as you,"" Gibbs tells us in a tender moment. He probably means it. Good for him. Even if he doesn't, I hope it gets him laid.","Debut from these newcomers to the Rough Trade label have just won NME's Single of the Week.

The Revolution Starts... Now,Steve Earle,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbdfabf31b7dc7155bba/1:1/w_160/27b4c3f6.jpg,2004-08-30 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2650-the-revolution-starts-now/,Artemis,"Hey, Steve, when does the revolution start? The title of Steve Earle's 12th album, silly as it is, could be seen as a nudge against Earle's previous release, the controversy magnet Jerusalem. His highest-profile record in ages, if not his highest-selling, it contained the O'Reilly-baiting ""John Walker's Blues"", an explication of the American Taliban's motives that was vilified for having the audacity to humanize the enemy, which Fox pundits and Nashville DJs saw as matter-of-factly treasonous. There's little on The Revolution Starts... Now that's likely to ruffle as many feathers as that song-- i.e., nothing quite so revolutionary-- although two early tracks try their damnedest. ""Rich Man's War"" draws similarities between an American soldier named Jimmy and an Iraqi insurgent named Ali, both of whom Earle describes as ""just another poor boy off to fight a rich man's war."" Anyone with an American flag license plate holder is going to find parallels like these at least disagreeable and at most offensive (although Earle may have a better chance of reaching swing listeners than many dissenting acts). Like ""John Walker's Blues"","" the song works hard to make both Jimmy and Ali seem sympathetic, and while the effort is laudable, the result is less than compelling. Faring far worse, both politically and artistically, is ""Warrior"", a spoken-word song full of purple-prose lyrics along the lines of, ""Your faithful retainer stands resolute/ To serve his liege lord without recompense/ Perchance to fall and perish namelessly."" Rather than being merely unrevolutionary, it sounds more like an embarrassment. It doesn't help that the song is sandwiched by a forgettable trucker anthem (""Home to Houston"") and a story-song (""The Gringo's Tale"") that takes forever to set up and then falls apart with a disappointing anticlimax that sounds as calculated as a stump speech. Ironic considering its title, The Revolution Starts... Now is halfway over before it picks up with the one-two punch of ""Condi Condi"" and ""F the CC"". The latter rocks the album's catchiest shout-out and is stage-ready for an audience pumping fists and singing along with, ""Fuck the FCC/ Fuck the CIA/ Fuck the FBI/ Living in the motherfuckin' USA."" As it finally breaks down into a Ramones-style spellalong, the song becomes the most righteously defiant track on the entire album. Earle sings ""Condi Condi"", a tongue-in-cheek-and-in-other-places ode to our current national security adviser, with Daily Show-esque straight-faced aplomb, and it should have fans lowering their pumping fists to cover their mouths as they chuckle over lines like, ""Skank for me, Condi."" While neither is as outright hilarious as Eric Idle's ""FCC Song"", both songs are a much-needed laugh amid all this election-year seriousness, and like a tent pole, they prop up an otherwise sagging album. ""Comin' Around"", a duet with Emmylou Harris, and ""I Thought You Should Know"" rein in the politics in favor of more personal matters. While the songs may seem out of place on an album bearing this title, Earle lets them remind his listeners-- as if they need reminding-- that life continues during wartime, more or less the same as before. Heartache and happiness, dread and disappointment aren't exclusive to political anxiety, and these songs make the album sound less like a manifesto than a document of a year spent watching the dead-heat elections and going about your business. Good as some of these songs are-- and the entire album is better than Nicholson Baker's similarly anti-war novel Checkpoint-- they're not quite enough to foment a revolution, and Earle closes the album with a lengthy reprise of the title track, which creates a bookend effect without actually building to anything specific. He's always been a deeply political musician, a radical in a genre whose stock-in-trade these days seems to be tradition. His ideology informs just about all of his albums to some degree, but politics as an overt subject may not be his forte, as The Revolution attests.","Though not as politically riling as his notorious Jerusalem, Steve Earle's latest album tries hard to be, with songs about sexing Condi Rice, and others that draw parallels between American and Iraqi soldiers.

Take live hip-hop, for example. Though no group has stepped into mainstream success like The Roots, several smaller acts across the country-- S.F.'s Variable Unit, the Twin Cities' Heiruspecs, the Breakestra out of L.A.-- have actually brought new elements to the form and elevated its standards. But they're the exception: Truth is, most rhythm sections lack the heavyweight punch to contend with an 808's bionic beats, and jammy arrangements can give too much slack to hip-hop's streamlined urgency. Without inspired songcraft and a novel approach, even the best MC will get swept out to a sea of watered-down funk. With their second LP, Oakland's Crown City Rockers bring a surprisingly fresh, well-rounded sound that reiterates just how good live hip-hop can be when done right. Without copping a single note, they give a nod to The Roots' Do You Want More?!!!??! days, easily tempering organic, jazzy dynamics with concrete beats and streetwise production. Rather than taking the classic Illadelph bebop approach, Earthtones looks to the mid-70s soul-jazz of Donald Byrd and Lonnie Liston Smith for inspiration. Most prominent are the textured keyboards of Kat Ouano, applied equally with ballsy aggression for a banging club feel (""Fortitude"") and deft understatement for smoother meditations (""Fate"", ""No Sense""). By balancing keys, bass, drums, and dense, MPC-generated breaks, producers Headnotic and Woodstock arrive at a flawless balance of instrumental spontaneity and programmed precision. But the real star here is MC Rashaan Ahmad. In the few years that Crown City Rockers have existed, they've undergone a name change, lost a key member, and released an underdeveloped debut album. Ahmad has clearly evolved with the band, working through adversity, sharpening his skills, and shaping his on-the-mike persona. With Earthtones he emerges as one of the West Coast's premiere MCs, his flow effortless and vocabulary expansive. He brings an everyman context to his rhymes, making the mundane dramatic with a subtle righteousness and around-the-way likability. He comes downright heroic on ""Another Day"", the album's first single, rapping, ""Rhyme writing, pressure's on/ I wanna move to the desert, play guitar songs/ Wanna move away from the city, crime and fear/ But I know the world needs me here."" ""Heat"" lives up to its name, Ahmad's scathing delivery hammering over a heavy breakbeat workout and a flurry of horns and Superfly-style strings. On an album full of well-considered positivity, only the haterrific ""Simple"", stands out as a misstep-- its sultry vocal sample and languid SoCat beat aren't quite up to the task of salvaging its bratty content. That, however, is just carping-- there isn't much to not like here. With this one exception, the album stays on track start to finish, peppering Ahmad's verbal calisthenics with occasional instrumental workouts that make for an absorbing ebb and flow. Combining ingredients as natural as they are effective, Earthtones is a great example of hard work made to look easy.","Recalling The Roots in their prime, this Oakland-based collective reiterates just how good live hip-hop can be when done right.

Chewing Glass & Other Miracle Cures,Sixtoo,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a681c0084474cd0c09a6/1:1/w_160/190bbed2.jpg,2004-08-30 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7777-chewing-glass-other-miracle-cures/,Ninja Tune,"If the name of electronica's game in 2004 is acoustic proficiency, Robert Squire, better known as Sixtoo, may be a leading contender for Rookie of the Year. Granted, the Canadian artist has a few releases under his belt, but Chewing Glass & Other Miracle Cures represents a marked departure from Sixtoo's underground hip-hop roots and, in effect, serves as an ideal (re)introduction to one of Ninja Tune's most promising new additions. Where Sixtoo differs from so many artists that beg a quick glance in the DJ Shadow Thesaurus is his newfound reliance on live instrumentation. Squire has humbly described this album as a ""learning experience"" in the arrangement of live instruments, but tracks like the three-part ""Boxcutter Emporium"" suite, each deliberate and subtly constructed amalgams of abstract electronic flourishes and live drum and bass accompaniment, demonstrate an emerging mastery of dark trip-hop composition. Recent touchstones include tourmates Blockhead and DJ Signify, whose collaborations with Sage Francis and Buck 65 are echoed in Sixtoo's few MC appearances. On ""Funny Sticks (Reprise)""-- a spare rendition of the original ""Funny Sticks"" from 2001's Antagonist Survival Kit-- and ""Horse Drawn Carriage"", Sixtoo exhibits an awareness of his limitations as a rapper, and channels all of his energies as a lyricist into these limited appearances on the mic. ""Sticks"" is an enraged expression of class unrest, and ""Carriage"", rapped in Buck 65's style of broken poetry, is an abstract exploration of guilt and vanity. Sixtoo doesn't quite equal the skills of his former Anticon collaborators, but these tracks provide an adequate bridge between his intricate acoustic compositions and former hip-hop gloom. Contributions from Godspeed You! Black Emperor cellist Norsola Johnson and bassist Thierry Amar blend seamlessly with Sixtoo's arrangements; Johnson's somber cello accompaniment is a standout on ""Snake Bite"", an ominous slow jam steeped in buzzing lo-fi distortion. Eric Craven from The Hanged Up and Matt Kelly provide further support on drums and keyboard/guitar, respectively, and actually outshine their GYBE! contemporaries on a few occasions. Kelly's effects and overdubs on Rhodes and Stylophone (a creepy-sounding little organ that's currently my favorite instrument of all time) on the sublime ""Old Days Architecture"" constitute an album highlight, while Craven's live drumming flawlessly fuses with Sixtoo's frenetic electronic beats. The real scene-stealer, though, is Can's Damo Suzuki, whose improvised vocals on ""Storm Clouds & Silver Linings"" propel the album's most disorienting and defining track. Backward tape manipulation shapes and fractures a frantic looped breakbeat, which spits and stutters behind Suzuki's vocals, and a slithering, nearly amorphous bassline and piercing guitar stabs further elevate the song's nightmarish qualities. About midway through the track, Suzuki drops his hushed whispers and off-tune singing for a bizarre, throaty intonation that suggests some kind of perverse Louis Armstrong/Yamatsuka Eye hybrid. The album's only significant fault is an overabundance of B-material and filler, which creates a distinct lag in the album's middle section. ""Transient Control"" and ""Chainsaw Buffet"" suffer from an overextension of vaguely intriguing but repetitive musical ideas, and tracks like ""The Honesty of Constant Human Error"" fall prey to atypically aimless jamming. The album's filler is made all the more conspicuous by Sixtoo's admittance in his liner notes that this style of composition is ""risky"" and can often sound ""weak."" On future releases, he would do well to take his own apprehension to meandering improvisation closer to heart. Fortunately, Sixtoo is as confident in his composing abilities as he is aware of his weaknesses, and this can certainly be considered his watershed album. Where so many electronic artists demonstrate their ""legitimate"" acoustic abilities with the insistence of a neglected studio musician, Sixtoo's development as live musician and composer comes across as natural and well-suited to his talents. In the morass of this year's more indulgent statements of acoustic aptitude, Chewing Glass & Other Miracle Cures stands out as an admirably genuine fusion of acoustic composition with the sensibilities of electronic music.","Sixtoo's latest electro/acoustic full-length represents a marked departure from his underground hip-hop roots and serves as an ideal (re)introduction to one of the Ninja Tune label's most promising new additions.

The Libertines,The Libertines,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfac0084474cd0c2bd4/1:1/w_160/eb027822.jpg,2004-08-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4771-the-libertines/,Rough Trade,"Call this grossly irresponsible if you must, but short of dying in a plane crash, nothing says ""rock star"" quite like a public drug freakout. I'm not saying drugs are right for everybody-- kids, stay away from crack unless you think you've got a pretty good shot at getting famous-- but through the years, drug addiction has consistently remained the ultimate in-style rockcessory of all fashion's fickle vicissitudes. For the layperson, addiction may be a tragic, often painful disease; for rock stars, it's simply bolsters ""mystique."" Alright, I'm teasing, you got me. Addiction is pretty terrific for everyone. Nevertheless, plenty has been made of Libertines frontman Pete Doherty's battle with crack, and I was fully prepared to not say another word-- right up until I realized that The Libertines' self-titled follow-up to 2002's Up the Bracket was indeed all about them and the interior struggles caused by Doherty's very public addiction. It's all a glitzy mess with a fair share less charm than the debut, and whether The Libertines is a wreck by design, or simply reflects the still-fractured state of the band in recovery, no one can say. All that's clear is that, once again, in the fishbowl of celebrity, addiction is being spun into a PR coup, a thing to be pitied, laughed at, cried at, forgiven, and ultimately used as just another excuse-- mostly for why this isn't a better album. The woes of drug use arise here at intervals, concluding with the romantic lament, ""What became of the likely lads?/ What became of the dreams they had?"" They signed with Sanctuary and released a slapdash second album; are you guys kidding me? Considering the great heights this album occasionally reaches, it's a bit of a left-handed compliment to level the lone criticism that it seems hopelessly tossed-off. It's brilliant at points, exhibiting the casual, grimy grace that laced Up the Bracket through English countryside benders, sing-alongs, and pub anthems, but evidently, The Libertines are creatures of excess, and even a good thing can be overdone. Bands pull off ""accidental genius"" with more frequency than anyone has a right to expect-- Pavement founded an empire based on it-- but even if The Libertines are more hits than misses here, it still takes a little more than slurred speech and sloppy guitars to drive this act home. Instead of lending the skiffling, slightly skewed rhythms a special air of irreverence, or making the occasionally off-key barbershop caterwaul sound a little sweeter, as on Up the Bracket, The Libertines' half-assed effort here produces half-assed results. Insouciance paid dividends for them in 2002 as they thumbed their noses at rock, dub, folk, and every other genre in arm's reach, but if you can possibly imagine it, that shambling style-blender was actually tighter then, both in terms of songwriting and cohesiveness. The only issue here is one of investment (or possibly a calculated lack thereof), since little seems to have outwardly changed, except perhaps Doherty's singing. To his credit, his vocal resemblance to Julian Casablancas is downplayed, as he instead opts to rely on his considerable natural vocal character over needless imitation, but with that, so goes the one polished instrument The Libertines had at their disposal. Carl Barât still has a stranglehold on Joe Strummer's uber-Cockney accent, and puts it to good use in the rowdy, fuck-all fashion that's expected, if sometimes too effectively (see: the staggering, raucously incoherent rant of ""Don't Be Shy""); but when Doherty goes on to slosh his own path through the impossibly English ""Narcissist"" (""Wouldn't it be nice to be Dorian Gray/ Just for a day?""-- that's Oscar Freakin' Wilde, folks), the vocal contrast between the two becomes conspicuous in its absence. But what the hell, even ""Narcissist"" is still a riot. The worst that can ever be said of this album is that if it suffers from an excess of half-formed ideas, or a lack of effort (even if a little extra elbow grease could've made some otherwise marginal songs much, much better), it's because they're too busy having fun, asshole. The one thing The Libertines excel at without qualification is pure entertainment; they may not be masters of any of the styles they crazily flirt with, or even possibly talented enough to produce the craftsmanship this album begs for at points, but they string genres together so readily and wildly that it's tempting to allow one's self to be swept away in barrage and just have a great time in the face of other shortcomings. You're just lucky that someone was diligent enough to resist all the fun this album promises and point them out for you; if not, you might hear the quiet call-and-response of ""Can't Stand Me Now"" or the infectious groove-stomp of ""Campaign of Hate"" or any of the myriad other relentlessly enjoyable moments on this album and forget that The Libertines aren't trying very hard. Boo. Okay, you caught me, I'm kidding; The Libertines is a charge. But it does still seem unfortunate that The Libertines don't more frequently reach the heights at which their music frequently hints here: The echoing chords and free-form trumpet of the sprawling sea shanty ""The Man Who Would Be King"" best exemplify The Libertines' lack of stylistic allegiance. Barely more than a string of ""la-la-la""'s and a chorus, the lightning riffs and hollow, dramatic spaces still kick sand in the faces of the rest of the album cuts. The song is outdone only by the incomparable solo on ""The Ha Ha Wall""-- indescribably brief, bright, evocative, and maybe the single finest moment The Libertines will ever lay to tape-- and ""Music When the Lights Go Out"", a genuinely sad, sweet tune with lots of cowbell and a chorus of earth-shaking majesty. These tracks show what might've been. Instead, The Libertines settle for less because demanding more would've been harder. And lest we forget why this album was a necessary casualty, the obvious (and crass) snorting that opens ""Last Post on the Bugle"" is an unnecessary hint. Cocaine, crack, whatever-- whether their self-titled second album is a wreck on purpose or not, drugs are The Libertines' reason, and it's not a very good one.","Following the massive UK success of their 2002 debut, Up the Bracket, Clash-fearing rockers The Libertines crashed and burned: Frontman ...

Yet, despite the cultural roles of artists as spiritual alchemists and conduits to where all of our trials and errors are given spectacular treatments and endearing portraits, we balk when they appear to have indulged themselves. Why is this? I understand that indulgence is supposed to be a sin, a crime against humanity and nature, but artists are among the very few whose responsibility for discovery supercedes an obligation to personal restraint. After all, don't they usually pay for this by existing in a perpetually tortured state?

And then there's Björk. She seems pretty indulgent, and despite the enigmatic, moderately antisocial persona, I've never quite understood why I called her an artist. As artistic qualifiers go, eccentricity is beyond superficial; it's downright misleading in most cases, and no matter the number of interesting musical concepts with which she aligns herself, I always figured ""real"" artists had to deliver a few concrete answers now and then. Answers, if not about my world, then about Björk's. I watched her sing ""Oceania"" (the first single from Medulla, though don’t try buying it, it's not for sale-- the artist strikes again!) at the Olympics, and it occurred to me that beyond the usual promotional gears at work, somebody must really feel she's important. They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyonce-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman. On aesthetic grounds, I can't argue with their choice, but I continue to wonder about Björk's significance. Medulla suggests that if she is artistically important-- and I should preface all of this by stating I don't normally evaluate music or musicians based on my perception of their ""importance""; Björk simply makes it difficult to do otherwise-- it's as a small scale model of the same individualist, mundane obsessions that dominate popular culture. Just as television networks bank on our interest in reality, Björk's emotional impact seems dependent on one's fascination with her. Medulla (her fifth album, and first since 2001's imperfect, introspective Vespertine) presents no set of ideas more compelling than those concerning its creator, her whims and impressions. That it's her a cappella record is just an interesting bonus, as it's no more or less ""her"" than any of her records. Ironically, the sound of Björk ""getting to the essence"" of herself is more dependent on outside musicians than usual. In addition to producing collaborators Mark Bell, Matmos and Mark ""Spike"" Stent, Björk enlists the vocal talents of The Roots' Rahzel, Japanese beat-boxing wonder Dokaka, American freak-patron Mike Patton and English progressive pop icon Robert Wyatt, among others. Medulla is the result of concentrated efforts on behalf of the best and brightest Björk could round up, and in the spirit of her symbolic godfather Miles Davis, betrays her knack for using talent to her best advantage. Use of the human voice on this album will get the headlines, but the bulk of the story is rote Björk. That said, Medulla is her most musically adventurous record since Post. ""Where Is the Line?"", featuring Patton's growl, an eerie choral arrangement and ingenious, jackhammer rhythm track powered by Rahzel and edited by Bell. Björk's melody doesn't seem particularly interesting until you try to follow along amidst the cut-up beats and falling, wailing choral voices. The machine-gun-precise percussive hits, accentuated by Patton's bullfrog squelch, hit harder than anything she's done since ""Army of Me"". ""Pleasure Is All Mine"" begins as seductive, wordless call and panting, before melting into lush, gorgeously arranged harmonies and Björk's dream-noir melody. She uses Patton's lower register to flesh out the arrangement, and her own singing is as powerfully resonant as anything I've heard from her. Throughout the album, Björk's commitment to bringing out the strength of her melodies, despite considerable opportunity to get lost in the wall of sound, is admirable and the mark of someone who understands the importance of serving her songs. ""Oceania"" has been marketed as the ""radio single,"" though with its bizarre, swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples, is hardly the most obvious choice to sell Medulla. I'd have chosen the considerably more upbeat ""Who Is It"", which reminds me of ""Alarm Call"" from Homogenic in the way it applies Björk's idiosyncratic performances to a traditionally pleasant sounding template-- though ""Who Is It"" features a much more interesting chord progression during the verses, and an altogether incredible rhythm track, again provided by Rahzel. The only other song on the record that might conceivably work on the radio (sans remix) is the house-y closer ""Triumph of a Heart"", featuring Dokaka's mouth percussion. The more atmospheric songs on Medulla are arguably its most evocative and powerful. ""Vokuro"" (or ""Vigil"") is one of two songs sung in Björk's native Icelandic, and is in fact an adaptation of a piano piece by Jorunn Vidar. Björk sings its plaintive strains accompanied by a solemn choir, and brings out its inherently hymn-like qualities. Wyatt overwhelms ""Submarine"" with his ghostly, striking vocals, thickly layered and overdubbed. Björk doesn't even enter with the melody for almost a minute-and-a-half, by which time Wyatt has already made his redoubtable mark. Not to be outdone, Björk's collage of sighs, whispers, cries and otherwise indescribable sounds on ""Ancestors"" might scare fans accustomed to a steady diet of actual songs. It reminds me of the work of American experimental vocalist and composer Meredith Monk (Björk has performed her ""Gotham Lullaby"" in concert several times), though some folks may just hear it as the ""unlistenable"" song on Medulla. Medulla is an interesting record. It continues Björk's run of releases that sound nothing like their predecessors, yet is, as ever, particular to her. Furthermore, she's found a way to bathe her immediately distinctive melodies and vocal nuances in a solutions that cause me to reevaluate her voice and her craft. I shouldn't be surprised: She's made a career of making me interested in her world of sound. And that she doesn't appear to be short on ideas 25 years into her professional career should end all speculation. ","Björk's fifth post-Sugarcubes solo studio album is constructed almost entirely from vocals, including multitracked voices (courtesy Björk herself, Mike Patton, and singer/songwriter Robert Wyatt), plenty of beatboxing (from Rahzel and Dokaka), and various other mouth-sounds. It's an outrageous conceit from Iceland's most notorious experimental export, and a huge risk for her career after the relatively conventional, diehard-pleasing Vespertine.

The Lost Riots,Hope of the States,by: Natalie Moore,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c163eb335119a49ed55c/1:1/w_160/e7b8def3.jpg,2004-08-29 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3990-the-lost-riots/,Sony,"The lone figure of a long-dead fascist dictator flutters to the ground, eyes burning out death rays, mouth moving maniacally. The skyline of the city behind is aflame as hordes of victims and refugees of the last days of capitalism mill and surge to escape some unknown terror. Suddenly, a great leader, our savior, morphs into a giant bald eagle, snapping and chewing as he devours his supplicants in snatches. The sky darkens. And then a vacuous-looking man slides into view, mouthing along to some utterly benign, meaningless and clumsy lyrics. This is no ""vision""-- it's just another stupid music video for another stupid band. Watching MTV these days sort of gives you the feeling that some bands are trying way too hard. One of those bands is Hope of the States, who have received rapturous press in the UK, with critics rolling out heavy names as reference points-- Godspeed! You Black Emperor, Radiohead, Mogwai, Manic Street Preachers. Oh, and Muse, which seems appropriate because Hope of the States make big-budget music mostly in that vein. These are summer-blockbuster songs, overdriven and overproduced simply because they can be, with little-to-no actual substance behind the heavy-effects bluescreen. Hope of the States waste no time getting to the point on The Lost Riots, their musical ID4: The opening instrumental ""The Black Amnesias"" begins with a solitary, maudlin, plucked guitar line and escalates slowly, pausing dramatically here and there until it explodes into an immense epic rock-opera piece, complete with wailing violins and high-diving crescendos. It is exquisitely horrible. The Lost Riots, like the aforementioned music video, plays on terrifying, portentous imagery throughout. Ruins and riots and fires and chaos are littered and strewn across the songs. An ever-present shadowy enemy seems to straddle the mess, but even when picking through the concrete debris and digging for scraps below the surface, the clues and signs crumble away in your fingers. It's impossible to determine whom Hope of the States are railing against: George Bush and the U.S.? The West in general? Capitalism? But I guess it's important that they're pissed off about something. Yeah. It's important to have fire. It gives you something to write an album about. But after removing the immense weight of the music, there's an emptiness to the songs at their core. And strangely, singer Sam Herlihy admits as much when he claims on ""Me Ves y Sufres"" that, ""I used to think I had something to say/ But my dumb ideologies gave me away."" Nonetheless, The Lost Riots contains a few impressive moments. Single ""The Red the White the Black the Blue"" is an abrasive rallying cry backed with spiraling pianos and Godspeed guitars. ""Black Dollar Bills"" is even better, meshing a soft piano lullaby with a total post-rock meltdown. But these two passable tracks can't forgive the rest of the whole, on which Hope of the States are merely shadowboxing. Until they focus more accurately on their targets, this band's moments of greatness will be fleeting, weighted down and muffled by the roar of empty noise-- a B-52, payload spent.","Having inexplicably garnered comparisons to Godspeed You Black Emperor! in their native UK, these vaguely political atmospheric rockers are much more easily likened to Muse.

Magic Wand,Little Wings,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2ceb335119a49ece09/1:1/w_160/384b3ba7.jpg,2004-08-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4818-magic-wand/,K,"Like many of K Records' recent releases, Little Wings' sixth album, Magic Wand, brings to mind the common image of the label's entire roster uniting around a bonfire, or heading out for some kind of musical picnic, with a four-track recorder along to capture the event. By now, these types of releases are expected several times a year from the label, with one caveat: The communal nature of these all-for-one projects consistently traps too many ideas in too tight a space. Though certain K artists have been able to combine each member's contributions into a cohesive, visionary whole (The Microphones, Yume Bitsu), most have been unable to straddle the line between preserving tight-knit relationships with fellow ""family"" members and creating a piece of work that stands alone. And while Kyle Field fares better than most on his sixth album as Little Wings, the K aesthetic still detracts. At their heart, these youthful folk songs are spare and gentle, but frequently, multiple instruments are stacked atop them, and their clamor cuts into the songs' simplistic intentions. ""Sing Wide"", for example, lopes along a static-laced bassline and stark acoustic guitar part before the sound of shaky, lunatic-fringe background voices overrides its jailed boom and distracts from the track's aspiring message. Elsewhere, ""Uncle Kyle Says"" fails in its attempt at bemused charm and winds up corny and unhinged. Limber with Field's sandman lessons to his nieces and nephews, its overwrought cuteness has the effect of studio downtime committed to tape. All ramshackle frolic and are-we-rolling spontaneity, the song breaks apart the restful ease of the songs placed around it. You can practically hear the K collective urging Field to leave it on the album, half-lark and misplaced signifier. Yet, when Field manages to sneak off into the woods and shed himself of his labelmates, his basic folk arrangements rival the best of field-bedded acts like Iron & Wine and Vetiver. Opener ""Everybody"" could smooth the scar tissue of the most hardened cynic; its campfire acoustic guitars crackle under Field's voice, easing listeners into the album with its clean, immediate warmth. ""So What?"" is a lonely piano ballad dissolving at the seams. Sagging with melancholy and spitfire remorse, it continually threatens to fall apart, and acts as a breather at the album's midpoint. Closer ""Darkened Car"" circles back to the album's hymnal beginnings. Recorded in a hushed, closeted space, Field strips the song bare to acoustic guitar and one background voice. The ideal endpoint for an album so reliant on evanescence, it's almost a shame there's audible evidence of this recording. Could they only have faded into the empty walls and spider-cracked windows of a foreclosed house, Field's wistful lines, ""In a darkened car, you're only who you say you are,"" might have found symbiotic expression. With August at full burn, the summer melds into Magic Wand's sunstroke imagery, and its shaded daydream descends to its obvious birthing, issued from stankheat and cicada cries. So, yes, Magic Wand works in favor of summer daze and sweaty distractions. Still, I'll be damned if that's not Dijon on my pant-leg, and we all know how pesky mustard stains can be.","With two prominent and impressive appearances on Devendra Banhart's acclaimed Golden Apples of the Sun comp, hopes are high for this K Records troubadour's new full-length.

Bubblegum,Mark Lanegan,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9eeb335119a49eccdc/1:1/w_160/f6f968c0.gif,2004-08-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4679-bubblegum-with-mark-lanegan-band/,Beggars Banquet,"That Charles Bukowski has been dead for over 10 years now is almost hard to believe-- partially because he's had more posthumous work hit the shelves than anybody this side of Tupac, but more so because of the enormous influence he continues to exert over contemporary poets and lyricists. I think it's safe to speculate that former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan has spent his share of time on a barstool, between the pages of the Black Sparrow Press. But Lanegan is no Chinaski-come-lately, and he's got the voice to prove it. As scratchy as a three-day beard yet as supple and pliable as moccasin leather, Lanegan's voice has evolved into a remarkable instrument, one that couldn't have been earned by easy living. It's a voice that redeems him a lot of sins, which is fortuitous because on Bubblegum his songs weave precariously between heartfelt depictions of the seedy life and hardboiled cliche. On previous solo albums, like 1998's Scraps at Midnight or 2001's masterful Field Songs, Lanegan explored various pre-rock forms like blues, gospel and country to mesmerizing effect. But his recent cameo with Queens of the Stone Age seems to have revived his tooth for the harder stuff, so with the help of guests like Greg Dulli, Dean Ween, Stone Agers Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri, and, yes, Izzy friggin' Stradlin, Bubblegum features a partial return to Lanegan's grungier days of yore. The seamy din generated by this revolving ensemble provides a well-matched backdrop for the relentless parade of petty violence, drug deals gone sour, and squalid love affairs portrayed in these songs. That's not to say that the whole thing comes off perfectly. Noisier tracks like ""Can't Come Down"" or the clanking ""Methamphetamine Blues"" sound undigested and vaguely dated-- almost as though they were written for Girls Against Boys' FreakOnIca album, which is about as succinct a definition of ""misfire"" as you could want. ""Methamphetamine Blues"" is particularly rough, as Lanegan briefly goes Ian Astbury on us, calling out to his female back-up singers, ""Rollin' children, keep on rollin'."" (They respond by calling him ""daddy."") I keep waiting for him to belt out, ""C'mon li'l sister!"" here, but alas, he leaves me hanging. Fortunately, these occasional clunkers are more than outnumbered by the album's highlights, which include a pair of smoldering duets with PJ Harvey-- ""Hit the City"" and ""Come to Me""-- either of which could slip unnoticed as a bonus track onto Uh Huh Her. It's also hard to not be delighted by ""Sideways in Reverse"" and ""Driving Death Valley Blues"", Lanegan's most bare-knuckled rockers since the demise of his former band. Additionally, he has few peers, particularly in his age bracket, when it comes to tackling moody, blues-infused numbers like the opening ""When Your Number Isn't Up"" or the Tom Waits-ish ""Like Little Willie John"". Throughout Bubblegum, Lanegan proves himself adroit at navigating the back alleys of Babylon, but after the record's umpteenth reference to loaded shotguns, '73 Buicks, and goin' cold turkey, one can't help but think he might eventually want to take a stab at some new material. So far, his voice has proven to be well-suited for whatever use he has put it to; hopefully next time he strays a little further afield to better stretch its limits.",,7.2,
La Increíble Aventura,Migala,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4695e6ef95969323a59/1:1/w_160/04c76bbd.gif,2004-08-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5280-la-increible-aventura/,Acuarela,"In these days of downloading and file-sharing, it's not uncommon for a band or label to augment an album with extra features, usually in the form of some multimedia content on the disc, like a video for the lead single, or a ""making of"" rockumentary. It's a good way to get people interested in actually buying the physical record when they could probably get it for free, though a lot of times you have to question whether or not the extra content even took any effort to compile. Spain's Migala and the Acuarela Discos label have apparently figured out the whole ""value-added"" concept, as they've gone and included a whole DVD with La Increíble Aventura, the band's fifth album (counting Restos de un Incendio, which reworked a number of their old songs for U.S. release). The disc contains a distinct video for every song on the album, including the untitled 50-second interlude track. They range from beautiful and evocative to just plain puzzling, but watching them greatly alters one's perception of the album, as they flesh out and occasionally offer counterpoint to the moody songs Migala have cooked up here. From the start, it's clear that this is Migala's darkest album, and its mostly instrumental format separates it even further from the band's past output. At first, it seems the band is building to some sort of political statement, titling the opening song ""El Imperio de Mal"" (""The Evil Empire""), but as the tribal drumming and chanting of the intro peels back, they insert not a sample of some American politician, but of Darth Vader calling Obi-Wan Kenobi to his death. This subversion of the music's melancholy tone and the soaring passion of the band's playing occurs several times over the course of the album, and even more often on the DVD-- the video for ""El Imperio"" features a stop-motion kitchen in the grip of a stroboscopic poltergeist and a coffee pot lifting its lid in unison with James Earl Jones' Vaderisms. With its blaring guitars and cathartic rush of rhythm, ""El Imperio"" is actually one of the album's highlights, and the two vocal tracks, sandwiched together mid-album make for a sublime central plateau. ""Your Star, Strangled"" is gentler than its title, as Abel Hernandez's mellow baritone mixes with hushed harmonica, violin and slide guitar in an arresting nocturnal swirl, while ""El Gran Miercoles"" opens with a long, hushed intro of searching guitars and crashing waves. The video for the song is a grainy 8mm vacation video filmed on a Mediterranean beach, and that hazy recollection is easy to read in the music, as Hernandez whispers lines about the sand beneath his feet while the song grows quieter and quieter, finally giving way to a sample of the waves before the band picks up the baton Godspeed You Black Emperor! dropped on Yanqui U.X.O. and runs with it, a wash of guitars droning triumphantly. The vocal tracks are something of a double-edged sword for the album as a whole, though, because their quality leaves you wishing for a few more, despite the pleasantness of instrumentals like the propulsive ""Sonnenwende"". The instrumentals have an overall consistency of tone and approach that causes them to bleed together somewhat; the videos perhaps do the most to lend them emotional variety with their footage of slow-motion fireworks, brightly lit carnival rides, flamenco dancers and, er, leather-jacketed guys in tiger masks fighting kung-fu-style on a mountain. La Increíble Aventura doesn't quite equal the sheer power and range of the band's best albums (2001's Arde, in particular), but it's a powerful statement nonetheless, capturing one of Spain's greatest exports at their darkest and most ferocious.","Latest album from these moody Spanish post-rockers, formerly known for their vocalist's uncanny likeness to Leonard Cohen, and for backing Will Oldham on tour.

Love Everybody,The Presidents of the United States of America,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a120c0084474cd0bfd33/1:1/w_160/9272fcaa.jpg,2004-08-26 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6459-love-everybody/,PUSA,"VH1, Pitchfork salutes you. Thanks for being cable TV's top purveyor of instantly gratifying (albeit non-pornographic) infotainment. But since you saw fit to release I Love the 90s just four years into the nominally fraught Aughts, did you really have to focus so often on the ugliness of that dearly departed meta-decade? Everybody already knew Hootie sucked. Now that our once-reviled teen pop stars have given way to posturing post-grungers, Blink-182 imitators (!) and even lamer teen-pop stars, we long for the halcyon days when Jerry was master of his domain and a quirky Seattle band sat alone in a boggy marsh. To wit: a million rock critics' lazy political puns praising the endearingly unpretentious return of that quirky Seattle band, The Presidents of the United States of America. The passing of a decade raises questions for any pop act, but especially a group that reached double-platinum prominence in 1995 for its relentlessly childish brand of rock. I first heard ""Lump"" when I was younger than a critic should admit, watching MTV at my parents' then-home in Tennessee-- just the second of the six states I've called home. Back then, the band's eight glorious strings and nonsensical lyrics instantly won over my unrefined sensibilities. ""Do you have any idea what it takes to rock?"" Chris Ballew sings on the band's sophomore effort, II. Quite frankly, I didn't. Would ""Peaches"" sound as sweet in 2004? Could any new album live up to nostalgia? On Love Everybody, the Presidents don't fully answer such questions. They stick mostly to their old formula of catchy hooks and gleeful goofiness, and it mostly works. On the title track, cheesy ""Mach 5"" synths and choppy singing sound like Bellew's signing up with this decade's new new-wavers-- appropriately, given the Buggles cover on Pure Frosting. But then again, his banana-fana-fo-fark cadences could just as easily be aping ""The Name Game"". Later, ""Drool at You"" proves the band still has a gift for entertainingly bizarre lyrics: ""I want to lick your lamb chops dry/ So please excuse me while I hump the sky."" They do toss in the occasional surprise, like the gloriously melodic ""Vestina"", which matches the laid-back pop of Guster's ""Ramona"" with a Britt Daniel-style vocal. Armed with steely indie contrarianism, part of me was ready to skewer this long-overdue release by one of my old favorite bands. After all, where were the hypesters and hipsters for Freaked Out and Small, the 2000 release that's so overlooked most writers call Love Everybody their third album? Seattle radio hit ""Some Postman"" didn't help quash my darker impulses. Granted, its hook is as infectious as anything the group has ever done. But isn't that the chord progression from Eve 6's ""Inside Out""? Close enough. Moreover, the new album suffers the same propensity for filler that marred II. ""Shortwave"" and bland ""Clean Machine"" will join clunkers like ""Bath of Fire"" and ""Lip"" down the memory hole. For all the Presidents' success in conjuring up the Ben Fold Five fuzz and Dead Milkmen whimsy of records past, the best track here sounds the least like their previous work. That's ""Jennifer's Jacket"", a mostly acoustic ditty destined to be a preschool favorite. ""She's got safety pins and strings holding it together,"" Ballew intones. ""She can only wear her jacket in warm weather."" Ballew somehow achieves an understated beauty while sounding more like Kermit than he did on the debut's ""Froggie"". When the inevitable electric guitars kick in for a blissful, slightly off-key coda, one thing becomes clear: Whether or not they ever record another ""Lump"", The Presidents of the United States of America should never be misunderestimated. There, was that too subtle to fill my political pun quota?","It's been nearly 10 years since anyone's cared about mid-90s novelties Presidents of the United States of America, but ahh, here they are again anyway.

Jaku,DJ Krush,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bf5e6ef95969322a33/1:1/w_160/24f87492.jpg,2004-08-26 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2366-jaku/,Red Ink,"While the world's cultural barriers of language and geography are gradually shrinking, many Westerners still know little about Japanese urban life but what Blockbuster Video teaches them. So what might they envision when listening to DJ Krush's collision of meditative, traditional Japanese folk and bass-heavy hip-hop? The, like, coolest soundtrack for a yakuza flick, that's what. Tracks that sync programmed percussion to the melodic elements of koto strings and shakuhachi flutes tend to end up as stock music for film scenes in which Yankee detectives with $100-haircuts enter a Chinatown with steam-billowing gutters whenever Hollywood television has to fulfill its token-Asian quota for the season. In a post-Wu-Tang world, that is possibly the lucrative fate of Krush's eighth album, Jaku. Nonetheless, Jaku still deserves respect for its cross-pollination of the arcane and the futuristic, where Krush guides you through his native Tokyo's neon forests, candlelit Buddhist temples, and the Harajuku neighborhood where teenagers flaunt Western-twisted fashions and rap in their native tongue. Since the late 80s, Krush has been credited with injecting hip-hop's trademark rhythmic minimalism with the Japanese artistic sensibilities of loose spacing and evoking the strongest impact with the slightest gesture. Such endeavors are best heard on his classic Mo'Wax joints Strictly Turntablized and Meiso, to which much so-called ""trip-hop"" seems uninspired in comparison. The new record furthers Krush's descent into black silk-draped symphonics with live Japanese instruments. Contrary to what the album title suggests (it's Japanese for ""tranquility""), most tracks are hexed by tension. The opener, ""Still Island"", sets that mood with string orchestrations and Shuuzan Morita's snaking shakuhachi melodies. The following ""Road to Nowhere"" strolls through a crimson-moonlit garden with a methanol-smoked bassline that hobbles along with a sprung-ankle of a beat. Krush is at his best here when he focuses more on the beat than the frequently over-saturated layers of strings that, at times, approach John Williams-caliber schmaltz: ""Transitions"" skitters in a time-lapse motion with dub rim-shots and cello blurts, while Krush's duet with DJ Tatsuki in ""Deck-athron"" grows eight legs out of a tumbling beat with some brilliant turntable-pitch tomfuckery. Other fine stitch-work is found in ""Passage""'s kick drums, which break holes in roofs for samples of rain to leak in, and the hustling taiko-crunk beat of ""Univearth"". Jaku's two guest vocalists-- underground hip-hop stalwarts Mr. Lif and Aesop Rock-- manage to save additional face for the record, breaking through the difficult challenge of translating Krush's amorphous mire into lyrical narratives. Lif wins the prize for his smooth, airborne surveillance of American Babylon in ""Nosferatu"", while Aesop's stream-of-consciousness exhale on ""Kill Switch"" is a swank noise of clever phrases, poetic flashcards and split references, even if they're essentially about nothing in particular. Still, the album's best narration is unspoken. On ""Song 2"", Krush stages what sounds like a dinnertime conversation about coming home with pink slips that day-- complete with interruptions, awkward pauses and tangents-- using only shakuhachi flutes and a kalimba. Indeed, though his genre may have long passed its prime, Krush's use of space and texture remain not just formidable, but remarkably relevant.","The more Zen moments of turntablist DJ Krush's Jaku may end up on a yakuza-gangsta flick, but his jigsaw connections between hip-hop and Japanese folk music should be beheld.

Armed Love,The (International) Noise Conspiracy,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b978c0084474cd0c2603/1:1/w_160/5fc9883f.jpg,2004-08-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4112-armed-love/,American,"""When I think about the revolution, you're still in my dreams."" That's Dennis Lyxzén's yawp on the third track of Armed Love, his internationally noisy and somewhat conspiratorial unit's third full-length, and their first to emerge from behind the beard of Rick Rubin. It's the old story-- boy meets girl but forgets to tell her about the Molotov cocktails in his kitchen sink, only to see her visage reflected in the fire of the office he just bombed. Her dad's, as it would naturally turn out. But then, the first rule of Fight Club is that you don't talk about Fight Club, so what's a partisan to do? Write an album that puts the catchy before the concertina wire, hell-raising before the consciousness-raising, and hope you can explain the politics later. At this latter notion, Serj Tankian only snorts cynically, and The (International) Noise Conspiracy's Warped Tour stage manager taps his watch with a shake of the head. But the band might be on to something truer than activism and louder than bombs. They're onto a reinvention of that trusty hippy mantra. They're rebuilding the love aesthetic for a fucked-up era, and matching it to their leather and Converse. Armed Love has a great title going for it, and a batch of tensile tracks built handily for sharp-elbow jiving and maybe even some fist-pump jabbing. It sinks wildly into wily, clever crossbreeds of late-60s proto-punk, organ-driven soul grease, and a succulent trusty jelly of ""Hey!""s, ""Whoo Whoo!""s, and-- what's this?-- sax solos? Well, the Huey Lewis quality of the latter is forgiven 'cause they're Swedish. Overall, the album is a decent economy piece with as much bottom-end punch as the perpetually underrated Division of Laura Lee's recent Das Not Compute. Indeed, ""Black Mask"" (""Need somethin' that can turn me on, YEAH!"") and ""A Small Demand"" are like long-nosed, more intelligently rhythmic versions of Jet's strutting, shit-eating pap. And ""The Way I Feel About You"" is unabashedly upbeat, its crackling electric guitar meeting the B3 halfway across the stage and flirting with the bouncy Motown bottom-end that's ripe for doing the mash potato. Wait, wait. Isn't this band supposed to be challenging the bourgeoisie in our bathrooms with glinty knives, ruminating in liner notes on social responsibility and The Anarchist's Cookbook, and generally rousing the rabble in what's usually referred to these days as ""the punk spirit?"" Was that powder keg of vigor lost on the way to Rubin's studio and the American Recordings contract? Well, not lost, exactly. They've still got Revolution in their eyes. But it's pretty clear that, for this album anyway, the (I)NC wants to make us hook up before we act up. Move our hearts, they're saying, and our minds will follow. The famously no-bullshit Rubin has certainly aided the Conspiracy in the Noise department. The album's a solid slice of Burning Heart label revivalism. It's not innovative, but it's deliberate and economic, with no filler and an inviting dose of Sly Stone-derived soul. Still, anyone looking for an overt political statement might be disappointed, since Armed Love favors moment-shifting sketches over world-changing schematics. ""It's finally coming/ The changing weather/ That we've been waiting for,"" goes ""This Side of Heaven"", and Lyxzén sings about ""tasting the sensation"" over the chorus' keening keys and tumbling percussion. He's probably talking about getting the word out, raising awareness, all that. But he could just as easily be selling fine chocolates. ""Communist Moon"", too, could be a celebration of young revolutionaries joining in the fight against tyranny. But it might also be an invitation for a totally bitchin' after-hours warehouse party. After shouldering the political burden for these past few years, maybe Lyxzén and his mates are tired of having to talk treatise with groupies instead of showing them the way to the tour bus. To this end, there's ""Like a Landslide"". Coming late in the album, it's a rousing, thick-bodied rocker with both organ and horn section add-ons, building to a chorus that wouldn't be out of place on a Paul Revere & The Raiders record. But its lyrics seem to dream for a time when togetherness can be just that, not a strategy meeting in some dingy basement. ""We're gonna move like a movement,"" the song's gang vocal climax asserts, and it's a moment when the crux of Armed Love walks in clear view. The (International) Noise Conspiracy (and probably Rubin, too) want love, not war. The solution to our collective social ills is in the pants of your neighbor, and finding that is way more fun than a first date fashioning political effigies.","Rick Rubin produces the third proper album from ex-Refused frontman Dennis Lyxzen's (International) Noise Conspiracy, upping the impact while the band tones down their formerly overbearing political agenda.

Oakley Hall,Oakley Hall,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba40eb335119a49ec99e/1:1/w_160/2990079c.gif,2004-08-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6098-oakley-hall/,Bulb,"Oakley Hall is a good-natured band from the countryside of Brooklyn, New York. And on their self-titled Bulb debut, they offer a collection of rambling honky-tonk that exists refreshingly out-of-frame, eager to rollick in the genre's bleary, heartbroken roots, but curious enough about the clang and call of the city to work in plenty of amplification and screechy organ amidst their banjos, fiddles, and pedal steel. Don't say ""alt-country""-- it makes me picture J. Mascis sporting Kiefer Sutherland's moustache from The Cowboy Way. But you're welcome to order another Genesee and stretch out on the old church pew in the corner. The band is the brainchild of Papa Crazee (ex-Oneida), who, when last heard from, had cut up his hand in a rather grisly table saw accident. He resurfaces here backed by a gaggle of players, including a supporting vocalist with a lovely voice. Her name is unclear, as are most of the details surrounding Oakley Hall-- Bulb's press materials are more about suggestion than fact. But that emphasis works like a charm, since the album's better without qualification. Both its breaded steak country stomps and the occasional, quieter passages drift over the tenements like the wispy aroma of a peach pie spiked with Wild Turkey. ""Feel This Way"" drops into gear with a nod to the 70s trucker idiom, its gang vocals chiming over a greasy backbeat worthy of a song about self-defeatist sex. ""Color the Shade"" fades in on the monotone sustain of an organ (a B3, maybe), and as its tone warbles louder, it reflects Oneida's dark psyche prowess and their fractured approach to genre-spattered indie. But here, the organ goes quiet, and instead gives way to a bassline reminiscent of ""Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay"", as well as strummed acoustics and a series of distant fiddle fills. Crazee and his female counterpart harmonize on lines like, ""Saw a color the shade of you/ Chased it down a one way street before I knew/ Reds just made me mad/ Blues just made me sad/ And yellows remind me of other fellows/ That you screwed."" The last line is nearly lost in a great burst of squelch electric guitar, another nod to the present that keeps Oakley Hall closer to operators like Acetone than anything on the Lost Highway's shoulder. Oakley Hall are neither ironic nor revivalist, but recordings like this don't work without an appreciation for traditionalism. Just ask Ween, who recorded 12 Golden Country Greats with a bunch of crack Nashville studio cats. To that end, Oakley Hall keeps ""Foolish Heart"" on a red-and-white gingham keel not far from your average roadhouse, and ""5 Sided Die"" is well-executed, if straightforward roots-rocker. These tracks don't have the intangibles of Oakley Hall's better moments-- the ones that glint like tiny diamonds scattered in peanut shavings-- but they're probably necessary for an album enamored of the relationship between city wolf and country wolf. The album really shines in its second half, when the maze-walking traveler of its cover finally sets foot on the flaming world in the center. ""End Time Evangelist"" is a slurred gothic rumination calling to the Handsome Family from a grimy diner's corner table, while ""You Wouldn't Believe What I've Been Up To (Since You've Been Gone)"" puts the female vocals front and center for a hilariously morbid letter to a departed lover. ""I take a nap in a hot drawn bath,"" she sings absentmindedly over gentle chords, ""with the radio under my arm..."" That hyper-distorted organ returns late in the album, too, this time for the rowdy ""Ridin' the Dog"". And then, the record ends, plaintively, with the 7-minute-plus epic ""Tuscaloosa"". Papa Crazee's voice cracks on the hiccups as he wanders through life with a heavy, totally crushed-out heart. He warns his woman away from him as a fiddle fades in sadly; he knows the resulting sparks would light them both in the fires of damnation. The song's extended instrumental outro will ring true and heartfelt with the O Brother crowd (as most of Oakley Hall's material likely would), but this band never tries to follow a framework, and often hurls grapeshot at strangers looking for one. Indeed, at the end of the day, Oakley Hall is just a great basement album, a backroom favorite made to heal the rifts in city girls' country hearts.","Bulb Records issues the debut album from the new band fronted by ex-Oneida singer/guitarist Papa Crazee, notorious for his lunatic vocals and gruesome tablesaw accident.

"Fugazi Live Series, Vol. 1: September 3rd, 1987",Fugazi,by: Cameron Macdonald,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be5a13d197565213b709/1:1/w_160/3eaa208f.gif,2004-08-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3243-fugazi-live-series-vol-1-september-3rd-1987/,Fugazi Live Series,"It's a shame that Fugazi tend to be more revered as a business model than a band. The ethos of charging only $6 for concerts, selling CDs for a flat $12, and never hawking any merchandise you can wear does not guarantee worthwhile music. It just so happens, however, that their sound reiterates why punk rock still matters. The answer lies in their albums, whose radical expansion of punk's defining characteristics confused as many punk purists as it enraptured, and their concerts, which underscored the unusual guitar tunings that sounded like ships crashing in the night and saw Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto barking as if just inches away from riot-cop mace-sprayers. Earlier this year, bassist Joe Lally began the Fugazi Live Series label to release the band's archived live recordings, which document every concert they've played for the past 17 years. Each cassette or DAT that passed quality control is now being burned to CDR and packaged in a jewel box with generic cover art that shows the band playing for flood reservoirs of people. And, exhibiting a unique sense of posterity, the band has opted to leave the raw recordings untreated-- all wrong notes, tape hiss, missed cues and microphone cutouts are fully intact. 9-3-87 Washington, DC-- just one of 20 volumes the band is selling exclusively at the Fugazi Live Series website-- captures Fugazi's public debut in September 1987 at the Wilson Center, a D.C. community center for teens. Caught by a cassette deck with narcoleptic magnets, it showcases a band still trying to find itself, and hoping that at least someone else digs it. Case in point is their slog-through of the Pointillist-funk number ""Furniture"", where MacKaye pleads the audience, ""Bear with me, please! ...This is the last part and after that we'll stop!"" Yet, even in this embryonic stage, Fugazi still concocted punk rock that crossed its arms and glared at the hardcore pep rallies that took over cities across the board during the late-80s. That night, the trio (Picciotto wasn't onboard until several months later) played a hybrid of thrash-funk and midtempo blues which sounded content to sit alone on parking-space barriers outside the hardcore clubs, thinking, while other groups' two-minute testosterone fits raged nearby. Positive Force D.C. activist Mark Anderson introduces the band; what follows is a snapshot of American punk standing at a crossroads. Here, MacKaye & Co. walk in a careful pace along a war-torn street, stepping over shattered glass, bullet casings and scattered propaganda leaflets selling visions of Reagan's City on the Hill. The guerilla war that hardcore long waged against the empire in America's suburbs and skid rows was at a lull, with infighting and exhaustion setting in. On this street that Fugazi treaded, major-label A&R; scouts or carpetbaggers loitered in the local veterans' halls, recruiting the disillusioned with brochures featuring the smiling faces of Hüsker Dü and The Replacements and obscuring memories of fallen heroes Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys. Fugazi's ""Song #1"", then, was a rallying cry of a whole other sort, announcing in a bullhorn: ""Song #1 is not a fuck you song/ I'll save that thought until later on/ You want to know if there's something wrong?/ It's nothing."" They continue: ""Life is what you want it to be so don't get tangled up trying to be free.../ It's nothing."" Fugazi here recall the European existentialists who cursed the language and sciences that led their countrymen to the Cold War, as aspects of ""nothingness."" And these critiques reoccur in the songs ""Furniture"", ""Merchandise"" and ""Word"", where MacKaye lectures, ""The world has got you down/ Everybody treats you like shit/ What's the answer?/ What was that word again?/ ...The word is 'change.'"" It's difficult to imagine the crowd's facial reactions as harDCore's own hero told them that all their scenester posturing and territorial pissing was useless. Fugazi's confidence in their musicianship spurts in ""Word"", as they march through a pogoing conversation between bass and guitar, and then slow it down to a dub space-out. Elsewhere, Lally delivers a deft bass solo for a Mashed Potato dance rhythm on ""Furniture"", while the anti-suicide jaunt ""Turn Off Your Guns"" remains among the band's poppiest moments to date. The only negative is that the setlist is confined in a narrow palette with chords and rhythms that the band would seemingly repeatedly recycle until turning a sharp left on 1995's Red Medicine. On the other hand, this document not only contains great historical value, but also elicits the excitement of hearing Fugazi realize where freedom-- and the rigor to maintain it-- can take them.","The first in a series of 20 live concerts recently made available via Fugazi bassist Joe Lally's new Fugazi Live Series website documents the first show that the now-legendary post-punk rockers ever played-- a September 3rd performance at Washington, DC's Wilson Center, at which they debuted material that would later wind up on 13 Songs, Repeater, and various EPs and compilations.

God Bless Your Black Heart,The Paper Chase,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17fb1335d7bf169828c/1:1/w_160/a7c8d9ee.jpg,2004-08-25 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6550-god-bless-your-black-heart/,Kill Rock Stars,"As a shaggy-haired teenage beanpole, I eventually graduated from worshipping inept hardcore debutantes and CBGB's amateur-night punks to indulging my melancholic needs with the more ""refined"" strains of The Smiths, Joy Division, The Cure, et al. At the time, the solipsistic zeitgeist wallowed in overdramatic giddiness like running down a street in the rain, feeling misunderstood, shaking my head no-no-no to ""Boys Don't Cry"", and milking a sense of the sublime (even if ill-defined) within my own gut-wrenching awkwardness. I was a cross between a 16-year-old Thurston Moore and a member of A Flock of Seagulls. That was a decade ago, but despite limited contact with the youngsters, I assume the I-wear-black-on-the-outside initiation period rings true for a new breed of suburbanites armed with Thursday, Dashboard Confessional, and Suicide Girls. And Lord knows If I had a time machine, The pAper chAse would've been plenty of fuel for my crocodile tears: So yeah, hand me a hanky because hearts really do turn weird colors and no, she doesn't owe you a goddamn thing... Despite epic production (think Sunny Day Real Estate aiming for Wagner), novelistic twists, and admirable chutzpah on God Bless Your Black Heart, The pAper chAse's lavishly curated third full-length, it's difficult to take every last pity party sentiment seriously. Still, John Congleton's breakdown is less grating than the detritus of most emo and post-emo yowlers, and his dual roll as main songwriter and atmospheric engineer (he's also turned knobs for 90 Day Men and Explosions in the Sky, among others), offers him the micro-managing ability to one-up the average screamer by setting his carefully narrated denouement in what feels like a diorama that houses Nick Cave's book And the Ass Saw the Angel as narrated by some imaginary post-punk version of the bald guy from President's of the United States of America vomiting gothic-lite bile onto a dark oak table. Tangentially somewhere between Dismemberment Plan geek and Cursive angst, there's a circus parade of violent outbursts, murky characters named ""queen bee"" and ""buttercup,"" white slaves, a pair of sideburns that reek of sex, and even some goddamn fat babies. At the end of Congleton's imagistic lyrical marathon, it's up to the listener to piece together the narrative and figure out, really, what he's talking about. Congleton layers his revenge fantasies atop aggressive shouting, dingy strings, cabaret piano, ""broken heart"" samples, and mathy guitar interjections-- all to create a dense, herky-jerky post-post-post not unlike Coral's Pillow Talk or the aforementioned Cursive's hyper-divorce jam Domestica. But where Domestica at times felt like legitimate hurt, The pAper chAse have a problem wading beyond bleating theatrics. And where Cursive's vocalist, Tim Kasher, proves adept at varying his accusatory attack, Congleton projects a disregard for variation, rarely coming down from his high-end hysterical cowpoke snarl. Opting for song titles that match his over-the-top sermonizing (""Abby, You're Going to Burn for What You've Done to Me"", ""One Day He Went Out for Milk and Never Came Home"", ""Now, We Just Slowly Circle the Draining Fishbowl""), stations him at full throttle, even when the music's a mere whisper. There's not a thing wrong with fire and brimstone dashed with piss and vinegar, but before the album reaches its halfway point, Congleton's shouty boy/girl accusations have sunken into a sing-song pattern that beckons sleep like the gentle nudge of an air-conditioner's hum. When presenting words and emotions this ""extreme,"" it often helps to house it in a more stoic structure-- say the less trill slashing of Swans. In this sense, the strongest portions of God Bless Your Black Heart are those closest to monotonous silence: jingle bells, the aftershock of a sinewy guitar, pleasing percussion/piano build-ups, noir interludes, hollowed parlor ambiance, the creaky violin outro of ""The Sinking Ship, The Grand Applause"", and the gaps in ""A War Is Coming"", a near-industrial snippet. Bassist Bobby Weaver and drummer Aryn Dalton provide an especially powerful rhythm section-- think a Shellac ballet. Sean Kirkpatrick contributes well-timed piano and synth lines that fill out the sound admirably (at one point I swear I can feel the haze of a neo-Gregorian chant), and Congleton's cathartic guitar parts wrap around his high-end decibels like a Columbian necktie. Ultimately, God Bless Your Black Heart's seemingly endless feast of rants and threats (i.e. ""I'll see your head up on a pole,"" ""Your doctors and lawyers can't save your ass,"" etc.) would imply that for Congleton to issue a restraining order against his bad self might not be a bad idea. Sometimes erstwhile obsessiveness can lead to revelation, but beyond the fancy engineering, I don't see much of that here. I'm not suggesting that The pAper chAse opt for dull-as-dirt Don Caballero instrumentals when it's obvious the band's ability to make-or-break rests on Congleton's shoulders and overwrought mind, but God Bless Your Black Heart really would benefit from a muted falsetto here or a tiny mumble there. You get a sense of that spaciousness over the album's last three tracks and it's completely beautiful: If the ballast leveled out more regularly and allowed breathing room for the nonverbal, these multi-layered atmospheres would ineluctably stand up and speak for themselves with less insistent wheezing. If I weren't so broke, I might even chip in for the guy's therapy to see it happen.","Kill Rock Stars debut from these long-running Texas-based emo-rockers is their most ambitious to date, but is held back by its lack of variation.

The Secondman's Middle Stand,Mike Watt,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9d89d034d5c69bf3d14/1:1/w_160/8e53a96e.jpg,2004-08-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8589-the-secondmans-middle-stand/,Red Ink,"""What can be romantic to Mike Watt? He's only a skeleton."" Even back in 1984, when D. Boon first sang those lyrics from Watt's ""One Reporter's Opinion"" on Double Nickels on the Dime, it sounded like an inside joke. By then it was already evident that Watt was one of punk rock's biggest and most self-reflective romantics. From Minutemen classics like ""Tour Spiel"" and the monumental ""History Lesson - Part II"", straight on through the fIREHOSE years and his busy but erratic solo career, there's been little about his working class hometown San Pedro, flannel, piss bottles, or jamming econo that our beloved bass-wielding Ulysses hasn't found romantic. All that nearly came to an end in 2000, when Watt suffered a burst abscess in his perineum, an affliction even more gruesome than it sounds. This horrendous episode very nearly rendered the world Watt-less, but he has since thankfully recovered, and now offers a not-entirely-unromantic account of this brush with death on his self-described punk opera, Secondman's Middle Stand. Watt has never been one to crib pages from someone else's rulebook, but Middle Stand is an idiosyncratic work even by his standards. Constructed loosely on Dante's Divine Comedy, the album bases three songs apiece on his illness (""Inferno""), treatment (""Purgatorio"") and recovery (""Paradiso""). The instrumental line-up is kept light and lean, with Watt on vocals and ""thud staff,"" the busy limbs of Jerry Trebotic on drums, Pete Mazich on organ and frequent background vocals from Petra Haden. It's that organ that's going to prove most nettlesome to punk-bred listeners, as it's difficult to disassociate Mazich's ornate, proggy Hammond B3 stylizations from just the sort of pompous arena rock that prompted punk's invention in the first place. But once you convince yourself that Mazich is not, in fact, about to break into Kansas' ""Point of No Return"", you should be able to appreciate the broad array of textures that the instrument brings to Watt's preferred power trio format. With his trusty thunderbroom functioning as his Virgil, Watt doesn't flinch as he begins his tour of the underworld. ""Abandon all hope!"" command the background singers on the opener ""Boiling Blazes"" while the drums and organ roil nauseously. ""No!"" Watt screams back defiantly. ""I'm going to make it through this hellride."" Things do get awfully hellish in the early going, and Watt spares us few gory details on tracks like the surprisingly peppy, ""Puked to High Heaven"", the self-explanatory ""Pissbags and Tubings"", and the driving, Deep Purplish ""Bursted Man"" which finds Watt trapped inside an infernal fever dream. ""I see that thermometer in your mouth/ It looks more like a fuse/ Send that mercury to the top/ Split the glass and splatter his bulkhead!"" Yikes. Throughout the album, Watt delivers his most emotive vocal performance on record, sounding at times like a cross between a diabolical Gregg Allman and the muttering derelict who nobody wants to sit next to on the bus. Unfortunately his frenzied delivery, rapid-fire lyrics and the live-in-the-studio production quality often have his vocals getting trampled under the hooves of the marauding bass and organ. But his bass work is as powerful and nonchalantly virtuosic as ever, with his omnivorous playing style serving as both propulsive rhythmic force and melodic color-bearer. And it'd take a hard heart indeed to not smile when Watt, after enduring all his myriad hardships, triumphantly sails into ""The Angel's Gate"", the celebratory track that introduces the ""Paradiso"" section. (""The Angel's Gate"" is also the name of the harbor at San Pedro.) When you hear him describe the simple, never-to-be-taken-for-granted pleasures of being able to resume bicycling, kayaking and music-making on ""Pluckin', Pedalin', Paddlin'"", you'll hear a man who has withstood a brutal ordeal with his boundless romanticism intact. And though this album requires its listeners to go through some arduous passages, you'll find yourself hoping to hear this Secondman making new stands for a long time to come.","Erstwhile Minuteman bassist's long-delayed conceptual third solo LP relives, in gory detail, his well-publicized brush with death in 2000.

Soft Commands,Ken Stringfellow,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58aea9e61561daa5173/1:1/w_160/5779e42f.jpg,2004-08-25 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7536-soft-commands/,Yep Roc,"The shot on the cover of Ken Stringfellow's third solo album looks like it was snapped in about 40 seconds in a hotel room decorated circa 1973, just before he headed off to take some stage with one of the numerous bands he tours with, be it the reconstituted Big Star, the remnants of The Posies, or R.E.M. The liners are sprinkled with out-of-focus shots of unidentified cities taken from high-rise windows, presumably in rented rooms. To say that Stringfellow lives a mobile, busy musical life is an understatement-- he produces, does session work, tours as both a side and front man, and occasionally records a solo record like this one, which was written on three continents and recorded in four separate studios. Stringfellow and longtime partner Jon Auer were wide-eyed fans of the guitar-pop vanguard when they inaugurated The Posies in the late 80s, and by the time they were dropped by DGC in 1997, they were fully immersed in both the band and the genre (good buddies with Alex Chilton, Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey), and unable to fully put The Posies to rest even after officially breaking up. Stringfellow's first solo album, 1997's This Sounds Like Goodbye was an uncharacteristically experimental and homespun album, a sort of exorcism of ideas, but his 2001 follow-up effort, Touched, was a well-developed album of sophisticated, classic pop. Soft Commands builds directly on that progression with a batch of songs guaranteed to be huge hits as soon as we're all sucked into a giant time warp and plunked back down in 1974. The arrangements this time out are much more ambitious, with small orchestras darkening the corners of the songs and lending a baroque, stately aura to the album. Even ""For Your Sake"", one of two tracks without outside collaborators, sounds huge, with mile-deep synths, fuzz bass accents and nervous rhythms backing Stringfellow's lithium-smooth tenor-- the melody is a collection of woven phrases that challenge the meter and highlight the fragmentary nature of the lyrics. ""Let Me Do"" doesn't exactly conjure the Senegal locale it was written in, instead fleshing out a simple declaration of romantic intent with opulent horn and string charts. Stringfellow takes his music subtly in dozens of different, sometimes bold directions on Soft Commands, dropping reggae and ska-inflected verses on ""You Become the Dawn"", a blue-eyed soul confection with a big, horn-draped chorus and a strange chant interlude featuring massed vocals and organ. It's followed by a throwaway dub instrumental, which is about the only point on the album in which Stringfellow takes his musical curiosity a bit too far. Elsewhere, ""Cyclone Graves"", with its refrain of, ""I hope you never go blind,"" conjures the soft-rock mastery of Todd Rundgren's Something/Anything, while opener ""You Drew"" makes a convincing case for the legacy of Jackson Browne with its graceful melody and anthemic scope. ""When U Find Someone"" rises from humble verses to an expansive, Wilsonian chorus packed with harmonies, kettle drums and theremin, establishing itself as the album's early highlight. The album closes with the comparatively spare ""Death of a City"", primarily featuring Stringfellow and his piano, though he layers himself into a massive choir at points while strings flit about in the background, adding counterpoint to his vocals. ""You go out late and look for the stars/ But all you see is orange on the clouds,"" he sings, summing up the futility of stargazing in the city, and you get the impression that he's weary of urban life, even as he feeds off of it. For an album recorded in so many places and incorporating so many states of mind, Soft Commands is remarkably cohesive, and a forceful confirmation of Stringfellow's ability to stand on his own as an artist worthy of respect and a listen from any true fan of classic pop.","Third solo album from the former Posies co-frontman dwells in the distant past, evoking the oft-emulated smooth sounds of 70s AM pop.

Patterns in a Chromatic Field,Morton Feldman,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd74abf31b7dc7155f5a/1:1/w_160/8045846f.jpg,2004-08-25 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3027-patterns-in-a-chromatic-field/,Tzadik,"The late Morton Feldman's quiet, sparse compositions manipulate the most basic facets of human existence-- heartbeat and breath, environment, repetition, the progression of time-- with such breadth and subtlety that it seems impossible such transformative music should fit on the small physical object of a CD. Heavily influenced by John Cage's musical theories and personal encouragement, Feldman outpaced his mentor in successfully counteracting the theoretical rigidity popular among many 20th century composers. While Cage's music, like Marcel Duchamp's toilet on the wall, could still eschew aesthetics in favor of ideological polemics, Feldman always remained concerned that his pieces would speak for themselves a priori of any extramusical conceit. Unimpressed with the compositional systems of the serialists or minimalists, as well as traditional scales, tunings and forms, Feldman's music is both deeply emotional and the antithesis of ""dramatic,"" relying on no trope to alight the far reaches of our inner worlds. John Zorn's label Tzadik, most prominently carrying Zorn's own releases and a host of abrasive Japanese noise/electronic artists, has released what it claims to be ""the definitive recording"" of Feldman's infinitely nuanced 1981 composition Patterns in a Chromatic Field. They've pulled it off, with an engaged and well-captured performance from pianist Aleck Karis and cellist Charles Curtis, as well as liner notes that, through quotes from Feldman's own writing, introduce listeners to his mature theoretical outlook. To those familiar with Feldman's general style, 1981's Patterns in a Chromatic Field may seem unusually busy. The composer is best known for his interest in the hazes of notes sustained after being struck (some pieces call for every sound to be allowed its full decay) as well as his use of chance operations within set parameters. Patterns is relatively rhythmic and almost fully notated, yet still imparts what Feldman called his compositional ""subservience"" to pure sound. The hushed instruments weave a web of intertwining figures, quieter parts allowing ambient noise of the surrounding world to enter into their musical environment. Patterns is driven by the communication that develops between the work's two inhabitants, piano and cello. The piece begins with the impression of being thrust upon something in progress, as though hearing the muted sounds of a couple arguing in the next room. The cello whines in looped patterns, while the piano drops weighted clusters along the pitch spectrum, soon segueing into stillness. Subsequent rhythmic sections recall the cadences of Morse code, the instruments stabbing at unity in their intersections and misses. In other instances, they'll engage in long passages of cause and effect, the piano a child fascinated that its repeated actions produce the cello's consistent result. In this way, though the piece shifts from one musical cell to the next without provocation, its progression never feels aimless. Its only predictable movement is in the tempering of any extreme with its contrast, creating a space in the meeting of opposites rather than the logic of linearity. Feldman's music has been called, by respectable critics, ""boring."" The most pared-down exercises in his theories can indeed take a large effort of will to enjoy, casting their atonal meditative glow at the expense of the modern attention span. But despite its 80-minute length, Patterns in a Chromatic Field takes little work to become entranced with; while one must take the initial leap of investing one's trust and concentration in Feldman's unique sensibilities, its moments of crystalline beauty are readily apparent. The piece maintains interest, yet fully realizes Feldman's goal of disassociating pitches from one another. Told in minor seconds and augmented fourths, the piano's thick knots of sound never feel dissonant or abrasive-- simply removed entirely from the game of functional harmony. Curtis' haunting cello work counteracts any lingering hint of academic sterility in Feldman's composition, penetrating deeply with its airy, sustained notes, and almost brutally clean tone (Feldman deemed vibrato a trick for covering up inaccurate musicianship). Karis, meanwhile, manages to retain control over the piano at even the scarcest volumes, and the musicians' interaction is complete and focused, if seemingly weary in later stages of the piece. The tableau in which Feldman is most fondly remembered by friends and students consists of him sitting quietly at the piano, letting loose gentle clusters of notes until each faded entirely, with a cigar hanging from his mouth and the ash gradually collecting on his lap. He grew from an argumentative pupil into a teacher known for his patience and thoughtfulness, channeling John Cage's propensity to find great power in stillness as both a composer and a man. And though Feldman would have probably scoffed at the Romantic concept of music as direct communication from artist to listener, one can't help but feel that as Patterns in a Chromatic Field hangs in the air, it has imparted a piece of the man's quiet, sincere spirit.","John Zorn's Tzadik label issues what it claims to be ""the definitive recording"" of avant-garde neo-classical composer Morton Feldman's infinitely nuanced 1981 composition Patterns in a Chromatic Field.

"Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned",The Prodigy,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13cc0084474cd0bfd79/1:1/w_160/a497858f.jpg,2004-08-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6486-always-outnumbered-never-outgunned/,XL,"A handful of industry insiders and media outlets expected The Prodigy's third album, 1997's The Fat of the Land, to alter America's pop landscape. Those prognosticators were correct: The album (which, fact fans, debuted at #1 in the same week that Radiohead's OK Computer bowed at #21) was a significant modern rock signpost, albeit not for the expected reasons. At the time, The Prodigy had been billed-- along with the Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and Underworld-- as the leaders of the mainstream media's regretfully named ""electronica"" movement, a moment in which electronic dance music was going to finally crossover to MTV and radio in the U.S. However, instead of inspiring you and your band to trade in your guitars for turntables, The Prodigy-- along with unlikely and otherwise unrelated contemporaries such as Korn, Nine Inch Nails, and Rage Against the Machine-- laid the groundwork for the string of mostly limp rap-rock/nu-metal bands that dominated modern rock throughout the late 1990s and into the new millennium. In retrospect, The Prodigy may not have become America's Great Electronic Hopes but ""Firestarter"" could be the world's greatest nu-metal single, a rousing anthem for the Mook Era that was unfortunately taken to heart at Woodstock '99, the abandoned festival that served as rap-rock's peak in popularity and its cultural nadir. OK Computer, ""electronica,"" Rage Against the Machine, Woodstock '99-- it may seem like ancient history, but that divide is the uphill battle The Prodigy face after a seven-year gab between records. The good news is that calling the band ""they"" is more misleading now than it has been in recent years: The Prodigy's fourth album, Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned, is mostly the work of musical linchpin Liam Howlett. Dancer Leeroy Thornhill left the group years ago, and neither Maxim Reality nor Keith Flint is featured here. Flint's bleating on The Prodigy's 2002 comeback single ""Baby's Got a Temper""-- a cringe-worthy attempt at provocation (it's an ode to ""date-rape drug"" Rohypnol) that is thankfully not included-- may have been his final bow with the group. Instead, vocals are provided by Kool Keith, Princess Superstar, and Juliette Lewis (among others), a roster that hints that the seven-year wait between records is less a result of going back to the drawing board as it is trying to coax a finished product from years-old ideas. (One could add Liam Gallagher to that list of past-their-sell-date vocalists, but as Howlett's brother-in-law his appearance could be as much a familial decision as a musical one.) Of the guests, only an underutilized Twista lends the album an air of timeliness. Even more disappointingly, Always Outgunned is a mess of unfocused energy and uncomfortably irrelevant sonics, an odd mix of cartoonish immediacy and tired youth-cult ideas that would be the perfect soundtrack to Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie: The Movie. The results are even more regrettable because they're coming from Howlett, whose string of singles and first two albums with The Prodigy are still crucial and enthralling. Howlett's run of solid singles does remain intact with ""Girls"", a delicious red herring of electro and breakbeats that stands head, shoulders and torso above the rest of the album. It leads into Princess Superstar collab ""Memphis Bells"" and ""Get Up Get Off"", the next closest things to album highlights. The latter features the yeoman-like Twista, who wisely slows his cadence rather than being tempted to race alongside BPMs which-- although hardly pummeling-- are much higher than, say, a Kanye West or R. Kelly production. ""Hotride""-- one of two Lewis collaborations-- is a heavy-handed re-imagination of The Fifth Dimension's ""Up, Up & Away"" (no, really) that aims for sexual but simply isn't sexy. Howlett also reaches back into the 1960s on ""Phoenix"", which liberally samples of The Shocking Blue's ""Love Buzz"", a vain, lifeless attempt to rub shoulders with the current wave of retro 60s garage rock. It's perhaps the record's most telling moment: long-time innovator Howlett aligning himself with the most necrophiliac elements of contemporary rock. The record's ungainly, knuckle-dragging nu-metal trappings overshadow any other pleasant sonic accoutrements-- the bassline from ""Thriller"" that loops throughout much of ""The Way It Is"" or the playful, subtle beats of ""Memphis Bells"". ""Your time is running out,"" Liam Gallagher sneers on album closer ""Shoot Down"", and it's unfortunately a fair warning for The Prodigy themselves. For a record that presumably took seven years to create, Always Outnumbered sounds unsurprisingly outdated but oddly lazy. Perhaps if Howlett officially disbands The Prodigy he can rediscover freedom and inspiration recording under his own name or another moniker, but if this ""it goes to 11"" take on rap-rock is all he's managed to digest and engage with during his absence, it's possible he needn't bother.","Liam Howlett returns with his first album since 1997's smash Fat of the Land was hailed by mainstream media as the future of ""electronica.""

Muswell Hillbillies,The Kinks,by: Jason Josephes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb75e6ef95969322c98/1:1/w_160/65d6f443.gif,2004-08-24 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4458-muswell-hillbillies/,VelvelVelvel,"Muswell Hillbillies came out in 1971, and it was the Kinks' first release on RCA. This explains why you haven't been able to find the little bastard for years, but the good kids at Velvel know what's up; They've reissued this 1971 album (and are filling in the gaps for everything up until 1984). Muswell Hillbillies may very well be the best Kinks album you never heard, a scathing but witty take on urban renewal. No, it's not quite a concept album, more like an idea album-- a buncha songs that are a bit downbeat in theme but lively in execution. What's a Muswell Hillbilly? Well, Muswell Hill was a community in England that the Davies family had to move to after their neighborhood in North London was razed and gentrified. You do the math, kiddo. Muswell Hillbillies features Ray Davies at his whipcracking best, rolling out lyrics like ""The milkman's a spy and the grocer keeps on following me/ And the woman next door's an undercover for the KGB."" It's a pretty simple sound, and one that's more folk and country based than any album they'd ever done. A wonderful brass band turns up on two of the album's best tracks ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"" and ""Alcohol"" (oh, there's a good combination). ""Here Comes the People In Gray"" is a bluesy stomp about a man whose house is being torn down by the city. ""Oklahoma USA"" is a pretty ballad about living in a fantasy world ""with Shirley Jones and Gordon McRae."" But other than the insidiously catchy chorus of ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" (you may be driven to murder if you listen to it too long), I can't find much to complain about with these Hillbillies.","Muswell Hillbillies came out in 1971, and it was the Kinks' first release on RCA.

The Concrete's Always Grayer on the Other Side of the Street EP,VietNam,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a99f9d034d5c69bf3cad/1:1/w_160/bfb7fdf3.gif,2004-08-24 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8535-the-concretes-always-grayer-on-the-other-side-of-the-street-ep/,Vice,"Skater punks, hip-hop vegans, frat boys, art geeks, lesbian indie chicks, mesh-hatted bedroom DJs, listen up: There hasn't been a more influential multimedia reacharound since Grand Royal. I'm talking about the uberhip, post-nihilist Vice empire. Birthed as a hilariously/repulsively degenerate magazine, Vice now embodies a film and TV production company, clothing line, and inevitable record label, presumably spawned as a funnel for all the musical effluvium snagged up by the magazine's cultural colander. Perhaps feeling underrepresented by the tongue-in-cheek electrofunk duo Chromeo (half-comprised of a Vice mag staffer), those cute ex-Canadians have gone and snagged themselves a jangly guitar duo to balance the roster. Vietnam's debut EP arrived at my door with no press info, no web info, and no prelude. The Polaroid images on the cover could've been taken from the magazine's recent ""Party Issue""-- two shaggy dudes with big mustaches offhandedly flicking off the photographer. It's a delicious, Zen-like feeling, not knowing what to expect and expecting nothing. If there's one thing I've learned from years of reading Vice, it's that inconsistency is the norm. I'm wrestling the urge to sum up this EP with a smarmy, shit-eating donkey punch, a far cry from the usual upstanding intellectualism this humble weblication is known for. Taboo, yes, but in homage to the muse I'm just gonna say fuck it and swing away, because one lyrical quotation from vocalist/guitarist Michael William, sung through his nose exactly like an exaggerated Jason Pierce, says it all: ""It makes... No diiiifference... To meeee..."" William and guitarist/vocalist Joshua Garrett so perfectly embody the witty, fuck-if-I-care ambivalence that spikes the copy of Vice magazine that I'm almost waiting for a chime to tell me to turn the page. Over the course of five songs, William and Garrett take turns shamelessly aping the sacred cool of their space-rock forebears (especially Spacemen 3), accompanying their admittedly soulful vocal mimicry on guitars and bass. I'd love to describe this music without comparison, but Vietnam is so self-consciously imitative they practically beg for a bullet list. Starting with a mellow guitar strum pulled straight from ""Heroin""'s reverent intro, the album burrows into Velvets melodrama with ""Too Tired"" and continues straight into the 10-minute anti-anthem of ""Makes No Difference"". Both here-- and later on with the overlong ""Apocalypse""-- William's Dylan-esque drawl is disquieting, since the delivery is transparent but the words debased (ex. ""As you're lying there; you pull your fuckin' cock so you can prove you're not dead""). Musically, though, ""Makes No Difference"" is all VU, stretching out over an opiated tambourine pulse that keeps time against a languid, droning guitar that eventually crashes into a heavy reverbed climax. Here, Sterling Morrison and J. Spaceman lock horns in a hopeless, epic battle of influence. But those lyrics, again, just scream postured detachment-- ""'Cuz baby, this is my life/ And everything else, man, it makes no difference/ To me."" Garrett takes a turn on the mic with ""Princess"", his lifted Lou Reed photorealism perfectly affecting glam trash lyrics like, ""Well, you see she laid up in bed/ Eightballs dance through her head."" The talent with these guys lies in the dead-on pantomiming of their heroes, and their ability to do it with ridiculous sincerity. Which is somewhat respectable given the accuracy of the shot, and is a novelty for the first couple spins. Gauge your interest by your tolerance for rock 'n' roll voyeurism, self-loathing, and Lower East Side style checking. Like an average experience with Vice, whether you love this stuff, laugh at it, or loathe it naturally depends on how many beers have lubed your motor. For that reason I'd say seeing Vietnam in a crowded, low-ceilinged bar with a bottle in hand would yield a much fuller experience than listening to the album in your living room. As of this writing I'm putting down PBR #3, and that five-point-oh rating is starting to feel a little harsh.","The Vice magazine empire's latest release comes courtesy of these strung-out-for-pretend NYC super-hipsters, whose caricatured Spacemen 3 imitation sounds more like mockery than homage.

Battery,Aveo,by: Derek Miller,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15fc0084474cd0bfdc3/1:1/w_160/942274c9.jpg,2004-08-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/387-battery/,Barsuk,"I have a friend. Since he's fictional, I call him as I wish: Marshall. Well, Marshall has a few hang-ups, one of which is Barsuk Records. He can't forgive them for unveiling Death Cab's white-collared weeping on the world. He curses their blue-eyed histrionics in a well-lubed monologue. The age-old frailty, thy name is Gibbard diatribe. Marshall un-surprised me earlier this week when I put on one of Barsuk's latest releases and he started sputtering again. Goth is the new glam; it's our generation's adopted grunge; c'est le nouveau garage. That Marshall. He's so coy when alliterative. But he's right. On their second release, Battery, the Seattle quartet Aveo has Phil Ek manning the boards again, and the results, while perhaps more wide-sprung, sound all-too familiar. Time, that ever-degrading barometer for pop music, has caught up with them. In 2001, their Brit-derived goth-punk was just gaining a foothold and still felt like a novel reinvention; now, its dreary slog is as commonplace as three-chord punk after the millennium's turn. Still, if the timing is a bit suspect (and, remember: this is their second album), technically, Aveo prove sure-handed purveyors of sounds never far gone from pop. Woking, Surrey and all of its punchdrunk-Who-punk of the late 70s is ably represented, just as surely as those indie-darlings The Smiths and The Cure. Cranky guitars grind against the sedate echolalia of these harmonies, and they occasionally manage to enfold you in prickly gossamer. When it works (""The Idiot on the Bike""), rudeboys and marble-eyed teens in thick-eyeliner exist in a tense, unshown turmoil where the chords laid out for each join without dissent. But most of the time, their discord seems falsely summoned, as though choreographed for a fight scene where fists sweep three feet of air and never smack chin. Marshall calls it Chicken Little Fright. He might say that music this oppressive needs room to suffocate itself. On Battery, Aveo poke just enough holes through their thick guitars and smoky atmospheres to let in unwanted air. You're never stifled or left to gasp, and so when the dense, grimy textures they're creating fail, you hear only their Cleaveresque veneer. The album's centerpiece, ""Fistfights with Mr. G"", offers the ideal illustration of these pitfalls. After building a candlewaxed ballad up from the ground, lead singer William Wilson uncurls the line, ""I'll take him with one kick between his bony thighs."" Marshall and I exchange a giggle. Actually, we keep rewinding the song to that point and joining in with our Fraggle Rock falsettos. The song's labyrinthine guitar work and pulsing keyboards crumble underneath this odd disjunction between hymnal sentience and kick-in-the-craw lyricism. It's somewhat like Frank Zappa fronting Joy Division, ""Mudshark"" grunted out atop ""Disorder"". Confusion settles in, but here it has no recourse to the musical buzzword of the last two years: irony. Instead, it's impotent with cheap fuck-the-man irreverence, and ""Mr. G"" lays down limp and stringbeaned atop the song's now-lost transcendence. As Battery spins through its final waltz, Marshall contemplates the pulp of his thumbflesh. He says the whorls remind him of a cartographical system still undiscovered. It's obvious that Aveo, with its tardy amalgam of Cure-rock, has him rethinking Barsuk. It's not enough to forgive them for Gibbard's gum-toothed melancholy, but it may prove a serviceable distraction. Anything to quell his monomania.","Barsuk issues the second full-length of Brit-derived goth-punk from these Seattle-based indie rockers.

Engine Down,Engine Down,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7113d197565213b313/1:1/w_160/c5f51b28.jpg,2004-08-24 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2789-engine-down/,Lookout!,"With their new self-titled record on Lookout!, Engine Down seem poised to join Pretty Girls Make Graves, Sparta, and Taking Back Sunday in the mainstream niche occupied by bands who've planed away the rougher edges of screamo (or ""post-hardcore,"" if you like) and conflated edgy indie deportment with radio-ready pop dynamics, catchy adrenaline-soaked melodies, and a healthy dose of youth culture lifestyle branding (you know-- cute boys, great hair, sensitive yet hard, punk rock as corporate-backed package tour and soundtrack for extreme sports). Often, these kinds of traits pose problems for rock critics, but I'm not going to sling a dour screed that calls for a return to fatuous indie ethics. This is a diagnosis, not a lament. In terms of creative trajectory, Engine Down have traversed a remarkably tidy arc, with a foreseeable terminus toward which they're decidedly aimed (it will be marked by full-on major label support and promotion, MTV rotation, and frequent soundtrack placement). The progression has been accomplished with precisely measured gestures of smoothing and softening. To wit: Engine Down's debut LP for Lovitt Records, Under the Pretense of Present Tense, was prototypical, screamy post-hardcore (to a tee-- the superficially abstruse yet intrinsically meaningless syntax of its title is characteristic of the micro-genre). It was an exercise in stark opposites and crisp corners, with its pronounced loud/soft instrumental binary and Keely Davis' whisper-to-a-scream vocals. While pretty standard stuff, and no more worthy of mainstream attention than spiritual brethren like Four Hundred Years, its sharp melodic sense and inchoate cello arrangements augured evolutions to come. It required two records for Engine Down to bridge the gap between the indie-screamo of Under the Pretense and the radio-hardcore of this new album; they were the roughly coequal Lovitt releases To Bury Within the Sound and Demure. Both of these albums were solid, if slightly strange due to their transitional state, as Engine Down got busy with the chisel and began hewing the sharp corners from their sound. Davis' reedy (yet bell-clear and resonant) vocals rubbed rather oddly against the still lo-fi (if more ambitious, thanks to J. Robbins) production-- the songs weren't quite the easy-to-swallow capsules they would become, but neither were they the quadrangular slabs of the band's debut, and the amorphous shapes were difficult to quantify. The albums retained post-hardcore trappings, but were more melodic, moodier, poppier, screamless, slower, subtler in terms of volume and tempo shifts, and anchored more centrally around the piano and string arrangements. While these records were not of the same caliber as this, their self-titled Lookout! debut, their ambition made it easy for anyone with a little intuition to see a departure like this mounting on the horizon. And so we arrive at Engine Down, wherein the quantum leap the band was clearly straining toward on their previous two records is somewhat achieved. Via a confluence of experience, ambition and glossy production, Engine Down have arrived at a palatable music that, with a little more refinement and promotional support, could cement their place in the mainstream cultural canon. Indeed, the production is going to be the deal-breaker for Engine Down fans, and if you're usually biased against vaguely hardcore bands who put extra coats of lacquer on music that you feel should be raw and untamed, I'd suggest dropping the rating above by a full point. By the same token, if you feel music is well-served by a high production value and view recording techniques as an integral component (Flaming Lips and late Modest Mouse fans, here's looking at you), you may do well to boost the rating into the low eights. Because on this record (for which they've left Lovitt for the somewhat larger Lookout!, which one assumes to be a stepping stone toward Interscope or Epic), Engine Down have employed producer Brian McTernan (Thrice, Hot Water Music, et al.) to achieve starker sound separation, richer tones, and their most dark and rumbling atmospheres to date. The upgrade is most apparent in Davis' vocals, which no longer cut through the arrangements like a dorsal fin, but nestle deeply into their terrain-- instead of being nasal and keening, they're lower, more variegated and shaded, and seem summoned from the diaphragm rather than torn from the lungs. The band is easily recognizable-- Cornbread Compton's primal and syncopated percussion, Davis' vocal theatrics, Jason Wood's metronomic bass, and Jonathan Fuller's winnowing minor-key guitar dirges are all intact-- but recognizable in the way you recognize a childhood friend upon reconnecting with them in adulthood. Paradoxically, in perfecting a music that should resonate in teenaged breasts across the land, Engine Down have grown up. All the earmarks of the new Engine Down are distilled in the opening track, ""Rogue"". It's leaner, more propulsive and snarling than anything they've heretofore produced. Davis' now-restrained vocals dart amid a swirl of feedback and unremitting, distorted bass, climbing a ladder of intensity toward the explosive chorus. The staccato bursts and lilting, plaintive vocals of ""And Done"" recall Sunny Day Real Estate's more expansive moments. ""Cover"" unfolds with relentless intensity as Davis glissades over meaty power chords and tricked-out guitar scribbles with an undeniable vocal authority. Such aggressive fare is juxtaposed by morose torch songs like ""In Turn"", which wafts an ominous arpeggio over swelling strings and Davis' gentle vocals, as the arrangement ramifies in a crescendo of mounting pageantry. ""Etcetera"" is a haunting chamber-song of night sounds and smoldering piano-man emoting, which, of course, gradually builds into a spine-shivering guitar climax that puts the record to rest. Its tone is consummately elegiac and mournful. Given Engine Down's history and implicit future trajectory, it's hard not to perceive ""Etcetera"" as a literal elegy, instead of a figurative critical construct: a requiem for the band they were, which must be interred and memorialized before they can embrace the band they clearly want to become.","Lovitt Records' flagship post-hardcore band relocates to Lookout! and sets Thrice producer Brian McTernan behind the boards to capture a more polished sound.

The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads,Talking Heads,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8839d034d5c69bf3a77/1:1/w_160/48d7eead.jpg,2004-08-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8266-the-name-of-this-band-is-talking-heads/,SireSire,"The liner notes to the long-awaited CD debut of Talking Heads' 1982 live release, The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, recommends other albums by the New York four-piece. The list includes each of the band's studio albums, plus Rhino's four-disc box set Once in a Lifetime; perhaps conspicuous in its absence is that other live Talking Heads album, the far more popular and legendary Stop Making Sense. It may not have been a confrontational omission, but the soundtrack to Jonathan Demme's Talking Heads concert film has long overshadowed The Name of This Band-- so much so that fans have long doubted that this earlier (and superior) live album would ever make it to compact disc. Thankfully, however, Rhino has now not only reissued The Name of This Band, but has also taken a cue from the recent ""Special Edition"" of Stop Making Sense by adding 13 tracks which weren't on the original version. Part of the charm and power of Stop Making Sense the film is that it almost purely translates the live experience of a rock show audience rather than the experience of a touring band. There is no backstage fly-on-the-wall stuff, no dressing room preparations, on-the-bus interviews, caterers, hotel clerks or road managers. Rather, it's the snapshot of one live document with the camera playing the role of a punter, trained completely on the band in an attempt to recreate the experience of attending the show. It works so well that it's almost jarring when the camera finally closes in on audience members dancing in the aisles during the show's finale. Musically, this approach is a bit limiting. As powerful as Talking Heads were at the time, Stop Making Sense still functions as a live document of one band at one moment in time (well, not technically-- the film was actually recorded over three nights). For a group such as this, who paid attention to the musical world around them, deftly and quickly folding outside influences as seemingly disparate as disco, afrobeat, funk and new wave into their already unique sound, The Name of This Band's approach-- collecting various live performances over a four-year period-- is more revelatory and rewarding. It functions as both a timeline in which a listener can trace the band's development and definitive proof that some of their supposed great departures-- particularly an accomplished and complex rhythm section-- were there from the onset. The result is both the best career-spanning snapshot of and single-purchase introduction to Talking Heads-- odd accolades for a live record-- and a treat for longtime fans. The record's title refers to band leader David Byrne's dry, cheeky, no-nonsense stage patter in the band's early days, the years documented on the set's first disc. ""This song is called 'New Feeling' and that's what it's about,"" Byrne begins, leading the four-piece group with both his animated, acrobatic vocal tics and affectations and the band's nervous, twitchy music. All bugged eyes and neurosis, Byrne spits and churns his way through the best tracks from the band's first three albums. His oft-criticized, stream-of-consciousness language (best illustrated by the ""Busy Doin' Nothin'""-like driving directions and matter-of-fact descriptions of the benefits of his apartment building and favorite federal laws in ""Don't Worry About the Government"") ground the band's more aggressive, robust playing music. At times, Byrne gets a little punchy as well, injecting anger and bemusement into ""I'm Not in Love"" and adding a bitter tone to ""The Big Country"", transforming it from the hazy thoughts of an airplane traveler to a more combative rumination on the urban/rural divide. It would be a candidate for the official anthem of the mythical Blue States if the so-called culture wars and other right-wing chicanery continue to drive their regrettable wedge into the country. When required, however, Byrne can craft an expressive lyrics, as indicated by the literate detail of tracks such as ""Psycho Killer"", ""Life During Wartime"" and ""Found a Job"". And on an early version of ""Electricity (Drugs)""-- one of three tracks first released on a rare Warner promo release-- the band is sleepy and drony, countering the lyrical claims that ""I'm charged up."" That track is also one of only three that is repeated on both discs, although on Disc 2, it's in as the more familiar ""Drugs (Electricity)"". The second disc borrows a page from Stop Making Sense's playbook and recreates the entire set from stops along the band's Remain in Light tour, including a handful of tracks from the much-bootlegged February 1981 performance at Tokyo's Nakano Sun Palace. Expanded to a 10-piece band that included Adrian Belew on guitar and Bernie Worrell on keyboards, the bulk of Disc 2's material gives its studio versions a run for the money. Belew's nuanced guitar work, more confident contributions from the core members, and the added rhythmic dimension and heft are frequently jawdropping, but the loose beats and a playful Byrne keep claims of muso nonsense at arm's length. The set itself is ordered nearly chronologically, which neatly and accidentally conforms to the logic of the album's running order. Within the set, the band builds the rhythmic density of their tracks, kicking off with a quartet of songs from their first two albums (including second appearances by ""Psycho Killer"" and ""Stay Hungry""), before the funk-influenced ""Cities"" and African rhythms of ""I Zimbra"". Those two fractured, beat-heavy and offbeat tracks guide the audience into the final two-thirds of the set, which is mostly built from the polyrhythmic Remain in Light. Along the way, a melodic ""Animals""-- perhaps the set's weakest track in its studio version-- easily surpasses the original, led by a gorgeous harmonic middle section. Last week, Rhino also released an 18-track Best of Talking Heads set. Spanning the band's entire 11-year career, it's well-selected considering its considerable limitations and is arguably more inclusive than The Name of This Band, but it is also unnecessary as anything other than a grab bag of familiar radio hits. This live album, on the other hand, is not simply a fans-only document or a curio or a means of padding the discography or exploiting fans. In many ways, it's the best one-stop document of what made Talking Heads one of the post-punk era's most dynamic and urgent bands, and a succinct argument for the merits of synthesizing rock with emerging, potentially oppositional sounds. The latter is a lesson that will hopefully be learned by today's rock artists.","Never before issued on CD, Rhino expands Talking Heads' classic 1982 live document to two discs-- the second of which captures the 1980-81 Remain in Light tour, which saw the band fleshed out to 10 members.

Radical Connector,Mouse on Mars,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e6c0084474cd0c358f/1:1/w_160/435ba2d3.jpg,2004-08-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5467-radical-connector/,Thrill Jockey,"As music makers in an electronic sphere, the nature and practice of repetition is something Mouse on Mars have had to confront. While they've often kept a finger on the club music button through remixes and various associations with the dance community, the Mouse on Mars method has always involved finding ways to knock the loops out of joint and upset the sort of internalized expectations that come from a lifetime of music listening. The element of surprise is crucial to their aesthetic, even though the change-ups are often subtle, which means serious attention to detail is a must. If they've taken longer to record and release albums than their contemporaries, it's because of this need to micromanage. Mouse on Mars on record are fussy and exacting. Their full-length portfolio shows a similar inability to leave well enough alone. Mouse on Mars aren't in the business of repeating themselves, and even now, eight albums deep, it's difficult to describe one Mouse on Mars full-length by comparing it to another. Certain qualities overlap and there is a distinctive ""sound,"" but each album picks a handful of ideas and explores them to varying depths. The next one then picks up somewhere else and goes. 2001's Idiology was unique because ideas were so numerous. Each track seemed to point to a possible new direction, and it seemed as if the next album could be anything from a screamo noisefest to an electro prog opera. You'd think we would have learned by now; it turns out that the threads running through the long-awaited new album Radical Connector are not found anywhere on Idiology. This is Mouse on Mars' most conventional album, with vocals on every track (by drummer Dodo Nkishi and Sonig fellow traveler Niobe), and it's also their most predictable in structure. Each song builds an internally consistent songworld and is content with its boundaries. If you're a fan of Mouse on Mars' more experimental side (hand up here behind the keyboard) it helps to approach Radical Connector on its own terms. Though it is indeed pop, Radical Connector has an unusual sound. Nkishi and Niobe have strong voices even untreated, but their vocals are vocoded, chopped, and phased to seem as unnatural as possible while generally avoiding robotic cliches. Several tracks with Nkishi on lead feature an intentionally thick and sludgy low end, with the bass and drums merging into a lunging, leering, lumbering beast. And though heightened danceability has been a key selling point of this record, most tracks are a half-step slow. ""Wipe That Sound"", for example, is nimble on its face with excellent ""oo-way oo-way"" disco background vox, a command to ""kick the can"" (do they play that in Germany?), and a gurgling acid bassline, but there's no way the plodding tempo is going to fill a dancefloor. Same goes for ""Mine Is in Yours"", probably the purest song on the album, with a simple chord structure whose catchiness becomes apparent when the electronics lay out and a ringing electric guitar takes over-- unique and excellent, but not dance music by any stretch. The best rhythms are left for Niobe. On two of her four tracks, she assumes the role of a distant and aloof diva, intoning cryptic lyrics (""When the boats go round/ Turn on back to a spiral"") behind several layers of processing. ""Send Me Shivers"" fits the tech-house template, with a steady chug of a rhythm hypnotic and groovy enough to earn its 6 minutes. The rhythmic accents are pure Mouse on Mars playfulness, however, with two stabs every other bar sounding like pistons from a Dr. Seuss machine. ""Evoke an Object"" is comparatively sleek and sexy, with a metallic sheen and a persistent glow of distortion, and though the beat goes on for almost 9 minutes and threatens to go into full-bore house several times, it always maintains a hint of off balance herky-jerkiness. ""Spaceship"" is an altogether different animal, a prelude of political lyrics (""The inexact inquiry/ Profitable madness/ Society/ The abstract variety"") over chaotic drum hits and wind-up noises that slowly gather like a storm before erupting into deeply goofy and great funk hinging on a rapid cut-up of the song's title. Niobe proves to be as sure a fit with Mouse on Mars' current sound as Laetitia Sadier was in the late 90s. Though reference points like Daft Punk and Prince have rightly been thrown around, Radical Connector is in fact a strange album that doesn't sound like much else. Subversion is still here, but this time it comes in the form of texture, most of which is purely electronic in origin. There is something fundamentally ugly about the sound of Radical Connector, despite its song-oriented tendencies, but it's a quality present for contrast and complexity, and not as a statement on its own. The tension resulting from opposing forces continues to fuel for Mouse on Mars' fire, even when they're experimenting in the realm of pop.","Mouse on Mars have yet to repeat themselves. Radical Connector boasts the longest gestation of any Mouse on Mars album since the duo formed over a decade ago, and the departure on this record is dramatic enough that it's easy to imagine at least two other transistional LPs between it and 2001's landmark Idiology. Here, the duo shake their progressive IDM constructs for alien club bangers.

Outta Sight/Outta Mind,Datsuns,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ab9d034d5c69bf3ad7/1:1/w_160/8e969265.jpg,2004-08-23 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11716-outta-sightoutta-mind/,V2,"Like squatters in a condemned building, The Datsuns have set up camp in the early 70s and refuse to leave. They're trying to evoke an era when every band rocked asses and arenas, groupies were nubile and plentiful, guitars blasted through walls, and solos lasted all night. But it's all so much rose-colored hindsight, a fantasy by musicians too young to have experienced the glory days firsthand and therefore condemned to recreate it with only a few scribbled notes and hazy childhood memories. The Datsuns attempted to revive the classic rock era on their self-titled debut album in 2002, but the results sounded messy and anonymous, devoid of humor and personality. While its title would seem to suggest some of sort of Wilco-like transformation, the band's follow-up, Outta Sight/Outta Mind, instead offers more of the same; it's a considerable improvement over the original-- perhaps due to production by Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones-- but that's not saying much. If their debut was Paleolithic in its riffs and sexual politics, then Outta Sight/Outta Mind is merely Mesolithic. Something closer to late Neolithic would be nice. While The Datsuns' sound is slightly harder and heavier than their garage-rock contemporaries, the band is still confined to the genre's constricted song format. Instead of indulging in long, screeching guitar solos or groove-driven noise freakouts, they adhere pretty closely to the verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/solo/chorus/finale template throughout Outta Sight/Outta Mind. This self-imposed constraint hems in other tendencies: Christian Datsun is a capable guitar player, but his solos feel compacted and listless when confined to three-minute songs. They could be powerhouse showcases for his fretwork, but usually they just sound obligatory. It doesn't help that The Datsuns' pop-length tracks tend to substitute mindless misogyny and awkward phrasings for hooks and meaningful lyrics. Like The Darkness, Dolf Datsun tries to inject his lyrics with an undercurrent of adolescent sexuality, but without Justin Hawkins' self-awareness and sense of goofy fun, the subtext quickly becomes the text. ""Girl's Best Friend"" refers to Dolf's dick. It's too easy to guess what ""Cherry Lane"" is about. Here's a hint: ""A boy is a boy/ But a girl is a child,"" Dolf sings, ""They mustn't be broken, they mustn't be harmed."" I'm not saying rock music should ever have to adhere to political correctness, but by now, this is pure cliche-- irony without a punchline. Which is too bad, as The Datsuns show new promise on tracks like the lamenting ""What I've Lost"". But their caveman take on 70s nostalgia-- simultaneously misguided and entirely too obvious-- renders them mostly forgettable and entirely ineffectual. The Donnas sound more depraved and dangerous, and even Jet has better hooks. This one will soon live up to its title.","And speaking of garage-rock, here's an afterthought from a band you could give two shits about. Yes, of course it's awful.

Alive & Amplified,The Mooney Suzuki,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b3eb335119a49ed78d/1:1/w_160/f6b2c39d.jpg,2004-08-23 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5419-alive-amplified/,Red Ink,"The Mooney Suzuki have earned their shot at mainstream acceptance-- after spending years touring and suffering countless accusations of stealing The Strokes' shtick (despite the fact that they formed years before The Strokes and generally embrace a pre-Velvet Underground aesthetic), the members of one of New York's most consistently underrated garage-rock revival groups are understandably fed up with their relative obscurity. For Alive & Amplified, the band has scrubbed off the caked-on Detroit grime of Electric Sweat and hit the studio with hot-shit production team The Matrix, whose recent Extreme Makeover work with Liz Phair understandably led to suspicion among many of the band's devotees. The resulting album is a glossy, well-polished document of a band reluctantly selling its soul in the name of wider exposure. The real problem here is that The Matrix crew has absolutely nothing to offer the band, whose raucous and refreshingly genuine Nuggets fetishizing arguably reached its apex on their previous release. Where Jim Diamond's bare-bones production allowed the band space to develop their self-contained energy in concise bursts of inspired proto-punk homage, The Matrix's luster robs Suzuki's music of its greasy authenticity. To say that the album is over-produced is an understatement; you could bounce a quarter off of most of these songs. Sammy James, Jr.'s vocals have been unwisely pushed to the forefront of the mix, accentuating his lyrical awkwardness, while James and Graham Tyler's dual guitar attack has been dissected and isolated, leading to a markedly sterile sound. In the past, each element of the band's sound blended harmoniously in a melange of mod and classic rock influences, but this album is covered in the thick fingerprints of The Matrix team's calculated, high-end sheen. Opener ""Primitive Condition"" immediately finds the band in uncharacteristically clumsy form. The song's generic country-fried guitar hook is forced and uninspired, while James offers perhaps his most insipid lyrics to date, cribbing from The Bloodhound Gang's notebook with lines like, ""Let's get in a primitive position/ We're just fancy animals with hands/ And animal glands."" The track, like much of the album, is overwhelmed by derivative classic rock bloat, and the lean, muscular sound of their unabashed early Who reverence is sorely missed. ""Alive & Amplified"", the album's first single, sounds specifically constructed for mass consumption, and the song, with its tired 70s dinosaur rock replication and overbearing chorus, insinuates itself with the subtlety of a battering ram. ""Legal High"" is so watered-down and ineffectual that it would feel at home next to a Vines track, while ""Loose n' Juicy"" and ""Hot Sugar"" achieve a level of unremarkable blues-rock plagiarism worthy of The Blues Brothers. The album's few high points, such as they are, hint at the band's former glory-- ""New York Girls"" just barely touches bases with The New York Dolls, and ""Sometimes Somethin'"" is an effective imitation of overwrought Stones balladry, though it sounds out of place after the frantic and humorless ""Shake That Bush Again"". Stories of the grueling recording process that spawned Alive & Amplified provide some insight into the album's general blandness: James has said that 90% of what The Matrix presented sounded like ""someone else's multi-platinum hit."" Half of that sounds about right; this certainly doesn't sound like The Mooney Suzuki, even if it does sound strikingly similar to every other ""garage"" cash-in band on the market. But the chances of this album going platinum are about the same as The Mooney Suzuki providing music for a video game soundtra-- oh, right. Hell, I suppose stranger things have happened.","In one of the most unexpected career moves of the decade, NYC garage-rockers The Mooney Suzuki team up with Avril Lavigne songwriting trio The Matrix.

The Shaggs,The Shaggs,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b35e6ef959693206d9/1:1/w_160/a79a18f3.jpg,2004-08-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7088-the-shaggs/,RounderRounder,"I've always found it odd that the music of The Shaggs usually elicits either side-splitting laughter or mesmerized awe. Both reactions are surprisingly extreme, because The Shaggs' catalog, collected in its entirety on this rehashing of a 1988 Rounder compilation, has always struck me as awkward and poignant, with subtle hints of tragedy lurking beneath the music's surface. The Shaggs' backstory is legendary: Sometime circa 1968, the Wiggin sisters Dot, Betty, and Helen, at the insistence of their enigmatic, overbearing father Austin Wiggin, Jr., formed a family pop band, presumably to fulfill one of dad's vicarious fantasies. Only one year after devoting their energies toward music lessons (they were home-schooled to help maintain musical focus), the Wiggins entered a cheap recording studio and emerged with Philosophy of the World, which amazingly became one of the great obscure gems of all time after its NRBQ-backed re-release in the 1980s. If their initial popularity was contingent on chance, The Shaggs' longevity is no fluke-- their music is brutally honest and has always been primarily informed by adolescent guilt (""I learned my lesson never to roam""), an open love of innocuous pop (""my companion is my radio""), shame (""sometimes I feel bottled up inside""), and a profound sense of obligation to family. ""Who Are Parents"" posits that kids who ""do things their own way [and] don't know what life really means,"" and that strict adherence to ""certain rules,"" though seemingly ""cruel,"" is the family ideal. Discussions of the Wiggins' dexterity as pop musicians are usually relegated to the two extremes of The Shaggs spectrum: Their complete lack of traditional musical sense is either uproarious or somehow transcendent in its crudeness. The uniform complexity of The Shaggs' songs, and the fortitude of their nascent musicianship, is often overlooked. The 2001 tribute album to The Shaggs emphasizes just how tenuous and complicated their compositions really are; most of the artists perform their chosen covers with the reluctance and reserve of a sight-reading community theater pianist. And who could blame them? There is no discernible meter or chord structure to follow, and The Shaggs' melodies are pretty much constructed at random, becoming a series of bastardized scale exercises. But this isn't a simple case of lead singer Dot making up the tune as she pleases. Her sister Betty unfailingly sings every arbitrary note in unison. Whether this was the result of constant practice (another disconcerting hint at the likely atmosphere of ""jam sessions"" in the Wiggin household) or some kind of psychic sibling intuition is anyone's guess. The Shaggs' later material, which consists entirely of the mid-70s LP Shaggs' Own Thing, falls back on amateurish bubblegum country, underscoring the singularity and starkness of their debut. But even this comparatively mediocre record packs a subversive punch. The title track, a duet between father Wiggin and eldest brother Robert, is particularly disturbing-- in the song, Austin catches another man (his son) ""sneakin' out"" with his girl and ""doin' it"" with her. I guess no one in the recording booth interrupted to explain the Oedipal implications to the (presumably) oblivious parties involved. Most who have heard The Shaggs know where they stand. To those who think the music is ""hilarious,"" this compilation isn't essential, but will certainly provide more fodder for easy mocking; to those who worship every note the band ever recorded, you almost certainly own this album already in one of its previous incarnations, and are advised to wait it out for the Philosophy of the World five-disc deluxe box set, which includes the complete unedited session tapes and a 300-page booklet of assorted Foot Foot sketches.","Creation Records reissues this 1988 compilation from these remarkable 1960s outsiders, famously dubbed ""better than The Beatles"" by Frank Zappa.

WYHIWYG,DILL,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb83eb335119a49eca5f/1:1/w_160/805018a5.jpeg,2004-08-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2567-wyhiwyg/,Flyrec,"Self-respecting journalists pick up on the details of their subjects the first time around, and if they don't, they make them up. The objective interpretation of reporting isn't so far off the subjective work of discussing music; certainly the demand for information is the same, and if one favors hard facts above plain fiction, it's only by a small margin. I could have presented a story about how Japan's DILL (Yuji Inoue) was apparently unaware that his static-y music-- spliced, cut and pasted like the best turn-of-the-millennium electronica-- was at least three years too late to make a difference, and it might very well have been good journalism. There are plenty of musical examples to support that claim, not least of which are covered in Pitchfork reviews of Autechre, Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Plaid and Hecker. But sometimes, it's worth missing the obvious in favor of catching something better. WYHIWYG's details are minute but endearing. DILL's music seems complicated in its construction, but comes out flawed instead of ""glitch,"" live instead of quantized, and modern instead of post-modern. The cuts and actual glitches are often reminiscent of considerably colder efforts by Autechre or Markus Popp, though are less experiments in electronically controlled chaos than the carvings and angles of sharp, ambitious ambient music. Inoue uses cello, piano and soft female vocals modestly, placing them strategically throughout the album's 37-minute program; he uses enough organic source material that the songs seem only just out of reach for a particularly precise chamber pop ensemble. In fact, the minimalist arrangements often exploit so few elements that I'm reminded of his cousins in Onkyo, who approach improvisation with the same knack for naturalism and understatement. Inoue's music is a lot closer to Brian Eno's classically informed ambience than Otomo Yoshihide's space-age free improvisation, but is just as Spartan and strangely attractive. The tracks with vocals stand out immediately; Inoue has a knack for supporting clear, seductive melodies with restless, jittery glitch. The brief ""Tena"" features the rounded, vocoder-affected alto of Akiko Sasaki over a minimal bassline and collage-style backdrop. Radio static comes and goes, and on the second verse I can hear bits of Eastern percussion, a falling siren and near atonal synthesizer clips. Yet, despite potential overcrowding, the track feels barely there. ""Up Down to There"" is similarly, deceptively busy, but uses its glitched pitter-patter to form the hint of a beat. A looped succession of sine waves introduces a two-chord progression and simple synth melody that wouldn't sound out of place on one of the Cluster/Eno records. However, the cut-up vocals about 6 minutes in remind me of Prefuse 73, or some such practitioner of digital-age voice design. The song also makes the case that Björk should have listened to DILL prior to recording the vocally obsessed Medulla. The anatomies of the individual tracks should interest fans of that good old dead IDM, especially those who felt its apex was Autechre's Confield. DILL's beats favor seemingly random successions of hi-hat and bass drum, and nary a backbeat within earshot. ""Onpotts"", with still more ingeniously manipulated vocal, pipes in a soft, jazzy shuffle (not schaffel, Cologners), and the shoegazed ""Won Noefte Jam"" features live drumming and a melancholy vocal duet. However, Inoue is hardly content to while away into gray bliss, opting to rinse the beat under his software and letting the singer carry the tune over a single-note-obsessed guitar. Dozens of things like this happen on each track on WYHIWYG, and in the hands of a lesser artist, could easily overwhelm the senses. DILL is more interested in revealing things few people notice, and in the process, creates something obviously beautiful.","What you hear is what you get, and what you hear is this Japanese glitch artist's reinvention of classic Warp Records fare.

Half Smiles of the Decomposed,Guided by Voices,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfc85e6ef95969323463/1:1/w_160/041604e6.jpg,2004-08-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3599-half-smiles-of-the-decomposed/,Matador,"The most talented player in his league labors in Midwestern obscurity for years. Then, without warning, he hits upon just the right supporting cast, and strings together an impressive streak of victories. After a historic three-peat, he briefly walks away from the spotlight and his team, only to return amid new surroundings, having discarded his classic squad in favor of new, younger collaborators. With this new lineup, the player profits off his star power for another long stretch, occasionally offering up fleeting glimpses of his prior greatness, but mostly overstaying his welcome, whittling his adoring public down to a small core of blindly loyal fans. To call Robert Pollard the Michael Jordan of indie rock is a wince-inducing comparison if ever there was one, but it's hard to ignore the parallel lines on a slow decline. Correspondingly, it makes sense to treat the release of what has been declared the final Guided by Voices album like an athlete's number-retiring ceremony, with Pollard's Daltrey-fringe jacket being lifted to the rafters and a bronze statue of the singer in mid-kick unveiled outside Pitchfork HQ while we all sing ""Game of Pricks"". Despite the piñata status of the Pollardverse over the last decade, where every rookie staffer was given a practice thwack at the latest tossed-off GBV side project, the majority of us can't help but feel a little sad to see the group's credits roll. It must be noted, however, that the band's death was not a sudden one. The romanticized mythology of Guided by Voices in the mid-90s may have been one of the greatest tales of indie lore: A gang of bored Midwestern middle-agers, fueled by ethanol, gather nightly for basement recording sessions, and in doing so happen to lay down some of the greatest pop anthems ever poorly recorded. No author could've dreamt up a more ridiculous cast, with a mic-swinging frontman sweating five songs a day and leading an amateur band full of impossibly wonderful names like Tobin Sprout, Mitch Mitchell, and Greg Demos. But with Under the Bushes Under the Stars closing out that incarnation's three-album summit, Pollard chose to molt and start anew, dismissing the ""Dayton lineup"" and replacing them with the snakeskin-boot professionalism of Cobra Verde. From that point on, GBV was all but synonymous with The Robert Pollard Experience, a vehicle for Bob to choose whatever personnel he calculated most likely to achieve his new dreams of crossover radio success. In the inane court of sellout justice, one could probably throw the book at Uncle Bob, but far more distressing was that he seemed to misplace most of the group's strengths amidst an ever-growing pile of side project detritus. Half Smiles of the Decomposed, like the preceding Earthquake Glue, finds Pollard aiming the bow of the GBV ship back towards some semblance of what made their fuzzy early days memorable. While the lo-fi sound Guided by Voices perfected has long since become a lazy fashion statement of slapdash indie bands, Pollard's anthems always sounded paradoxically hollow drenched in stadium production, and Half Smiles settles upon a more comfortable mid-fi compromise that reflects virtually none of ex-producer Ric Ocasek's syrupy brightness. What continues to elude Pollard's memory, unfortunately, is the economy of arrangement that used to set his music apart, melodic viruses that promptly deposited their hook-filled DNA before immediately perishing. Even the shortest songs on Half Smiles (""Girls of Wild Strawberries"", ""Gonna Never Have to Die"") would be the GBV equivalent of a side-long suite on older LPs, their 2-minute runtimes inflated by such routine features as second verses and chorus repetitions. Unsurprisingly, these shorter songs are also the best-- ""Girls"" a bright acoustic march, ""Gonna Never"" a tattling sing-along laced with startling synth. ""Closets of Henry"", meanwhile, proves that Pollard will never lose the ability to trigger the fist-pump reflex, contracting listeners' biceps with mere drum rolls and ohhhh's. Yet lyrically, Pollard continues to move in a more literal and reflective direction, resuming recent albums' obsessions with deconstructing his much-beloved World's Rockingest Alcoholic persona. If opening his band's final statement with a song called ""Everyone Thinks I'm a Raincloud"" and chanting ""for far too looooong"" over the closing fadeout doesn't give you a snapshot of Bob's current attitude, look no further than the ominous crawl of ""Sleepover Jack"", as dark a song as can be found in the swollen GBV discog. Sounding every wrinkle of his nearly 50 years, Pollard sounds knocked around by the song's slapping, incessant guitar riffs, sighing, \x93I know/ You're gonna fuck up my makeup/ You're gonna make up my fuckup."" Every GBV release (yes, even Do the Collapse) since their heyday has had a pocketful of bright spots, though, and the mediocre filler that rounds out Half Smiles' lineup is, sadly, par for the band's late-era course. Slow, limp songs like ""Window of My World"" and ""Tour Guide at the Winston Churchhill Memorial"" can't come close to even the outtakes (Suitcase) of the outtakes (King Shit and the Golden Boys) from the band's classic lineup, and album-sequencing-freak Pollard continues to neglect the sort of 10-second fragment interludes that used to suture their ADD-stricken albums into cohesion. And so the rock star dreams of Dayton's most prolific grade-school teacher reach their exhausted conclusion, the suitably bombastic career-ender ""Huffman Prairie Flying Field"" slyly announcing, ""If that's what you want to hear/ Then that's what I will sell you."" That may be exactly what we're about to get in the post-GBV era, as Pollard mentions in a recent interview that his next release will be a double-album (shock!) of forgotten tracks from his shoebox archives. While retiring the name of GBV may be no more than a symbolic move, it's possible that leaving behind the franchise, its expectations, and its faded momentum is just the thing to relight a flame in the man of 10,000 songs.","For a while there, it seemed as though it would never end. But with this album, after a 20-year career, Robert Pollard finally lies to rest one of the greatest bandnames in rock history, and though it seems a purely symbolic gesture, we'd be lying if we said we weren't bawling right now.

Free The Bees,A Band of Bees,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45fea9e61561daa4ec3/1:1/w_160/b6bc018d.jpg,2004-08-22 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1124-free-the-bees/,EMI,"I wanted to write a concept review of The Bees' latest, if only because the best way to convey how shamelessly Free the Bees apes its antecedents would be to shamelessly ape Pitchfork alum Brent DiCrescenzo. Yet half-baked imitation, no matter how conceptually apt, is a recipe for mediocrity. That's probably news to The Bees, whom you may have known as A Band of Bees on their debut, Sunshine Hit Me. Back then, the group was a duo, recording in a shed, and improbably following their Beta Band-like flights of electropop fancy into tropicalia and even reggae. This time out, The Bees hunkered down in Abbey Road, with four new members and major-label backing. ""These are the ghosts I've made,"" sings Paul Butler on the opening track, but it sounds more like the studios' ghosts made him. Had I written my concept review, you'd be reading about how Inspector Pinot Grigio of Interpol (the agency, not the band, natch) apprehended master masterpiece-forger Rolf Otterloo, the man behind high-profile fake Van Goghs, Gaugins, Mondrians and one work by Xu Beihong for a museum in Beijing. The only difference between a fake and an original work of art is in people's perception of them, the old copycat would say. The Inspector would bristle behind his martial mustache. Yet no amount of reverb-drenched vocals, acid-flashback harmonies or Hammond organs can prevent The Bees from being a bunch of blokes from the Isle of Wight who happen to have better record collections than songwriting abilities. Listen: The White Stripes didn't become famous because they sounded like Led Zeppelin; they became famous because they wrote great songs. The Bees move from what amounts to The Creation and Skip Bifferty covers to the Rufus Thomas impression that is ""Chicken Payback"" without ever developing a personality. There's something offensive about a band that cops the pose of unadorned 60s garage-rock and calls that an album. I expect affected earnestness from MTV emo bands, not the group that recorded ""Binnal Bay"". ""It's fake authenticity,"" the Inspector would declare. ""It's like all the architects imitating Greek friezes and columns in The Fountainhead, while Howard Roark went out and made true heroic buildings that actually belonged to his time. This one's a pretty love song, though... The Temptations meet The Penguins."" ""It's called 'I Love You',"" Otterloo would reply, stooping over his antediluvian record player. ""Here, let me play you the single, 'Wash in the Rain'."" ""They're so busy citing appropriately hip reference points that they don't have time to come up with memorable lyrics or melodies,"" the Inspector would retort, oblivious to the awkward unreality of the middle-aged European detective as rock-music scholar. ""'Try and I fail, and sometimes I even succeed'? Is this what passes for cleverness nowadays? Then again, at least they're not Ocean Colour Scene."" There would be no struggle as the Inspector gently applied the handcuffs to his old nemesis. The strains of what sounded like the opening bars of ""Ticket to Ride"" would still be jangling from the battered old record player as the album spun to its last track. ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,"" I would tell Editor-in-Chief Ryan Schreiber via e-mail, and he would fire back some terse reply that sewed up the whole ridiculous conceit.","Garage-y British psych-rockers' second album finds them further mining the 1960s for inspiration, but offering no new ideas-- or decent songs-- of their own.

River Through Howling Sky,Richard Youngs,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aadfb1335d7bf1699743/1:1/w_160/4ca1d68d.jpg,2004-08-22 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8842-river-through-howling-sky/,Jagjaguwar,"Scottish multi-instrumentalist Richard Youngs is a man whose career defies easy summary. Both as a solo artist and in collaboration with such like-minded cohorts as Simon Wickham-Smith and Acid Mothers Temple's Makoto Kawabata, the prolific Youngs has always made highly personalized music that forges improbable links between traditional folk, musique concrete and avant-garde electronic minimalism. His back catalog is a maze of lane changes and about-faces, so it should come as no surprise that River Through Howling Sky manages to simultaneously be a continuation of his past as well as a new departure. This is Youngs' fifth solo release on Jagjaguwar in five years, and it finds him turning away from the fingerpicked acoustic guitars and pastoral folk melodies that helped leaven the experimentation of 2002's May and 2003's Airs of the Ear. Instead, Youngs casts the listener into a vast, inhospitable landscape here, occupied by little but his keening voice, violent stabs of electric guitar, and tottering percussion that follows along reluctantly behind him like a thirsty burro. This skeletal mixture combined with his almost ritualistic use of repetition and epic song lengths make this perhaps the most intense, comfortless work of his career. His guitar is the most immediately arresting element of ""Fountain of Light"", the 8-minute opening track that quickly establishes the album's parameters. Utilizing a torrent of piercing, boundlessly sustained single notes, Youngs' playing here is highly reminiscent of Moonyean-era Loren MazzaCane Connors. Like Connors, Youngs is able to conjure up a universe of solitary desperation with incredible efficiency, sending wave after wave of distressed pleas skyward like signal flares. This guitar onslaught stands in jarring contrast to Youngs' vocals. His voice is as pure and sweet as a field of Highland clover, and in the past he has (at least occasionally) used it on the type of tunes that you might expect to hear hummed by a shepherd. But on River Through Howling Sky, his vocals are unmoored and wandering, following the open-ended melodic structures of songs like ""Blossom"" or the marathon ""Red Cloud Singular"" up countless false peaks and through endless blind canyons. When on the latter he gradually intones, ""I see a river/ I see where it flows/ I see infinity,"" it's with a sense of impending mortality rather than joyful discovery, especially with those ominous guitar thunderheads looming above him. Listening to River Through Howling Sky straight through in its entirety can be an exhausting experience, but if one approaches it in the proper frame of mind, it can also be a rewarding one. It's certainly not the record to put on if you're in the mood for pure entertainment, but if you're a listener who enjoys the occasional glimpse of a talented artist doing some strenuous off-map spiritual exploring, Youngs has again outfitted you for an adventure. And it's an expedition made even more harrowing when you realize that your guide has no more idea where he's going than you do.","Glaswegian experimental folk artist and former collaborator of Acid Mothers Temple's Makoto Kawabata returns to a more meditative style.

Theory, however, tends to oppose creation, and jazz today is often either a painfully intellectual or quaintly nostalgic affair, leaving few modern performers that aim both for visceral impact and musical progress. That aim at the visceral is what makes The Vandermark Five, a quintet of white guys in turtlenecks, so unexpectedly refreshing. The avant-jazz scene is filled with those who wish to expand its sonic palette, or redefine the term ""jazz"" entirely within a world of samples and post-modern jumble. It's a rare group that purposefully and successfully advances the movement into modernity within the confines of a fairly standard ensemble, and the fact that traditionalists have questioned V5's ""legitimacy"" only strengthens their position.

Though Ken Vandermark's playing bears the stamp of Sun Ra's influence, it contains none of the great spaceman's studio experimentation; while his style is sometimes compared to John Zorn's, one doesn't get the same sense that Vandermark's out to prove anything. His failure to indulge the time-honored Jazz tradition of honing persona and mystique may end up cementing him within the sidenotes, but it allows his playing to come across as sincere, egoless, and confident-- an important vibe to transmit in such obtuse musical territory. Confidence is an audible quality in any improvisational performance, but perhaps none more so than free jazz. It might seem anti-intuitive to attribute the success of a braying, squeaking solo to nearly imperceptible subtleties, but it's the performer's intense vision and forward momentum that can give the music its force, or render it aseptic. From the first freakout of opener ""Outside Ticket [for John Gilmore]"", the listener is ready to place trust in Vandermark and his tight ensemble, rendered nearly telepathic in their musical communication from years of live performance. Vandermark's compositions strike a balance between surface-level impact and deeper complexity. In one of the album's most solid tracks, ""Knock Yourself Out [for Jean-Michel Basquiat]"", drummer Tim Daisy and bassist Kent Kessler work in tandem to constantly shift the downbeat, and flow from solid groove to controlled chaos in a heartbeat. Vandermark, Jeb Bishop and Dave Rempis begin with a straight ahead funky octave hook, moving quickly to far-out territory and back again; each return to the theme increasingly explores the polyrhythms inherent in phasing or inverting it, and each departure becomes more abstract and minimal. Their juxtaposition of such a standard hook with their wild soloing could be seen as humorous or sardonic, but the passion with which it's all presented instead draws a connecting line from past to present. In ""Telefon [for Glenn Gould]"", the quintet leaps from frenetic swing to microtonal drone and then back again, a structure of calm in the center of a storm that paints an image of the great Bach pianist Gould sitting in Zen bliss as counterpoint lines flow from his fingertips into the surrounding air. The pieces here are all dedicated to various artists who have pushed their forms forward while remaining cognizant of those who've preceded them, reflecting V5's general preoccupation with their own place in jazz's linear history. Just as V5's freedom within convention stands as a testament to their musicality, however, it's also what holds them in place. While the jazz greats can be spoken of in their ""phases"" and ""periods,"" it's not clear that Vandermark is headed anywhere in particular. Despite the success of these compositions and energy present in the recording, Elements of Style would add little to the collection of one who owns V5's previous output. This pressing of the album includes a disc of Vandermark's arrangements of songs by the great Rahsaan Roland Kirk, famous for playing several saxophones simultaneously. Vandermark's arrangements are skillful, and an admirable attempt to focus attention on Kirk's music, rather than the man's defining gimmick. Ultimately, though, the recording feels dull-- while the pieces seem like they'd be excellent live, the disc is not an engaging listen following the unhinged joy apparent in the first. Ken Vandermark is in a tough position, attempting to hone a modern style that delivers satisfaction to the audience-- to feel good about himself both as an artist and as a performer. He's managed to find a successful balance of both, though his overall consistency is approaching stasis, and one hopes that he's getting ready to mix things up or forge some new territory. Still, Elements of Style... Exercises in Surprise is a great album, and about as accessible as free-jazz can be. Full of energy and purpose, its should offer any music lover a refreshing oasis of excellent musicianship.","MacArthur Genius Grant recipient Ken Vandermark heads up another new full-length with his prestigious Chicago-based free-jazz quintet.

Bring the Neon War Home,Yellow Swans,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab1cea9e61561daa5ce0/1:1/w_160/ed1aa4cc.jpg,2004-08-22 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8909-bring-the-neon-war-home/,Narnack,"It does no good to say that Yellow Swans are any of the following things: Improvised noise, art-damaged, hardcore, industrial, avant-garde, revolutionary, crazy, fuckin' crazy. Like the works of any successful composer, they are what you make of them. Theirs is also music you're likely to respond differently to each time you hear it, and by that I don't mean that sometimes you'll find yourself passively reaching for it, while others you simply won't be in the mood; Yellow Swans have a more intense effect on your emotions and impulses. At best, I feel at home inside their music, like these songs were written specifically for me and I can kick my feet up, let down my manners, and generally be part of them. That's a profound feeling. Equally profound is how much I can hate this record at times. Feeling alienated and utterly worn down after the first track, ""Police Eternity"", I've often thrown in the towel and vowed never to hear it again. But my inner masochist always find some excuse to return, and I've generally found the album more enjoyable with each subsequent listen. Yellow Swans are almost too adept for the type of music they play: Shrill, anarchic, noise-laden, and largely improvised, their aural base-jumping in theory embodies the spirit of deliberate improvisers like Glenn Branca and Sachiko M, but in practice identifies more closely with the stridency of Wolf Eyes and Merzbow. If you must, yes, this is some heady shit. In fact, Bring the Neon War Home is often dauntingly noisy. Propelled by a duly menacing industrial beat, ""Police Eternity"" opens things on an unambiguous note, all ring-modulated guitar peals spiraling off like a video game laser gone haywire, mammoth glaciers of feedback plodding insistently forward, and unintelligible vocal yowling. But as with all five tracks on this collection, there's a pinioning melodic undercurrent, faint but insistent, that I believe is what makes Yellow Swans so compelling. ""Police Eternity"" is easily the most confrontational (and thus potentially off-putting) track on Neon War. Clocking in at just over four minutes, it's almost a condensed version of the album as a whole, melding spacious textures, propulsive industrial beats, and grating feedback in one tumescent package. Other songs branch off down these individual tributaries: ""High on the Mountain of Love"" is an avalanche of sound; unwieldy and arrhythmic, the only thing certain about it is its persistent, all-encompassing forward momentum. Elsewhere, ""Neon War"" is the most melodically top-heavy, riffing for 13 minutes atop a pounding beat, barely audible bassline, and quaking, gradually decomposing guitar loop. The untitled closing track, meanwhile, is a hushed, ruinous skeleton of the music of which it lies in wake, vaster, more imagistic, and even delicate by Yellow Swans' standards. The thing at once so intimidating and admirable about Yellow Swans is how they eschew the reductive ""anybody could do that"" branding foisted upon many noise and improv acts. As entropic and abrasive as their compositions can wax, there's an unflagging virtuosity to them that at once demands attention and punishes the listener for getting too close. Like Branca's monolithic ""Lesson No. 2"", Yellow Swans are staggeringly deliberate; their patience and acute attention to detail allow them to pack a beguilingly huge wallop, and Bring the Neon War Home prevails on density, not girth.","Recently debuting with a CDR under the name D. Yellow Swans, this Portland-based outré-noise ensemble's debut for Narnack Records applies discipline, finally, to the noise-rock aesthetic.

Winchester Cathedral,Clinic,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60213d19756521390b3/1:1/w_160/e63f675b.jpg,2004-08-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1515-winchester-cathedral/,Domino,"When learning how to swim, the first thing you're taught to do is tread water. It does nothing to transport you, but if all else fails, it keeps you alive. When Clinic splashed down with their self-titled EP six years ago, they seemed capable of so much, and indeed, they accomplished a lot in two years, cranking out three excellent EPs and a debut full-length, Internal Wrangler, whose brilliance hasn't dimmed one iota with age. Yet, two albums and four years later, they seem content simply to keep their head above water. So much acclaim early on can be difficult for a band to cope with, and even before Internal Wrangler had officially reached U.S. shores, our speculative media culture was already trying to figure out how Clinic could possibly follow such a touchstone. The band were all over John Peel's show, praised from all quarters, and asked to open for Radiohead, and their surgical scrubs schtick-- initially a joke that helped them garner early attention-- became a sort of straitjacket: They were even booed once at a London gig for appearing onstage in street clothes when the scrubs were stolen prior to showtime. To Clinic's credit, their sophomore album, Walking with Thee, strived for progression. Its restraint, however, also diluted much of what had made the band so exciting and perfect in the first place. They no longer delved into those erratic, two-minute interjections and enthusiastic experiments that had lent Internal Wrangler its schizophrenic unpredictability, and without that exuberant exploration, even Walking with Thee's finest moments felt cold and studied. The madcap infectiousness that had so thrilled listeners originally had been extinguished-- and along with it, much of their unhinged, unfiltered energy. Walking with Thee was often described as falling about halfway between what Clinic had been and what Clinic could be. The same could be said for Winchester Cathedral. Clarinet and melodica again lead the charge, and Ade Blackburn's voice is frustratingly suppressed throughout, forcing his trademark alphabet soup under an impenetrable wave of surf guitar. But the disc does open promisingly, with a quickening EKG pulse that flatlines under metal chimes, guitars bursting in, and Blackburn churning out near-unintelligible lyrics through clenched teeth. As the drums stomp and the melodica wails, the music could be recognized as no other band than Clinic, and in an instant, it becomes crystal clear that the band have created an utterly unique sound for themselves. Each of the next three songs, however, is built on a similar template. Two of these do throw in some minor variations-- a Peter Hook-ish bassline on ""Anne"", or a piano line beneath ""Circle of Fifths""-- but the album's first single, ""The Magician"", is essentially ""The Return of the Return of Evil Bill"". The band glides with rhythmic ease through all of this, yet no one song stands apart from the others, and before long, the album hits a wall: ""Vertical Takeoff from Egypt"", a grinding and boring instrumental, leaves off the band's signature spring reverb, feeling totally out of synch with the rest of the record. Later, the album closes with another instrumental, ""Fingers"", which feels like an unfinished vocal track slathered with clarinet and noisy guitar outbursts to cover for its lack of emotional center. The downplaying of Blackburn's vocals is another element detracting from Winchester Cathedral's emotional gravity. On ""The Second Line"", he made complete gibberish sound inexplicably fresh, even transcendent, but mixed beneath the barrage of instrumentation, none of his prior character or personality shows through. The only songs that truly move the album's plot forward come during the album's last quarter: The haunting ballad ""Falstaff"" makes a worthy successor to past Clinic slow-songs ""Goodnight Georgie"" and ""Porno""-- its velvety doo-wop harmonies and wet guitars waltz in a sea of reverb while plaintive clarinet offers a fragile counterpoint to Blackburn's intense refrain. The grotesque Eastern European rock of ""August"", meanwhile, is a radical step forward, even incorporating Klezmer overtones. On these two short tracks, we're given a glimpse at what could be a very promising direction for the band. Unfortunately, the surrounding material shows the band reverting to a by-now very comfortable sound, seeming to indicate that, at least for now, they have put their evolution as a band on the backburner to pursue safer attributes like maturation and continuity, which means that the album finds Clinic stuck in the same transitional territory of Walking with Thee. Winchester Cathedral is not a bad album, and removed from context, most of its songs stand alone well. Still, one can't shake the feeling that formula is what's really at the heart of the record, and in light of the promise shown by their debut, that lack of fervor and off-the-cuff adventurousness is a difficult shortcoming to ignore.","After 2002's Walking with Thee showed little progression from their landmark debut, Internal Wrangler, reports began to circulate that Clinic's third proper album, the newly released Winchester Cathedral, would mark a serious departure for the Liverpool art-rockers. Now, the truth can be told...

Stereo Blues,Velvet Crush,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9879d034d5c69bf3c7b/1:1/w_160/74a5efab.jpg,2004-08-19 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8512-stereo-blues/,Action Musik,"Let's climb into the wayback machine for a moment, shall we? It's the mid-90s, and the major labels (there were six back then!) are marching their A&R; armies through the suburbs of America, scooping up every band with a couple of guitars and a serviceable melody in search of the next ""alternative"" sensation, thereby ensuring well-stocked cutout bins for decades to come. Epic plucks the Velvet Crush from their Providence basement, and they go on to record their finest album, Teenage Symphonies to God, for the label in 1994, releasing it on Creation in the UK. Epic brought the Crush their best chance at a real hit, but it was a match that couldn't last, and they were dropped as the alternative boom collapsed and gave way to the recorded frustrations of ambiguously irked rap-metal meatheads. Crush principals Paul Chastain and Ric Menck regrouped in 1998 to revive the band, but fell flat with Heavy Changes, an album that unsuccessfully attempted to deny their pop prowess and cast the band as ballsy rock 'n' rollers. They seemed to realize their misstep, though, as 1999's Free Expression was an expertly crafted, refined tribute to the guitar pop of the 60s and 70s, and last year's Soft Sounds continued that arc by presenting the duo as older, wiser balladeers. So I guess that basically makes Stereo Blues a midlife crisis record, a reactionary oh-my-god-we-don't-rock-anymore retreat to their basement days to rummage for the spark and fire they once possessed. It's not a flop on the level of Heavy Changes, but it's still a fool's gambit, as their last two records have proven their facility for crisp pop sophistication, and this one merely proves that they went in the right direction when they gave up rough-edged rock abandon. One of the album's principle plagues is the near total lack of low-end-- all that unsupported treble gets tiresome after a while. There's a bass hiding in there, peeking out from behind the overdriven rhythm guitars and ponderously formless solos like a shy mammal trying not to be seen. This is most egregiously apparent on ""The Connection"", a plodding 7-minute dinosaur whose melody I can't remember and whose strangely polite freakout coda ought to come with a bottle of Motrin. These ponderous guitar noodlings turn up all over the place, ruining ""Son of Ray"" (is that a reference to ""Sister Ray""?), and intruding on several otherwise strong tracks. It mystifies me why people as obviously talented as Menck and Chastain would insist on being so tuneless in the name of ""rocking."" Gentlemen, please, if shitting on a fretboard is your idea of rock music, kindly return to stately balladeering and reminding me why I liked Big Star. Dammit, though, it's really not all bad. These guys can't help writing a fantastic melody, and they do it quite a few times here, kicking out a picture-perfect anthem for 1993 in ""Fall Awake"", its sweet, double-tracked vocals overcoming bombastic drums and a chorus guitar riff that interjects in a manner far too reminiscent of the little doodles in Creed's ""Higher"" for comfort. ""I Want You Now"" rocks for real, building on a concise, Incesticide-worthy riff and a choppy verse melody for just under two minutes of spiky pop bliss that wisely crunches to a halt before any ass-ugly guitar solo can kill the momentum. ""California Incline"" isn't so lucky, but it's still pretty marvelous, retreating from an opening squeal of feedback into an easy groove full of loose strumming and clean, harmonious guitar-- it builds to a spot-on chorus, too, before taking off into one of the album's more passable jams. Even the good stuff can't wash away the dross, though, and there's too much of it here to make this album recommendable to anyone but a Menck/Chastain completist (they do exist). Free Expression, a record that plays to all of their strengths, was just reissued last year, and in lieu of the out-of-print Teenage Symphonies, that's the one to get. It seems likely that this is just a passing phase for the band, but here's hoping they turn it down for the next and just return to what they do best.","Reliable old jangle-pop duo enters midlife crisis, unfortunately indulging a sudden impulse to rock.

Meguro,Takashi Wada,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa9cc0084474cd0c120b/1:1/w_160/54dc5d74.gif,2004-08-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8779-meguro/,Onitor,"Takashi Wada's ""28°C"" begins simply, with a few plucked notes of an acoustic guitar echoing nicely around a ""wet"" room, before a cooing female voice sings a few bars and a field recording bridge serves as a ramp up to a grand second half. Suddenly, a rapid double-time Casio beat and sampled bottom of double bass folds in, eventually carrying with it a joyous melody swinging on a synthesized trumpet. It's like a toned-down version of Max Tundra's ""Cakes"", and it's one of those moments where you forget completely who you're listening to, or how the music is being made. You just feel happy at this thing that sounds so good in such a fresh way. So it goes through much of Meguro, the first album from this 21-year old kid from Tokyo. Traditional instruments mingle easily with electronics, and the usual boundaries associated with these tools breaks down. Wada is a student of jazz guitar and classical piano, which might explain why his eclectic blend of sounds and approaches is seamless. Four Tet and the first Manitoba album are reference points, but Meguro's music is more placid than either while remaining unpredictable. These songs don't seem hemmed in by genre; they go where they need to go. That said, the overall tone of Meguro is certainly pastoral, and roughly half the record could be accurately termed ambient. ""3am Cityscape"" is the title of the first track, and it's a telling opening image. As the track drifts along in the bubbly post-Gas haze, it's not hard to imagine the kind of slow pan across a skyline Sofia Coppola so loved in Lost in Translation. Whenever synths are present, they're fluffed up like pillows, all soft edges and thick texture, so even on ""Modern Architecture"" when an uptempo, bass-heavy beat enters halfway through, that the chords still suggest contemplation and stillness. ""6pm Cityscape"" leaves no doubt as to when Wada comes alive; its warm, dubby techno seems much more beginning than end. When he tones down the blissout, Wada fuses genres and incorporates pop melodies. ""Space and Shadow"" uses conga drums to impart a Latin feel, though when the full beat comes in, it proves too hectic to be danceable. The title track resembles Nobukazu Takemura during his Child's View phase, with descending piano chords, kiddie drums, and a clarinet calling the tune. Unfortunately, the most obvious weakness of Meguro is something else Wada shares with Takemura: He has a knack for letting his tracks go too long, repeating ideas after he's already made his point. There's not quite enough here to warrant the record's 72-minute runtime. Still, Wada is young and editing is a learned skill. On the evidence here, we should remain attentive to wherever he goes next.","21-year old Tokyo kid's debut album points to a promising future, with both Four Tet and Manitoba as reference points.

Arm of the Starfish,The Blithe Sons,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30b13d19756521389cf/1:1/w_160/d326ca24.gif,2004-08-19 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/802-arm-of-the-starfish/,Family Vineyard,"It takes a strong mind and stout heart to keep up with all the diverging branches of the Bay Area's prolific Jewelled Antler collective, and I'm sorry to say I haven't always been up to the task. The loose-knit collective of sonic improvisers maintains such an active schedule of shape-shifting and bandname-changing that it's virtually impossible for the casual observer to tail their every move. Two of the few Jewelled Antler constants, however, are members Loren Chasse and Glenn Donaldson. Indeed, one or both of them is involved with virtually every Antler act you may have stumbled across, be it Thuja, Skygreen Leopards, Dead Raven Choir, Hala Strana, The Child Readers, Glassine, Ivytree, Birdtree, The Franciscan Hobbies, Tomes, Coelacanth, Silvery Branches, or any number of other projects. When the two walk the earth as a duo, however, they call themselves The Blithe Sons, and the numinous, abstract folk field recordings they create are quite worth the stumble. Arm of the Starfish is The Blithe Sons' second album on Family Vineyard, although like many Jewelled Antler projects, they do have a hard-to-trace back catalog of CD-Rs, lathe-cut EPs and, one presumes, countless songs etched directly onto the bark of birch trees. As you might guess from songs like ""Sun Anemone"" or ""Foam"", this record finds the Sons wandering seaside, recording outdoors as they go. (You know you're listening to a Jewelled Antler act when you see that album title and you at least briefly consider the possibility that the musicians just might be plucking the amplified arms of a starfish. I can't say for certain that they aren't.) But the coastal setting is crucial to note because, as has previously been the case with many Antler records, what is being played is less important than where it's being played. The Blithe Sons are hardly the first artists to look to the seas for creative illumination, but most sand-and-surf-inspired music has tended to focus on the activities of humans: sailing, surfing, bikini-watching, pirating, etc. The Sons instead focus on the natural world, and seem to intend for their music to become just another feature of the coastal landscape with the waves and the wind blending in as essential accompaniment. Though that may sound like the dippiest of new age propositions on paper, the two play together with such imagination and intuitive ease that the results are rarely less than captivating. It isn't always easy to say exactly what instruments the Sons actually are using: The opening track, ""Sparkling Diatoms"", begins with jingling percussion and loosely stretched waves of drone, perhaps created by harmonium and/or wood flutes. On other cuts, more identifiable threads of acoustic guitar, dulcimer, banjo and Donaldson's mysterious vocal utterings bubble to the surface, and then slide back under the gently crashing surf. The album culminates with the 17-minute ""Sea-Glass"", an ever-shifting epic of quiet delicacy that should have even the most landlocked listener washing the salt out of his hair. If you've been bewildered or put off by the unwieldy Jewelled Antler discography in the past, The Arms of the Starfish is an excellent place to make your approach. It contains all of the elements of off-handed beauty and shared discovery that exemplify the best of the collective's work. And if you're a Jewelled Antler completist, here's another prize for your already-groaning shelves. And my hat is off to you.","Latest outing from this much-loved free-folk project spearheaded by Jewelled Antler Collective captains Loren Chasse and Glenn Donaldson.

Too Much Guitar,Reigning Sound,by: Stephen M.

In addition to Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination at the Lorraine Motel, Elvis croaked at Graceland; Al Jackson Jr. was murdered in his home; Otis Redding died in a plane crash; David Prater died in a car crash; Stax went under and was torn down; Chris Bell drove into a telephone pole off Poplar Avenue; Jeff Buckley drowned in the Wolf River. Ineluctable tragedy has seeped into Memphis' mythology and mindset, as pervasive as muddled civic government, and it bubbles out through the city's music. Not many Memphis musicians understand this municipal obsession with mortality as well as Greg Cartwright, who fronted the 90s noise-rock trio The Oblivians until the group disbanded in 1997. Afterwards, he formed the Reigning Sound with three other local musicians, releasing Break Up Break Down and Time Bomb High School, two full-to-bursting albums of jarring garage-rock that transcended the genre through its impossibly deep knowledge of local and national pop and soul. On their new album, Too Much Guitar, the Reigning Sound make it clear that they would be playing the same songs with or without that genre's recent revival. Not that the garage-rock trend has been especially good to the band. After Time Bomb High School, the Reigning Sound were on the verge of breaking up, held together by the power of a dozen or so new songs and the promise of studio time. Guitarist/keyboard player Alex Greene left in 2003, which left Cartwright, bassist Jeremy Scott, and drummer Greg Roberson, the latter two forming a tight-as-ever rhythm section reminiscent of their Stax forebears. Splitting time between Memphis and North Carolina and recording several tracks in Cartwright's now-closed Legba Records store, they brought in a few local musicians-- including Alicja Trout and Jay Rensley of Lost Sounds-- to create an album full of stomping backbeats, scorching guitars and soulful melodies. On the opener, ""We Repel Each Other"", the band promise to live up (or down) to the album's cheekily self-critical title: Cartwright's voice is buried beneath piles of guitar noise, as if he's singing from six feet under. It's an odd tactic: Cartwright is blessed with an amazing voice for the music he plays, able to convey defeat and defiance, hangdog sadness and poisoned disdain, all in the same breath. At points on Too Much Guitar, he's barely audible-- although you hear more of him with each listen. However, the album's messy production exponentially increases its raw spontaneity and desperate urgency. Not surprisingly, death informs much of the record, which directly equates love and loss. Songs like ""If You Can't Give Me Everything"" and ""I'll Cry"" lament the end of a relationship as if performing an exorcism. Even when a song celebrates romance-- such as the cover of Sam & Dave's ""You Got Me Hummin'""-- fear always countervails happiness and contentment, making these songs seem restless and gloomily resigned to love's futility. Or, as Cartwright sings on ""Funny Thing"", ""Love is a funny thing/ You don't know it's real 'til it's caused you pain."" Sometimes death is very literal, as on ""Drowning"", which begins ominously: ""I went walking the other day/ Under the bridge to Arkansas."" He promises to tell us what he saw, but only mentions that the sparkle in her eyes died. On one of the album's standouts, ""Let Yourself Go"", Cartwright sings, ""Keep your feelings inside/ All your thoughts of suicide/ Oh, let yourself go."" He's not promoting death, but exhorting listeners to ""live your life like the end is near."" Cartwright seems to be heeding that advice: Despite being so recently in the throes of their own demise, the Reigning Sound sound lively and vital as ever.","Memphis-based rockers crank out their third full-to-bursting LP of jarring garage-rock that transcends the genre through its deep knowledge of local and national pop and soul.

Up All Night,Razorlight,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a303c0084474cd0c01a1/1:1/w_160/57738379.jpg,2004-08-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6921-up-all-night/,Interscope,"Courtesy of NME, I present to you this year's worst band ever. Razorlight are Britain's latest response to garage-rock's attempted world takeover (The Libertines were the first), and they hope to win your love by borrowing tricks from some of your favorite artists-- including The Strokes, Television, Lou Reed, and even Bruce Springsteen. Certainly, the burden of the past is always a bitch, but saying that Razorlight wear their influences on their sleeves is perhaps giving them too much credit. The band simply doesn't possess the energy or conviction to qualify their songs as mimicries, let alone exculpate their sinful lack of identity-- the notion of developing a ""Razorlight sound"" may not have even crossed their minds yet, and might possibly never. At nearly every turn of their flaccid debut, Up All Night, Razorlight squander the ideas they've snatched up from other, more talented acts, then somehow find even more ways to ruin already perfectly uninteresting songs. The tacked-on piano prelude to ""Leave Me Alone"" gives way to the song's main riff, a thick guitar grind that's doubled on bass and chipped away by the hi-hat 16ths of now ex-drummer Christian Smith-Pancorvo. The energy level is passable, but falls a few notches with every ""Marquee Moon"" breakdown the band invokes, until the song ends with barely a whimper. ""Which Way Is Out"" further encourages Television comparisons-- the tenor of the verse's guitar catcalls are so similar to, again, ""Marquee Moon"" that one has to wonder if it's the only Television song Razorlight has ever heard. The song nosedives when its wonderwall of plastic distortion kicks in at the chorus. Maybe it's another ""if you can't beat' em, steal their schtick"" sort of schtick, but Razorlight really hit up The Strokes for ideas on a number of tracks. Even their song titles are curiously Strokes-like (""Leave Me Alone"", ""Which Way Is Out"", ""Get It and Go"", ""Up All Night""). The opening guitar twitches on ""Stumble and Fall"" came right off Room on Fire's ""Automatic Stop"", while ""Rip It Up"" would be an expert Is This It forgery were the lyrics not so asinine: ""Hey Girl! Get on the dance floor! Rip it up! That's what it's there for!"" Ultimately, though, it's Razorlight frontman Johnny Borrell who decimates Up All Night. The poor guy's all over the place, admirably (but stupidly) attempting to match a song's stolen vibe by impersonating the affectations of its respective frontman. He's virtually never believable: The Casablancan ""and uhh's"" and ""ah well uh's"" on ""Rock 'n' Roll Lies"" sound particularly empty. When he's not desperately trying to emote (""Vice"") or to intimidate (""Get It and Go""), Borrell seems most natural on the kiddie-punk breakdown of ""Dalston"" and the ""Maneater"" tribute ""Golden Touch"". Neither song is particularly great, but Borrell's delivery on each is at least partially convincing. Of course, even at their best, Razorlight refuse to meet their influences with anything more than half hugs and limp handshakes, butchering the bits they brazenly borrow, and taking rock 'n' roll apathy to formerly unbelievable lengths.","New UK press darlings' full-length debut is yet another appropriation of garage-rock past and present, snagging its sound most notably from The Strokes and Television.

By folding blunted hip-hop bounce into the boiling rhythms of drum 'n' bass, they've cranked up a wicked urban aesthetic that moonwalks the line between slick b-boy breaks and dark club kid tech. 2002's Subway Series was a peak achievement, and its dubby spaciousness and jazzy rush drew major label acts to the duo's fine-tuned production skills. Two years later, Ming + FS return with a stylistic balancing act that just doesn't cut as deep. It's a tough position to be in: Clearly, the band's sound is relevant (at least to the Madison Avenue tastemakers at Nissan and Victoria's Secret), but can it appeal to both underground beat hounds and Must See TV trendoids? Ming + FS seem at a loss for an answer this time around-- Back to One settles for an ambiguous middle ground. Given their tendency towards kitchen sink hybridization, it was only a matter of time before they either broke through with a truly definitive work or slumped into a tepid rekindling of their earlier fire. Which isn't to say Back to One is all tired rehash. Even when they reach back into the hip-hop lexicon, as with the witty, all-too-brief beatboxed breakbeat of ""Draw"", the duo exude a fresh playfulness. And when they slow to a sticky, bubbly thump on ""50FT Mole Man"", they build a warm, voluptuous ambiance, but unfortunately can't maintain it. Repeat appearances by MC Napoleon Solo add a modicum of character; his gruff, uncomplicated rhymes are functional and his voice malleable enough to bend to Ming + FS's shifting beatscapes. It's telling that they rely on his vocals on half the tracks-- I've always been more partial to the group's instrumentals, but the boom-bip of the smoldering ""Starts Somewhere"" and organ-led break of ""Skills and Grace"", despite some innovative samples, is built to be rapped over. The pinnacle of this more supportive production technique is ""2092"", a supremely funky, De La Soulful track that eschews the drum 'n' bass for a scratch-laden summer joint that doubles as the album's highlight. But Ming + FS's predictable foray into electro-fried breaks comes as a disappointment. Opener ""Fish Eyes"" waxes reverb over a bone-crunching, vaguely exotic beat, while the freakish adolescent vocals on ""Big Little Jeffrey"" are plain unsettling. Closer ""Nadia"" digs into stuttering IDM territory in the midst of what could be a shimmering, silky groove; a more cohesive finale would've strengthened the album's overall impact. In the midst of an economic slump, getting paid hardly invites the blow to an artist's integrity it once did. It's hard to blame Ming + FS for digging into what are probably high-paying commercial jobs over the monkish dedication and forward-thinking creativity necessary to produce work as enthralling as their previous albums. Sadly for their fans, every time they do so, the music is bound to suffer.","After netting a series of high-paid TV commercial spots, this NYC drum 'n' bass duo backpedal on the progress of their last full-length.

Spine and Sensory,Tristeza,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a819c0084474cd0c0d59/1:1/w_160/aa35d352.jpg,2004-08-18 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8166-spine-and-sensory/,MakotoMakoto,"Tristeza have been fairly inert over the last few years, but their name ought to ring some bells-- besides guitarist Jimmy Lavalle's incarnation as The Album Leaf, and other members' involvement in The Locust, they've shared bills with the varied likes of !!!, Mouse on Mars, and GBV. Spine and Sensory was their debut LP, originally recorded in 1999, but out of print for several years. It's been re-released with a badly needed new mastering job and three bonus tracks. The timing might seem a little odd (has the range of nostalgia already been conflated to the five year mark?), but the folks at Better Looking must have figured that it'll ride the current wave of uplifting post-rock a la Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky, as well as guitarist Lavalle's growing success as The Album Leaf, to find a greater audience. Thanks to several years of nonstop touring, Tristeza enjoyed a fair amount of attention relatively soon after their formation in 1997. But they've had their detractors; their sophomore release, Dream Signals in Full Circles, was slammed by some-- including Pitchfork-- for being too ""new age."" Tristeza's attempt to inject their scene with some positive frequencies has been as happy to me as it is distasteful to those who need their beauty twisted, and given the more recent directions of instrumental rock, such a sound might land on friendlier ears these days. Spine and Sensory, however, only hints at the deeper listening to come from Tristeza. The first two tracks are fairly standard pieces of instrumental rock, beginning with interweaving counterpoint guitar lines and some synth, adding interest to the texture. ""RMS 2000"" is where the sonic exploration begins, as delayed percussion, feedback drones, and reverbed organs announce themselves in the mix. After some more mid-tempo builds, ""Memphis Emphasis"" quickens the pace with a tight staccato pulse. The album sags a little in its third quarter, but the beautiful piano/synth flute piece ""Cinematography"" provides a textural surprise toward the end of the album, and foretells the gentle, sweeping nature of their forthcoming work. Criticisms of ""too repetitive"" have plagued Lavalle's music through its incarnations. Though the songs of Spine are constantly shifting and building, the intentional lack of memorable melody can forcefully relegate them to the background of one's attention. Still, Tristeza should be approached on their own terms; their music is about movement, not of the dancing kind, but the spiraling, racing and blooming that instrumental rock can evoke. Without any member rising to the forefront, Tristeza are able to work as a true ensemble, creating thick textural structures that gesture toward the expansiveness of ambient music while retaining more standard forms. Spine and Sensory was and remains a sincere effort to inject the decidedly emotionless lines of math-rock with some color, without resorting to the aggressive crescendos of their counterparts. It's not uniformly gripping, but contains enough moments of beauty and interest to be worthwhile. The tracks of Spine and Sensory explore a variety of rhythmic and timbrel contrasts, each managing to set itself apart in a genre that is often plagued by formulaic, indistinguishable pieces. The new age stigma is thrown around quite readily if a band employs atmospherics toward any means other than the melancholy or foreboding, and Tristeza, despite their name's translation, are decidedly uplifting. But even if the idea of warm pads and chimes still gives you chills, this record strikes a balance not found in their later work that should appeal to all.","The long out-of-print 1999 debut from this instrumental post-rock band that shared members with The Album Leaf, GoGoGo Airheart and The Locust gets reissued.

From Gutter w/Love,Pidgeon,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16e13d1975652138621/1:1/w_160/81843d89.gif,2004-08-18 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11807-from-gutter-wlove/,Absolutely Kosher,"Many consider the Pixies the Platonic ideal of a certain hardcore-pop style, of which copious transitory doppelgangers are merely cast shadows. But for every gross of mediocre Pixies imitators, there's a band that builds upon their legacy by appending their own specific sensibility to it. It's prudent to note that these echoes are not usually the result of blatant imitation; rather, they're born from a genuine love and admiration for a work that inflamed the imaginations of so many people. All art is some permutation of, or comment upon, the art its creator has internalized; what's crucial is that something is added to the mix. Without the Pixies' ascendancy, we wouldn't have the Nirvana we know. The same goes for Mclusky, who impressed their own distinct thumbprint and range of other influences on the Pixies' style. And we probably wouldn't have Pidgeon's excellent marriage of boy/girl singing, shredded screaming, indie-pop, and blistering thrashcore-- the mansion they've built upon the foundation the Pixies laid by assimilating their own influences into a unique style. San Francisco's Pidgeon concoct the unruly, melodic cacophony of their debut, From Gutter w/Love, with three vocalists (a female singer, a male screamer/singer, and a male screamer), three guitars, bass and drums. The opening song on their debut, ""The Second One"", proves the accuracy of their self-proclaimed Cardigans/Motorhead/Pixies triangulation with its simmering drums and deep, piston-like bass, crisp shifts in volume and intensity, growling guitars that feint and leap, and a breathy, contagious vocal melody sporadically shattered by black metal shrieks-- indie pop injected with dangerous, illegal drugs and mutating uncontrollably. ""Strelnikov"" weaves singer Valerie Iwamasa's dulcet upper-register through a flurry of spacious, contrapuntal guitar arpeggios and dense segments of puissant thrash. The staid ""Powerful"" begins with an ominous, cyclical guitar figure and spare reverb before expanding into a tangle of chugging, staccato Kim Dealisms, followed by the propulsive, Surfer Rosa-ish anthem ""Down"". The triple-negative pep-pill ""Ain't Nothing Can't"" and the woozy string bends of ""Fallout"" are akin to The Wrens' haywire, seasick pop techniques, and the bastard ska of ""Sty"" is riddled with prolix, rapid-fire ranting that complements the euphonious pop vocals that it jostles against elsewhere on the record. Truly new ideas are rare. New combinations of old ones are a more realistic benchmark of quality. When one band sounds just like another band, it's natural for us to balk. But when a band sounds like a hybrid of several bands, filtered through their own specific lens, it seems fair to say they only sound like themselves. If Pidgeon sticks around long enough to build a body of work and cement themselves in enough minds to be reference-worthy, some years down the road, I may find myself referring to them to describe a new band that has imbibed their aesthetic. It's not just pop that will eat itself; art, in general, is a cannibal. Dig in.","Absolutely Kosher debut from these San Francisco-based Pixies-loving pop/punks is an unruly, melodic cacophony.

No Said Date,Masta Killa,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c568c0084474cd0c3732/1:1/w_160/571622f7.jpg,2004-08-18 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5605-no-said-date/,Nature Sounds,"Over the foreboding intro of the aptly titled ""Triumph"", the Wu-Tang Clan's single biggest commercial splash, a bumbling, typically incoherent Ol' Dirty Bastard invites the listener to follow him and the gang ""back to '79."" Inspectah Deck then spits one of the group's most memorable verses (""I bomb atomically...""), inaugurating a nearly 6-minute string of relentless wordplay featuring nearly every Wu member in top form. While the Wu solo records of the last seven years have occasionally been retrograde, none of it has been expressly retro in sound or spirit. In fact, since 1997, the group has mired in stasis, presiding over an uneven spate of generally lackluster solo albums and a pair of underwhelming group efforts; ODB's call has been taken in vain. There were periodic beacons of hope, but nothing that ever materialized into broader success for the group. GZA's excellent 2002 release, Legend of the Liquid Sword, eulogized its roots in both NYC and the Far East with sly mainstream appeal and poignant autobiographical lyrics, reverently pushing the envelope forward like no Clansman since Raekwon on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. But other members' stabs at innovation have either been too far-flung for mainstream ears or too uneven to make a lasting impression. Ghostface's caustic, free-flown verses have been reliably ferocious, but even his 2000 classic Supreme Clientele was too blowhard to fit in alongside fellow members' more group-minded efforts. Method Man has declined, RZA has branched out in non-hip-hop endeavors, and Ol' Dirty has simply embarrassed. None of this has boded well for the marginal ninth member of the Clan, Masta Killa, whose presence in the group has been enigmatic at best. Adding to the inauspiciousness is the fact that No Said Date, his inaugural solo endeavor, marks something of a milestone for Wu Tang: Masta is the last Clan member to count a solo album to his credit. From his diminutive (though deceptively strong) performances on group issues such as 2001's Iron Flag, there was little basis from which to expect anything, one way or the other, from Masta-- which is why his stealing the spotlight with the most fully formed Wu solo effort this year comes as such a surprise. No Said Date is by no means an entirely new outing; many of its tracks have been cocooned for several years, patiently ripening in the 36 Chambers' dankest crevasses, and No Said Date's opportune release-- in the smack-dab middle of a disconcertingly weak year for Wu-- makes its anachronous vibe all the more vital. That these songs sound pungently old fashioned is no mistake: RZA's production is markedly pared-down from more mainstream-minded Wu solo material, and Masta's verses benefit from this unpretentiousness. The record succeeds on modesty, not reticence; Masta is a rapper's rapper, forsaking high-flown gimmicks for Spartan flows and carefully considered rhymes. His accent isn't as instantly identifiable as RZA's or Method Man's, but Masta's bulwark is rote verbal skill, the kind often shunned for higher targets like aesthetic appeal, production novelty, and uncouth humor. No Said Date packs those elements as well, but in a subtle, refined manner that never upstages the album's focal point: its lyrics. While devotees may hear this as a back-to-basics approach for Wu Tang (Masta himself has even vowed to ""[bring] back that original Wu-Tang sound""), No Said Date owns its share of decisively forward-looking tracks: ""Digi-Warfare"", with its housey electronics and lusty vocal intonations, could be mistaken for a Basement Jaxx remix, while ""The Future"" literally teleports decades yonder, handing the mic over to a trio of pre-teen MCs, whose breathless verses rival Ghostface among Clan members in their horrific violence. (Its instrumental track is also one of No Said Date's tightest, though several songs vie for that title.) That ""The Future"" is considered a skit in the liner notes is a testament to the record's depth. Masta wisely eschews tedious humor sketches, typically taking a more serious bent. But unlike his contemporaries who make up the so-called conscientious school (Talib and Dilated Peoples are guilty), his gravity is never dogmatic. The title track derives most of its weightiness from a determined beat that samples strings from OutKast's ""Skrew It On the Bar-B"", while ""School"" features fluid, appropriately self-conscious lyrics (""Banging on the lunchroom table, I used to speculate/ And watch some of the MC greats throw verses back and forth/ I didn't have the heart to step forth"") over a particularly austere beat. Though explicitly old-school in approach, Wu-Tang could never have sounded this tight and direct 11 years ago on 36 Chambers; the technological just wasn't there. But Masta Killa has delivered one the most urgent, straightforward Wu releases since the group's debut over a decade ago. Maybe it's just refreshing to hear a Clansman whose head hasn't grown swollen yet, but the man at the top of the Wu food chain in 2004 happens to be the group's quietest. Hopefully, Masta's fellow members will take his queue.","The only remaining Wu-Tang member to not have released a solo album finally gets free from prison and one-ups his Clan-mates' recent outings.

Mississauga Goddam,The Hidden Cameras,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0d35e6ef959693235f6/1:1/w_160/5dbdae57.jpg,2004-08-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3854-mississauga-goddam/,Rough Trade,"Shock value, like youth, is fleeting. Remember Jackass: The Movie? You and a couple of buddies snuck in with a six-pack of Miller High Life after passing around a bong named Captain Jack, and for 87 blessed minutes, you almost believed bungee-cord wedgies and unabashed homoeroticism were the pinnacle of comedic history. But the next morning, in the cold glare of a Chicago November, you weren't exactly pining for a sequel. Actually, maybe that wasn't you. Anyway, the comparison is unfair, because The Hidden Cameras, led by sugarcoated pervert Joel Gibb, are infinitely more amusing than anything Steve-O could jam up his rectum. The Smell of Our Own, the band's Rough Trade debut, was a subversively catchy accomplishment, full of lavish pop and explicit homosexuality. Their latest, Mississauga Goddamn, is a fading echo of the original, and while that's way better than a new Johnny Knoxville vehicle, it still feels like the season South Park stopped surprising and all your friends switched back to Simpsons reruns on Wednesday nights. Named for a dam in Gibb's suburban Ontario hometown, the new record confirms the young maestro's knack for bright AM pop melodies. Saccharine love songs like ""We Oh We"" or ""Builds the Bone"" could almost be mistaken for that Bread single you once got on a mixtape from a high school crush. Fortunately, Gibb still can barely let a song go by without a graphic description of gay lovin', giving even the schmaltziest moments a gleeful dissonance. Like this line from ""That's When the Ceremony Starts"": ""I drank from the wine that came from inside/ The heart of his meat and the splurge of his sweet."" Lingering beneath the album's sunny exterior is Gibb's unease over his Mississauga upbringing. When doubling as sexual innuendoes, these images subtly rebuke pious bread-breakers who would condemn his lifestyle. Equally clever is Gibb's tack of cloaking explicit lyrics in perky arrangements to which those same churches might take very kindly. The depth of his resentment finally leaches out through the lyrics of the title track, a languid shuffle drenched in Pet Sounds strings and harmonies. ""I'm wearing my disguise/ Until I rid my life of Mississauga Goddam,"" Gibb admits. At their best, Gibb and his ever-expanding cast of accompanists stitch together a disguise as beautiful as a Technicolor dreamcoat. But despite the strength of ""Music Is My Boyfriend"" and lush single ""The Fear Is On"", I continually find myself humming songs from the debut instead. ""Ban Marriage"" was truly brilliant: a hook-filled pop ditty about the silliness of marriage, at a time when the issue of marriage was particularly close to the hearts of many. And ""Golden Streams""-- well, it remains the loveliest tune ever recorded about peeing on one's partner. In their stead, Gibb drops repetitive stinkers like ""B Boy"" or ""I Want Another Enema"". I'll get back to you on the Jackass sequel, but according to IMDB, it went straight to video.","With their debut, The Smell of Our Own, having established them as perhaps the most pottymouthed, sexual preference-flaunting indie group since Pansy Division, The Hidden Cameras return with another batch of lyrics explicit enough to make gay erotica seem tame. Unfortunately, their baroque melodies aren't quite as interesting.

Five Suns,Guapo,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfebabf31b7dc71563a3/1:1/w_160/0b0dbf1b.jpg,2004-08-17 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3631-five-suns/,Cuneiform,"I'll bet you aren't listening to Magma right now. Well, neither am I, though in due course, all of us will be one day. The experimental French prog band are one of the last sure-thing revivals from the 70s yet to get their due among the general hipster faction. I don't know why; you'd think people would be looting retirement communities just to get their hands on something in a made-up language, sporting guys in black with gold medallions and Fender Rhodes pianos. You know, the whole Sigur Rós fiasco led me to believe odd was in, and with Magma you don't even have to sit through 12 minutes of introductory bullshit before getting to the next chord. Well, okay, sometimes you do. But enough of that, I'll just show my hand and proclaim my enduring fascination and fandom of Magma. Some things transcend my reputation as a relatively normal person, and this is one of them. I had the screensaver, for fuck's sake. Of course, it's nice to know I'm not alone. Take British trio Guapo: with Five Suns, they appear to have fashioned an entire album in homage to a single Magma song. Playing lengthy, minimal experimental prog featuring buzzsaw bass, insistently busy drums and that old Rhodes, their music is often at the mercy of the infamous ""De Futura"", a track that Chicago's Flying Luttenbachers also felt the need to sacrifice virgins to over the last several years. As an added bonus for non-believers, Guapo also share an affinity for aggressive, near-chaotic expansion with bands like Lightning Bolt and Hella. In all cases, the bass/guitar and drums provide a rock-solid base of rhythm under which explosive noise and endlessly repetitive thematic development ends up as oppressive rock fury and all-around punch in the neck. Where Guapo differ is in their preference for large-scale symphonic forms and love of sinister, dreadful moments of calm between outbursts. They offer an inventive, if not necessarily strikingly original update on the Magma template. The five-part title suite begins with the clang of a gong and spooky Rhodes figures-- and if I didn't know any better I'd double-check to make sure I hadn't accidentally slipped in one of the Mahavishnu records. The extended introduction gives way to a fistful of fury via a three-note figure from bassist Matt Thompson that does remind me a little of the Luttenbachers' pound. However, very soon the band launches a martial, tightly wound synth-led melody that practically telegraphs their debt to Magma. Everything from the simple, crushing drumming to slightly goofy synth patches and even down to the specific bass tone crib from ""De Futura"", but that's okay. I get the feeling Guapo really are taking that ball and running with it rather than being content to wallow in its glory-- plus it's instrumental, so you're spared from having to sing about Orks. The five parts of Five Suns take up most of the album, though ""Mictlan"" and the relatively calm ""Topan"" outline variations in their style. The former fooled me into thinking they'd reconsidered their idea of sonic pummeling by beginning with a long, hypnotic synth drone. However, 40 seconds in, the pummeling returns in the form of minor chord, bottom-heavy acrobatics. Guapo usually keep their ideas concise, so if you don't happen to dig what's going on at any given time, it's likely to change before you even know what's happened. In a perfect world, maybe the band wouldn't be quite so reminiscent of another band, though in truth they're probably not running into a lot of people protesting Magma-thievery at gigs. As far as newer bands in this vein, I prefer the Luttenbachers and Lightning Bolt, or even another Cuneiform-sponsored band from the late 90s, Happy Family. Still, if you ever want a bit more bite in your instrumental post-rock, Guapo have you covered. Hamatai!","British trio Guapo appear to have fashioned this album in homage to Magma, but also share an affinity for aggressive, near-chaotic expansion with bands like Lightning Bolt and Hella.

The Will to Death,John Frusciante,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be52eb335119a49ed04a/1:1/w_160/94c508ca.jpg,2004-08-17 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3234-the-will-to-death/,Recordcollection,"Will to Death is the third stop on the John Frusciante Proliferation Tour 2004, after February's Shadows Collide with People, a bruised, seat-of-pants throwback to high-concept, tweaked pineal soul-seeking, and the side project Ataxia, a noisy and exploratory collaboration with Fugazi bassist Joe Lally. In comparison to those projects, Death is a plain dealer. Working quickly, Frusciante and trusty pal Josh Klinghoffer banged out the guitar and drum tracks, coloring them with keys, subtle electronics and rudimentary yet powerful studio twiddles (backmasking is the new Pro Tools), then adding vocal tracks streaked with his usual naked emotion. Shadows Collide's alloy of rue and hope is still evident here, both in the arrangements and in lyrics like, ""Laughter's an ugly friend of mine/ We shared the best and worst of times,"" which he sings over the skeletal Velvets lilt of ""Unchanging"". Frusciante's solo career will probably always be more about self-therapy than gaining a foothold in the marketplace. But as another impressive portion of his potent '04 output, Will to Death's immediacy and quality should quiet the critics-- particularly those who pegged his early solo records as the work of a narcotics pain-train washout. After a satisfactory opener, Death detonates the stuttering synthesized lead riff and splashing cymbals of ""An Exercise"". A stylistic peer to Shadows Collide's ""Carvel"", the cut comes from Frusciante's Pete Yorn place, that piece of his id with a love for beard-rock and pearl-snap buttons. But soon we're into the meat of the album, with the simplistic 60s guitar/drum strum and stereo separation of ""Time Runs Out"" and the epic ""Loss"". Heavily reverbed vocals wash over starkly live-sounding drums and guitar; the song surges to a raucous movement of intertwined solos, one warm and one damaged in squelch. That's a dynamic Frusciante seems to have resigned himself to, both in life and music-- he's always on the run from the darkness, but still believes in the comforting light ahead. There's a bit of Bill Callahan in that duality-- the longings to be forgiven for sins you were nevertheless happy to commit-- and in Will to Death's instrumentation: The wind effects and dirge piano of ""Mirror"" set up lyrics grappling with bad decisions, delivered through a flanging howl of mixing board effects. The broken man ruminations of ""The Days Have Turned"" are made stronger by the closeness of the vocal in our ear, the cold wall of hesitation between Frusciante and the quietly hopeful guitar chords. It could be a suicide note read aloud as Californication's ""Scar Tissue"" plays through a tinny AM in the background. There are no push-up bras here, not even the memory of hedonism: ""I've stabbed life in the back,"" Frusciante sings. ""I'm awaiting life as another man"". Still, Will to Death's purples never blotch out the better days completely. Perhaps due to the album's quick recording schedule, it's guided by a plain-faced grace, best exemplified by the comforting Cat Stevens quality of the aforementioned ""Time Runs Out"" and the introspective instrumental ""Helical"", on which tiny, watery chords ring and whisper between amp fuzz and guitar pick scratch. The album closes with its title track. With another understated jangle tickling the left ear, Frusciante reiterates his philosophy in melody in the right-- ""The will to death is what keeps me alive""-- and this time the twin solos are happier than silent sunlight.","Latest LP from the artiest Chili Pepper is the third in what is said to be a series of six Frusciante releases planned for 2004 release.

Sunburn,Dan Friel,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be9fc0084474cd0c2ef7/1:1/w_160/b2ea0a72.gif,2004-08-17 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3319-sunburn/,Veloci,"Every generation has signifiers of its youth, nostalgia triggers that work almost without fail. For my parents' generation, it's hard to think of a better one than the Radio Flyer wagon. These simple red-and-white carts with oversized black rubber wheels are as emblematic of suburban childhood in the 40s and 50s as ICBMs were to the Cold War, and almost anyone who grew up in the postwar era remembers their ubiquity fondly-- they actually outsold Ford station wagons for a number of years. The Radio Flyer of my generation might be the Casio keyboard. I can remember getting one when I was a kid that had maybe three octaves and about 10 or 12 sounds along with classic preset rhythms they called ""rhumba"" and ""bossa nova."" My brother and I spent plenty of time parlaying that keyboard into extended sessions of annoyance for my parents, and I'll never get over how amazing we thought it was when we were young that you could get these little demos playing on it and then speed them up or slow them down at will. I remember a specific instance when the keyboard's batteries were dying, but still had enough juice in them to produce a sputtering, vaguely piano-ish sound when you hit the keys. Just a few months ago, I rediscovered a brief recording that I'd made of this phenomenon on a boombox, and it sounds oddly poignant, this wandering quasi-melody of wavering and decaying notes. Whatever spoke to me about the sound of that failing machine years ago apparently also captivated Parts & Labor's Dan Friel as he worked on Sunburned, his second solo EP and his first to see proper release on a label. He opens the disc with a track called ""Dead Batteries"", a song literally built on a foundation of an old Casio struggling to play a rhythm preset with the power provided by nearly expended C batteries. The effect is a twitching, crackling foundation for his laser-toned guitar to slice through that perfectly sets the tone for this intriguing, challenging disc. Friel has slowly been making a name for himself in Brooklyn not only with Parts & Labor, who last year split a full-length with rising avant-garde star Tyondai Braxton (now a member of Battles alongside ex-Don Caballero guitarist Ian Williams), but also with his bit parts in ensembles helmed by Damo Suzuki and Glenn Branca. In his spare time, he records with an intentionally limited setup, working to coax the best music he can from an array of electronics like remote-controlled car joysticks and walkie talkies. The squealing, dense textures he builds from those sounds form the bulk of this record, and he interacts with them with his electric guitar, pouring on layer after layer of his distinctly hued drones and distorted overtone series until the wall of sounds is complete. The music he ends up with sounds like little else out there, a heaving mass of static beats, monolithic distortion, and bending, diving tones. Most of the modulating squeals that cut through songs like ""Tractorcalls"" are created by amplifying the signals of the remote controls, which produce a surprisingly wide array of pitches as the trigger is manipulated. Some of the clusters this technique creates are harsh and dissonant, while others are strikingly melodic. Friel creates a manic beat and descending harmony with his keyboard on ""b2bs"", making what could be best described as drill 'n' bass with a Motown chord progression. The beat on closer ""Quitting"", created by looping various pitches of static from his guitar pedals, is far less traditional, but functions well as a backdrop for his nasty guitar improvisation, which sounds like a doo-wop group made of fluorescent lights. The queasy, noisy beat of the song nicely brings the EP full circle to its beginnings, emphasizing the disc's overall sense of cohesion and singular purpose. I hesitate to throw out the word ""experimental"" in most cases, but here I think it's warranted, as Friel's music is quite explicitly designed to test the sonic possibilities of a set group of objects and explore as much of that ground as is reasonably possible on an EP.

Astral Glamour,The Homosexuals,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c152eb335119a49ed544/1:1/w_160/f2310919.gif,2004-08-17 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3975-astral-glamour-box-set/,ReRMorphius,"As cultural constructs such as ""punk"" traverse the dimming corridor of history, they're revised in unfathomable ways. Temporal distance hews away their ambiguities until they fall into orderly, narrative rank and file. In our collective memory of historical events, some players are canonized, others are diminished, and the process that separates them often seems arbitrary. With punk rock, this process of selective forgetting has at least one discernible component-- the most heralded old punk bands are the ones that mainstream rock critics ordained as the movement's standard-bearers. Most of us remember The Sex Pistols, The Clash, X, The Germs, The Ramones, Wire, The Fall, and Black Flag. But how many remember Crime? What about The Adverts? What about The Homosexuals? Perhaps The Homosexuals, who evolved from a band called The Rejects, were never in the right place at the right time. But this seems unlikely, considering that The Rejects were opening The Roxy for The Damned, The Jam and Wire in the late '70s, which is pretty prime in terms of the punk zeitgeist. Perhaps their name scared away cultural dilettantes slumming for a more mannered radical idiom, but this is also improbable: The Sex Pistols didn't seem to have much trouble cementing their legacy. Perhaps The Ramones' tri-chord sing-alongs were just more memorable than The Homosexuals' adventurous, eclectic song structures (and ""Gabba gabba hey"" does stick in the brain a bit more than ""Ivory elbows/ Deny shads edge""). Nevertheless, in our current climate of rampant historical salvaging, it seems likely that every shooting star in the fleeting firestorm that was punk will be plucked from the obscuring swarm and bronzed for posterity. The Homosexuals are the latest to come (back) down the pike, clothed in new fire: reissued, remastered, repackaged, and finally, remembered. The triple-disc Astral Glamour clocks in at a whopping 81 tracks, and documents every salvageable mote of music The Homosexuals committed to tape or vinyl from 1977 to 1984, including multiple versions of many tracks (guitar mixes, vocal mixes, live versions, instrumentals). Most of the first disc's songs appeared on the posthumous 1984 Homosexuals LP and The Homosexuals' CD reissue that was released earlier this year. So it's the second and third discs that will get exhaustive collectors all hot and bothered-- they're brimming with tracks restored from decaying LPs and an ultra-rare tape of which 10 known copies exist, plus demos, singles, unreleased tracks and alternate versions unavailable anywhere else. Handsomely packaged in a gate-fold case with a 32-page booklet of photos, posters, lyrics, and commentary, Astral Glamour might be the collection by which the best punk band that no one heard finally get their due. The Homosexuals epitomize the British post-punk style of the late '70s (why didn't Rough Trade pick this up?), combining the brainy word collages and winding guitars of Scritti Politti with the manic energy and bizarre flourishes of The Pop Group. Even remastered, Astral Glamour raises shitty production to an artform, and the tinny guitars one associates with old punk records achieve effects of depth, texture and distortion that are startling. But what really distinguishes The Homosexuals from their numerous peers is the remarkable diversity of their output, which maintains its vigor and cohesive mien while exploring different methods of construction and tone: ramshackle pop, mangled dub, rock shredding, garage funk, Afrobeat, and gutter psychedelia. ""My Night Out"" blasts off with chaotic guitars and babbling, affected vocals reminiscent of The Pop Group's ""We Are All Prostitutes"", before collapsing into a streamlined pop/punk anthem. The title track evokes Entertainment!-era Gang of Four, with its melodic bass licks and trash-funk guitars. ""Hearts in Exile"" has a squalid grandeur as it moves in and out of the speakers, a ghostly, vanishing version of the Psychedelic Furs' sweeping paranoia. ""You're Not Moving the Way You're Supposed To"" reworks New Age Steppers-style ragga-punk with plinking harmonics and euphoric rock breakdowns. The twinkling piano and amorphous atmosphere of ""Nursery Chymes"" predict The Walkmen 25 years before their advent, just as ""In Search of the Perfect Baby"" seems to auger the disturbed and dilapidated opulence of Frog Eyes. The complete songs are strung together with wispy motes of ephemera, such as the fractured dub of ""Symbols I Love"" or the electric stutter and flux of ""Black Noise"", which rolls into the twangy, laddering funk of ""Ants on Parade"". Taken alone, any song on Astral Glamour is engaging. Taken together, in all their multiplicity and ambition, they cohere into a monstrous and shambling mutant before which one just collapses slack-jawed and cowers. As David Berman put it, ""Punk rock died when the first kid said/ 'Punk's not dead.'"" Maybe so, but as limb after limb is plucked from the wreckage, it's leaving behind one exquisite corpse. The three-plus hours of material ranging over Astral Glamour unites The Homosexuals' fragmentary oeuvre to reveal them as punk visionaries who were at least as questing, untamed, and ultimately listenable as any of their more renowned contemporaries. This is the sound of history revising itself toward perfection.",,8.0,
The Slickness,Prince Po,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17eb1335d7bf1698288/1:1/w_160/e705888b.jpg,2004-08-17 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6547-the-slickness/,Lex,"I asked a hip-hop dealer on the corner of 3rd & St. Marks if he had the new Prince Po album. Apparently, I had asked him for the new Panda Bear LP instead, as he had no idea what I was talking about. ""No, I ain't got it. You want 213 instead?"" ""Prince Po?"" I pressed. ""From Organized Konfusion."" ""You mean Prince Paul?"" ""No, dude."" ""No dice, then. You want Nina Sky?"" And the Prince Po international parade of anonymity marches on. Organized Konfusion was more slept on than Trina, and while Pharoahe Monch went on to get the fuck up, Simon said Prince Poetry would have to wait in the basement while the other children played in the yard. But seven years on from The Equinox, Po's bouncing ball of justice may have arrived in the form of his Lex Records debut. From Po's opening volley (""Grind like the Clipse, flow like The Beatles"") to his closing pathos, this ""freshman"" release is the white pair of gloves for Po to usher in a promising era of The Slickness. While Anticon beatmaker Jel's tag on the opening track might hint at Anticon-esque abstruse nonsense, ""Hello"" is an accessible pacecar for Po's solo debut. Legato strings tease the listener for a half-minute before Po steps up and recites the Virgin Megastore's $9.99 rock section: ""My ghetto Synchronicity officially eludes The Police/ They bes terrified of my mystery/ Got 'em walking on the moon/ When they Hootie blowing 'fficially parties/ It's like The Clash when they mention me."" Aside from illuminating his knowledge of a canon outside the hip-hop sphere, Po's deft wordplay demonstrates his growth since Organized Konfusion's Stress. Like Monche, Po abandoned the sing-songy early 90s flow for a semi-rhythmic machine gun style, allowing him more longitude. On the emotional ""Be Easy"", Po spits soul-baring honesty: ""Major cutbacks, blacks go first.../ So many crooked cops pull cards and they hate spades."" More importantly, Po never loses touch with hip-hop's carnal side. On the ""Across 110th Street"" mock-up ""Love Thang"" rocks a soul-stuffed sample that probably got my mom and pops to hit the sack. Danger Mouse makes the bed while Po fluffs the pillows: ""Baby, I'll sop up your biscuits with this gravy straight out the pot/ Hot how you want it."" Meanwhile, UK beat chemist Richard X delivers the hottest track here in the form of ""Hold Dat"", a 16-bit skyscraping car chase. (Sorry DJs, it's only on the CD.) Oddly, the album's title track falters. The Atlanta Braves woh-oh'ing bores and disrupts the album's otherwise flow. Furthermore, The Slickness does suffer from a slight case of guest bloat. MF Doom simply outshines on ""Social Distortion"" with lines like, ""Wrote this humdinger with a dislocated bling finger,"" and, ""Drag 'em backstage like the tiger did Siegfried""; J-Zone, Raekwon, and even Jemini's appearances frequently show up the main attraction as well. Still, The Slickness excels at balance. Like Doom's Vaudeville Villain and Danger Mouse's Grey Album, Po & Co.'s non-denominational approach lets the album dance between straightforward beat-knocking and esoteric soul to please the hip-hop head and the indie rockers alike. Despite a handful of occasional blunders, Po helms an excellent release.","After seven years of silence, Organized Konfusion emcee Prince Poetry brings his debut solo outing to Warp Records' increasingly prestigious hip-hop wing, Lex. A slew of talent-enhancing producers (Danger Mouse, Madlib, J-Zone, Jel, and UK electro icon Richard X), and some show-stealing guest rappers (MF Doom, Wu-Tang's Raekwon, and Jemini) are along for the ride.

Kate,Spalding Rockwell,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a680c0084474cd0c09a1/1:1/w_160/55c06495.jpg,2004-08-16 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7776-kate/,Defend Music,"Electroclash was preoccupied with its own brevity. Genre figurehead Larry Tee and his people spent lots of money and column inches convincing a percentage of articulated punters in urban centers that this hiccup of electro, techno, and lipstick-punk ethos would be vital for the next three minutes, or at least cooler to namedrop than Digital Hardcore. The tarted-up viral marketing campaign worked-- did the ""Electroclash Tour"" roll through your town?-- but the artfully coifed style union ran into some trouble when its various entities started trying to capitalize: The brightest sparks of a hipster movement aren't supposed to simmer; they should flare up nicely, but then explode into pretty slow-motion confetti, as final proof of the fad's premeditative, finite life. Crashing and burning, though, doesn't get you paid, and that's where Electroclash finds itself faltering. Spalding Rockwell consists of ML and Nikki, two leggy gamines with a knack for Nagel and cheeky sleaze electro ditties like 2002's ""White Cotton Panties"". The band's singles had their bits of good-natured debauchery, no question-- and Kate, the duo's dull cash-in full-length, makes electroclash's furious endorsement of the moment seem like pure genius. Unfortunately, when confronted with manufacturing a body for their inflated pretty heads, Spalding Rockwell stumble badly on their 10-foot stilettos. Kate is astoundingly vacuous as a standalone album. When it's not blatantly reconstituting the stippled rhythms and brazen, sex-fueled vocal chants of electroclash, it gathers from a musical gene pool that seems pretty typical. There are tepid My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult rampage yammers (""Masha""), melodic references to Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"" (""Nina""), and retreads of Fannypack-style neo-electro (""Naughty""); ""Boy"" sounds like Peaches covering a Raveonettes song. Over ""Karahi""'s introductory beats, either ML or Nikki blurts, ""You should give me everything that I want in this life, because I'm that good looking."" The song then unfolds around a sleazy, distorted drum track, sinister synth figure, and the repeated lyric, ""Pills, pills, pills, pills."" Taken with the opening declaration, we're probably supposed to consider ""Karahi""-- all two minutes of it-- as a jaded meditation on the dangers and decadence of the glitterati lifestyle. Instead, it just suggests Murray Head as a horny recreational drug user. A little flesh, a little history, and suddenly you're working at a Quizno's. In its fleeting moments of resonance, Kate might pass as background ambience for after-hours meat-packing facilities, or as music for the Derelicte campaign-- rock guitar-addled opener ""Ingrid"" is a passable sister to Miss Kittin's totally shit-hot ""Professional Distortion"", and ""Bad Bad Thing"", a fully realized version of Spalding Rockwell's normally sputtering come-on does give off a haughty coolness. Just like the scene that birthed them, ML and Nikki love coasting on horizontal action and druggy naughtiness. But while stink-puddle sex on a chainlink fence has its place, it's definitely not gonna last all night. (These are Manolo Blahniks, after all.) And Spalding Rockwell never give us anything besides a bump (see: ""Cocaine""), which means Kate's highs are momentary at best. Like licking an East Village toilet seat, the whole thing just seems like a dumb idea in the morning.","Electroclash has-beens give it one final cash-in with this disasterous full-length outing.

If Only a Sweet Surrender to the Nights to Come Be True,Esmerine,by: Nathan Humpal,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf45e6ef95969322f69/1:1/w_160/3d79ca5e.jpg,2004-08-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2908-if-only-a-sweet-surrender-to-the-nights-to-come-be-true/,Resonant,"The first time I saw Godspeed You Black Emperor!, the stage they were playing on was about as big as my apartment kitchen. Shoving nine shaggy, disheveled Canadians into a tight corner along with cellos, dulcimers, glockenspiels, and whatever-the-hell-else strikes me as somewhat inhumane but the physical proximity of the musicians seems a completely appropriate manifestation of what has become the typical GYBE sound. The music begins calmly and comfortably, droning and relaxed, as the musicians attempt to adjust themselves, but before long, the inevitable tension arises: Norsola steps on Sophie's foot, Dave ashes in Efrim's hair, Mauro elbows Roger, the projector shines into Aidan's eyes, and eventually the sound grows to a cacophonous slow riot. You'd think that the essentially two-person line-up behind Esmerine would then contribute to a more relaxed and meditative mood. Consisting mainly of A Silver Mt. Zion and Set Fire to Flames' Becky Foon on cello and Godspeed's Bruce Cawdron on sundry percussion, Esmerine's minimal personnel should have much more breathing space, and hence, arrive at a less stressed sound. Not so: Their debut record is a mixed bag of the contemplative and the aggressive, as the two members seem to latch onto that claustrophobic Godspeed frustration, possibly purely by force of habit. A xylophone opens the record's leadoff track, ""Red Fire Farm"", with strings and militaristic drumming following close behind, building, building, and then slowly exhaling as the track returns to a crawl. So it's typically Godspeed-esque, save one important thing: In stark contrast to GYBE's fiery 22-minute suites, Esmerine practice remarkable efficiency: The track reaches its climactic frenzy in a taut 4\xBD minutes-- and without sacrificing any of its tension or release. Of course, while this is certainly a functional start to the record, it's hardly spectacular, and even less so in comparison to its follow-up, ""There Were No Footprints in the Dust Behind Them"". ""Footprints"" exhibits a much more effective use of the elements available to the two leaders: Here, strings take the forefront, and, given plenty of room by underlying unobtrusive percussion, are allowed to set the song's pace. This provides them the space necessary to explore the range of their pitch and tempo, and to shake the room, drone at midrange, and then shriek out excitedly, all within the span of a few concise moments. Though Esmerine hardly exercise the succinctness of the opening song here, the unexpected dynamic range of ""Footprints"" makes its 12 minutes seem a perfect length. These two tracks represent how the rest of the album can generally be categorized: a) typically Montreal structured crescendos, or b) exploratory contemplations. What's interesting is that these two elements balance each other out, neither allowing the album to become an exercise in tension sustenance (a la Yanqui UXO), or to be written off as obnoxious, rambling tedium (Set Fire to Flames' Telegraphs in Negative). While the crescendos are allowed ample time to brood, the meditations are never shown a level of hospitality that could encourage them to overstay their welcome. Still, it might have been nice if the duo had taken better advantage of their opportunity for genuine exploration.","New project from Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s Bruce Cawdron and Becky Foon of A Silver Mt.

Book of Silk,Tin Hat Trio,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8825e6ef95969321217/1:1/w_160/8aee384c.jpg,2004-08-16 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8265-book-of-silk/,Ropeadope,"Tin Hat Trio seem to exist on a plane far removed from the rest of modern music. Heedless of genre, era, and trend, the Trio have patiently spun their creaking, cinematic yarns over the course of four enigmatic albums. By absorbing a variety of nearly forgotten, worldly styles-- flamenco, post-bop, Eastern European waltz, tango, gypsy folk, bluegrass-- they've come to occupy a singular niche that might be described as cozy if it weren't so haunting. Book of Silk is perhaps their most evocative work, a sepia-toned, still-life dream that whispers with secretive, mournful passion. No doubt the tragic death of guitarist Mark Orton's wife just before the album was recorded cast a shadow of lament over the sessions: whereas Tin Hat Trio previously winked at old-world forms as novelty, Book of Silk shudders with an almost morbid mortal understanding. Like the most compelling human dramas, it's precisely that lurking sense of sweet sorrow that raises this album into rarefied heights. Added to the core trio of Orton, accordionist/pianist Rob Burger, and violinist Carla Kihlstedt are longtime Björk harpist Zeena Parkins and tuba player Bryan Smith. Both played with Tin Hat on their last release, The Rodeo Eroded, but here their roles are expanded, enlarging the overall sound on opposite ends of the tonal spectrum. Smith's rich tuba bass is especially significant throughout the album. Though softened into a rumbling smudge, its almost subliminal frump provides droning, sober ballast against the album's chiming strings. The eerie ""Compay"", for instance, tiptoes along with stifled paranoia, Smith's tuba anchoring an ascending trill repeated in unison on piano and violin. ""Things That Might Have Been"" is a gritty, countrified reel that's both ponderous and delicate, and a rare recorded meeting of accordion, dobro and tuba-- a true feat of rusty, broken-down ambiance given the latter instrument's usually jolly marching-band clownishness. Pinned onto concise arrangements, and unburdened by longwinded solos or standard structure, most of these songs are powerful and pure in their linearity. ""Elliot Carter Family"" and ""Light Black from Pole to Pole"" stray into abstract Kronos Quartet territory, but slow burners like the gorgeous ""Lauren's Lullaby"" and heartrending opener ""The Longest Night""-- both clearly informed by deep loss and deeper love-- are painfully vivid. By no means is the album a bleak downer, though; the band paints with a full palette of emotions. Kihlstedt's oily violin scats like a French street corner chanson on ""The Clandestine Adventures of Ms. Merz"", while Orton's jazzy picking warms up ""Hotel Aurora"" and his banjo twang throughout the syncopated swing of ""Same Shirt, Different Day"" borders on front porch funk. My initial feeling was that with no composition longer than five minutes, these musical vignettes are almost too brief to make an impression. But the album clocks in at just over 50 minutes total, pretty much the golden number in terms of sustaining a mood and holding interest. To the band's credit, this is a great album in the old-fashioned sense, a gripping and contiguous work meant to be pondered as a whole. Maybe that's not the best marketing angle given the current single-for-hire downloading zeitgeist, but I don't think they care. Given their boldly updated antiquation, Tin Hat Trio might be channeling their music from another age.","Latest release from these NPR darlings is haunted by the spectre of guitarist Mark Orton's wife, who died in a tragic accident just before the album was recorded.

The Function Room,Half Cousin,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c161c0084474cd0c331f/1:1/w_160/25778c87.jpg,2004-08-16 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3989-the-function-room/,Grönland,"It's no secret: Music is best when it has a secret to keep. Often, the longer an album's treasures take to reveal themselves, the longer they take to wear thin. But a record can look good both from afar and under the microscope, as evidenced by Scottish collective Half Cousin's The Function Room. The album presents a trove of pleasantries off the bat, but its subtler treats are revealed only after a set of glaring entreaties-- that sludgy bass stomp that opens its first single, ""Country Cassette"", those affable acoustic guitar melodies, and a charming lo-fi aesthetic. The Function Room takes the found-sound aesthetic to a whole other level: Here, the band seems to have taken whatever random parts were lying around and made music from them (""Country Cassette"" even enlists a sink as percussion). It's treacherous territory, to be sure, but Half Cousin pull it off convincingly, faltering only in the rare moments that they sacrifice melody to spotlight quirky instrumentation. Delightfully oddball without the heavy-handedness that often accompanies that rep, Half Cousin are capable rockers as well. ""Canned Laughter"" brings together the best of both worlds, scattering piecemeal effects and flourishes around a core of bawdy live drums; key are the deftly manipulated feedback swells-- part of the multi-tracked guitar part out of which the band builds a sundry but insistent rhythm. Exemplary of the record as a whole, the song is filled with subtle sweeps and jaunts throughout: tracks discreetly disappearing from one ear and reappearing in the other, multiple sounds strung linear to form a singular melody, and various other affectations pulled from a hefty sack of tricks. Half Cousin haul their sack reliably throughout The Function Room. Yes, these tracks are robust with melody and can rend hearts as readily as any of the artists on Devendra Banhart's contempo folk exposé Golden Apples of the Sun, but the band's greatest asset is their ability to pull sudden turns and drop non-sequiturs without ever inhibiting the flow of the album or jarring its fetching aesthetic. A stolid, Joyce-ian read-over, spoken in thickest Scottish drawl, turns the downtrodden ""Mrs. Pilling"" even soggier before a radiant electric guitar and ascending vocal melody carry the song down a markedly sunnier path. Meanwhile, more straightforward folk tracks like ""Hindsight"" and ""Blue Ruin"" evoke the usual canonical suspects (Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen, Bert Jansch) while owing a substantial debt to a diverse array of modern artists (Beta Band, Beck, and Skygreen Leopards all come to mind). The album closes on a self-conscious note with a dirgeful, if rote, cover of The Beatles' ""Girl"". Half Cousin meet the song halfway, retaining its melody and structure while razing its originally unexotic instrumentation and replacing it with a kitchen sink-full of accordions, theremins, clarinets, and pedal organs. A daunting track for any band to tackle, Half Cousin make the audacious choice to render it verbatim, succeeding in ways even The Beatles didn't, strikingly capturing and enhancing the psychedelic torpor of the original with novel instrumentation and a downcast, lugubrious performance. Under the auspices of a lesser band, the move might seem gimmicky or apologetic, but Half Cousin turn in a motley effort of incidental genius-- a modus operandi the band fit quite nicely.","Scottish-turned-London resident Kevin Cormack's debut as Half Cousin is an experimental pop jaunt with junkyard percussion, affable guitar melodies, and a charming lo-fi aesthetic.

I Am a Cold Rock. I Am Dull Grass: A Tribute to the Music of Will Oldham,Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c25e6ef95969322a3b/1:1/w_160/06cb5fa4.gif,2004-08-16 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5978-i-am-a-cold-rock-i-am-dull-grass-a-tribute-to-the-music-of-will-oldham/,Tract,"In early 2004, Will Oldham released a tribute album to himself, the sprawling and divisive Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy Sings Greatest Palace Music. Oldham's history of shape-shifting (his aliases to date include Palace, Palace Music, Palace Songs, Palace Brothers, Will Oldham, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, and the simplified Bonny Billy) has always encouraged a certain amount of stylistic diversity, allowing him the freedom to craft new homes for his thin, defeated yelps and quasi-absurdist prose. Sometimes, his goods are framed in full-band noise (Palace Music's Viva Last Blues); other times, they're spare and minimal (Palace Brothers' spectacular Days in the Wake). Still, Greatest Palace Music saw Oldham's tendency towards reinvention circle in on itself, the ultimate expression of meta-reflection: Oldham performing his older material under the guise of his contemporary alter-ego, with a crowd of Nashville session musicians adding sickly sax solos and slide guitar. Just months later, Tract Records has released a slightly more conventional tribute record: I Am a Cold Rock. I Am a Dull Grass. features covers of classic Oldham cuts voiced by prominent indie artists (Iron & Wine, Calexico, Pinetop Seven, Sorry About Dresden, Scout Niblett, and Adrian Crowley appear) and a slew of lesser-known Oldham admirers who were hand-picked from the label's open call for submissions. And since most of this two-disc collection's material playfully imitates Oldham's trademark spare-and-acoustic style, it seems likely to introduce fans of the Oldham aesthetic to some impressive new voices, including Jeffrey Luck Lucas and Diana Darby. Of course, it's the more recognizable names that triumph. Calexico's take on Days in the Wake's ""I Send My Love to You"" is a stunning reanimation. Its lilting pedal steel, violin, light percussion, and boy/girl harmonies puff up Oldham's vocals-and-guitar lament, adding heft and gently smoothing over all of Oldham's scaly admissions-- a cool hand brushing bits of hair from a sticky brow. Fundamentally, Calexico's approach is not really so different from what Oldham himself attempted on Greatest Palace Music: harsh, abrasive intensity traded for a soft, layered beauty. Iron & Wine's cover of ""We All, Us Three, Will Ride"" builds on the Viva Last Blues cut with gently shaken handheld percussion, and Sam Beam's hushed, melodic vocals smoothing out Oldham's Appalachian crackle. In true Oldham spirit, however, the safest contributions to I Am a Cold Rock are also the greatest missteps-- Pale Horse and Rider's studied ""Work Hard/Play Hard"" follows the Palace version too closely, ultimately missing the dirt-road recklessness that made the original so jarring and addictive. Likewise, Rivulets' melancholy strumming gives ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"" a markedly suburban feel, with vocalist Nathan Amundson's plaintive perfect pitch evoking none of the stewing emotion of the Days in the Wake original. The unexpected cohesiveness of I Am a Cold Rock-- which, however inadvertently, strips away all accoutrements, lineup changes, and other superficial fixes-- reveals Oldham as a surprisingly consistent songwriter, despite all his coy tricks and outfit-changes. In the past, Oldham's skills have always been at least partially obscured by the tenuousness of his vocals, the sparseness of his arrangements, and the full-wank sprawl of his bandmates. I Am a Cold Rock, like Greatest Palace Music, isolates and highlights Oldham-as-scribe, dragging his compositions into new, unbroken light.","It's never too soon for a tribute album, and with Will ""Bonnie 'Prince' Billy"" Oldham at the top of his indie rock game, he's given his due with this massive double-disc, 30-track covers record featuring material spanning his entire career, as performed by Iron & Wine, Calexico, Godspeed You Black Emperor! side project Molasses, Scout Niblett, Sorry About Dresden, Pinetop Seven, Pale Horse & Rider, and countless others.

Kiss and Swallow,I Am X,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99f5e6ef959693229e3/1:1/w_160/acf36b50.jpg,2004-08-15 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4156-kiss-and-swallow/,!K7Recall,"Poor Sneaker Pimps. The Reading, England trio has always been eclipsed by the trip-hop power trio of Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky, whose respective genre-defining debuts (Blue Lines, Dummy and Maxinquaye) made the Pimps' fine but late-to-the-game 1996 LP Becoming X seem somewhat irrelevant. Despite that, the band persevered, building a name for themselves on the strength of a solid single (""6 Underground"") and the Armand Van Helden-remixed club hit ""Spin Spin Sugar"". When vocalist Kelli Dayton left the band, though, Sneaker Pimps leaders Chris Corner and Liam Howe were suddenly without their only trip-hop selling point, and it became necessary for the band to redefine themselves. The duo experienced some serious growing pains with 1999's Splinter, but came back rejuvenated five years later with Bloodsport. The album was uneven, but to the Sneaker Pimps' credit, they had distanced themselves from the movement they were at first identified with, and had begun to follow a promising industrial-electro trajectory. While the Sneaker Pimps prepare a follow-up to Bloodsport, Chris Corner has issued a solo album under the name I Am X, a tongue-in-cheek play on the name of the Pimps' debut, Becoming X. In truth, I Am X's debut, Kiss and Swallow, doesn't differ much from Bloodsport's aspirations, and actually fits nicely into the band's current trajectory. On many songs, Corner's typically gorgeous low-end synth provides oxygen for the album's dark electro pulse, at times fancying I Am X a sinister counterpart to Felix da Housecat. The opening title track functions as a bridge of sorts between Bloodsport and I Am X's new agenda, as Corner's reverbed vocals are contrasted against the heavy but lilt synth bass and crunchy snare effects. Elsewhere, the opaque Add N to (X) low-end of ""You Stick It in Me"" provides a healthy bounce for the song's coked-out female vocals, and the initial glitz of ""Your Joy Is My Low"" melts nicely into crisp string melodies and a deliberate half-time rhythm that, for better or worse, recalls Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"". Still, for all Corner's forward-thinking moves on Kiss and Swallow, I Am X still takes painful recourse to his trip-hop past, desperately trying to emote with those soaring-but-boring vocal melodies that got him in trouble on Splinter. On ""Simple Girl"" and ""Mercy"", he ruins his fantastic production with overly dramatic deliveries, and the scratchy duet-chorus on ""White Suburb Impressionism"" offers one of the more painful lyrics of the year: ""Every cure is someone else's disease."" Two songs, thankfully, forgive I Am X of many of his missteps. The first is ""Skin Vision"", a slick and indisputably electro anthem whose ragged bassline could very well land the song in deep house sets, and whose sultry female vocals beg to be remixed. The second is ""Missile"", whose relatively complex progression and warm, cloudy timbre recall Brian Eno's ""Some of Them Are Old"", until I Am X harnesses the ambience with a labored beat, then overwhelms it completely with blasts of gargled choirs and warbled piano melodies. The song's not trip-hop, and it's certainly not electro-- it's just a good pop song.

White Rabbits,Neotropic,by: David Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c9eb335119a49ed7cb/1:1/w_160/17041200.gif,2004-08-15 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5747-white-rabbits/,Mush,"Riz Maslen has claimed that she doesn't mind being asked in every interview what it's like to be a Female Artist in Electronic Music, but I'm not convinced. Maslen, with the support of a new label, continues to distance herself from the image impressed upon her as the resident woman at Ninja Tune, and on her fourth album as Neotropic, she makes a concerted effort to tear down cumbersome and arbitrary gender and genre barriers that potentially obstruct her growth as an artist. White Rabbits is a sprawling and personal work that further develops Maslen's advances in electronic-influenced acoustic experimentation, until now best evidenced on her previous release, 2001's La Prochaine Fois. The album is also one in which Maslen continues her refusal to be conscious of gender in her work. She exhibits an active rejection of her assumed ""responsibility"" as a marginalized female voice in electronic music by remaining uncompromisingly gender-neutral; gender, for her, is essentially a non-issue. On non-instrumental tracks, her lyrical statements are willfully obscure, and the recurring lyrical themes are separation and release from a stifling relationship, which pretty well sums up her perception of the ""femininity"" in her own music. Maslen, now as always, wants nothing to do with image pigeonholing, and on White Rabbits she takes another crucial step toward total liberation as an unclassifiable musician and composer. What's most interesting about this statement of liberation is its construction. Maslen's composition model initially embraces an almost optimistic openness, but grows increasingly paranoid over the course of the album. This regression toward containment results in a type of inverse catharsis. Opener ""New Cross"" is a leisurely, bittersweet piece that melds faint electronic flourishes and muted distortion with relaxed live drum accompaniment and a soothing guitar melody. ""Inch Inch"" infuses a gentle piano line with clipped bursts of stuttering noise, but remains grounded in acoustic orchestration until the melody crawls to a halt. The predominantly acoustic façade begins to crack in ""Magpies"", a nervous, vaguely trip-hop instrumental, and shatters completely on the subsequent track, ""Odity Round-a-Heights"", which is built upon creepy ambient atmospherics and what sounds like a pirated recording of a German submarine radio played backward. The systematic introversion continues-- dissonant strings, eerie harmonica and flute lines, and foreboding glockenspiel melodies transform the role of acoustic instruments in the album from a source of grounding and comfort to part of the disquieting symphony. Finally, the increasingly claustrophobic environment implodes entirely on closing track ""If We Were Trees"", a stark piano-driven piece that concludes the album with uneasy resignation. Maslen, her voice tired and ambivalent, sings, ""Isn't it time we called it a day?"" Despite many hints of potential evolutionary strands Neotropic might choose to follow in the future (including a bonus track, which reveals the ensemble's adeptness at collaborative, free-form post-rock exploration), it is possible that the level of discourse on Riz Maslen's musical career will never completely move away from a narrow discussion of gender. But it is comforting to know that Maslen is unburdened by her ""place"" in electronic music. White Rabbits showcases an artist at the top of her form, remaking her image on her own terms, and refusing to allow her music to be affected by anything other than the limitations of her own creativity.","The Ninja Tune stable's only solo female artist abandons her former British electronic imprint for the more hip-hop-minded Mush label, and releases her first album in three years.

These Were The Earlies,The Earlies,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf35e6ef95969322f65/1:1/w_160/eba1867e.jpg,2004-08-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2907-these-were-the-earlies/,WEA,"Homesickness hurts a lot less if you get really high and start shooting the breeze with the morning wind. ""Transatlanticism"" isn't just the title of a Death Cab record; psychedelia can be prayerful without white-robed choirs. These are the lessons of The Earlies' debut album, These Were the Earlies, a deliriously ambitious record packed with neo-psych lullabies and swooning choruses. The record, which was compiled from a handful of selections off the band's first five EPs (hence the title), sets its sights eight miles high with opener ""In the Beginning"", which boasts hymn-like harmonies that recall the Beach Boys' Smile opener, ""Our Prayer"". But this isn't a teenage symphony to God: The Earlies just want to be taken home-- wherever that may be. Forgive them for not being too clear on where home is: Half the band is from West Texas, while the other hails from Manchester, England. The result is music that crosses borders as easily as its performers. One caveat: The Earlies aren't ""making everything new,"" as a man's voice intones during a collage-based, Willy Wonka-worthy freakout in ""One of Us Is Dead"". Their sound is filtered through the influence of countless indie psych-pop groups, most notably Mercury Rev. Think big, sweeping production, replete with bassoons and choirlike harmonies, and of course, the frail vocals of a stoned-sounding naïf. But whereas other recent up-and-comers (I won't name names if it's okay with The Polyphonic Spree) lack variety, and too closely ape their influences, The Earlies don't tie themselves to one particular sound: Sleepier tracks like ""Slow Man's Dream"" and ""Low"" manage to resemble the lunar chillout of Air or Manitoba, and set the band apart from their acid-friendly peers. With perverse abandon, The Earlies luxuriate in enough music history to make even the most bullshit-averse scribe reluctantly bust out his ""meta"" prefix. There's ""A Day in the Life"" in the news-reading of ""One of Us Is Dead"". There's ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in ""Bring It Back Again"" (""O can you see by the early light""). Even album standout ""The Devil's Country"" has a brass section just a few neighing saxamophones away from the USC marching band's ""Iron Man"", as singer Brandon Carr announces, ""Your march in time is just a shot away,"" like a man searching for not just home, but shelter. Additionally, if the title of ""Wayward Song"" makes you think of Kansas, you're in luck-- amid a floating piano ballad buoyed by ""I Got You Babe"" strings and computerized belches, Carr tells a son to ""carry on."" Yes, fucking Kansas! Nevertheless, The Earlies' ample cleverness gives them personality, and their sumptuous soundscapes offer a reason to keep pushing play. Even when their lyrics are banal (""It's all right, my baby"" from ""Morning Wind""), the music rarely fails to provide more twists than an M. Night Shyamalan ending. The album follows moments of quiet melancholy with frenetic orchestral crescendos, spiraling vocal harmonies, atonal noise and whatever else is handy. Sure, The Earlies could stand to employ their kitchen sink a bit more judiciously, but for the most part, they reach their lofty goals. In the tradition of mind-expanding music since Syd Barrett, however, These Were The Earlies poses more questions than answers. The narrator never finds his home (though Carr repeats ""take me home"" so often amid the escalating swirl and whoosh of ""Morning Wind"" that it becomes more chant than hook). In the closing track, ""Dead Birds"", he reprises the opening song's call to Mother Mary, but discovers only that ""time is free for the man who sleeps inside the glow,"" whatever the hell that means. Given the band's transatlantic proclivities, though, I'm guessing home is Atlantis. Or a water bong. Whichever is closer.","Debut full-length from this new psych-pop group recalls Mercury Rev, if spaced-out with the dense electro-acoustic glitch-pop of Manitoba.

More Adventurous,Rilo Kiley,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2795e6ef9596932040d/1:1/w_160/6acd1802.jpg,2004-08-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6789-more-adventurous/,Warner Bros.BruteBeaute,"Over the course of a 10-year career, Jenny Lewis and Blake Sennett have slowly graduated from quirky shoestring recordings, where clunky misfires rubbed against tight hooks and unexpected outbursts. Though their scattered but affecting indie pop has always borne the seeds of promise, their records have never quite lived up to the potential they've hinted at, leaving one to wonder what a stronger focus and better production could do for the band. Their last disc, 2002's The Execution of All Things, was a major step up from the lo-fi pop and alt-country leanings of their first albums. But as the band moves on to More Adventurous, their first album backed by a major label, you can hear them polish their act: Sennett's vocals are cut entirely, save for one track (""Ripchord""); the funny interludes are yanked; the jolts from urgent pop/rock to campfire singalongs are sunk into the valley of adult-alternative; and while the occasional swear words remain, they're no longer proudly shouted out. With all this change, More Adventurous places its bets on one thing: Jenny Lewis' voice. As pure as chilled spring water, and as cute and yearning as a hormone-stroked teenager, Lewis' crisp alto shines on every track. From country to new-wave, ballads to throwdowns, she makes the album her showcase, and while the rest of the band-- which includes drummer Jason Boesel and bassist Pierre de Reeder-- does yeoman's work in her service, they all seem to understand that those pipes are what's going to garner real recognition. Unfortunately, the songs (and especially the lyrics) don't give Lewis the support she deserves. More Adventurous opens with its weakest number, ""It's a Hit"", whose painfully awful lyrics criticize the President by comparing him to a monkey that throws its own feces. Compared to subtler anti-GOP songs like The Fiery Furnaces' ""We Got Back the Plague"", it neatly illustrates the gap between satire and pure griping. Elsewhere, the storytelling of the other-woman song ""Does He Love You?"" is too blunt and lacks poetry. And even though Lewis belts ""I Never"" like an authentic, blue-collar country diva, the song runs out of words, leaving her to repeat ""never"" up to 27 times in a row. The song's false ending is also awkwardly executed, as it comes to a total halt, and then pauses long enough before returning that when Sennett's guitar finally comes back blazing, you have to check that it's still the same song. But even with these weak spots, Rilo Kiley's music has become attractively consistent. They display an increased maturity on the expertly honed and highly accessible acoustic ballads ""Absence of God"" and ""More Adventurous"", where Lewis' lilting expressiveness has replaced the sassy accent and almost conversational tone she used to employ. If those are too sedate, ""Portions for Foxes"" and ""Love and War (11/11/46)"" all but steal the album: the guitars spike and roar, and Lewis stops worrying about ripping her best dress. Sure, the anything-goes stew on Execution produced better results. But Jenny Lewis has a voice that deserves to swoon in front of a rock band on one track and a string section on the next. And while productions like these tend to underscore the band's weaknesses, they're also taking Rilo Kiley in the right direction.","Former Saddle Creek indie-pop quartet makes the leap to Warner's new Brute/Beaute subsidiary, and issues this more refined effort with notably higher production values.

Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding / Horse and Goat,Venetian Snares,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a93d13d1975652139827/1:1/w_160/553a95f7.jpg,2004-08-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11859-huge-chrome-cylinder-box-unfoldinghorse-and-goat/,Planet µ,"A great schism has gradually formed in the orthodox church of the glitch and IDM scene. Of one doctrine is the Matmos/Oval/Mouse on Mars school, based around clicks, squelches and skips, in which musicians struggle to merge our fleshy, imperfect world with that of bent circuitry and drum machines. On the other side are those such as Autechre and Richard Devine, who program crystal-clear computer assaults directly into the listener's brain, with no patience for human warmth or error. While the first are an elusive breed of rarefied souls with mild artistic aspirations, the second are the kids who once survived on Mortal Kombat, Jolt Cola, and Dune, all grown up and ready to overload your conscious mind. And if, at the moment, electro-acoustician Fennesz and musique-concrete practitioners The Books are at one end of the scale, Canada's Aaron Funk (aka Venetian Snares) is providing the counterbalance. Venetian Snares' slightly menacing persona, drill 'n' bass onslaughts, and use of pizzicato string melodies all add up to, yes, a strong affinity with godfather Aphex Twin. But aurally, Venetian Snares equally occupies the soundscape of Autechre, creating mathematical spaces of sleek synth tones that show no trace of human intervention. This is more apparent than ever on Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding, Venetian Snares' second LP release this year following The Chocolate Wheelchair Album. Focused and consistent, Cylinder Box accentuates Venetian Snares' most accessible side. It's relatively gentle and melodic, and takes few forays into the abstract. Here, he's created his most sterile universe-- the computer generated spaceships pictured on the insert belie an environment lacking in the real voices or acoustic interludes that have occasionally humanized his quantized breakbeats in the past. The untouchable machinery of the album almost positions it as a piece of pure sound sculpture, but for the numerous complex beats and catchy melodies that keep it engaging. The drums veer away from the snare-heavy sound on which Funk built his reputation, to more metallic tones and sci-fi laser effects. The stereo panning in ""Ion Divoy"" is an especially memorable piece of production, and ""Vida"" is a standout track, ending in a cannon of pixelated bells and smooth syncopated pulsing. ""LI2CO3"" is another surprisingly pretty one, nearly Venetian Snares-lite. But there's still plenty of hardcore Funk present, and subtle pieces of scattered candy for the attentive listener. The album's fault lies in its lack of overall variation, which makes it nearly impossible to take in one sitting, despite the predictable ambient breaks. Funk's other recent release, Horse and Goat is a six-song EP inspired by its own cover art, which features-- in an attempt to shock the burgeoning soccer mom IDM listenership-- a Trevor Brown painting of a naked little girl helplessly surrounded by mutated children's-turned-sex toys. It's to be assumed by the ringtone modulated child's voice in the title track, and the deconstructed speak 'n' spells elsewhere (also present on Cylinder Box) that Funk is trying to say something about society's perversion of childhood; then again, it's hard to read too much into the work of a man whose stated goal is to make music that's ""fucked up."" Regardless, Horse and Goat is both more abstract and varied than Cylinder Box, but also less appealing. There are excellent parts, for sure: The title track is catchy and freaky, while the atmospherics of ""Lithium Twatting"" echo the dense computerverses of dark ambient artist Kim Cascone. But Horse and Goat passes by without really leaving an impact, and as much as we'd all love to proudly display it on our mantles, it may not be worth the $2 per song a U.S. resident must put toward ownership. By the time you finish reading this, Aaron Funk will have most likely released at least three more albums under two different pseudonyms. It's hard to say whether this level of output devalues the music, or stands as a testament to the man's work ethic (from interviews, it sounds as though he does little else). His position as among the most talented in his ultra-specialized field is unquestionable, his capacity for self-quality-control less so. But Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding is a good exercise in focused atmospherics, with beats that'll carry you along their lucid logic for as long as you're able to follow.","Drill 'n' bass virtuoso Aaron Funk offers two new releases-- one more refined than his usually abrasive output, and the other inspired by its Trevor Brown-painted artwork, which showcases a naked little girl surrounded by sex toys.

Three Fingers,The Rogers Sisters,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29c5e6ef95969320458/1:1/w_160/aa2d2aab.jpg,2004-08-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6820-three-fingers/,Troubleman Unlimited,"It's been almost two years of bad haircuts and reluctant dance moves since The Rogers Sisters' Purely Evil LP. In that time, the New York hipster gestalt has reached a feverish, pogoing pitch and bounced into the arms of an almost religiously unoriginal rehash of garage-rock and new-wave. The Rogers Sisters are following suit. With Three Fingers, the Sisters-- true siblings Jennifer (guitar/vocals) and Laura (drums/vocals), plus the ambiguous Miyuki Furtado (bass/vocals)-- have done little to alter their twangy Pylon-meets-B52's wigout, producing seven songs of hurry-up offense that strike quickly but barely stay in the game. The music is still catchy, still adrenalized: Furtado's manic Motherbaughian bark cuts like a razor and is countered warmly by the Sisters' shiny harmonies. But the sad point is, there isn't a lot of progress to make for a band so deeply rooted in a nostalgia that most twentysomethings can only appreciate second-hand. They're at their best when the two vocal forces-- Furtado and Jennifer Rogers-- spar playfully between verse and chorus. Opener ""Freight Elevator"" is the best example of that inconsistent mojo, an open-handed slap war between vocalists that reaches satisfying critical mass at its final moments. But when Furtado goes it alone, the band's flimsy façade is obvious. The predictable ""Prayers"" has little going for it, and ""Check Level"", with its ""Time for Livin'"" riff and ferocious shout-along breakdown, doesn't leave a mark. Over Laura Rogers' metronomic banging and Jennifer's patently angular guitar, Furtado exclaims, ""We're the voice/ The voice of America!"" Not exactly, but at least the voice of headstrong, self-referential mimeography. The album fares better where Jennifer's rigid vocals are featured. She gives ""The Secrets of Civilization"" a fun, spastic performance, but after an interesting flanged-drum opener, sister Laura settles into a lackluster beat. In a trio setting like this, if one element doesn't hold up the wheels come off the cart; in this case Laura Rogers' lockstep drumming is the culprit. When Jennifer unleashes the tribal grind ""Fantasies Are Nice"", the band's potential glimmers briefly. Here, Laura's by-the-numbers drumwork actually pays off, a flock of honking sax jangles the nerves, and Laura's talk/sing vocals hit home. But even though the subject matter is clever, and somewhat relevant, it still harps on the same themes as Purely Evil-- mindless overconsumption, delusional stockpiling, etc. It's 2004; the deficiencies of a market-driven economy have been hammered home by far more convincing voices. At just over 20 minutes, Three Fingers barely achieves velocity before grinding to a halt. Either there's a lack of ideas here or this is the band's idea of tightly-strung precision. Either way, the flashbulbs don't linger long. Like most post-punk acts, The Rogers Sisters probably make a much more stimulating live show than their album suggests-- there's no lack of energy here, only a novel way of presenting it.","Latest outing from these New York new new-wavers is no more impressive than their first: all style, no talent.

Fire in the Hole,Brand Nubian,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45e9d034d5c69bf3056/1:1/w_160/ad3a646b.jpg,2004-08-12 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1123-fire-in-the-hole/,Babygrande,"Let's be upfront: Spitting on mainstream hip-hop is really easy. Nobody cares that Pharrell pumps beats into a calculator and gets cookie-cutter club knockers. Nobody blinks when Juvenile chants, ""Uhh, I like it like that, she workin' that back, I don't know how to act."" Not a soul wept when The Roots brought the blatantly unfinished ""Don't Say Nuttin'"" to mega-producer Scott Storch and he dubbed the track dynamite. But the purist in me harkens back to a time long ago-- the early 90s-- when ""underground hip-hop"" was only fledgling phrase, and groups like De La and Tribe headed a Native Tongues army, preaching truth and beats for all. Eschewing the decadent values and gang-banging personas of their hip-hop peers, these Golden Age warriors wed themselves to Afrocentricity and musical ingenuity. So after a five-year hiatus, when New Rochelle natives Brand Nubian decide to release another LP, I expect the trio to build on their reputation as remnants of one of the best eras in hip-hop. Unfortunately, Fire in the Hole fails to invoke any effective nostalgia as it phlegmatically wanders through 12 solid but unexciting tracks. After 1998's stellar Foundation, Sadat X and Grand Puba left the group in search of solo success, but only found acclaim rapping on other people's tracks. Meanwhile, Lord Jamar made the challenging jump from rapper to inmate on HBO's Oz. As a result, Brand Nubian has been a name without a body and Fire in the Hole fails to capture the synergy that the group once possessed. Six years later, Brand Nubian just sounds tired. Listen to the much-hyped single ""Who Wanna Be a Star?"" and you've heard the whole album: The eternally idiosyncratic Sadat X drops crazy shit on the chorus (""And all the broads, yeah, ultimate head!"") while Puba and Jamar push honest but unpolished verses against well-worn underground hip-hop motifs. ""Always Mine"" echoes the album's laziness: a standard soul reworking and mediocre flows (""We first met in junior high/ I was so shy, you were so fly""). Meanwhile, ""Got a Knot"" is straight from the Mario Paint beatmaking kit with its jarring blips and obnoxious MIDI rock guitar. While Fire in the Hole may not spark a comeback, it does reveal glimpses of Brand Nubian's former potential as potent, emoting MCs. ""Where Are You Now"" crackles with summery keys and reveals Brand Nubian's vulnerability as they retell of all the women that have done them wrong. ""Just Don't Learn"" projects the desolation and nihilism of the ghetto through Brand Nubian's sobering experiences. Sadat X laments: ""I wish I had a dollar for every funeral parlor I been to/ I've been friends to a lot of dead niggas."" These two tracks, however, hardly salvage an otherwise average release. While Brand Nubian may boast positivity, they're missing the quality. If Nas is right, sleep is the cousin of death, and Brand Nubian's career is certainly napping.","Early 90s hip-hop crew issue their first album in six years, but can't hold a candle to 1998's Foundation, let alone their 1990 near-classic One for All.

Their own description of the music is harder to digest: ""Afro-Cuban Yoruba Roots meets Post Modern Free Jazz and Electronica."" With all that build-up, a newcomer might wonder if the band is some kind of world music mélange, and if so, whether they pull it off: With so many influences that qualify as ""exotic,"" the Sonic Liberation Front could have splintered into pastiche like the menu at the Rainforest Café, or muddied the colors into a drab blend. But the band's second album never pins them to one sound: The 11-piece ensemble proceeds with the grumbling unity of a town meeting that keeps ditching its own agenda. While the horn section evokes a mid-60s Blue Note recording on the cusp of avant-garde (especially the searching drift of ""The Sirens""), the unison passages verge on dissonance, like the head on the title track that frays apart a little differently each time. The horns front a rhythm section that includes three percussionists armed with congas and bata drums, with no piano or guitar in the middle to mediate. The instrumentalists lock intensely together, like on the taut rhumba that ends the record, while other times, the soloists have to carry on their own rants: On ""Seize the Time"", a saxophone burns itself out in a fury while the percussionists amble by, minding their own business. Female voices break out in Yoruba, and Chuckie Joseph sings his ""Agua Dulce"" over solo guitar. But where another band would turn these interruptions into a collage, Sonic Liberation Front just throw them into the mix, and the recording-- which sounds as live as a gig at the local community center-- never cues our responses or tells us which argument to agree with. With a world of options laid out in front of them, Sonic Liberation Front chose exactly the right ones. Exceptionally written and arranged, Ashé a Go-Go runs through compositions that are as terse and muscular as they are diverse, and every new turn fits the band's voices. While it's not always right to judge music by the engineering, the engagingly physical sound is this album's clincher: It's exhilarating for its own sake, but too matter-of-fact to summarize a band that barely tries to describe itself.","This 11-piece Philadephia-based ensemble never pin themselves to one sound, proceeding with the grumbling unity of a town meeting that keeps ditching its own agenda.

Wild Like Children,Tilly and the Wall,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8819d034d5c69bf3a6f/1:1/w_160/5e2e6a00.jpg,2004-08-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8264-wild-like-children/,Team Love,"Tilly & The Wall's full-length debut of study-hall pop, Wild Like Children, is the first release on Conor Oberst's brand new record label, Team Love. Which, I'm sorry; but calling a label that curates earnest and emotionally naked pop music ""Team Love"" is kind of like giving birth to a chubby kid and naming it ""Lardo."" It ain't gonna to help their chances on the playground any, if you get my drift. But in an era of stymied passion and cynical detachment, when many bands hide their emo urges under a bushel of aggressive guitar and abstruse non sequitur, Oberst's baldly maudlin sentimentality seems almost punk by comparison, as it unapologetically violates accepted mores of good taste. Is suburban mawkishness the new radicalism? The avant to the slickly cosmopolitan garde of Interpol, TV on the Radio, The Stills and The Strokes? The American mystery deepens by degrees. In addition to gelling with Oberst's unabashed my-angst-is-bigger-than-your-angst aesthetic, Team Love makes literal sense: Tilly & The Wall is a chance for old friends to get together and relive their halcyon days of teenage romance, early adventures with booze and heavy-petting, and starry, night-stalking urgency. Consequently, affection, tenderness and shared history ooze from the record's seams like homely yet structurally indispensable grout. Tilly & The Wall's roots lie in a band called Park Ave., which was one of the always-prolific Oberst's pre-Bright Eyes efforts. Park Ave. played saccharine, pointedly amateurish, yet relentlessly infectious sing-along pop, with a ""My locker is stuck again!"" lyrical purview that made sense, considering that its authors were actually living through such amplified teenage crises at the time, rather than exploiting them for forced pathos (cough Dashboard Confessional cough). Park Ave. also included Tilly & The Wall's Jaime Williams and Neely Jenkins, and their output, while just a hair above the Langley Schools Music Project in terms of musicianship, was ridiculously infectious, and revealed a songwriting acuity that was drastically disproportionate to its members' nominal experience. As such, those of you familiar with Park Ave. are already tacitly familiar with Tilly & The Wall-- they sound, essentially, like a grown-up Park Ave., with tighter arrangements, more focused songwriting, glossier production and a tap-dancing percussionist. I'll pause for a moment while you internalize that last bit. It's true. Most songs on Wild Like Children can be summed up as [band X] with a tap-dancer: Belle & Sebastian with a tap-dancer; Son, Ambulance with a tap-dancer; Rilo Kiley with a tap-dancer; Bright Eyes with a tap-dancer; and, on certain rollicking piano-driven numbers, Billy Joel... with a tap-dancer. This similitude is neither surprising nor a slight to the band; pop music is more about familiarity and heritage than novelty. Wheels that spin on the well-oiled bearings of eternally enticing melodies don't require reinvention; leave that to the deconstructionists, academics and post-music provocateurs. Brimming with co-ed harmonies, jangly acoustic guitars and lambent keyboards, Tilly & The Wall forgo a drummer and allow Jaime Williams' tap-dancing to provide the rhythmic chassis. While this may sound like a despicable throwaway gimmick upon first impression, it actually makes a great deal of intuitive sense, and seems so completely natural that one becomes kind of astonished that the tap-dancer-as-percussionist isn't more common. Williams hoofs out striated, staccato clusters that would be impossible to replicate on drums, and lends the clattering pop songs a crisp and martial demeanor that buoys them up above the traditional indie-pop maneuvers they otherwise employ. Of course, indie pop has always gotten by on swooning melodies, and without them the conceit would fall flat, but Tilly & The Wall rise to the occasion with a collection of thoroughly hummable nursery rhyme airs. Wild Like Children opens with ""Fell Down the Stairs"", which is consummately Park Ave., with its prolix male/female narrative of teenage trepidation (""They got lost as they were taking off each others' clothes""), galloping acoustic guitar, tinkling bells and theatrical a cappella breakdown. ""Nights of the Living Dead"" puts David Dondero doppelganger Derek Pressnall's vocals front-and-center for a quickening ode to the possibilities of a closed-down nighttime world, borne along on a tide of staticky, surging guitar, with sudden exclamations leaping from the darkly glittering current like fantastic fish. The wistful, gently unfolding ballad ""Let It Rain"" would have nestled snugly on the Son, Ambulance/Bright Eyes split release Oh Holy Fools, with a transparent lyrical simplicity that echoes its spare arrangement: ""I thought you'd come and go/ I never thought you would stay/ And I'm sorry if I tried to push you away."" In the final, unlisted track on Jawbreaker's Dear You, Blake Schwarzenbach broadcast this petition into the skeptical, dead-eyed cosmos: ""Show me the raw stuff of youth."" Nearly a decade later, Tilly & The Wall have answered with an album that harnesses this fiery anima with the highest imaginable fidelity. It's remarkable how little signal degradation has occurred, considering that the band members are professional-class citizens (two of them retired from public school teaching to devote more time to Tilly) in their mid-twenties. Often, grown folk singing about teenaged problems comes across as exploitative and off-putting (cough Papa Roach cough-- sorry, I must be coming down with something). But Tilly & The Wall split their time so equally between youth's heartaches and unmatchable joys that it seems a heartfelt and sophisticated coming-of-age document, despite the fact that ""sophisticated"" is usually antithetical to such ingenuous musical roman a clef.","First release on Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst's new Team Love label is gaining press for its unconventional percussionist, a tap-dancer. While this transparent gimmick is certainly easy enough to hate purely on premise, her clacks form a surprisingly normal rhythmic foundation for the band's clean indie pop songs, which, while a bit heavy on the teenage romance, never offend.

The Shining Path,Bruces,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0eaea9e61561daa468a/1:1/w_160/a4d46f6e.jpg,2004-08-12 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/978-the-shining-path/,Misra,"Omaha-bred Alex McManus is the sole force behind this one-man Americana folk band, and for more than half a decade now, he's recorded under the plural moniker The Bruces. He began recording in the 1990s, during brief tenures playing with Vic Chesnutt and Lambchop, but didn't manage to secure a record deal until the Athens-friendly (but Austin-based) Misra label saw fit to issue his spotty 2002 full-length The War of The Bruces. Two years later, he's returned with The Shining Path (presumably named for the Peruvian communist movement, although he makes no mention of it). McManus possesses a high, piercing voice, slightly off-key and unsettlingly off-kilter. It's precise and gelid in a way that sounds detached, which gives his songs a chilly quality appropriate to the overcast skies and wintry scenes that illustrate his music. And though his is neither a polarizing nor a necessarily unique voice, it seems never to settle down into predictability. Likewise, his music may be quiet, but is rarely ever soft. Alternately coldly confrontational (""What Do You Know About Home"") and warmly friendly (""Sleepwalking""), McManus has intuitively attuned his voice to the dulcimer, banjo, and rattling percussion that color The Shining Path's 10 songs; perhaps it's due to his former experience as a sideman, or to the fact that he plays almost every instrument on the album (there are only four non-Bruces listed in the credits). Sonically, The Shining Path is subtly eclectic, making good use of a few backup singers as well as a chorus of bom-bom-bahs on ""Fine Solutions"". ""Sleepwalking"" hinges on a nearly arrhythmic flamenco guitar interlude, and the wind chime of instruments on ""Pilot Light"" and the acoustic guitars like icicles melting on ""Far East Sweet"" anchor McManus' airy vocals to the ground. Despite admitting that ""I've got the wrong tongue for such a long sound,"" McManus' songwriting voice is keenly acclimated to the world around him-- both the natural and the manmade-- and his tensile, barely dissonant vocals lend gloomy gravity to his songs about insects in the bug zapper (""The Electric Halo"") and about the detachment of living away from home (""Beautiful Slanted Northern Light""). But even home presents a distinct dreariness: On the intimately domestic ""Pilot Light"", his furnace goes out, ""so I ignite the pilot light on my four-burner stovetop/ Heat my house with the oven door hanging wide open."" Similarly, most of the songs evoke loneliness and isolation, in lines like, ""And fallen stars they're all shooting something/ Then they turn into snow/ On your TV screen,"" which unravel a progression of images that descend from the skies and into your room. About halfway through The Shining Path, however, the songs begin to meander in and out of focus, the album begins to sag and slow, and the spell threatens to break. The nearly vocal-less ""My Nerviosa"" makes a nice interlude between the halves, but is too structureless to be so long on an album that is itself so short. It doesn't help that the brief ""What Do You Know About Home"" feels faint and only half-developed. But this Path does finally lead to the somber title track, on which McManus steels himself against the departure of a lover. As if summoning the last of his resolve, he manages to sound hopeful: ""If I had a compass I would turn the world around/ And make the sun arc the sky in your favor."" Of course, every silver lining has a dark cloud, and The Shining Path ends with McManus, his voice for once steady and solid, lamenting, ""I think I lost your road.""","Second album from Americana folk singer/songwriter Alex McManus (a former sideman for Lambchop, Bright Eyes and Vic Chesnutt) possesses a chilly quality, evoking overcast skies and wintry scenes.

PV Trecks,Hecker,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0955e6ef95969323589/1:1/w_160/b066d552.gif,2004-08-11 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3794-pv-trecks/,Mego,"I had some fillings put in recently, first time in many years. One of the cavities was in a semi-impacted, difficult-to-reach wisdom tooth, so my dentist had to use the ""slow drill."" Since the RPMs are lower on this particular drill, a significantly larger amount of force has to be applied to carve out a hole for the filling. (I asked him about the slow drill later; he told me that in the early days of mechanical dentistry, when these drills were the only game in town, the job required a large amount of upper body strength.) When my dentist got serious and leaned into his instrument, the sensation was completely overwhelming. I was numb from Novocain, but my skull felt like a Ford Festiva doing 50 on rims down a dirt road. The physical trauma of the moment was so shocking I didn't have time to formulate a reaction beyond ""Wow!"" And the sound! The sound was like... well, it was a lot like ""Stoocha Acid Zlook"", the 21-minute centerpiece from Hecker's Sun Pandämonium. I know, Andy Beta already mentioned dentistry in his Pitchfork review of that album, but nothing else in common experience comes close to describing the sensation of that particular record. You gotta talk about the dentist when you talk Hecker; it's the perfect reference point. Hecker's goals for his music lie in the physical. He's trying to ""move"" the listener, alright-- move him out of his seat and into some sort of duck-and-cover position. PV Trecks is less in-your-face than Sun Pandämonium, but it's no less abstract, and it affirms that Hecker is an odd throwback to a different era. It's all done digitally (the lone credit here is ""computer"") and I'm certain his setup is completely cutting-edge, but his music seems a tribute to the sounds coming out of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the early 60s. The goal then was a new kind of composition using a new kind of sound, and the rules were still being formulated. Much of this music existed in part to present previously unknown timbres as ends in themselves. This sort of ""pure"" electronic music is no more accessible now than it was back in the day. And so it is with Hecker. He uses familiar tones such as sine waves, pink noise and primitive blips, and then bends, twists and overlaps them to achieve visceral effects. His music is strangely devoid of any sort of ""organic"" quality; all sounds are birthed from a calculating motherboard inside the guts of a machine, and when they emerge from speakers, we know immediately that they've lived all previous days as 1s and 0s. The sounds are not referential, that seems very important. PV Trecks consists of 33 tracks totaling 34 minutes. A number of cuts are less than 30 seconds (you would be well advised not to buy it by the track), just a few squiggles, some chirps that turn quickly into grinding noises, and then it's over. Unlike Sun Pandämonium, there's nothing epic or particularly intimidating here; some of the sketches have a certain playfulness, while others contain chunks of silence. A few pieces go for balls-out noise (""Ciz-Glemp 2"" is particularly intense), but nothing is sustained. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hecker's music, when stripped of Sun Pandämonium's thrilling sense of sonic assault, gets boring after a while. There seems to be a complex underlying structure here, which might be fun to decode for the same reason people get wrapped up in jigsaw puzzles. But as music, PV Trecks never manages to cross over from the realm of pure idea.","Mego Records deathknell! Electronic noise artist's abrasive latest is a visit to the dentist.

Love the Cup EP,Sons and Daughters,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67dea9e61561daa539c/1:1/w_160/1ce413ff.gif,2004-08-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7773-love-the-cup-ep/,Domino,"In the music industry, it's not always all about who you know, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have well-placed friends. Glasgow's Sons & Daughters are about as well-connected as you could be. Their debut EP was first released late last year on former Matador publicist/Badaboom Gramophone publisher Ben Goldberg's Ba Da Bing! label; then, 2004 it-band Franz Ferdinand invited the band to open on their U.S. tour, whereupon Domino Records saw fit to reissue the disc. Which is not to say that the band aren't deserving of attention, just that they're lucky. Perhaps one reason they didn't have to work too hard to get their music heard is because they display quite a lot of potential. These two guys and girls (hence the name) prominently exhibit the heavy influence of Highland folk and American rockabilly, but they also have a modern rhythmic dynamism that places them very logically on a stage in front of Franz Ferdinand. Their fusion of punk aesthetics and traditional rock elements calls to mind the Mekons, though it's far more aggressively hybridized and less reverent than that of Jon Langford's crew. Sons & Daughters simply pull together whatever elements they need for the song in question, and wind up with a distinctive brand of spaciously recorded Anglo-American murder pop. Drummer David Gow morphs the shuffle of classic rockabilly into a hard, rough-edged groove to provide the band's basic drive, while the vocal trade-off between Adele Bethel's forceful alto croon and Scott Paterson's brogue-coated deadpan is somewhat reminiscent of fellow Scots Prolapse (albeit in a completely different musical context). Ailidh Lennon's mandolin lends the music an unmistakably Scottish flair, even amidst the unadorned post-punk guitar scratching that serve as the meat and potatoes of the band's sound. All of these elements are perfectly in place and balanced on opener ""Fight"", Bethel's eerily calm delivery meditating the song's rhythmic thrust and swagger. The undeniable highlight of the EP is ""Johnny Cash"", kicking in with a lightly distorted guitar riff and a swinging percussive stomp that carries the Paterson-sung verses. The band explodes into the chorus, with all hands on deck for the shouted vocals as the bass and guitar sweep from side to side like a wayward roller coaster. ""Blood"" careens over a furious post-disco stomp and carries subdued male/female harmonies in its quick-tongued verses, rising to the controlled outburst of the refrain, while closer ""Awkward Duet"" is the disc's big come-down, laying a delicate melody over Appalachian fingerpicking and militaristic drums. The song has a tense electricity to it that Bethel's hazy delivery oddly plays into-- this is a band that never turns it all the way up to ten, and still somehow manages to sound loud and manic. As their functional debut (their first EP, The Lovers, was self-released and not widely heard), Love the Cup presents Sons & Daughters as a dynamic and potentially awesome band. Even if they're not nearly the greatest band in Britain, as the members of Franz Ferdinand like to claim, Love the Cup displays a broad range and distinct sound that could soon make them one of the better ones.","Domino Records issues the debut EP from these Franz Ferdinand tour openers, whose fusion of punk aesthetics and traditional rock elements recall a more aggressively hybridized Mekons.

The Sound of Konk,Konk,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc395e6ef95969322dc9/1:1/w_160/20eac44e.gif,2004-08-11 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4583-the-sound-of-konk/,Soul Jazz,"With the rise of electroclash's popularity in the last few years, the sounds of robotic disco-funk have been seducing fashionable nerds onto the dancefloor in record droves. And with the parallel surge of interest in the early 80s New York scenes, it's a good time to discover Konk, an act that was born out of jazz, early hip-hop, and disco to create a fusion (certainly a dangerous word) of the better kind. Led by saxophonist Dana Vlcek, Konk channeled sounds ranging from the alien hooks of P-funk to the stilted grooves of krautrock through early-80s technology. Of course, a band with such a period-specific sound risks seems more silly than relevant 20 years later, but happily, Konk is both at once. It's cheesy, for sure, but if you dig good times, then The Sound of Konk-- a collection of their singles and LPs (such as Yo! and Jams)-- is ready for action. Like post-punk reference-point the Talking Heads, Konk apply the rhythms and melodies of Latin music within funk's staccato pulse. But while the Talking Heads' experimentation is contained in song forms, Konk maintain a funk-sprawl ideology in a system that foretells acid-jazz-- a slew of solos and sections announce themselves unprovoked over shifting grooves, creating non-linear yet highly organized multi-part jams. With several layers of live and electronic percussion, Konk compel movement. You don't need to dance to enjoy the music, but Konk won't likely do much for you if you're sitting still-- driving, running, cooking, or partying are all recommended Konk-enhanced activities. Konk's integration of live instrumentation and electronic manipulation remains impressive, combining synthesized sounds that are still imperfect enough to sound human with musicians of precise virtuosity. While Konk is often lumped with fellow downtown experimentalists Glenn Branca (with whose ensemble Konk shared members) or ESG, the strongest link there is a shared interest in the deconstruction and reformation of musical elements, especially in live performance. Simultaneously, Konk shares just as much common ground with the proto-techno of The Art of Noise or Yello. Like these acts, plenty of gated snare drums and Max Headroom-style vocal manipulation keep the mood of Konk gleefully rooted in the 1980s, but Konk's timeless horn section and airtight basslines save them from the fate of becoming a technological artifact. The Sound of Konk begins with one of Konk's most conventional tracks, instrumental ""Baby Dee"" (the bonus live version includes some excellent Kurtis Blow-style MCing). Delayed female vocals intertwine with a robotic male chorus in ""What U Want"", before the song lets loose a prolonged rhythmic breakdown of drums and synth bass. ""Love Attack"" begins with a monologue highlighting various dangers of an oncoming love attack-- such as when ""some girls think a kiss is a contract""-- segueing into a vocoded chant that could be taken from one of Señor Coconut's Kraftwerk covers. ""Soka La Moka"" breaks up the relative rhythmic homogeneity of the album with a tumbling bongo beat and klezmer horns. To today's ears, The Sound of Konk combines true dance pleasure and experimentation with the humor of the groovy whiteboy sound embodied/parodied by Gary Wilson. Should Konk be given credit for the accidents of history, accruing value like a fine wine as their once cutting-edge technology matures into bootylicious kitsch? Should a band be adored for the same criteria that could be used to criticize them? Maybe not, but in the words of Shirley Bassey via Propellerheads, ""Why ask your head? It's your hips that are swinging."" Beneath Konk's dated sound is some, well, intelligent dance music, and given the current popularity of !!!, or live/electronic hybrids like VHS or Beta, Soul Jazz chose the right time to unleash The Sound of Konk upon a funk-hungry land.","Early 80s polyrhythmic NYC disco-funk renegades are given their due on this new Soul Jazz anthology.

Gang Gang Dance,Gang Gang Dance,by: Andrew Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bffceb335119a49ed2f9/1:1/w_160/fedb68e8.jpg,2004-08-11 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3647-gang-gang-dance/,Fusetron,"248. I prefer Of Human Bondage to Portrait of an Artist as my sensitive male coming-of-age tale.
249. Sandle-tan
250. I blow my nose and-- nearly always-- examine the tissue. Claire was smart and had a borderline unhealthy obsession with Elvis Presley. She was beautiful to boot-- clear olive-complexion, auburn hair, brown eyes, corn-fed figure-- and I knew that no mere courting ritual could attract her to my sphere of awkward hellos and pudgy exterior. No, for her I had to think of something extravagant, something slightly self-deprecating but all-in-all a massive feat of wit and humility. Thus was birthed into the world by my 16-year-old hands the weighty and indulgent ""List of 250 Reasons NOT to Go Out with Andrew Bryant"". My reasoning was two-fold; (1) the sheer phenomenal length of such a list would express to her my devotion and attention to detail, or lack of anything better to do, and (2) it would plant the adoring seeds of refutation in her mind. For every step I took away from her, she would take three towards me, and for a brief period of my life I was Casanova, hand-in-hand with the complex and stunning belle of only my best dreams. 153. I break glass in deserted parking lots because I know that it is both a gorgeous display and a necessary one. As I lay on my sofa watching the revolutions of their recent self-titled vinyl only release dwindle to center, it strikes me that Gang Gang Dance (GGD) perform a similar transparently self-absorbed trick on their listening public as I did with the divine Miss C: They divulge a slew of seemingly unconnected and oft disturbing images in a successful attempt at shepherding the skeptics to their flock. Like my own situation, though, the group does so in a seemingly uphill battle of their own creation. Judging them merely by the gatefold-cover of this document-- and given the group's roots in the now-hot Brooklyn indie-folk scene, shared by mates Excepter, Animal Collective, and Mouthus-- one might presume a safe knowledge of what is contained betwixt cut-out photographs of skulls, literature, and band members seemingly hard at work perfecting their sound. Before even setting the needle to the groove, I had an inkling that Brian De Graw and Tim De Wit would bring the abrasive and frankly weird sound of former band Cranium to the record, outfitted with the Chrome-by-way-of-Appalachia noise of Jackie-O alum Josh Diamond. I also took for granted that vocalist Lizzi Bougatsos would yield a lysergic feminine insight to this boys-only genre of reinvented folk, yielding what would at best sound like a distorted Carter Family backed by the No Neck Blues Band. Speakers charged, the first sound I heard was one emanating from my own throat-- the acidic choking back of my false assumptions. Side A, entitled ""Kentucky"", begins with the gathering of aberrant tones produced by the sly reed of a dense and distorted flute. This eventually cascades into a true rhythm outfitted by a smattering of crude percussive techniques typified by other groups in the same musical vein such as neighbors to the North, Sunburned Hand of the Man. Unlike their brethren, though, GGD manage to keep a decidedly optimistic tone throughout the introduction, an interesting parallel to the operatic dirge of the band's increasingly lilting vocals. Throughout this exercise, guitar lines weave in and out of the periphery falling ultimately to a sturdy deep pulse and a vocal orgy of guttural wrenches and cries. This menagerie continues unabated until a bastard collection of sinusoidal tones washes on the banks of one of the album's few distinct ""tracks,"" ""Rugs of Prayer"". As a woodpecker promenade erects the scaffolding that will hold the weight of the track, a grumbling beat slowly builds, increasing in both rate and complexity. Guitar and synthesizer punch holes in the whining collection of drones, culminating in a grinding halt of munching jaw sounds, creating a startling bleak atmosphere that simultaneously breathes of its own accord and places its hungry fingers around your throat. A chilling song, it fittingly closes the first side on a note of anticipation as to whether this experience will provide an ending with any hint of what one could recognize as ""happy."" 49. One can not overestimate the stupidity of this statement: ""If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere."" The B-side continues GGD's dangerous and exhilarating flirtation with all things lining the sordid underbelly of popular music, beginning with the vocal piece ""The Thread"". Over an occasionally dropped beat, one does not deem to doubt the sincerity of Liz's plainly spoken plea, ""The things they say to you/ What are they worth?"" as skittering electronically derived percussion builds to match her vocal intensity. As is often the case on the album, unbridled fury is duly followed by a resting valley of contemplative instrumentation as the track slowly fades into a ping-ponging rest, another beat to serve as a future musical base. Atop this mesh, a volatile hi-hat eventually enters, creating a dialogue that results in a short-lived loop of intense synth-stepping heralding the album's theatrical climax and instrumental denouement. The final track-- as far as I can tell from the confusing liner-notes-- features most prominently the talents of former bandmate Nathan Maddox who unfortunately passed away in 2002, the victim of a chance encounter with a lightning bolt atop his girlfriend's apartment in Chinatown. Beginning on a zenith of buzzing bees droning into ever-shifting registers, a compelling series of chimes and a shifting rhythm map out a gamelan-style ascending scale that lends a foreign atmosphere to the nearly indecipherable lyrics. To this mixture, Nate adds a serious chant that stirs the music into a renewed fervor, as the once-steady drone becomes a feverish roar. The beautiful mess layers itself into a syncopating infinity shortly before a series of distorted vocals signal a timely rest and the end of the album-- an effect as breath-taking as the first time I listened to Tago Mago, excited and slightly disturbed. 207. Fat-Elvis should justly be considered as sexy as young-Elvis. Some records you fall in love with in their entirety. Only with time and effort do you begin to discover the subtle intricacies and details that lend to a fuller, richer interpretation of the whole. Gang Gang Dance succeed in back-loading this theory, forcing the listener to dedicate themselves piece-meal in the full understanding of this creation-- falling in love in ""stages,"" if you will. Either way, patient music-lovers will discover that, whether they're enamored by the forest or the trees, this is a record more than worthy of their full attention.","Gang Gang Dance, along with Excepter, Animal Collective (in their more extreme moments), and Double Leopards head up Brooklyn's outré-noise explosion.

VV2: Venomous Villain,Viktor Vaughn,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98b13d19756521398ab/1:1/w_160/175f9540.gif,2004-08-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8515-vv2-venomous-villain/,Insomniac,"I never thought underground hip-hop would brush shoulders with cold, hard philology until I made my way out to the MF Doom fan forums. Calling the people who post there ""Doom fans"" sells them way short; ""Doom scholars"" seems more appropriate. One person's reaction to VV2: Venomous Villain, the follow-up to Doom-as-Vaughn's fantastic 2003 album, Vaudeville Villain, involved a track-by-track, to-the-second rundown that analyzed how much time Vaughn spends on the mic. His science speaks: VV2 lasts 32 minutes and 53 seconds, and Vaughn raps only 9 minutes and 30 seconds of it. These simple (if fanatic) mathematics get to the heart of the record's problem: There's just not enough Vaughn, on either the mic or the decks. As on Vaudeville Villain, he's turned over all production to a number of underground heatseekers, and the album's vocal tracks almost always feature at least one special guest from the Insomniac label's roster. Four skits and interludes further detract from the pull, and as a result, the disc feels more like an Insomniac Records sampler featuring Viktor Vaughn than a proper Vaughn release. Fortunately, VV2 manages to hurdle many of these obstacles: Despite the variety of beatmakers, the record feels strikingly cohesive-- and naturally, when the Villain's on point, he's pretty much untouchable. On opening instrumental ""Viktormizer"", producers System D-128 and DiViNCi drop the requisite introductory sci-fi flickery before coursing briskly through glitched-up, Prefuse-inspired drumwork and settling into a scratched beat flecked with guitar and violin. ""Back End"" flutters in on the wings of a mensch-machine reminiscent of Disney's Tron, while Vaughn fires out from the corner: ""There's feds at the door, oh it's just Fed Ex/ I thought I heard walkie talkies, must've been them redneck/ Neighbors of mine they fuckin' with their CB/ And we up in the spot watchin' Cops on TV."" But there are too many problem areas: While Philly-based Session 31's piano breakbeat on ""R.A.P. G.A.M.E."" favorably recalls Doom's own work on Operation: Doomsday, VV2 executive producer IZ-REAL and Mars Ill's Manchild squander their verses with clumsy lines like, ""I'm trying to compensate for ya ill rap trace/ By concocting schemes to sell a few rap tapes."" Likewise, thin, plastic horn synths ruin ""Dope Skill"". Still, these weak spots underscore album highlights like ""Doper Skiller"", on which Vaughn trades verses with Kool Keith (whom some consider Vaughn's primary influence) amidst Sex Style-esque scratches. Though Keith by no means bests himself here, his brief appearance boasts some charmingly in-character vulgarities. Check: ""Leave ya yellow spots around your bed area/ Defecate around your head area,"" or, ""Urinate on your jacket and leave you pissy."" ""Bloody Chain"" is another standout, with Vaughn spinning a typically brilliant two-sided narrative with guest rapper Poison Pen. However, the record closes awkwardly: The Analears' remix of ""Pop Quiz"", while passable, feels somewhat incongruous within the context of VV2. In fact, Vik raps not as Vaughn here, but as Doom, suggesting the possibility that the track was tacked on as a means of fleshing out an already lacking effort. Throughout the course of VV2, Vaughn drops a number of lines that express a general dissatisfaction with the album, confirming suspicions that he may have largely just passed this one off. The record's opening verse advises, ""Dub it off your man, don't spend that 10 bucks/ I did it for the advance, the back end sucks."" Similar telling sentiments pop up elsewhere: ""Can't stand the beat, there's no sense bitchin',"" and, ""Coulda flipped it longer 'cept the beat was rather rinkydink"" both speak to Vaughn's frustration. Considering these deficiencies, VV2 feels like a sequel to Vaudeville Villain in name only, not in spirit. Then again, it's hard to complain about having more Doom to tide us over until the late October release of the highly promising Mm Food-- even if it's just 9\xBD minutes.","On the heels of his landmark Madvillain collaboration, underground hip-hop's masked genius, Viktor Vaughn (aka MF Doom, aka King Geedorah, aka Zev Love X), unleashes this sequel to last year's acclaimed Vaudeville Villain.

A Long Hot Summer,Masta Ace,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c567c0084474cd0c372f/1:1/w_160/b04cedb0.jpg,2004-08-09 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5604-a-long-hot-summer/,M3,"Treach put it bluntly: ""If you ain't from the ghetto, don't come to the ghetto."" Yet suburban white teens, the core of hip-hop's buyer base, draw their experiences with the state-sponsored segregation and degradation of the ghetto from their iPods and Discmans on their way to school. Hip-hop album liner notes and the pages of XXL serve as a proxy for those who can't face the ghetto first-hand. So when a fresh MC dons the griot's cloak and translates his world for public consumption, the gap that once separated millions of the Black and Latino poor, and their scores of campaigners and admirers, is lifted-- if only for a momentary spin of the vinyl. As the last member of the legendary J.U.I.C.E. crew, Masta Ace's ability to translate his life into hip-hop should come as no surprise. 15 years of paddling in the backwater of the rap industry (and utterly smoking Boogieman on ""Acknowledge"" along the way) has given Ace the fatherly insight of a veteran. While 2001's Disposable Arts brought Ace a new generation that was weaned on ""Sittin' on Chrome"", A Long Hot Summer is a lesson for tykes who don't remember when MC were cultural messengers. Unfortunately, A Long Hot Summer starts slowly. In fact, when you cop this album, do yourself a favor and skip the first five tracks. One of the many hip-hop traditions that Ace continues here is inconsistency, and it's unfortunate that the worst work on the album arrives first. Chicago's Dug Infinite offers up a yawner in ""Big City"" and Ace comes off lazy, like he let Urban Outfitters' Hip-Hoptionary ghostwrite his verses: ""This ain't America, is it?/ It don't take much for the cops to pay you a visit/ But do what you gotta do, fuck them laws/ Life is a test, you better up them scores."" Even 9th Wonder's patented soul sounds awkward on ""Good Ol' Love"", with Ace again delivering mediocre phrases like the ironic, ""Y'all think I'm washed up like I got in the tub."" Despite its unpolished beginning, the album bounces back with ""Beautiful"". Producer Koolade's elegant claps and weeping keys set the perfect backdrop for Ace to paint Brooklyn with a golden veneer. For the first time on A Long Hot Summer, Masta Ace invokes the honesty that made Disposable Arts so likeable: ""The most beautifulest thing ever/ And it's here to bring terror to the bling-era/ You can feel it in your inna'/ It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving Dinner."" On ""F.A.Y."", Ace immediately counterposes his romance with Brooklyn with the disdain and nihilism of a struggling MC, as he and Strick provide a laundry list of complaints about their inequitable conditions from tax collectors and sheisty label execs to sloppy girlfriends who fart in their sleep: ""To all you mean creditors and magazine editors/ Same ones that debted us and put niggas ahead of us/ I'm a mad dog who sits in the dark/ I'm fixin' to bark, watching 106 & Park."" Moreover, Ace does establish his ability as a capable MC. In a late attempt to counteract the average flows on the album's opening, Ace parades his lyrical feathers on ""Soap and Soda"". (Check: ""I just got home as the Sunkist the sky,"" or, ""I just grab my wife and we lay and Snuggle/ We talk about how one day we gonna sail on the Tide and get Wisked away."") Surprisingly, the bane of random play (aka the skits) pulls the album together thematically. Rather than wasting time with phone calls from friends or snippets of orgiastic female moans, Ace weaves the story of his relationship with the fictional hustler Fats Belvedere. The contrast of Masta Ace's dedication with Fats' unscrupulous money-chasing provides a glimpse of Ace within his Brooklyn context. While Fats may earn more money than Ace could earn in a lifetime, it's Ace's devotion to the art that Fats respects and ultimately what strengthens their friendship. In spite of the a world pitted against both of them, they find solace in hip-hop's bosom. (A legitimate motif on a hip-hop album? Tell De La Soul. Holy shit.) A Long Hot Summer merely extrapolates from Fats and Ace's relationship as Ace speaks with an earnestness and conviction about his life that gives his work credibility.

The Cover Up,I Am the World Trade Center,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c199eb335119a49ed5af/1:1/w_160/dc4c9205.jpg,2004-08-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4041-the-cover-up/,Gammon,"""The 1980s live on Radio Lite 104.1!"" And the station will proceed to skim the sonic surface of the Reagan Era, wrapping the lunchbreaks of sedan drivers in a comforting Pier Connection poultice of Human League and ""Hungry Like the Wolf"". Though there's always the occasional stab into the decade's deeper layers (""Here's a gem from Chris Rea!""), a large chunk of the population's 80s memories would fit on disc one of your average Rhino retrospective. I Am the World Trade Center take a different tack. They're as enamored of the decade as A Flock of Seagulls (who, incidentally, are still touring), but their memories live on in the rhythms of import singles and the tiny circuits of a 21st century hard drive. And if they spend a lot of time reveling, they do try to reinvent, as well. The Cover Up, I Am the World Trade Center's third album, tends to prefer detached whirs to direct references-- and that detachment drips all over Amy Dykes' every syllable. ""If you're looking for a good time/ Call me tonight,"" she throatily coos in opener ""No Expectations"". She's the unattainable 80s video vixen, pushing away Peter Godwin every time he gets close enough to smell the Chanel. Behind her, bandmate Dan Gellar's pulsing electro/disco bassline is punctuated with snare triggers and the occasional keyboard tinkle, which lends an authentic feel more akin to those flashy plastic times past than to present-day revivalism. And yet, it's all built with point-and-click Powerbook know-how. World Trade Center rock this dynamic well throughout The Cover Up, even as their songs eventually begin to blend into a pleasant haze of burbles and Debbie Harry poses. It's essentially a one-trick sound, but here, they do a better job of adapting it to their post-dated needs than they did on previous albums: ""Love Tragedy"" summarizes the disintegration of Dykes' and Gellar's romance to the cool and twittering underpinnings of Substance-era New Order, while ""Follow Me"" leaves more space in its arrangement-- with some tweaking, it could be a Trans Am-worthy mainframe freakout. The Cover Up also offers a cover of The Jam's ""Going Underground"", which nicely breaks up the album's fizzy beats with some electric guitar cranks and warm organ chirping. Guitars figure into ""Different Stories"", too-- an elastic wah-wah tone suggestive of early Britpop married to the clicky synth percussion of their beloved bygone era. It's the kind of thing I wish World Trade Center had further experimented with on The Cover Up; employing elements not typically associated with their retro revisitations is a better way to make this sound live in the present. To their credit, the duo do seem to grasp this notion: On the title track, they occasionally drop out the incessant clicky beat, and work in keyboard sounds that, at the very least, weren't included with most ROM packs back in the day. Still, while they could stand an infusion of variety, I Am the World Trade Center's version of nostalgia still sounds fresher today than most of what's endlessly replayed on Nostalgia FM. They're accessing what it sounded like to be cool back then-- not just popular.","Synth-pop retro-fetishists expand their sound palette on this third full-length, presently blowing up college radio charts.

Cash and Carry Songs,Octet,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3e9d034d5c69bf5409/1:1/w_160/7d908074.jpg,2004-08-09 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6097-cash-and-carry-songs/,Plain,"For so young a genre, lap-pop has run an outsized gamut of phases. Careening in just a few short years from imminent explosion, to reviled novelty, to just another banal indie staple, its artists have had precious little time to reconnoiter and derive a cogent statement of intent. Lacking a true flagship work, there seems a persistent air of illegitimacy about the genre, and so its artists' vision of DIY is viewed with less credibility than punk's or hip-hop's. But it takes at least as much skill to program powerful beats and create dynamic textures from celluloid as it does to bash guitars and drums into anti-music oblivion. And while lap-pop may not yet have any sort of unifying relevance, the technology ain't going anywhere; someone, somewhere, will eventually get around to writing the masterpiece that albums like The Notwist's Neon Golden and Ms. John Soda's No P. or D. fell just short of. Likewise, for such a succinct album, Cash and Carry Songs, the harmless debut by French lap-pop duo Octet, runs an outsized gamut of styles. If lap-pop hasn't yet found its chef d'oeuvre, this effort is sufficiently above average to keep connoisseurs of the stuff engaged and sated. For now, albums like this--- congenial and well-crafted, yet poorly defined-- provide the par for course. And that's okay. Cash and Carry Songs dabbles in divergent styles, failing to hunker down and commandeer its own. A sense of Múm-meets-big-beat runs throughout, posing an interesting textural dynamic. Check the spaced harpsichords and rock-steady beat of opener ""Hey Bonus""; the combination lays a throbbing, motorik groundwork while simultaneously casting light from above. Not 10 minutes yonder lie the lubed-up, housey electronics of ""Sneakers & Thong"", and further still the glaring rhythmic drones of ""Trackball of Fire"". It's obvious Francois Goujon and Benjamin Morando know their way around a Reason interface, and the finesse with which they build a distinct instrumental foundation for each track is admirable. Octet are at their best when they involve vocals, rather than milking tedious atmospherics, such as on the beatific but droning ""Anti-Camp Policy"". The aforementioned ""Hey Bonus"" is especially strong, despite its forgettable lyrics. In such a cordial context, where psych-pop meets spliced vocals and a house beat, it's easy to overlook a chorus of, ""Wasting my time/ Losing my mind."" In fact, during some of Cash and Carry Songs' more placid instrumentals, such unexceptional vocal flourishes are sorely missed. ""Kino Cat Leng"" is just a tad too blip-happy for a song without the telltale trademarks of IDM's more successful composers. Guesting on a couple of tracks is M83 vocalist Suzanne Thoma, whose robustly demure pipes are a perfect complement to Octet's slick yet too often dainty orchestrations. ""Blind Repetition"" is further aided by some deftly interwoven bass clarinet swells; lacking a steady beat, it's Cash and Carry Songs' closest encounter with ambient, and incidentally, one of its most sophisticated moments (something the duo might want to note on subsequent efforts). On the opposite end of the spectrum, ""Feels Good to Give Up"" successfully approximates the hip-hop-tinged female vocal pop so prevalent in the American mainstream these days, while Peaches cohort Taylor Saavy's vocal embellishments recall Octet's countrymen Phoenix. But what hinders this collection, and lap-pop in general, is a vacuous lack of identity. It has taken other forms of electronic composition up to 30 years to successfully invoke the ghosts in the machine, and most strains are still learning. On that timeline, lap-pop has barely begun its ABC's. Still, for a young genre with grandiose ambitions, Octet are a promising act who might one day turn exemplary.","If lap-pop hasn't yet found its chef d'oeuvre, this French duo's debut album is sufficiently above average to keep connoisseurs of the stuff engaged and sated.

This Is Riphop,Death Comet Crew,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb865e6ef95969322c26/1:1/w_160/cb56fbd1.jpg,2004-08-09 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2569-this-is-riphop/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Twentysome years before desperate postmillennial irony spawned electroclash, there was just electro. At the dawn of the 80s, urban America was an incubator of newborn aesthetics where burgeoning new genres were feverishly built up and broken down night after night. 1979 had seen the infamous ""Disco Demolition"" promotion at the White Sox's Comiskey Park; after a pile of dance records was ignited in center field, Chicago's rampant rock 'n' roll faithful erupted into a riot and forced a forfeit to the Tigers. In Detroit, an intrepid radio DJ named Electrifying Mojo flouted conventional genre restraints five hours a night, backing up Prince with Kraftwerk and Parliament with Tangerine Dream, while voracious listeners like Derrick May and Juan Atkins were drawing the blueprints of techno. Merely mentioning the names of New York's seminal clubs of the era-- CBGB, Studio 54, Paradise Garage, The Roxy-- evokes reveries of legendary hedonism and unbridled creativity, and their impact on current music runs deep. Since our collective cultural hindsight seems permanently set on a two-decade span, recent interest in the glory days of urban music has left few worthy artifacts undiscovered. With Death Comet Crew, however, Troubleman has dusted off a priceless electro gem. Along with bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid, DCC was a major part of Manhattan's early 80s downtown arts scene, brazenly fusing disco, punk, techno and hip-hop for dancefloor experimentalists and would-be B-boys. Comprised of drummer/producer Stuart Argabright, guitarist Michael Diekmann, bassist/guitarist/keyboardist Shinichi Shimokawa, DJ High Priest, and MC/grafitti writer Rammellzee on occasional vocals, DCC was drawn together intermittently for shows and recording sessions in '83 and '84. This is Riphop draws material from several performances and session dates during that period. The band's aggressively schizoid personality is split in more ways than one. Originally named Arena Sex Death (my personal favorite), then Death Star Crew (George Lucas took exception to that one), Death Comet Crew arrived at a crucial intersection of styles and created a patchwork of malevolent Frankenstein funk that has influenced a generation of DJs and producers. With live electronic drums and drawn-out sound collage sampling, they demolished the rigid breakbeat-and-loop structure that had dominated hip-hop to that point. Huge, overmiked bass drums and frantic effects-laden guitar presage The Bomb Squad's dense wall of noize that fortified Public Enemy. High Priest's booming, stream-of-conscious dialog samples set the stage for DJ Shadow's cinematic hip-hop. A seething, experimental darkness permeates the album, recalling Dälek and Kid606. The most telling indicators of the album's old-school origins are Rammellzee's simplified delivery and a shoestring production feel to live tracks like the scratch pastiche of ""Amphipet"" and the new, new wave of ""A King Wave Passes"". These quirks, though, are more endearing than inhibiting-- after all, this hypnotic, next-level shit was actually made back before Pro Tools existed, and Rammellzee's sing-song flow blows emotional buoyancy into this weighty effort. MF Doom, in fact, owes a clear debt to his style, as well as DCC's overall dirty, ragged sound. Songs show up in complementary pairs: Psycho-sampling ""America"" and ""America 2"" bookend the album; ""Interior Street"" is sparse and skeletal while the hazy ""Exterior Street"" takes its lead from Shimokawa's rolling bass and keys. ""Funky Dream Two"" and ""Funky Dream One"" both bounce along on the same comedic vocal sample, but ""Two"" is cavernous where ""One"" is brittle. Even with the current gush of electro and dance-punk into the indiestream, DCC easily trumps !!! and Tussle if by no other virtue than they did it first-- and Nic Offer is no Rammellzee. Today, Tussle's sweaty, percussive dancehall punk is DCC's closest kin. Stuart Argabright remixed their ""Don't Stop"" for an EP early last year, and I'm betting that set the wheels in motion to get this album compiled. Death Comet Crew also reunited for a much-hyped gig in October 2003 at NYC's Knitting Factory, and are reportedly working on a new release. There couldn't be a better time for their return-- now that we can hear it, their legacy is loud and clear.","Though they only ever released one EP in the early 80s, Manhattan's Death Comet Crew-- along with bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid-- were major innovators of New York's early 80s downtown arts scene, brazenly fusing disco, punk, techno and hip-hop for dancefloor experimentalists and would-be B-boys. 20 years later, Troubleman finally issues the long-bootlegged, never-before-released 1983 and '84 recordings that predict everything from Public Enemy production crew The Bomb Squad to Negativland's Escape from Noise.

The Forcefield Kids,Passage,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17d13d1975652138647/1:1/w_160/4d6e9d1c.jpg,2004-08-08 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6546-the-forcefield-kids/,Anticon,"Ah, the fickle whims of history. On the one hand, originality has become almost the de facto measure of a creative effort's lasting worth; we judge artists by what they've contributed to the ideological advancement of a genre, leading us to dismiss that which seems derivative. Then again, no movement or scene can exist without prominent imitators. Take the show Survivor. Sure, America was captivated by the wacky day-to-day exploits of Richard, Rudy, and the gang, but it's the show's multitude of lesser imitators that have led ""reality TV"" as a whole to topple the sitcom and sit atop the throne of nighttime entertainment supreme. So it goes in the music world. Hip-hop could never have existed as a movement had anyone given pioneers like Grandmaster Flash too much creative breathing space. It's imitation that turns the fancies of a few into the parameters of a genre. From Passage's first entrance on his solo release, The Forcefield Kids, in which he bursts out with rapid-fire free association and triplet rhythms tumbling into suspended tones, the influence of fellow Anticon artists Doseone, Why?, and Sole is apparent. As a member of original outfit Restiform Bodies, Passage's MCing has generally maintained a level tone, trading off lyrical bursts with musical interludes. Here, his nearly constant narration slips from conversational speech to distorted rant, bratty child to British dignitary, all territories previously explored by other Anticon MCs. The striking affinity with Clouddead in Passage's sudden acoustic guitar sections and nasal harmonies is hard to ignore. But whether Passage exists as their peer, or as the first in a generation of imitators, is up for debate, and it's a matter of taste whether the similarities turn you off or get you psyched for the hip-hop revolution. Anticon has always flirted heavily with the term hip-hop, and though its artists and critics both balk at the genre label outright, few deny its influence. Apart from Passage's singsong MCing, the most hip-hop aspect of his music is the prominence of the collage. Everything about The Forcefield Kids, from music to lyrics to cover art, delivers a jumbled mess of conjoined ideas, where anything is up for grabs and genre divisions are defied as readily as sentence structure. Passage programs his sawtooth synths over minimal drum machine snares or breakbeat bursts, placing him on the aggressive end of Anticon's output. The stark contrasts of images and styles combined with the musical assault give the impression of Passage as an ADD-addled teen in a room full of keyboards and samplers, letting loose the ravings of his sugar-soaked subconscious. These impressions are reinforced in Passage's lyrics. Though he explores similar absurdist/surrealist realms as Doseone, Passage's jumbles of thoughts and impressions tend to be less linearly coherent in phrasing, and more reminiscent of beat poetry, as he addresses general topics through the course of each song. Delivered with a proclamatory urgency, the streams of free association contain fantastical imagery mixed with the sneer of teenage nihilism-- apocalyptic prophesies (""Emergency broadcast's a grim infomercial, but listen closely for the great big, final school cancellation""), rebellion against the modern world (""We watch saints of popularity, rain thin snack on their hollow legs"") and misogynistic tendencies (""Women are funny, they're almost like people""). Though he offers many clever phrases and striking images (""DaVinci twists the valves to move the gasses round in Reagan's chest""), he just as often comes across as intentionally cryptic. The Forcefield Kids is a good album, and comes close to being something better. Anticon is quickly growing from a collection of artists into a style all its own, and Passage is still in a position of opportunity to expand it. He seems to be staking out his territory as the Nintendo-damaged suburban youth of Anticon's roster, but while everything's in place for his character to flourish, his delivery is still incomplete in development. Passage's future releases that will determine whether he's a parameter-shifting performer of Anticon, or just a forgotten sidenote.","Anticon newcomer's highly experimental pop/hip-hop hybrid makes for an intriguing debut, but he has some developing to do before he's in a league with his cLOUDDEAD labelmates.

Matki Wandalki,Felix Kubin,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc38abf31b7dc7155c88/1:1/w_160/b6f87e51.gif,2004-08-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4582-matki-wandalki/,A-Musik,"German electronic pop artist Felix Kubin (born Felix Knoth) scores Dadaist cartoons of the future, as imagined by retro-futurists on a budget. His music, beyond his electro-acoustic works as part of the duo Klangkrieg, reflects an admiration for turn-of-the-80s German electronic music of Kraftwerk, Der Plan, Palais Schaumburg and the ""Neue Deutsche Welle"" (or ""German New Wave""). He even uses similar equipment, eschewing the laptops and software that seem practically required in most modern electronica. Kubin's brand of pop is loopy, yet straight-faced, as if ""irony"" is the furthest thing from his mind even as seriously old-school organs and drum machines suggest kitsch. He's worked with fellow serious-artist-come-future-pop-practitioner Asmus Tietchens, and like him, places melody and traditional song structure at least as high as digital sound and beat manipulation. For that reason, his music might seem quaint to people used to something more abstract. Then again, given his preferences for absurd imagery (google for photos of him performing in a space suit or dressed as a 19th Century European military officer), ""quaint"" might not be the best word for him. Matki Wandalki is Kubin's third full-length CD (including last year's Tetchy Teenage Tapes release featuring material from the early 80s begun at the ripe old age of 11), and is an almost flawless collection of compact, buoyant electro-pop. It's a bit on the demented side, with bizarre synthesizer sounds, painstakingly tweaked in much the same manner as his influences did before the dawn of the digital age. In fact, Kubin also has a background in video art, including films and even producing his own comic book, and this album reflects a skewed innocence; his songs (usually instrumental) are bouncy and immediately endearing, even as they sound better suited for some lost Richard Elfman or David Lynch short than a kiddee matinee. ""Lumière Belge"" is, at over six minutes, one of the longer tracks on the album, yet like most of Kubin's music, seems effortlessly compact. Furthermore, despite being produced entirely by an array of analog synthesizers and other proto-robotic equipment, nothing about it seems necessarily tied to the idea of ""electronic"" music. That is, its faux-spy movie strains and driving rhythm could just as easily been arranged for a surf-rock band, or Nelson Riddle's orchestra. Kubin, like his true ancestors Raymond Scott, Mort Garson and Bruce Haack, approaches electronic music as a means rather than an end, and succeeds in pure songcraft where most of his more overtly experimental peers fail. ""Hissi Hissi"" is a micro-symphony of simple, yet typically infectious melodies. The goofy 60s organ that carries the tune, and its ancient sci-fi cousins that flesh out the rest of the arrangement, is both cute and strange-- and never obscures the efficiency and ingenuity of Kubin's arrangement. Occasionally, as on the title track and ""Hit Me, Provider"" (one of two songs featuring his vocals), Kubin draws upon the clipped, stylish German techno similar to that of Ellen Allien and the Bpitch roster, though decidedly less concerned with the dancefloor than spaz for its own sake. Apparently, Kubin's idea of dance music is winding up his drum machine as fast as it will go, and setting his synths to stun (check the laser beam melody on ""Hit Me"", and dare yourself to turn it up). Of course, style isn't really his game, as the Lionel Richie cover will attest, but part of the charm of Matki Wandalki is that it exists so completely in a world of its own that it's beside the point to draw comparisons to contemporary scenes. Kubin is one of the few true originals in music, electronica or otherwise, and he's at his best here.","This German electro-pop artist may have an extremely demented vision, but his album is a great listen, drawing comparisons to fellow futurefreaks Raymond Scott and Bruce Haack.

Drill a Hole in That Substrate and Tell Me What You See,Jim White,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa1eea9e61561daa5b49/1:1/w_160/1717f72c.jpg,2004-08-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8657-drill-a-hole-in-that-substrate-and-tell-me-what-you-see/,Luaka Bop,"Archer Street in Chicago was once a short leg of US Rte 66, the near-mythical highway that once connected the Second City with Los Angeles, whose sprawl at the time of the highway's establishment was just an abbreviated teaser for the megalopolis the city has since spawned. Even though it only traversed a limited band of the country, Rte 66 was America's highway in a lot of respects, entering our popular song canon in the title of a standard, and bridging the open spaces of the West. There's no question that Rte 66 was an engine of entrepreneurship, as every town along its course offered something to the weary traveler-- in a sense, the road is symbolic of the golden age of local charm in this country, before Mobil bought every Charlie's Gas 'n' Go in sight and when The Thing? was as much an attraction as a Six Flags is today. Rte 66 is, of course, just another ghost wandering through America's memory now (its old side road, US Rte 666, was recently assigned a new number by the Feds in a final act of indignity), but there are still outposts of that older, stranger, more charming America around drawing a curious trickle of people bored with canned amusement. Pensacola's Jim White strikes me as perhaps one of those people-- the man's own story fits in well with the inherent transience of American road life, and his music feeds off of the Pentecostal television programs he took in when he was young. White didn't get himself into a recording studio until his 40s, and by that time he had already spent time as a fashion model in Milan and mangled his hand in a bandsaw accident-- and that's when he wasn't surfing for a living. White's music is singular, constantly fluctuating between various non-genres that mostly begin with post-, neo- or alt-. You can hear the white gospel of his youth dripping forward through Joe Henry's modern production, the record's lustrous sheen at once incongruous and oddly apropos for White's hushed poetics. There's an ambitious scope to this album as it traverses funky swamp folk, whispered electric ballads and humid country jazz, in the process conjuring that leftfield America of insane castle builders, toilet seat artists, Wall Drug and mystery spots as much as he captures Sunday evenings on the front porch and bluegrass concerts in the town square. And yet, the unvarnished fenceposts and unpaved roads of White's Americana are strangely modern, informed by the glow of Mercury Rev and Sparklehorse and Harry Smith's anthology in equal measure. White has enough guest musicians on this, his third album, to populate any number of small towns, and the likes of Bill Frisell, Aimee Mann, and M. Ward bring a varied array of voices and capabilities to the proceedings. ""Combing My Hair in a Brand New Style"" is noir funk stewing gospel backing vocals in heavy wah pedal and muted trumpet, while ""That Girl from Brownsville, Texas"" is a whispered prayer that opens with a challenge to the being who might answer it: ""God, if you ain't smilin' on me/ Then you ain't no friend of mine."" The song's two-tiered chorus is beautiful and fragile, as White sets up the drifting, countrified declaration, ""All I'm trying to do is plant those seeds of love/ With that girl from Brownsville, Texas,"" with a seesawing melody over brushed snares and steel guitar. On the back of the promo, someone at Luaka Bop (or maybe White himself?) wrote, ""These songs rise up out of a landscape of Pensacola steeples. They haunt you out. They know where you live at."" That's about as apt a description as you might get without a minute-by-minute account of when the banjo comes in and where the mile-thick horn section rises up like a neon vacancy sign on the side of the interstate. These meandering piles of modern synthesizers, female backing vocals, melodicas and religiously conflicted narratives have a way of getting inside your head, and there's something about the way White whispers, ""You can't waste the whole damn day,"" on ""Objects in Motion"" that just sticks with you. In the song, he first finds a suitcase full of unsent love letters floating in a river, and later discovers the body of the girl who wrote them ""adrift beneath the surface of the cool, brown water."" Even as White lapses into sentimentality on ""Phone Booth in Heaven"", there's a gravity to it that pulls you back into his head and makes it real. And there's also the fact that you won't hear another record like it this year, possibly ever-- all the comparisons that can be made to Tom Waits, Lambchop, Grandaddy and Vic Chesnutt will only tell a small part of the story. What all these disparate elements that White pulls together add up to is White's alone, a style with no real name, American as barbecue sauce on apple pie.","David Byrne's Luaka Bop label issues the third album from this unclassifiable Southern folk artist, with guest appearances from Aimee Mann, Bill Frisell, and M. Ward.

Hopes and Fears,Keane,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc375e6ef95969322dc6/1:1/w_160/44341c55.jpg,2004-08-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4581-hopes-and-fears/,Interscope,"I'll happily admit if I turn out to have been wrong-- and only time will tell-- but Keane sound like they'll be the last in a long line of British bands who've grown tired of miming Radiohead and now simply aim for the much more imitable sound of Coldplay. I say ""last"" because Keane's debut album, Hopes and Fears, is so miserably and calculatedly maudlin that it almost seems capable of killing the trend started by Travis and passed like a relay baton to Starsailor and, eventually, Snow Patrol. Coldplaya-hatas will loathe Keane; most others will just be insulted. Inexplicably, the band was recently shortlisted for the Mercury Prize. Keane consists of three well-meaning guys from East Sussex: drummer Richard Hughes, pianist Tim Oxley-Rice, and singer Tom Chaplin. With this limited instrumental setup, Keane ought to sound like either some bizarro-world version of Ben Folds Five or that pick-up band that played your cousin's wedding. Whether those options would be better than what they actually sound like is up for debate. Oxley-Rice does attempt to salvage the wreck by channeling U2 circa-""New Year's Day"". His piano forms the main melodies, and combines with Hughes' drumwork to form a technically competent rhythm section. The almost minimalist approach of these two could potentially have served as the foundation for a mildly compelling-- or at least passable-- album, one closer in spirit to the chilled-out ambience of this album's only not-horrible track, ""Untitled 1"". The problem is Chaplin, who sings as though he's trying to talk you down from a ledge (and failing), belting out tunes with all the bombastic earnestness of James Walsh and Fran Healy combined, but no sense of subtlety or melody. Every song on Hopes and Fears soars, as if winging a gossamer wind to scale the heights of heaven and touch the cloudy hand of God. Across the span of 11 tracks, there are maybe 13 triumph-of-the-human-spirit choruses, each trying to out-uplift the previous. ""Bend and Break"" is particularly egregious: ""If only I don't bend and break,"" Chaplin wails as the chorus swells to bursting, ""I'll meet you on the other side/ I'll meet you in the light."" Silly as the lyrics are, they might have more impact if every other song on Hopes and Fears didn't work the same melodramatic, soft-verse/loud-chorus template with the predictability of a bad xFC-metal band (or if Chaplin didn't repeat more or less the same sentiment each time). Writing such dramatic melodies undeniably takes talent, but putting so many of them back to back takes not only a penchant for repetitious banality, but a particularly rampant egotism: Not since All That You Can't Leave Behind has a band tried quite so hard to change your life. It's strange, then, that Chaplin puts his own life squarely at the center of these songs-- both vocally and lyrically-- rarely affording consideration to anyone else, even his bandmates. There are other people in these songs, but like Hughes and Oxley-Rice, they're only present as a framework for his projectile vocals, and to reflect his morally superior intentions or ideas about friendship, music and love. In addition to nebulous notions of life and love and hazy references to ""change"" and ""the light,"" Chaplin peppers his songs with vague pronouns-- she, you, and it-- but I predominates. And when he's not condescending (""I don't know you and I don't want you till the moment your eyes open""), he's engaging in a kind of self-centered therapy (""Everybody's changing and I don't feel the same"") that wears increasingly thin from the moment Hopes and Fears begins. That line from ""Everybody's Changing"" is telling: For all their elitist pomposity, Keane are just bandwagon-jumpers, without an original thought-- or even a trace of charisma-- to save their rep. My hope is that they'll fade unceremoniously into obscurity; my fear is that they'll breed still more Coldplay knockoffs, eventually saturating Stateside department store P.A.s with all their bloodless sobbing. On some level, I'm optimistic that Keane's eighth-wave mimicry could signal the end of this particular brand of copycatting; on another, I know that it simply points to a future in which upstart British bands aim to sound just like Franz Ferdinand instead.","Rapidly gaining press in the UK for their pale-faced Coldplay imitation and pious condescension, this melancholy, overproduced Sussex three-piece elicits all the wit and ingenuity of their Family Circus namesake.

These mysterious broadcasts contain seemingly random chunks of repeating data-- usually a lone voice reading a string of numbers or letters, but sometimes it's simply electronic tones or bits of music. It is generally understood (though never formerly acknowledged) that numbers stations are encrypted messages broadcast by various governments for some unknown purpose-- most likely espionage. They may be instructions to undercover agents in the field (the CIA, MOSSAD, KGB, and so on), and involve commands encoded and decoded according to an understood key. The Conet Project is a collection of numbers stations recordings first issued in the late 90s and now officially back in print. Its blip of mainstream notoriety came when Wilco sampled a track from the set (a woman's voice intoning ""yankee... hotel... foxtrot..."") for the closing moments of ""Poor Places"", providing the title for Wilco's best-known album. The Conet Project is an unusual collection to say the least. It's extremely long (four discs), expensive, and contains insanely thorough documentation-- the 70-page booklet assumes a working knowledge of cryptography lingo, and explains why shortwave is such a secure and efficient medium for exchange of encrypted information. Of course, something about preserving this stuff on CD seems anachronistic in light of current technology-- people trade numbers stations recordings by CD-R and share them online-- but if the jury is out on The Conet Project as a commercial product, there is certainly much here to enjoy. First, even when stripped of the important political context, these CDs are interesting on a purely textural level. Anyone inured to the sonic pleasures of imperfect technology will find a lot to love in these extremely low fidelity recordings, which were packed tightly to travel halfway around the world and remain intelligible on the receiving end. Voices sound pinched and claustrophobic forced into the narrow band of the medium, and each sound carries with a layer of distortion. A slight but delicious warble is constantly present, an effect more pronounced when music or electronic tones (great primitive synth sounds abound) take over the voices. And every broadcast is carried along on a thick shag carpet of hum, buzz and crackle. If you enjoy listening to recordings from the first 15 years of the space program-- those stony all-American voices amid all that static, each transmission punctuated with the electronic beep-- then The Conet Project has obvious appeal. And then there are the voices. Steve Reich is inspired by the musicality of human speech (""Come Out"", ""It's Gonna Rain"", ""Different Trains""), and The Conet Project provides a lot of raw material. There are dozens of them here, in as many tongues as you can imagine, working through sequences of numbers and letters with heavy repetition. Some of the broadcasts are either tape loops or some kind of triggered sample, others seem to be read ""live."" The cumulative effect is hypnotic. Once you've absorbed the sound and let the imagined content of these broadcasts sink in, The Conet Project moves from interesting to fascinating. Remember why these broadcasts allegedly exist: to instruct people to do harm. Even if espionage is in service of an ultimate good, the details of the enterprise involve deception, betrayal, and occasionally, violence. Knowing that these unnervingly dispassionate voices, reading endless streams of random numbers aloud, carry within them ""plain text"" messages about assassination, terrorism-- you name it-- is creepy, voyeuristic and exhilarating. It's an unblinking call for conspiracy, the paranoia of the Cold War boiled down to its essence. This is the station tuned in by Bobby Fisher's silver fillings when he's having one of his ""bad days,"" and that's what the boys from Wilco heard. That voice in ""Poor Places"" is the black box inside the crashing plane, holding the clues to why things went so desperately wrong.","In the world of electronics, radio is an old technology, but it still holds a special allure. Forget the closed-circuits ...

Country Favorites,Volebeats,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a99e9d034d5c69bf3caa/1:1/w_160/38927838.jpg,2004-08-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8534-country-favorites/,Turquoise Mountain,"Some bands release EPs as stop-gaps between albums. Those bands just aren't trying hard enough: Michigan's Volebeats have just released a new full-length to make the wait for their official follow-up to 2000's Mosquito Spiral a little more bearable for fans. Comprised of a few rarities, some new studio tracks and six broadly ranging covers, Country Favorites really only lives up to the first half of its title. Still, the originals are mostly strong, and a few of the covers work surprisingly well when recast as old-time country pop tunes. The old-time specification is important for The Volebeats-- their brand of country harks back to the genre's golden age in the 1950s and 60s, with none of the nauseating sheen or gimmicky lyrics of contemporary countrypolitan material. The record opens with a take on the 13th Floor Elevators' ""I Had to Tell You"", tastefully arranged with steel guitar and Jeff Oakes' natural twang. For a country band with well-known indie rock sensibilities, this isn't really a surprising choice, and their interpretation of the York Brothers' ""Hamtramck Mama"" (named for the Michigan town in which the band formed) is also a natural. On their other covers, The Volebeats reach outside their core sound, taking a lovely stroll through Abba's ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"", which is full of heavily reverberating and lower register guitar lines straight out of an old trucker ballad. They also make what could have been a ridiculous cover of Slayer's ""Die by the Sword"" somewhat credible, slowing it way down and turning it into a sort of Camper Van Beethoven tribute. Serge Gainsbourg's ""Manon"" doesn't fare quite as well in its C&W; surroundings as most of the other covers-- French with a twang just doesn't really sound right-- but The Volebeats hold their own on a heavily condensed version of Funkadelic's ""Maggot Brain"". It's difficult to imagine anyone approaching the sheer cathartic power of the original's blistering Eddie Hazel guitar solo, but The Volebeats' woven pedal steel and big, ringing electrics manage to pay surprising respect. It's a radical reinterpretation of the raw source material and a mournful, irony-free outpouring that serves as the emotional crux of the disc. The Volebeats have three well-developed songwriters (Matthew Smith, Jeff Oakes and Bob McCreedy)-- each of whom has a very distinct style-- which always bodes well for their original material. Oakes' ""One I Love"" is a classic big-reverb country shuffle: His twangy tenor subtly harmonizes with guest Erika Hoffmann and the guitar twangs with that huge Angelo Badalamenti sound. Bob McCreedy gets three songs in this batch, the best of which is ""Hold On"", with its swaying chorus, swinging bassline and Byrdsy solos. His other two contributions, ""318"" and ""Too Much Love"", don't really get going until their respective choruses, with the arid ""318"" actually sounding a bit out of place amidst the disc's wide-open sound. Smith's songs are the truly odd ducks, though. His best writing has a timeless melancholy and a melodic sensibility straight out of the songwriting factories of the 1960s, and his voice has a twang-free smoothness that sounds great floating in the reverb of ""Standing Next to You"" with the swelling steel guitar. Smith's songs are so well tailored to his voice that it seems odd that Oakes sings his other song, ""Almost Crying"". I could hear Outrageous Cherry, Smith's other band, making this ballad devastating, but here it's not quite as powerful as it could be. On the whole, Country Favorites is an effective grab bag, but don't expect the coherence of an album-- that's something for which Volebeats fans are going to have to wait. For now, those fans will want to get their hands on this, while others will reap greater rewards checking out The Volebeats' best proper albums-- Up North, The Sky and the Ocean or Mosquito Spiral, the latter exploring their pop tendencies more fully than any of their other releases.","Long-running Michigan-based roots-rockers' new odds-and-ends collection features twang-infused covers of Serge Gainsbourg, Abba, Slayer, 13th Floor Elevators, and others.

Winged Life,Shearwater,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c5c0084474cd0c033a/1:1/w_160/fe182f56.jpg,2004-08-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7103-winged-life/,Misra,"In addition to playing keyboards in Okkervil River and fronting Shearwater, Jonathan Meiburg is a graduate student in ornithology, a pursuit that seems to inform and almost define his music. For instance, a shearwater is a type of bird that flies close to the water's surface, and its namesake band plays songs that skim immense emotions and often push towards soaring climaxes. Fittingly, Shearwater's third album is entitled Winged Life, which refers to a William Blake verse but could easily title Meiburg's biography. Former Kingfisher frontman Meiburg co-founded the band with Okkervil River's Will Sheff in 1999 and released the starkly atmospheric The Dissolving Room in 2001. For 2002's Everybody Makes Mistakes, they added bassist Kim Burke and percussionist Thor Harris. Winged Life boasts an even more lush, orchestrated sound that incorporates banjo, pedal steel, violin, and programmed percussion. Its music is not quite as quirky as Okkervil River, although its songs are similarly hymnlike. It's only a few shades lighter than the pitch-dark Americana of Pinetop Seven, although Meiburg and Sheff, like Darren Richards, approach lyrics with a storyteller's eye, allowing the music to bring out the tone of the words. Taking to heart Joan Didion's assertion that ""we tell ourselves stories in order to live,"" Meiburg and Sheff write story-songs that feel like life-or-death situations even though they usually only document life's incessant mundanities-- no big events, just gentle realizations. Sheff especially is more interested in missed opportunities and crippling inaction than in actual events: On the standout ""A Makeover"", he sings about a man who undergoes a conversion, only to revert to his old self disappointingly quickly: ""And in three weeks his new leaf has rubbed away and it feels just like an average day."" On the somber ""Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine"", Meiburg ponders the loss of rambunctious youth among himself and his friends. But he never comes across as indulgent or whiny, just a bit awkward and sadly wistful as he realizes, ""I'm the only one, at the top of my lungs, who's still singing sweet adelines."" He addresses a similar lament in ""The World in 1984"". In two concise scenes, one with his WWII veteran grandfather and another with his mother, he realizes how much has changed in 20 years and how much has been lost, but as his mother tells him, ""Kid, you're lucky to be alive."" Meiburg and Sheff may share songwriting credits and singing duties, but moments like these, along with the avian themes, prove that Shearwater pursues Meiburg's vision like a homing pigeon. Unfortunately, not all these story-songs carry the emotional impact Shearwater grasp for, sometimes proving too hollow-boned to bear the weight. On ""My Good Deed"", a man leaves his lover, thinking he knows what's best for her; it's a scenario that's either classic or clichéd, depending on your point of view, but for a recent example, the book and movie The Notebook hinges creakily on the same predicament. It's the music that saves the song: ""My Good Deed"" fades out with an open-air coda rich with thick organ and ascending bells. When the lyrics begin to drag, Shearwater-- especially Harris and Burke-- redeem the album with a lush sound full of gentle surprises-- like the pop-song chorus of ""(I've Got a) Right to Cry"" and the ascending guitar lines on ""St. Mary's Walk""-- that nicely compliment Meiburg's fluttery vocals. Such flourishes make Winged Life more than just an Okkervil River side project (as previous efforts arguably were); Shearwater's years of dedication and hard work have established them as a solid group in their own right.","Technically a side project of Austin folk-rockers Okkervil River, Shearwater's third release establishes them as a solid group in their own right.

The Equatorial Stars,Fripp & Eno,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be9eeb335119a49ed0b7/1:1/w_160/82237939.gif,2004-08-05 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3318-the-equatorial-stars/,Opal,"""Ambient is a spacious, electronic music that is concerned with sonic texture, not songwriting or composing,"" says the All-Music Guide. That seems reasonable, although I suspect Brian Eno might take issue with the notion that his music is somehow unconcerned with composition. As with most musical definitions (and music itself), perception is key; if it seems as if the composer was unconcerned with traditional methods of writing music, it becomes helpful to think of the music being similarly ""unconcerned."" Of course, that definition isn't helpful. Is ambient ""spacious?"" Not if you're in the way of one of Toshi Nakamura's hyper-compact sine waves. Is it electronic? Not if you listen to one of those old Ligeti micro-polyphonal pieces-- or if you stick your head out of a window and listen to the wind and people and cars. Is it concerned with sonic texture? Absolutely, just as Britney Spears' producers are on ""Toxic"". Is it unconcerned with songwriting? I suppose that depends on whether or not the composers are writing ""songs""-- and still more on whether or not you hear them as songs, or care one way or the other. Eno helped invent something, but it wasn't a form of music. At best, it was a form of music journalism, and a shortsighted one at that. The Equatorial Stars is the third collaboration between Eno and Fripp, and the first in almost 30 years. Both men made their names not as experimental music technicians and academics, but as well-mannered revolutionaries in two of the most important bands of the 1970s. Eno's Roxy Music and Fripp's King Crimson-- however far apart their eventual fanbases grew-- were, at one time, two sides of the same coin. They offered ""art"" (with a small ""a"") music to people who'd grown up believing Art (with a big one) had no place in rock 'n' roll. They offered art to a culture shown the finer things in life by The Beatles, Andy Warhol and J.D. Salinger, one that would fall in love with the notion that the only way to move on was to destroy the past and its idols. Fripp and Eno were not punks in usual sense, but they understood the best way to generate interest at the time was to ignore the past-- especially the immediate past. That said, their actual, physical innovations were few. ""Frippertronics,"" the recording method invented on 1973's No Pussyfooting, involved a tape-loop system wherein a single reel of tape is physically joined together at the ends and then run continuously between the outermost reels of two adjacent decks, the first of which records incoming sound and the second of which plays it back. Eno demonstrated this to Fripp, and the first recorded result was ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" from No Pussyfooting-- it is indeed the ""spacious, electronic"" music described in the All-Music Guide. Fripp took some pride in the unorthodox nature of this piece, and to his and Eno's credit, it didn't really sound like anything that had come before it. Whether or not that constitutes a new genre is debatable-- especially because few (if any) other musicians have done much else with Frippertronics. Even Eno's ambient records, sharing much with earlier efforts by Germany's Cluster and Tangerine Dream, don't sound like his collaborations with Fripp. Nor does The Equatorial Stars sound like No Pussyfooting or the pair's 1975 follow-up Evening Star. On the surface, it does nearly equal their effuse beauty, with airy synthesizer textures and hints of melody. However, its use of Frippertronics is subtler, and I don't hear the Zen-like simplicity of, say, Eno's Music for Airports, or the classical deconstruction of his Discreet Music. Instead, I hear cloudy, vague music, as if the pair invested too much in their own reviews over the years, believing ambience required a lack of planning or composition. Yet, I also hear an alien beauty, and real grace, the kind that only comes after years of succeeding, failing and succeeding again. And these pieces reveal themselves not when you are preoccupied-- allowing the ""unobtrusive"" to fill in spaces where you need them, ignoring them elsewhere-- but when you let them actively pilot daydreams. If ambient is supposed to be passive music, Fripp and Eno make something different. Perhaps passive/aggressive ambience, where we're given the impression that our minds could wander, but in reality we're being directed into varying degrees of mysticism. The faintly glitchy ""Meissa"" (each song is named for a star) is melancholy and wet. Fripp's guitar outlines fragmented melodies, strung together only by the reverb that bathes the arrangement. He wanders into the lowest register of his instrument, only to wind his way upward again with the lackadaisical trajectory of a raindrop on glass, following the path of least resistance. He also sounds more straightforwardly pretty than I've heard from him in decades; recent bouts of metal fetishism with King Crimson haven't affected his ability to craft delicate, assured lines. Eno's job is to provide the transparently lush backdrop, as he does better than practically anyone in the world. Here (and on the erotic impressionism of ""Lyra""), he uses dim rhythmic elements, such as a loop of Fripp playing arpeggios, or a stuttering harmonic pinch, to simulate movement while major-chord synth drone hardens like skin on a dead pond, too far in the distance to suggest stasis. Yet when Eno provides straight beats, as on ""Altair"", he threatens to turn the music into New Age. Fripp's atonal chord clusters that rise like breaking surf aren't enough to obscure the tentative, colorless funk beat and his own chicken scratch strum (a first?). Several pieces are entirely devoid of rhythm, and are similar to the post-Eno/Cluster sound design of The Hafler Trio and Richard Chartier. ""Ankaa"" mixes sparse solo lines from Fripp with blurred, spacey synth textures and the occasional ebb of deep, bassy pull. ""Terebellum"" is less lush, but more engaging if only because it favors higher tones and more overt dissonance-- compare with The Hafler Trio's Normally from this year for a study in extended tension. Eno's production is warmer than that of his younger, digitally trained descendents, and surprisingly consistent with his 70s efforts. I'd argue it is also less imaginatively detailed, but with this music, that isn't so much a crime as artistic license. Ultimately, The Equatorial Stars is direct, engaging and modestly unsettling. No context required.","The first collaboration between Robert Fripp and Brian Eno in over 30 years, nearly equals the effuse beauty of their celebrated 70s works, No Pussyfooting and Evening Star.

Old Enough 2 Know Better,Various Artists,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7af13d1975652139495/1:1/w_160/0262d3a5.jpg,2004-08-05 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1931-old-enough-2-know-better/,Merge,"Driving across the country, as I've been doing over this past week, one sees some strange and fantastic things written in America's bathroom stalls. In Utah, I was treated to a prolonged ode regarding Outkast's Andre 3000; in Missouri, a piece of political discourse ranging from an intricate dissection of John Kerry's foreign policy record to ""nuke 'em all."" And on a women's stall in an Iowa bar (I'm not a perv, the men's was being used), I found that someone had scrawled a line from Neutral Milk hotel's ""Song Against Sex"": ""Don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you, you're too wonderful to die."" That Neutral Milk Hotel have become stall-quotable is emblematic of the place they occupy in the hearts of their fans. Everybody has music that encapsulates their past, and for an increasing number of listeners, it's the music of the more established independent labels-- Merge, Sub Pop, Matador, or K-- that helped them discover a world of indie culture and define an identity during their formative years. Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Song Against Sex"" is the first song on Merge's 15th year compilation Old Enough 2 Know Better, a massive 3xCD set offering both a look at the label's long run and a collection of new tracks. The cover art, by David Horvath, features a happy world of wee little counterparts to Radiohead's fierce, sobbing creatures, reflecting the general sentiment of the label's condensed sound. Being given a chance to hear so many Merge artists in once place, I was struck by how noticeably friendly the aesthetic is-- positivity courses through this collection's veins. And though Merge's niche was built on the fundamental indie pop sound, hints of backward-looking folk and country also pepper the collection, making the label seem equally a refuge for singer/songwriters born in the wrong decade. Old Enough abides by the same format as most compilations of its type, aiming to give newcomers a representative overview of the label's span, introduce casual acquaintances to more obscure artists in the roster, and give devoted fans something new. The first two discs comprise the retrospective, filled with popular songs that haven't been too played-out over the years-- usually solid tracks off artists' more overlooked albums, such as ""Long Vermont Roads"" from The Magnetic Fields' The Charm of the Highway Strip. Disc One is a little more raw, featuring the likes of Buzzcocks' ""Jerk"" and Polvo's excellent ""Tragic Carpet Ride"", while the second showcases subdued sounds in the varied orchestration of The Ladybug Transistor or singalong pop of The Essex Green. It takes us in no particular order from Versus, Spoon, and, of course, Superchunk, to the new generation of acts like M. Ward and Destroyer, who are now filling the void left by the since-disbanded groups on which the label built its rep. As excellent as the retrospective is, fans and obsessive completists alike will be purchasing this collection mainly for Disc Three: 19 tracks of various rarities and unreleased songs. The contributions are almost uniformly excellent, and nobody ought to be disappointed. M. Ward's ""One More Goodbye"" is, as you might expect, a jangly piece of pretty and wistful folk, while Spoon covers Yo La Tengo's ""Decora"" in a markedly Spoony style of call-and-response guitar and bass. The disc also indicates the expanding variety of influences represented in Merge's sound-- Richard Bruckner's orchestral country ballad ""Dogwood"" provides a striking interlude, as does Crooked Fingers' Spanish ballad ""La Maleta Fea"". Though it's probably not the mix that any one person would compile, this collection comes as close as such an effort can to pleasing all of the people all of the time (especially at the price of one CD). As the joke of the title Old Enough 2 Know Better is borne in mixing a wizened grumble with IM-speak, so does the compilation manage to evoke simultaneous nostalgia, discovery, and excitement for the future. Still, it does strike me as just a little scary to think that 30 years from now, the oldies stations might be playing the Merge catalog for a bunch of black-clad grandparents with star tattoos and vintage-vintage cowboy shirts, driving down the road and scrawling Neutral Milk Hotel lyrics in rest stops and bars as they see fit.","In celebration of their 15th anniversary, indie powerhouse Merge Records offers this enormous 3xCD anthology, with two discs dedicated to the best songs they've released, and the other compiling rare and previously unreleased tracks. In all, the set spans 61 tracks from more than 50 of the greatest indie rock bands ever: Neutral Milk Hotel, Trail of Dead, Buzzcocks, Spoon, The Magnetic Fields, The Clean, Superchunk, Lambchop, etc.

Young Days,Hint Hint,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0ea13d197565213baf9/1:1/w_160/00303c17.jpg,2004-08-04 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3875-young-days/,Suicide Squeeze,"I've never seen Hint Hint live-- the buzz in their hometown Seattle is that the shows are ""intense"" and ""awesome"" and ""fucking life-changing, man""-- but from their ""dark"" and ""atmospheric"" debut, Young Days, I imagine it's something like this: The house cuts the music and four members of Hint Hint come out with their heads down, all crying softly, probably about existentialism. They pick up their instruments, cry again, maybe one of them prays, and then they stoically lower their heads again. Then frontman Peter Quirk comes out, limping for no obvious reason, also crying. He is wearing running mascara that initially looks like a pregnant bird has shit all over his face. He tells the crowd he doesn't care, though, because the world is going to end, and there's nothing he can do about it, except whisper about philosophy, which he then does. Then, Hint Hint play a self-involved, 50-minute set of the most vapid rock 'n' roll of the year. I don't think there's even a word for this. Call it what you want, but with each passing minute, Young Days further proves that it has no substantial musical core to justify its rotten gild of overwrought angst. Hint Hint are so short on ideas, in fact, that they can barely afford more than one chord progression and guitar line per song, and must instead rely on star drummer Jason Lajeunesse to change up his beat enough to differentiate the verses from the choruses. On opener ""Natural Collegiate"", for which Quirk does a terrible (but presumably his best) John Lydon impression, it quickly becomes clear that guitarist Dean Hudson and keyboardist Leona Marrs don't plan on moving past their respective Les Savy Fav and Pretty Girls Make Graves mocking. After some token breathing time for this suffocatingly dark song, Lajeunesse overplays his toms in the closing minutes, as if to compensate for the song's flatness. ""Senator Blues"" sheds light on Hint Hint's main compositional glitch: on Young Days, guitar and keyboard melodies never reach outside the basic notes of the chord, and for however much energy is pumped into them, the melodies always feel stagnant. Musically, Young Days is a serious bore, but what sends the record across that thin line to ""painful"" territory is the conviction with which Hint Hint approaches such terribly uninteresting songs. Quirk is mostly to blame for this-- he just doesn't know when to shut the fuck up. On ""Same Skies"", he crummily evokes Jeremy Enigk, ruining the song's slick sub-bass synth grinds with shameful turns like, ""I'm gonna burn your letters when I'm all burnt out,"" and, ""This non-stop feeling, oh, when will it end?!/ It never ends."" On ""A Curse on You, Dear"", Hint Hint rush headlong into Quirk's most laughable line: ""This is a relationship I can't deny/ This is a relationship I can't comprise/ With my relationship I won't comply/ So let it die,"" which is driven home by a tense buildup to the dramatic utterance: ""I'm not afraid to die."" With ""Leviathan"", Hint Hint throw what they must think is the greatest curveball in rock history. In contrast to the surrounding infinite sadness, here, a blistery piano bounce opens what will be Hint Hint's best approximation of Paul Simon's ""You Can Call Me Al"". The song almost works as the breath of fresh air Hint Hint seem to have intended it to be, but again, Quirk destroys it, ending the song with all of Kurt Cobain's vocal affectations and none of his heart: ""You awaken slowly, my little baby/ And all of us fall dead, we can solve that."" Hint Hint's gesture to ""fun"" is appreciated, especially given Young Days' propensity toward heartless melodrama and such half-assed ""serious"" melodies. Needless to say, ""Leviathan"" simply can't outweigh Young Days' guffaws-- and where the song's sad-goes-happy schtick is concerned, even Jimmy Eat World rock it better.","Awful playing, brutally embarrassing lyrics and a complete lack of songwriting ability make Hint Hint's Young Days one of the most insufferable records we've had the displeasure of hearing yet this year.

Slowblow,Slowblow,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67c13d19756521391c6/1:1/w_160/70293f29.jpg,2004-08-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7772-slowblow/,Mobilé,"When Björk isn't being mentioned, the Icelandic indie music chatter goes something like this. Múm: childlike! Beguiling, like cute insects with laptops! And Sigur Rós: Chilling! Instant transport to the lichen plains of their native land! While all of that's sort of true, Slowblow's departure from the country's musical stereotypes does lend their self-titled third album a refreshing air. Slowblow principals Orri Jònsson and Dagur Kàri Petursson largely ditch their peers' electro/acoustic textures in favor of detachedly strummed acoustic guitars and gentle, organic percussion. And their fractured little songs speak in a language we understand, rather than hinting at a mystery that lunkheaded yanks like to get all hyperbolic about. Slowblow aren't above leaning on their pals, of course. Múm's Kristín Anna Valtysdóttir drifts in with vocals here and there, and the album was mixed at Sigur Rós' reportedly very drafty studio. But while Kristin Anna's voice is immediately recognizable, it primarily serves to contrast and complement Dagur Kári's own breathy waver. Opener ""Very Slow Bossanova"" hesitantly ticks along on a rhythm of tin cans, fleshed out by simplistic Casiotone, piano, and an electric guitar that softly picks out a hopeful little melody. There's an inviting casualness to this album-- the liner notes speak proudly of it being recorded ""to tape in various living rooms and bathrooms in Reykjavík."" The results sound like Grandaddy recording on D batteries and good old-fashioned manpower in a secluded green pup tent. It's a long way from Iceland's typical veiled swirls of gauzy fog, or Prada turtlenecks pulled over skinny faces. ""Within Tolerance"" begins tentatively before Kristín's familiar accordion bleats a note over a lazy snare drum and sustained acoustic chording. More light harmonizing between she and Dagur Kári follows, propelled by the surprisingly effective addition of prominent and steady handclaps. The distorted vocal and crazed fuzz guitar of ""Happiness in Your Face"" approaches mental-hospital Pixies, featuring a percussion track that sounds like someone pouring out a jar of old rusty screws. ""Phantom of My Organ"", however, is the true standout: Orri's carefully spoken, mildly processed vocals suggest Lambchop's Kurt Wagner while a harmonium whirs and knitting needles clack behind a fluttering violin. It's one of the few tracks here that does channel Sigur Rós' lucid grandeur, albeit in a much rootsier form-- a sepia tone lullaby crackling from a vintage radio in one of Slowblow's cozy porta-studio living rooms. But this grassroots approach isn't always successful. Parts of Slowblow sound tossed off, or at least unfinished. ""I Know You Can Smile"", for example, holds plenty of potential, but never rises above its polite offhandedness. Still, despite a handful of small missteps, this quietly fractured release remains direct and welcoming, and teems with simple surprises.","Icelandic group's third album shuns their country's musical stereotypes in favor of detachedly strummed acoustic guitars and gentle, organic percussion.

Poor production, thematic inconsistencies, and shouting DJs (""DJ CLUE-CLUE-CLUE!!

So why bother reviewing the mixtape of Tribe's other member, Consequence, well after his apex on Beats, Rhymes, Life? Well, maybe some of us wanted to know what Kanye West does on the weekends, when he's not milling Jesus-faced bling.

He even commissions his artists-in-training for cameo appearances on any other project that falls in his lap (check cohort John Legend's background appearances on Jay-Z's ""Encore"", Talib's ""Get-By"" and Dilated Peoples' ""This Way""). Kanye West had been a major player on the mix circuit well before the release of his College Dropout album early this year, and he still favors the medium for dropping exclusive remixes and one-offs. It's win/win for all involved: West maintains a fresh public façade, and his Kon Man Crew is given the chance to shine. Take 'Em to the Cleaners may be listed as a Consequence release, but Cons plays a far smaller role here than that implies. This is really West's album: He designed the set, assigned the parts, and wrote the play. Cleaners opens with Kanye at his kick/snare-popping best on ""So Soulful"", his best off-Rocafella production to date. From its Jackson 5 guitar loop to John Legend's pleasant peripherals to Consequence's percolating flow, the track brims with the energy and effervescence of a late-summer classic. And when ""Soulful""'s momentum fades during the two following tracks, Cons and company come back hard with the perilously talent-stuffed ""Wack Niggas"", a long-time staple of West's mixtapes that shows the multifaceted talents of Kanye, Common, Talib Kweli, and Cons meshing beautifully, throwing punches at fake thugs in Chrysler Sebrings over vaudevillian horns and tip-toeing strings. Especially in contrast to Kanye's solid, idiosyncratic production, Consequence seems wary of his talents. It's not that West is relegating Cons to the sidelines; rather, Cons benches himself. On ""Yard 2 Yard"", he cracks: ""Moved from a never-quite-was to an overnight-buzz/ 'Cuz the way I flip a metaphor, nobody quite does,"" yet rarely makes any real attempt to support this claim (let alone to establish himself as the marquee performer). Other times, he just embarrasses himself: Check the off-key warbling and questionable refrain of ""Trains"": ""You should be my queen/ But the only thing I can do is treat you like a slut."" Thankfully, Consequence does provide at least a brief glimpse of his ability. While he only manages to trade two stanzas with Little Brother's Big Pooh on the 9th Wonder-produced album highlight ""I See Now"", his catcalls are surprisingly slick: ""It's like a college degree when you're following me/ Without the entry level job, just a modeling fee."" Two of the better cuts also prove to be safer territory for Consequence, who gives confident performances over a snappy adaptation of Souls of Mischief's ""'93 'Til Infinity"" and the Tribe re-release ""The Consequence"", featuring Con's cousin Q-Tip. Despite this apparent identity crisis, however, Consequence legitimately shines against the chirping flutes on ""And You Say"", intimating his former glory as ATCQ's junior member. In the end, these flashes of lyrical finesse are all the more frustrating: Even after an entire Consequence album, we still don't know who we're listening to. Take 'Em to the Cleaners is less of a breakout for Kanye's sidekick than a draft of his potential success, and another stitch in Kanye's red bear sweater. If and/or when Quence's major label solo debut is ever released (it's been tied up in the record industry's Red Tape District for almost a decade), it should be interesting to see if he can prove his height when he's not standing on Kanye's shoulders.","This new collaborative effort pairs hip-hop's brightest beatmaker, Kanye West, with former Tribe Called Quest MC Consequence.

DNA on DNA,DNA,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8513d197565213b0e3/1:1/w_160/fc1c7e74.jpg,2004-08-04 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2568-dna-on-dna/,No More,"Question for the young'uns who are studying DNA for the first time: Sure, DNA mattered, but were they any good? ""no-wave"" (genre): The stunted strand of noise music/performance art where amateurs played fast, disjointed jerks of songs with no development, making vulgar and even physical assaults on audiences who would've settled for being spat on. Immortalized as much for how quickly it burned out as for how many bands it still influences, no-wave is mostly remembered by a single milestone, No New York, produced by Brian Eno, who picked the four bands that had the best names: James Chance & The Contortions, Teenage Jesus & The Jerks, Mars, and DNA. All of DNA's studio tracks and a handful of live ones are here, even the four songs from No New York. Everyone refers to No New York as one of the great out-of-print albums, but if you look around, you can buy it on CD for about $40. But that would be really stupid. Damn, Francis Crick just died. People joke that if you've heard one DNA song, you've heard them all, but you really need at least two: one with keyboardist Robin Lee Crutchfield, and another with his vastly more capable replacement, Pere Ubu bassist Tim Wright. Robin Crutchfield, writing on his website about one of his first gigs, in 1976 at a performance art festival: ""I mapped out a perimeter on the Floyd Bennett airfield runway with a stick of chalk and took several objects including a toy piano and a blanket with me to live in a self-imposed cage like an asylum inmate for the day. 'The Death of Sparrow Hart' was a persona I took on, part bird, part autistic child, dancing and sobbing and pecking at the piano, hiding under a blanket and so on."" The single biggest reason to revisit DNA is noise savant Arto Lindsay. Lindsay chicken-chokes his guitar, splintering notes and shattering chords like windows falling out of a skyscraper. He cracks his vocals like a bullwhip, then garbles his lyrics with the patience of dry heaving. ""Get out of here/ Go fuck yourself,"" he moans, then sticks his head back in the bowl. When a woman suffers a miscarriage, a common cause is genetic damage: The egg and sperm unite but the DNA combines incorrectly, causing chromosomal damage that is too severe to allow the fetus to come to term. Children who are born with mental retardation also suffer genetic irregularities, but landed right at the threshold where the damage did not prevent them from coming to term. Going off the tracklist here, Blonde Redhead could've just named themselves Egomaniac's Kiss instead. Drummer Ikue Mori can't or won't lock in with anybody. Her frantic cymbal-bashing works better than when she tries to keep the beat-- which is fine, since the rhythms are numbing. As for when she pounds out a tribal tattoo, if you were sacrificing your daughter to a volcano and Mori were the best drummer you could hire for the ceremony, you'd really feel like an asshole. Crutchfield on how they got Mori on drums: ""Arto wanted her to be our drummer. I was reluctant, for a number of reasons. The first was that she had played violin and had no experience on drums. The second was that she didn't own any drums. The third was that she didn't speak enough English for us to communicate and manage to build a 20 minute set of songs in less than 30 days. And the fourth was that her visa was expiring and she was planning to leave the country... She did have one thing going for her. She was interested in working with us."" Is it true that no-wave bands couldn't play their instruments? With the benefit of hindsight, you can figure out who had talent and who just had attitude, but no-wave is still remembered as a lost oasis of committed, crippling unprofessionalism, of a simpler time when making inept noise with gusto actually could shake someone-- except of course, how inept could it be if it's still worth listening to on a record, in your living room? Lindsay and Mori later worked with cult composer and improviser John Zorn, for example in the ""game improvisation"" Cobra, where Zorn herded his groups through painfully elaborate rules to produce music that sounds even uglier than this stuff. The nerdification of noise music suggests that for all the posturing and the awareness of posturing that surrounded no-wave, the downtown scenesters really lost something when it just became ""skronk."" Lindsay et al had the sense to kill the project instead of developing it. Arto Lindsay went on to become a fine singer and guitarist, and when he isn't playing extreme improv, he records beautiful albums of Brazilian pop. Meanwhile, Mori switched to drum machine.","After years of unavailability, these seminal 70s no-wave rockers finally offer a definitive 32-track anthology, containing virtually everything they ever recorded-- even the four from Brian Eno's classic No New York comp.

Porcelain,Sparta,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5049d034d5c69bf31d5/1:1/w_160/35e564f6.jpg,2004-08-04 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7405-porcelain/,Geffen,"After the politically radical (but economically capitalist) art-screamo troupe At the Drive-In disbanded in 2001, three of its members-- Jim Ward, Paul Hinojos and Tony Hajjar-- apparently still had some seething rhetoric to spew. So they recruited Belknap bassist Matt Miller and formed Sparta, a band whose anxious, epic guitar rock maintains ATDI's twitchy prog-punk aesthetic while standardizing some of that group's more esoteric algorithms for mass consumption and heightened accessibility-- Byzantine art-punk cathedrals with wheelchair ramps. Sparta continue to tread the thin line between ""authentic"" punk (compared to most of what passes for punk on the radio, Sparta absolutely rages) and ""commercial"" punk (they're on a major label, receive limited MTV exposure, and tour with Incubus) that drives a certain stripe of staunch, conflicted indie purist mad. Sparta's sophomore LP, Porcelain, doesn't extend the sound of the band's debut so much as inflate it. Porcelain is grandiose and questing, with scintillating, spacious atmospheres and rangy, confident songs that sometimes break the six-minute barrier. It's ziggurat-rock, decadent and Babylonian. But while the band's music has intensified since 2002's Wiretap Scars, the lyrics have retracted into frugal, open forms. These verbal Rorschach blots forgo literal substance in favor of pithy evocation-- they could be about girls or capitalism or hating school, depending on your interpretation and/or psychological needs. Sparta believes that more is more, but their colossal sound is sleek and streamlined, never sludgy. Rock comes in all shapes and sizes; Sparta's is equivalent to a boulder flung from a catapult-- monolithic and daunting, yet swift and aerodynamic. Porcelain opens with ""Guns of Memorial Park"", an S.O.S. tapped out in Morse code echoing urgent, cyclical guitar and alternating, fuzzed-out bass tones. The drums lock as if they're literally beating back a standard-bearing army of vocals and guitars that threaten to breach the castle keep. The shout-along chorus and hectic swarm of ""Hiss the Villain"" evoke classic Hüsker Dü with a heavy coat of varnish. ""While Oceana Sleeps"" is a standout. With its tinkling harmonics, melodic bass, detonating chorus and plaintive vocal performance, it recalls (not for the only time on this record) the arctic sonic waters sailed by The Appleseed Cast. ""Lines in Sand"" is made exceptionally lovely by the chaos around it: It's a richly detailed, burbling soundscape that cascades in waves of quietude and release-- a nerve-soothing Coldplay moment amid the edgier histrionics. There's one sticking point I've yet to address: Is Sparta emo? At the Drive-In was often labeled as such, but any genre that lays claim to both Pedro the Lion and At the Drive-In obviously has some semantic kinks to work out. ""Emo,"" as a genre signifier, should apply to the stripe of music that can make a 12-part harmony sound thin and reedy, with shopworn hardcore progressions arpeggiated into anonymity, and lyrics that prey on the malleable emotions of teenagers (pacesetter: New Found Glory). Sparta, on the other hand, sound positively huge: The arrangements are complex and inventive, and the lyrics are too oblique to wind up in anyone's slam book. Besides, most music transmits some sort of emotion (like, is Ghostface Killah emo?), and if the term that designates any emotional music has taken on negative connotations, as ""emo"" has to some, then one gets the squirmy feeling that we truly have entered the much-ballyhooed ""post-human age."" That, of course, is mere food for thought; Porcelain is food for sheer bodily exaltation. It's an imperative and ornate exhortation to lay open your nerves and unabashedly, unapologetically feel.","Second full-length from these former At the Drive-In members continues to tread the thin line between ""authentic"" punk and ""commercial"" punk that drives a certain stripe of staunch, conflicted indie purist mad.

MGM Endings: Cellar Door Remixes,John Vanderslice,by: Andrew Lehman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9175e6ef95969321359/1:1/w_160/a780ae42.gif,2004-08-03 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8404-mgm-endings-cellar-door-remixes/,Barsuk,"With the release of 2002's The Life and Death of an American Fourtracker, John Vanderslice proved himself capable of striking a balance between his thoughtful, inspired songwriting and his equally intricate and skillful production techniques. As owner of San Francisco's Tiny Telephone studios, the former MK Ultra frontman no doubt has ample time for sonic explorations behind the mixing board. However, on Life and Death, Vanderslice's bag of production tricks never outshone his greatest strength, songwriting. With the release of his fourth full-length, this year's Cellar Door, it seemed that balance was beginning to tip. While tunes such as ""Pale Horse"" and ""White Plains"" showed Vanderslice was still at the top of his songwriting game, some tracks seemed weighed down by his elaborate studio savvy. Already hard at work on a proper follow-up, the increasingly prolific California troubadour is treating his fans to a limited-edition disc titled MGM Endings: Cellar Door Remixes. While the tracks on display here are, after all, ""remixes,"" and a certain amount of studio experimentation is to be expected, it seems evident that Vanderslice is becoming increasingly interested in bringing his inventive production talents to the forefront. Scott Solter, J.V.'s engineer and right-hand man, is again at the helm for this collection of reinterpretations. MGM opens with a remix of Cellar Door's closing track, ""June July"". In its new version, here sneakily re-titled ""August"", the warm acoustic ballad is stripped of its guitars and vocals leaving only booming drums and repetitive string and synthesizer gestures. That the record begins with an instrumental is a harbinger of things to come: Vanderslice's distinct vocals are notably absent from 8 of its 12 tracks. However, the second track, ""Bushnell Scope"", better represents what's to follow. A remix of Cellar Door's ""Up Above the Sea"", ""Bushnell Scope"" features super-compressed bass and layers of huge trash-can-like drums typical of the overall sound of MGM. Like several songs that follow, this track gives the impression of meandering experimentation, the song itself taking a backseat to the myriad effects and gear at hand. This sound further reveals itself on ""Lifeboat"", where massive percussive blasts are accompanied by ethereal, wordless female vocals. By the time the compressed drum hits return for the third time, the track has essentially worn itself out. Likewise, layers of reverberating percussion and fuzzy guitars make up the remix of Cellar Door's ""Pale Horse"", here listed as ""Behold a Pale Horse"". Ultimately, the thundering percussion isn't quite enough to sustain the track, as it otherwise fails to develop. Not surprisingly, the MGM remixes are most successful when Vanderslice's emotive tenor is at the forefront. ""Field Guide"", a rumination on escaping demons of the past, features Vanderslice's vocals backed by layers of slightly distorted acoustic guitars. Although the track is a fairly straight-forward interpretation of Cellar Door's ""White Plains"", the warm lo-fi feel, coupled with the stripped down arrangement, makes for a satisfying alternative to the original. The remix of ""Promising Actress"", re-titled ""Requiem"", also benefits from vocals. Here, a consistent background texture evokes scratchy vinyl, and after a hollow opening of echoing bells, fuzzy guitars emerge to support Vanderslice's delivery of a condensed version of the lyrics. Of course, not all of the instrumental tracks suffer from a lack of vocals: ""Bomb in Reverse"" consists only of acoustic guitars, accompanied by intermittent sonic swells. The tempo is significantly decelerated from the original ""My Family Tree"", but Vanderslice's melodic gift is clearly evident in the undulating guitar figures, which have no trouble standing on their own. It's this melodic inventiveness that's most missed on this collection. Over the course of four solo releases, Vanderslice has established himself as one of the Pacific Northwest's most imaginative indie pop songwriters. When combined with his distinctive voice and unique songwriting, J.V.'s production skills produce remarkable results, but when the elaborate studio arrangements overtake the songs themselves, his talents are often obscured. For many other artists, this wouldn't be cause for concern. Vanderslice, however, is simply too strong a songwriter to take a backseat to production.","Pacific Northwest pop songwriter reworks his recent Cellar Door album for this newly released remix LP.

Drag It Up,Old 97's,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b49d034d5c69bf52af/1:1/w_160/508f5636.gif,2004-08-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5966-drag-it-up/,New West,"Old 97's change their sound restlessly. Over the course of the past 10 years, they've gone from the ramshackle country of Hitchhike to Rhome and Wreck Your Life to the messier country-punk of Too Far to Care to the pristine pop of Fight Songs and Satellite Rides. What's impressive is how well the band have delivered each of their attempted styles, from Brit Invasion to power-pop to country to punk; it's professional range. Drag It Up, however, marks the first time the band's sound has taken a step backwards. Reversing their popward trajectory, the group incorporates more country elements here. The effect is such that the album could fit at any point during their decade-long career-- were it not their weakest effort since their 1994 debut. Part of this regression can be attributed to singer and primary songwriter Rhett Miller, who seems to be losing his edge. Perhaps it has something to do with his recent marriage and fatherhood, both of which have immense personal rewards but often exert a settling effect on artists who've trafficked in damaged goods and sly sexual come-ons. Whatever the cause, he sounds a bit neutered on Drag It Up, having clearly come to terms with his own radical impulses. Aside from ""Won't Be Home"", in which he throws a girl out of his car, Miller declines active agency in these songs: He doesn't do things; things simply happen to him. On ""Bloomington"", he describes how ""a girl in pink took a sip of my drink/ And laid down next to me."" She is the seducer and he the seduced: ""This is love, baby, this is love/ The moment she let me, the moment she let me."" Meanwhile, ""Borrowed Bride"", about an affair with a married woman, could be seen as a sequel to Satellite Rides' ""Designs on You"" if Miller didn't sing the entire thing in second person. Bassist Murry Hammond gets the best songs-- the surf-guitar epic ""Smokers"" and ""In the Satellite Rides a Star"" (which provided their previous album's title)-- and steers the album in a decidedly C&W; direction, reminiscent of the band's earlier material. But as with past albums, the secret weapon here is Ken Bethea, who rarely seems to get his due as a guitarist. Never showy, he infuses ""Smokers"" with its 60s-style bounce and takes vocals duties on the endearingly goofy ""Coahuila"". To an extent, if Drag It Up sounds disappointing, it's mostly in relation to previous albums; it's hard not to compare these songs to ""Valentine"", ""Book of Poems"", ""Busted Afternoon"", or ""Doreen"". But with a discography this sprawling and diverse, it seems unlikely that, aside from a few initial spins, any longtime fan wouldn't reach for the Old 97's other albums before this one. Of course, it's always possible that Miller will receive a renewed burst of confidence or inspiration from here, proving this only a temporary dip in quality. But here, with the band scaling back their sound and reverting to a more comfortable form, there's also little indication they won't just peter out entirely.","Sixth album from these constantly mutating Americana mainstays regresses to an earlier sound, leaning closer to alt-country than other recent outings.

Snow Gas Bones,Meow Meow,by: Zach Vowell,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c566eb335119a49ed9cd/1:1/w_160/2b8e5447.jpg,2004-08-03 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5603-snow-gas-bones/,Devil in the Woods,"Someday, the world will be rid of the likes of me and my fellow asthmatics. Cats, continuing their 4,000 year passive/aggressive reign, will grow in per capita population, increasingly encroaching on our clean, dander-free air. And given the state of blind sensitivity towards animals these days, it will be too late once the remaining masses look up to find a good portion of mankind buried under countless plots of cat hair. It's called natural selection, and it's only a matter of time. Once this realization finally hits, one other observation may go forever unnoticed: Behind a fuzzy exterior lies a fuzzy interior. Led by the songwriting team of Christopher O'Brien and Kirk Hellie, Meow Meow tap their namesake's yelp with that very truth in mind. Listeners who experience this album in a veterinarian clinic might claim that its music is pop-oriented, with furry edges and touches. But I believe that those pop elements-- like the innocuous mannerisms of the feline species-- belie the music's obviously poisonous external coating. The soul of this band is more like Poe's Black Cat than Davis' Garfield. Kitty apologists will delight in Meow Meow's ""sunny disposition,"" though their Californian sense of melody suggests these boys were subjected in their youth to some kind of wicked Blue Hawaiian experiment designed to reveal the effects of too much sunshine. The lyrics don't lie. Lines like, ""Cracked torn and frayed/ I fucked it all up again,"" and song titles such as ""Disaffected"" bear this band's standard, while concessions to warm sentiments are just that. In fact, the tired trick of lapping desperate, anxious, self-loathing lyrics over a sweetly strung voice steers Meow Meow dangerously close to whiny So-Cal pop/punk. Being more than a one-trick pony, however, Meow Meow's lyrics quickly emerge as one component of the whole fuzzy interior/fuzzy exterior sound, and cease their service to the Beach Boys' vocal horse-cart. Left with only a saccharine voice and a buried showcase of melodic attentiveness, Snow Gas Bones presents an ironically enjoyable sonic portrait of the best of all modern beasts, the domestic housecat. It may coo innocently and walk in a soulful gait, but my allergic friends and I know better: The very lines of its silhouette predict our primal darkness. Of course, as delineated by our good friend and fellow feline skeptic Baudelaire, if you do it right, there can be beauty in that darkness. Witness Meow Meow's sleepier moments, as on ""Finis"" or in the requisite taped-message-backed-by-treated-keyboards-backed-by-foreboding-ambience that closes ""Disaffected"". ""Amplified Breathing Apparatus"" boasts a great, understated fuzz-organ, loops of soft radio noise, equally understated vocals, and vibes helming the transition between verses. Though all the foregoing is as satisfying as Snow Gas Bones' lack of actual filler, there are moments when the band can't quite stand on all four legs. The toy box piano on ""The Killing Kind"" turns up the California Effect a tad too high, man: The second track's nakedly anthemic, ""You're my sick fixation!"", busts this band's usually subtle approach, and brings them that much closer to mimicking their musical ancestry (in an unattractive way). Oh, but that subtlety, when it-- conspiring with quality production-- fogs your ears with a handful of disparate layers, consisting mostly of punishment, it makes you want to pet your punisher. Or you may like cats, I guess, in which case you better just sing along.","Los Angeles-based duo cranks out a series of solid SoCal pop tracks recalling early Fountains of Wayne, in both melodic adroitness and lyrical shortcomings.

Recorded Live,Amon Tobin,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cab1335d7bf1699118/1:1/w_160/cecbfbe7.jpg,2004-08-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8088-recorded-live/,Ninja TuneSolid Steel,"As a man who's often credited with reigniting the sputtering spark of drum 'n' bass, Amon Tobin has a huge burden to carry. To date, his studio releases have lived up to standard he set by his earliest recordings under the Ninja Tune banner, plastering the testosterone-fueled aggression inherent in hard jazz over volcanic basslines and finely chopped beats. Tobin mines subtlety from minor changes in volume and pacing, but relies almost exclusively on sheer force to bowl over the listener. His music is ominous and looming, mysterious and cinematic, despite its menace. Even as 2002's Out from Out Where nodded to the Chemical Brothers' big beat/psychedelia pastiche, Luke Vibert's kitchen sink breaks, and the organic jazz textures of Roni Size, his DJ sets have always been about shock and awe above shade and nuance. Recorded live in Melbourne, Australia for Ninja Tune's Solid Steel radio series, Tobin's sound here is derived purely from a laptop, two pieces of vinyl, and Final Scratch, a software package that allows him to mix digital audio files via a turntable interface. For almost a full hour, Tobin flows through several moods in all his ear-splitting, creeped-out, bass-heavy hysteria. Those moods mainly range from dark to darker, but eventually come out the other end of the tunnel with a relatively gentle comedown. In lieu of hiring a full band to recreate his songs, Tobin's tourdates primarily consist of DJ sets like this one, and as such, he tends to throw many of his own tracks into the blender. Song of his like ""Chronic Tronic"" and ""Verbal"", which almost come off with a nod and a smile on Out from Out Where, are here taken into a back alley and roughed up with jackhammer breaks and chasms of reverb. The roar and moan work well here, tempered by spiraling rhythmic structures, quickly shifting tracks, or clever sampling-- all of which Tobin takes advantage of without remorse. A brief LL Cool J quote bleeds into the hip-hop opening of Cherrystones' ""Pressure Cooker"", and a snippet of an astronomy lecture evokes a vintage Space Mountain feel at the end Tobin's ""Marine Machines"", before diving into the vintage Space Invaders warfare of ""Schmalla"" by Facs & Smythe. These bright moments stab out of the fog and give the listener something to hold on to while Tobin keeps the bass in full force. Unfortunately, a ponderous midsection mires the maddening pace of the album's first and final thirds. Here, Tobin blends 13 tracks in less than 20 minutes, killing the heightened anxiety by total anesthesia, drumming and bassing us into numbness. Normally known for extended, intricate transitions, the blending of these tracks seems forced-- almost clumsy. The press notes accompanying the album mention that some songs were excised from the set in post-production due to lack of legal clearance for samples, and some of these transitions lead me to believe that something is literally missing from these segues, as they're so uncharacteristically inelegant. Things pick back up during the final third of the record, though, as we find Tobin at his most playful and surreal. His ""Night Life"" is the first downtempo respite of the set, a churning break accompanied by Arabesque flute and brass. Future Prophecies deliver some future-funk breaks with the well-titled ""Deep Impact"". This is soon followed by the shuffle and bounce of Dizzee Rascal's ""Sittin' Here"", in which the UK garage star's vocals seethe and bubble with effects (though are almost entirely drowned in what must've been a muddy P.A. mix). The last 12 minutes-- a including mashup of three Tobin originals-- offer some innovative peak moments, probably leaving the drunken bogan crowd shaken to their Ug Boots. Here are the schizoid arrangements and found-sound samples that makes Tobin's albums so intriguing. The elephantine bass of ""Proper Hoodidge"" slowly fades into the breaking cymbals and strings of ""Four Ton Mantis"", which then slides into ""Hey Blondie""'s electro synths. And then comes a truly inspired finale: Tobin drops a majestic, cathartic ""Venus in Furs"", slow-breaks style, that despite the low vocal volume closes the album with a heavy-lidded sigh. Of course, even with Lou Reed's hermaphroditic voice lightening the set's loafers, Recorded Live is overwhelmingly masculine. In other words, if you're looking for delicate, atmospheric beats you won't find them here. What the disc does contain is a brutish, undeniable muscle that makes it an enthralling and abrasive listen. Best be sure your speakers can handle the workout.","The latest release in Ninja Tune's Solid Steel series captures this diverse December 2003 DJ set from Amon Tobin, featuring live remixes of tracks by Dizzee Rascal, Aphex Twin and The Velvet Underground.

Out of the Shadow,Rogue Wave,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a302c0084474cd0c019c/1:1/w_160/50cee0e1.jpg,2004-08-03 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6919-out-of-the-shadow/,Sub Pop,"Rogue Wave recently exploded onto the national stage with their Sub Pop debut, Out of the Shadow. When an unknown band erupts from anonymity and begins garnering rave reviews in grassroots webzines and established glossy print mags alike, cynical consumers, steeped in suspicion of market manipulation and mainstream postmodernism, immediately become wary and guarded-- the animal that has been mistreated shying away from the friendly hand. Sometimes, breakout bands have indeed been ""sold"" with ingenious marketing pushes and lifestyle branding techniques, but more often, the seemingly abrupt success is the product of a long and invisible series of missteps, failures, minor triumphs, and most importantly, years of unheralded toil and sweat. Such is the trajectory of Rogue Wave. In early 2002, the deflating dot-com bubble left musician Zach Schwartz jobless and spiritually bankrupt. What he initially perceived as a disaster, however, was a masquerading boon: The layoff led directly to his Sub Pop debut. A member of the Bay Area indie group Desoto Reds at the time, Schwartz left Oakland for New York, California's dark mirror, to record a few songs with his friend, producer Bill Racine. He returned to the Bay Area with an entire album. The bicoastal milieu of Out of the Shadow is apparent: It reflects both a lush, sunny ""California Dreamin'"" temperament, and Gotham's grimy, melancholic disposition. That Schwartz wrote and recorded Out of the Shadow by himself also seems fitting: It's lonely and remote in the vein of Oh, Inverted World, and vividly evokes one man sitting alone amid the finely wrought, baroquely detailed, and ultimately imprisoning architecture he's constructed around himself, contemplating his failure to include an exit door. Upon returning to California, Schwartz quit Desoto Reds, changed his last name to ""Rogue,"" and placed an ad for musicians on Craig's List. He found drummer/sampler Pat Spurgeon, bassist Sonya Westcott, and guitarist/keyboardist Gram Lebron. By all credible reports, the new quartet almost literally fell in love with one another. Soon, the members had added tactful motes of Moog, thin wires of lap steel, and square-shouldered vocal harmonies to Schwartz's tapes. Out of the Shadow opens with ""Every Moment"", a song that begins with channel-switching low-end tones and a metallic guitar figure that sounds as though it were run through a ring-modulator-- instrumentation that stands in stark opposition to the Brian Wilson-caliber harmonies preparing to break over the arrangement like dawn. A shifting fog traced with refracted light, this nervous jostle of pop standards (bright Byrds guitar tones, big balloony drums), set against a backdrop of alien drones, elucidates exactly why Rogue Wave are such felicitous label/tourmates for The Shins. The crisp percussion, uproariously strummed acoustic guitar of ""Nourishment Nation"" recalls Yo La Tengo if pared down to the most broad and translucent gestures-- particularly when the Ira Kaplan-esque vocal melody begins snaking around the amorphous arrangement like scaffolding. ""Be Kind + Remind"" opens with a guitar phrase as ineluctable and hypnotic as anything Windsor for the Derby has produced, and its twittering birds lend it the same Emersonian naturalism. It's also the record's first brush with questionable lyrical choices-- the ""please be kind and remind"" pun of the chorus seems like forced quirkiness, and strikes a discordant aesthetic note. Despite it, the flashes of bright plumage flitting through the arrangement in the guise of tiny whistles and bells enliven the auditory canvas enough to rescue it from the clutches of ignominy. ""Kicking the Heart Out"" is a spare acoustic ballad augmented by chiming harmonics. It trades the earlier songs' more inflated vocals for leaner, darker melodic turns that fully exploit Schwartz's knack for creating sonic atmospheres akin to gazing at the natural splendor of The Pacific Ocean on a calendar in a sterile office cubicle. The walking bassline takes it increasingly lower, into the murkier dungeons of consciousness. Wildly incongruous handclaps cement its pristine strangeness. This is the loudest quiet since Simon & Garfunkel turned a facile paradox into a philosophical enigma by aurally evoking ""The Sound of Silence"". Considering Out of the Shadows' backstory and recording sessions, this album may come to embody the sound of Rogue Wave in an embryonic stage. With the band's new members likely to play a larger role in song development from here on out, it seems likely that the group could quickly evolve into another entity altogether. Either way, having been plucked from obscurity by Sub Pop, and showing so much potential this early on, Rogue Wave seem ordained for long-term success.","Building a remarkable following on the strength of opening performances for The Shins, Spoon, and Super Furry Animals, San Francisco-based indie pop group Rogue Wave have gained a dedicated fanbase virtually overnight. It's easy to see why: Their Sub Pop debut overflows with breezy, Pacific Northwest harmonies, lush vocals and strummed guitar work that beats a path similar to The Shins' Oh, Inverted World and Elliott Smith's XO.

Green Imagination,The Sunshine Fix,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c45e6ef95969320b9f/1:1/w_160/e47e2d1c.jpg,2004-08-02 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7593-green-imagination/,spinART,"In the world of Olivia Tremor Control spinoffs, Bill Doss' The Sunshine Fix has fancied itself the fun and poppy counterpart to the dark, experimental tendencies of Will Cullen Hart's Circulatory System. The problem with this is that they've never been fun, nor particularly interesting. Drenching their previous releases in blindingly bright, caramel-saccharine glee, The Sunshine Fix are psychedelic Fred Penners making clumsy attempts at approximating Beatles production-- they even frequently crib Lennon/McCartney tracks note-for-note. Green Imagination, The Sunshine Fix's latest release, convicts Doss and company once more of shamelessly aping as many of the Fab Four's post-Help! trademarks as they're likely to get away with. To their credit, however, they occasionally throw a curveball: Careful dusting occasionally reveals the prints of Keith Richards' sticky fingers on Green Imagination as well, marking the first time the band has ever dared to venture outside the Magical Mystery realm. In fact, were there any trace of the innovation and easy genius these artists routinely exhibited, The Sunshine Fix might actually be onto something. Unfortunately, given the influences they've drawn from, The Sunshine Fix's returns are awfully unrewarding. Green Imagination does awkwardly stumble into some redeeming moments, but never without a slog through the banal first. The short opener ""Statues and Glue"" showers itself in yellowed vocal harmonies, lulling listeners with its mundane chord progressions, until a simple but powerful bass and drum breakdown is introduced, slashed on the offbeat by Doss' upstroke. ""What Do You Know"" is an abridged version of Black Foliage's ""A Sleepy Company"", trading the latter's devilish string parts and general oddballery for flat-out gimmicky flanged guitar lines and scrambled vocals-- but while the call-and-response between Doss and his ""What do you know?"" chorus initially cloys, the closing refrain recompenses, as Doss fights against ascending vocal harmonies and a children's choir. Which is maybe what's so frustrating about Green Imagination: Doss clearly knows how to craft challenging yet accessible passages, and it's a shame he so often settles for compositional truisms. Another hurdle that The Sunshine Fix could stand to clear is their tendency towards pop overload. When Doss fails to find an interesting melody, he seems to think that simply stuffing tracks with an unwieldy number of boring ones will solve the problem. Tracks like ""Extraordinary/Ordinary"" prove just the opposite. The falsetto melody that opens this track is maybe the most remarkable parody of Carl Newman's songwriting prowess I've heard, and the rest of the song is content to congeal into a mess of flaccid horn bops, guitar slides, and wispy harmonies. Starlight Mints send-up ""Afterglow"" and Rolling Stones town-carnival tribute ""Face the Ghost"" make it all the more clear that Green Imagination desperately wants to be loved-- and obnoxiously so. Doss' blues affectations, and each track's transparent recourse to some goofy ""we're totally fun!"" trope (see: the addition of harmonica and/or ""Twist and Shout""-style chord builds) are, in fact, not totally fun, but wholeheartedly infuriating. Let's pass over the John Lennon-does-country sleeper ""Rx"", the TV mini-drama theme ""Enjoy Your Teeth"", and ""Runaway Run"" (the latter a possible successor to Beavis and Butthead's ""Lesbian Seagulls""). Maybe the only truly worthwhile track on Green Imagination is the closer, ""Sunday Afternoon"". The catchy stop/start guitar riff initially keeps the short song's energy level high, but soon, some fantastic multi-part vocals steal the spotlight: While sweeping guitar lines and oohs/ahhs are pushed to the front of the mix, two massively catchy vocal melodies trade fire across the stereo in the background, the tenors on one side, the bass on the other. This production technique would seem to contradict common sense, but it works extremely well here-- and if nothing else, it leaves those who can even get through the entirety of Green Imagination with a nice consolation prize.","Fronted by ex-Olivia Tremor Control co-frontman Bill Doss, The Sunshine Fix's third full-length offers no hint of the twisted brilliance behind his former band.

Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy),Doug HilsingerCaroleen Beatty,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c160abf31b7dc71565f5/1:1/w_160/9f2043ae.jpg,2004-08-02 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3988-taking-tiger-mountain-by-strategy-with-caroleen-beatty/,DBK Works,"As Pitchfork's Top 100 Albums of the 1970s list showed, Brian Eno ruled the decade, bookending it with the #100 entry and playing a huge role on our #1, David Bowie's Low. Interestingly, though, Eno's second solo album, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy), failed to place in the pantheon at all. Strange that it was left out in the cold, especially as it always held a place in my heart, even if it is (rightfully) considered a chilly album. Chalk that up to Eno's early experimentation with drum machines and synthesizer technology, which propelled those hastily worded (yet still evocative) songs. Concurrent with Virgin's Eno reissues, Bay Area multi-instrumentalist Doug Hilsinger-- on either whim or dare-- cut a full-album cover of Taking Tiger Mountain, enlisting his friend Caroleen Beatty to take the vocal duties. The disc was never intended to see retail daylight, but at Brian Eno's lecture appearance at The Long Now Foundation in San Francisco, the duo slipped him a CDR copy of their secret love letter. And when the man responded with the realization that ""they aren't bad songs after all,"" the album found its way out. The most immediately striking thing about this homage is how this so-called Maoist opera is significantly warmer and more of an even keel than the original. This is due largely to Hilsinger's insistence on playing everything on the album with a conscientious shunning of drum machines and keyboards of any sort. Still, all the guitar noises mimic the Eno treatments to a tee, which frees up the lyrics themselves to shine under Beatty's reading. Having worked with The Mekons' Jon Langford in the past, it's not too surprising that Beatty's voice evokes Sally Timms' radiance; she deftly replaces Eno's adenoidal, androgynous nasal delivery with a throatier resonance. The song titles now read like 50s film marquees from a parallel universe: A vague plot and character interactions surface on the grainy black-and-white ""Burning Airlines"" and the near-comedic march of ""Back in Judy's Jungle"". Who would be cast in the role of ""The Fat Lady of Limbourg""? You can almost see the lead of ""The Great Pretender"" stagger away from the surrendered shape of Monica on the sand as if in some tragic end scene, the looping noise crescent as the ocean waves overtake him. ""Third Uncle"" unfortunately gets taken at a reggae shuffle here, undermining the paranoid pace of the original, and the ecstatic peaks of ""The True Wheel"" are leveled out by Beatty's too-calculated delivery. As the title track ebbs away, though, Eno's sentiment holds true: Beneath the cold machines and chin-stroking theories that weighted the originals down lies more human heart than even its creator ever suspected.","San Francisco duo release a full-album cover of Brian Eno's Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).

Mystic Chords of Memory,Mystic Chords of Memory,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c565c0084474cd0c372b/1:1/w_160/dd94445a.jpg,2004-08-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5602-mystic-chords-of-memory/,Rough Trade,"The 2002 dissolution-via-extended-hiatus of cosmic-country pioneers Beachwood Sparks spawned a generous litter of side projects and swishy psych-experiments, some bizarrely short-lived (the freshly dismembered All Night Radio), and some a little bit more enduring. But regardless of their relative shelf-life, the surfboard never seems to fall terribly far from the Beachwood umbrella, and each of the former members' post-Sparks projects have been imbued with the same characteristic sun-streaks and slow California ease. The latest record to pop forth from Beachwood Sparks' sandy grave is Mystic Chords of Memory, which features Christopher Gunst (also of Strictly Ballroom, The Tyde, and Further) and partner Jen Cohen (of The Aislers Set), and was recorded exclusively from inside Gunst and Cohen's shared home. Acknowledging the duo's inherited aesthetic (painfully relaxed), and factoring in the total lack of studio pressure, MCoM's subsequent long-player is an unsurprising sprawl of deliciously lulling fuzz. Given their pedigree, it may seem unlikely that Gunst and Cohen could stumble across anything more sleepily compelling than the slow, breezy squeals and overwhelming atmospherics that Beachwood Sparks fans so eagerly lapped up, but this debut isn't all spineless sighs and gooey waves. With its soft melodies, sweet vocals, and scratchy DIY production, Mystic Chords of Memory is also an overwhelmingly intimate record, focused and domestic-- much closer to Elliott Smith than former-benchmarks the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield. The duo's wordy moniker was lifted directly from a phrase in Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address, a lecture delivered in the spring of 1861 and boldly eternalized at the base of Mount Rushmore (the full quote, ""The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone..."" is etched directly beneath Lincoln's face, fodder for zillions of disposable cameras and whirring camcorders every July). Appropriately, the band's sound is just as archaic as a truly striking political speech: Gunst and Cohen blend tinkling bells, melodica, harp, keyboards, bits of samples, tinny drums, and strummy guitars, presenting a vaguely contemporary update on the British folk phenomenon of the late 1960s-- albeit with more blips. The instrumental ""Soul Through the Bullet Hole"" juxtaposes puttering drums and thick bass with otherworldly keys, rubbery guitar, and bubbling samples; the singer/songwriter sap of ""Golden Dome"" is perfectly augmented by a careening violin and Cohen's gentle backing harmonies. Gunst's vocals are lower and less strained than on most of Beachwood Sparks' tracks, and the duo's living room tinkering seems to have freed Gunst from the knee-jerk nu-psych cawing of his past. Mystic Chords of Memory is a surprisingly coherent re-introduction to Gunst, and his professional coupling with Jen Cohen has proven both a freeing and inspired move. Gunst is carrying on the Beachwood torch, but abandoning the baggage.","Rough Trade releases this debut outing from Beachwood Sparks' Christopher Gunst and The Aislers Set's Jen Cohen, full of soft melodies, sweet vocals, and scratchy DIY production.

The Empire Strikes First,Bad Religion,by: J.H. Tompkins,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f2b1335d7bf16983a5/1:1/w_160/bb210021.jpg,2004-08-02 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/522-the-empire-strikes-first/,Epitaph,"I walked outside before dawn one day last fall in Redlands, CA to find a firestorm racing across the nearby hills, leaving a ghostly crimson light flickering in and out of picture windows and windshields, and lending an eerie glow to the early morning fog. The inferno seemed a horribly apt fit for the historical moment-- a kind of purification by fire delivered to a nation choking on official lies, war and joblessness. Greg Graffin and Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, the twenty-something year-old L.A. punk band, were paying attention; a few weeks later, they went into the studio to record the searing ""Los Angeles Is Burning"", a grim celebration of environmental rape and the subsequent payback. That's just one great moment from Bad Religion's The Empire Strikes First, 14 songs that are fresh, focused, and absolutely alive in the way that great rock 'n' roll energizes everything it touches. It's been a long road from their early-80s beginnings, but these days, the primary concerns of Graffin and Gurewitz are not the band's intricate (and subtle) years-long evolution; they're first and foremost topical songwriters focused on domestic chaos and its global manifestation. Bad Religion is, after all, the outfit that, during the first Gulf War in 1991, shared a Maximum Rock 'n' Roll split seven-inch with radical MIT professor Noam Chomsky, who, like them, is locked into the tense present and dedicated to exposing the forces who lie and disguise to deepen and enforce human misery. The truth is that after 20+ years, Bad Religion meet the present day not only unfettered by nostalgia, but hardwired into the moment. Fans take the band's growth and standards for granted. It's tempting to say-- though impossible to prove-- that the The Empire Strikes First is a such a terrific album because vocalist Graffin and guitarist Gurewitz, the band's most important creative forces, are responding to the death, desolation, and destruction of war, and to the concurrent attacks on the Bill of Rights; it seems more than just a happy accident that the band has just delivered one of its most charged and inspired records in years. Bad Religion's most important elements are intact here: Graffin's voice and politically informed lyrics, and Gurewitz's imaginative guitar work and background vocals. They wouldn't likely contest the suggestion that the use of simple elements equates to a formula, but the genius of Graffin and Gurewitz is how they take these simple elements and twist them-- unexpected chord changes, short breakdowns, quick drum fills, and increasingly sophisticated, sweet-sounding vocal arrangements so rich you could trade them for military arms. ""Sinister Rouge"" is a study in contrasts; a wall of cinematic harmonies comes at you like choir practice in a cave, while Gurewitz's guitar is so close it could touch you (whether you'd like it to or not). ""Los Angeles Is Burning"" lifts a lesson from the band's own backyard, but ""Let Them Eat War"" is a classic Bad Religion anthem. Graffin spits out a variation on the theme of old-school punk politics locking arms with the American worker in order to explain how fighting a war serves the interests of the capitalists who keep them down. You'd think (or I would anyway) that any song with the lyric, ""You never stole from the rich to give to the poor/ All he ever gave to them was a war/ And a foreign enemy to deplore,"" should be stopped before it kills again. But don't pull the switch-- the band rocks along at high speed beneath Graffin (and his vocal uses the whole scale), while Gurewitz delivers aggressively graceful, ultra-melodic fills, and sugary harmonies to glue the chorus together. The irony of it all is that the band's call-and-response vocal arrangements are straight out of a Baptist church house, as are the rich harmonies and the reliance on one man-- in this case, Graffin-- to testify to (and for) the congregation. Bad Religion's magic doesn't stem as much from their political lyrics as from the airtight arrangements and thick, sweet harmonies that bring the lyrics to you, and interestingly, are also the antithesis of the social rebellion the band advocates. A case could be made (and sometimes I make it) that the band resorts to the very things it deplores in order to get across a message, and that in the process, they demand a kind of allegiance that a cynic might call unhealthy. But if Graffin and Gurewitz are willing to return to the well to help the innocent climb out, the end certainly justifies the means.","After a series of arid, interchangeable albums, current events and contempt for recent U.S. policy lights a fire in the belly of pop/punk pioneers Bad Religion, resulting in their most inspired record in years.

Uncollected,Galaxie 500,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beddea9e61561daa7982/1:1/w_160/0cb43048.jpg,2004-08-02 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3381-uncollected/,Ryko,"The effect of Galaxie 500's music is akin to that of a lit match in an empty, darkened room. Their style of ambient rock is so uniquely visceral and assuredly sovereign that the band are near impossible to place in context. They're better than context, at once barrenly isolated and cozily insulated. They radiate light when there's nothing to illuminate. One can picture them performing alone on an infinite plane, casting lambent guitar peals into the abyss as the bass throws off cool purple embers. It's uncanny how a band could create such imagistic soundscapes using just guitar, bass and drums, but their method was deceptively simple: Recording elementary pop songs at slothful tempos, Galaxie 500 voided the outside world simply by using reverb-- lots of it-- to make their songs hugely, panoptically immersive. Their indolent compositions are at once keenly prescient of the slacker rock of the early 1990s, and beholden strictly unto themselves. Indeed, in literal terms, the band were, in some ways, all by themselves. Operating during what was arguably a latent period for underground music, the group were unparalleled in style and substance. Oddly enough, they came to typify late-80s college rock, right alongside their Boston brethren the Pixies. But Galaxie 500 were always markedly set apart from their peers, enjoying (one imagines) the sort of critical insulation brought by a timeless sound and largely posthumous discovery. This confluence of circumstances, combined with some of a decade's most killer riffs, has won the band comparisons to The Velvet Underground. But as with the Velvets, to saddle Galaxie 500 with generous comparisons is unnecessary, and only serves to diminish their rare achievements, and undercut the singular impact they've wrought upon independent music. Though 1989's On Fire remains their finest and most fully realized album, uninitiated fans seeking to begin an affair with this group would be well advised to seek out three tracks from Uncollected, a document of the band's rarest works that was first issued as part of Rykodisc's four-disc Galaxie 500 box set, and has now been issued as a standalone release. ""Walking Song"", and the two subsequent tracks, comprise the band's 1987 demo tape; they aren't the highlights of this set (much less the band's entire catalog), but they are significant, because they illustrate, more vividly than any other selections I can think of, the group's rapid learning period and concomitant progression toward one of the most distinctive sounds in indie rock's storied history. In just five years, the trio went from being a slack post-grad pub band with minimal playing experience and a dilettante bassist, to progenitors of dream-pop and one of the underground's most folkloric and influential acts. Many of these tracks exist outside this collection, among various odds-and-sods EPs and compilations. The non-album version of ""Blue Thunder"", pilfered from the 1989 Rough Trade EP of the same name, features a yowling saxophone, and, despite the stridency of its accompaniment, is somehow even more sobering than the album cut. Tender and quavering originally, Ralph Carney's tenor sax stands up to the woebegone guitar and chilly vocals, providing firmness in the face of heady melancholy. The contrast only broadens the already immense emotional breadth of the song, making it not just one of the most moving songs here, but anywhere in the band's repertoire. A guitar band first and foremost, Galaxie 500 also displayed a scholarly and eclectic penchant for covers, and Uncollected gathers a handful of these impressions among 11 original works, including a slowcore read of The Rutles' ""Cheese & Onions"" and an august live suite showcasing The Beatles' ""Rain"" and Jonathan Richman's ""Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste"". Suffused with piecemeal effects and lush string swells, ""Cheese & Onions"" is more histrionic than the band's traditional understated material, and serves as a stellar example of their musicological reach. The nearly-nine-minute live suite, however, is quintessential Galaxie, showing all shades of the group, from ragtag pop troubadours, to cogitating slowcore shamans, to towering guitar rock demigods. Dean Wareham's lavishly reverbed solo at the end of ""Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste"" is one of his most formidable; that it was performed live is a testament to his well-earned, yet still largely unrecognized, place in the guitar-god pantheon. While many of these tracks remain true to the band's staple sound, the most interesting cuts are those that witness them taking a different, often slightly exploratory bent. ""Oblivious"" shows a bouncier Galaxie 500, sacrificing ambience for a blither interest in straightforward hooks, while ""Song in 3"" stakes a tumbling inverted waltz that smacks more directly of the band's relationship with 60s pop. Elsewhere, ""Walking Song"" is perhaps the most upbeat example of the group's songwriting, honoring its title with a propulsive drumbeat and surf-like breakdown. The songs most redolent of the band's album cuts-- the jittery ""Them"", ""Summertime""-in-uteri ""Final Day"", and the drowsy ""Maracas Song""-- are undoubtedly strong ones, but nevertheless provide somewhat pallid stand-ins for classics like ""Fourth of July"", ""When Will You Come Home"", or ""Listen, The Snow Is Falling"". These aren't Galaxie 500's best songs, but-- whether covers or not-- they are unmistakably their songs, which makes this release an invaluable artifact for devout fans, and a strong selling point for tyros.","Slowcore progenitors Galaxie 500 have seen a period of renewed interest since the release of Plexifilm's all-encompassing double-DVD anthology, Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste. Now, Ryko gives a proper release to this compilation featuring every rare non-album cut recorded by the band, as well as live covers of songs originally performed by The Beatles, Jonathan Richman and The Rutles.

Live at the LU,FenneszKeith Rowe,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b9b1335d7bf1698561/1:1/w_160/b7b6dc42.gif,2004-08-01 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6849-live-at-the-lu-with-christian-fennesz/,Erstwhile,"Ever since he laid his electric guitar flat in emulation of painter Jackson Pollack in the 60s, English artist Keith Rowe has been splattering intricately nuanced white noise. Beyond his painterly approach, he's also taken conceits from John Cage, and strains of imaginary landscapes from shortwave radio, frantic cartridge music crunch, indeterminacy, patches of 4'33"" non-silence, and prepared guitar strings abound and commingle in his sound. It makes him a guitar hero of the queerest sort, as most of today's players still hesitate to explore such things as pick-ups' electromagnetic fields, or the effect that motor drones, tongue depressors, and Brillo pads have on detuned strings. Not until well into the 90s did Rowe even find a generation of sympathetic ears, or international players with which to surround himself beyond the confines of his main trio, AMM. The Erstwhile label has often documented the meeting of elder statesman with younger minds, to startling and sonically-challenging effect. So to team him with Christian Fennesz, the gateway guitarist/Powerbook player known for straddling noise and pop, is an intriguing move, as it could well introduce Rowe to a slightly larger demographic-- particularly if the two were to incorporate more of Fennesz's shoegazing ambient washes. Additionally, it could offset the grumbles that Fennesz merely treaded water for his follow-up to Endless Summer, rather than take his explorations further out for Venice. While not their first meeting (both gents appeared alongside Pita, Pimmon, and Oren Ambarchi for 2000's Afternoon Tea), it is their first performance as a duo. Unfortunately, with the ferocious crackle and piercing frequencies that tear open this 2002 live performance in Nantes, France, it appears that they're headed for decidedly rocky and difficult terrain. Over the course of this 43-minute excursion, the topography of the performance more closely resembles that of the music of Keith Rowe's other duos, as the two favor textures, rumbling drones, and physical crackles, as well as sampled bits of shortwave radio (a mainstay of most Rowe performances). Sadly, the most striking feature on display here is a curious instance of cheap drum machine patter. Fennesz subsumes himself throughout, reacting more to Rowe and manipulating that input rather than injecting his poignant melodicism and own talent for sonic landscaping. Instead of the dynamics of vistas and valleys that enrich Fennesz's solo work-- which could have brought a refreshing change to the world of electro-acoustic improv-- the performance remains at a tepid, level plane, settling into a comfortable bed of indistinct noise that rarely changes, much less suggests the pedigree of the gentlemen at play, and fades away long before the disc clicks to a close.","Live piece from AMM guitarist Keith Rowe and Powerbook processor Christian Fennesz lacks the invention the collaboration suggests.

Out to Go,Moco,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c56313d197565213bfd1/1:1/w_160/dddc3713.jpg,2004-08-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5601-out-to-go/,PitponyStuntmonkey,"Located about halfway between Manchester and Liverpool, Wigan is a fairly unassuming city of around 90,000 people, once a major mining center, but now completely devoid of functioning collieries. Tourists know it for its pier, its outdoor market, and its proximity to lots of rolling north English countryside, while dweebs like me know it as the epicenter of Britain's Northern Soul scene, and for turning out The Verve and Witness UK (not to mention bubblegummers Kajagoogoo)-- all in all, not a bad chart showing for such a small town. Well, now we can add hooky garage-rock to Wigan's extant mix of Northern Soul, majestic psychedelia, fizzy synth-pop, and stately Britannicana, courtesy of Moco. Moco don't bear much resemblance to any of their hometown forebears, with a grimy sound worthy of those old boarded mining operations and a vocalist sure to have them labeled a North English Strokes. I'm not sure vocalist Steve Jones' timbrel similarity to Julian Casablancas is intentional, though; he seems to be making an effort to distance himself from the comparison with a delivery that's far more engaged and enthusiastic. However, producer Steve Kettle is doing him no favors by wrapping his voice up in Strokesian processing. Indeed, those little numbers up there at the top of the review would be a few ticks higher if Jones had just gotten to go off like the Iggy descendant he seems to have lurking in him. For their part, the rest of the band sound like the kind of act that could flatten a crowd in a pub, with a canny sense of dynamics and arrangement. The guitars peel off riffs and drop them in your head's pop depository, and the band comes up with some clever turns in the middle of ""Dirty Love"", as the song veers into a frenetic march piled with xylophone, ooh-ing backing vox, and trumpet. The guitar hooks of ""Baby When You Die"" have a Rubber Soul quality to them, but the song's highlight is actually its midsection build-up and crashing return to the chorus. Songs are kept quick and to the point, with only one even flirting with the four-minute mark, and the album's half-hour total runtime makes it feel like a sugary punch in the arm-- it's not quite aggressive enough to knock your teeth out, but neither is it afraid to give you a decent bruising. Ultimately, if Moco are to fully realize their potentially high ceiling, they'll have to step out from the garage a bit and allow themselves to be exposed as the fire-breathers they are behind the mask-- bassist Nick Higham and Simon Misra can bang, and I'd love to hear them shoved a little further in my face. But as it stands, this is all talk for another time, as Out to Go, for all its sonic shortcomings, nonetheless sticks mightily to your ribs.","British garage-rockers are held back by their Strokes-y production, and would fare better were they not so tied to current trends.

Dead Diamond River EP,The Court & Spark,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a684ea9e61561daa53b0/1:1/w_160/deef0dde.jpg,2004-08-01 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1636-dead-diamond-river-ep/,Absolutely Kosher,"Twang: the plight of any alt-country musician. From Jeff Tweedy's inauspicious beginnings in Uncle Tupelo, to dusty latter day folksters like David Pajo and Will Oldham, the genre has always been haunted by detractors who yield the word like incriminating evidence. If the indie music press shares one thing in common with the right-wing media juggernaut, it's its eager defamation of this innocuous onomatopoetic device. Much like ""liberal"" in today's so-called political journalism, twang has come to mean something dirty among the critical elite. Aside from the obvious imbecility of the idea that any singular element can be inherently bad in music, twang is a relatively harmless quality to vilify. After all, the last thing one could call Ry Cooder's slide guitar meditations is pretentious. In fact, alt-country was founded in part to counter the sort of discreet braggadocio so virulent in underground music. The Court & Spark certainly belong to this category, albeit cast down a somewhat more experimental tributary. Conceived and reared in San Francisco, the band are as indebted to Cooder et al as anyone, and their vast soundscapes evoke untainted portraits of an Ol' West less steeped in folklore than shear, elemental love of life. And yes, their songs twang along with the best of 'em; see their tender ""National Lights"", off 2001's Bless You, one of the exemplary y'allternative songs of the last few years, for proof. But The Court & Spark are so much more than twang, and it only takes a few bars of ""Invercargill"", the opening cut off the group's new EP, Dead Diamond River, for them to reiterate it. Three years removed from their last full-length effort, the California quintet have had sufficient time to explore, hone, and expand their sound, and if this concise five-song collection is any indication, their forthcoming Witch Season LP should provide a more nuanced companion to the band's erstwhile work. Of course, given the band's rootsy aesthetic, there are the haggard old tricks-- dolorous tempos, heart-rending vocal deliveries, and plenty of pedal steel (""Bar the Door, Davy"" even intercepts, verbatim, a riff from The Decemberists' ""Clementine"")-- but the band are adventurous enough in their retreads to revere a long lineage of forebears while simultaneously taking steps toward an advanced sound. Aforementioned ""Invercargill"" dabbles in mesmeric psych-folk atmospherics before performing an abrupt turnabout, dissolving inwardly, and emerging with a drowned-out rag that it rides to an anti-climax. Before long, the amicable ""Lucia"" cozies up to some bucolic acoustic fingering, and The Court & Spark are back to being their humble old selves again. But don't be fooled. The Court & Spark are a very sophisticated animal, and any intimations at simplicity are readily dispelled by the finesse of their arrangements. What saves songs like ""Lucia"" from succumbing to vapidity is a keen sense of dynamics, and a killer knack for arranging familiar instruments. Throughout Dead Diamond River, acoustic guitars, vibraphones, glockenspiels, pedal steels, organs, and analog synths intermingle with harmonious fluidity, resulting in a sum much greater than its parts. You don't need to have seen San Francisco to appreciate their visceral orchestrations; like any successfully evocative folk music, the portraits the band etch are almost better than the real thing for their fictitiously preserved perfection.","San Francisco-based experimental alt-country band evokes untainted portraits of an Ol' West less steeped in folklore than shear, elemental love of life.

Frozen Orange,David Kilgour,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9413d197565213b105/1:1/w_160/361319a2.jpg,2004-08-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4422-frozen-orange/,Merge,"Old Reliable. Is there a better nickname for David Kilgour? Maybe there's one only his close friends know, but for my money, as a listener, few titles could be more fitting. For 2\xBD decades now, Kilgour has been to New Zealand indie pop the batter who hits .300 every season with 100 RBI, the nightwatchman that never misses a shift, the surgeon who never loses a patient. These things don't make front-page news or win many awards, but they're admirable feats all the same, and ultimately, that kind of consistency is a huge accomplishment. Kilgour will never make the best album ever, or even the best album of the year, but when he heads into a studio with friends-- be they his long-running and hugely influential band The Clean, or just a one-time assemblage for a solo record-- the results are always impressively satisfying. There's something very comfortable about Frozen Orange, Kilgour's sixth album under his given name-- its sound is welcoming, almost casual, and its contains a fine clutch of compositions. But while Kilgour's work boasts a workmanlike consistency, these songs are still clearly the result of careful craftsmanship. There's a tangible ebb and flow to his record, as Kilgour and a crew including Jason Loewenstein, Lambchop's Mark Nevers, Clockhammer's Matt Swanson, Alan Haig of The Verlaines and The Chills, and Tony Crow sculpt the dynamics of these songs to create an overarching contour for the album. Songs like ""Everybody's on a Ride"" feel loose and relaxed, but the way the twangy guitar hook is punched up to the front of the mix in response to Kilgour's wispy intonation of the title reveals good planning. ""Living in Space"" is a sprightly, complex rocker, but its drive never spills over into aggression, and the sound is kept clean. In fact, distortion is hard to come by anywhere on Frozen Orange, and the raga-inspired instrumentals that dominated much of Kilgour's last album, A Feather in the Engine, are nowhere to be found. This serves the songs well, and gives the album a tone rather akin to the underwater world depicted on its cover, tremolo being the main effect present on the guitars. Also contributing to the album's strength as a complete piece is the deft sequencing. ""Rolling"" is a great closer, with its easy-flowing guitar and piano motifs and Sam Baker's roomy drums bringing things down like the last call for beer at a summer deck party. Its waltz beat also draws the album full circle to opener ""The Waltz"", which, true to its title, is a loping, three-to-the-bar tune spilling with spacey guitars and drifting vocals. In between, there's nothing to complain about, as basically everything hits homelike it should, from the Caribbean beat of ""Gold in Sound"" to the spacey piano pop of ""G Major 7"". Hence, Old Reliable. I feel a little odd implying that Kilgour is old, as he hasn't reached the point of complacency or irrelevance that the word implies, but he's been with us for quite some time, and his mark looms so large on the New Zealand music scene that it's difficult not to think of him as an elder statesman. That said, he's fully earned the tag on Frozen Orange, and anyone looking for unpretentious, laidback and solid full-length is hereby invited to check out what's made Kilgour one our most consistent performers for 25 years.","Merge Records issues the sixth solo album from this ""Old Reliable"" frontman of The Clean and veteran of the New Zealand indie rock scene.

Odessey and Oracle,The Zombies,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab4fea9e61561daa5d36/1:1/w_160/1a00fa0d.jpg,2004-08-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8959-odessey-and-oracle/,Fuel 2000,"Fractals are psychedelic. Twenty-foot-tall praying mantises are psychedelic. Wearing other people's glasses is a little psychedelic. But despite pervasive positioning as a halcyon-era psych-pop masterpiece, The Zombies' 1968 pop epic Odessey & Oracle is not so far-out. Direct, narrative threads and often simple songwriting stand in contrast to Oracle's swirling, ornate cover, crafted by a sense-dulled stoner (hence, ""Odessey""). While Odessey and Oracle is definitely one of the great rediscovered works of the psychedelic era-- an under-appreciated record of beauty and foresight-- albums like Love's Forever Changes, Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle, and even the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, expanded minds with wider sonic palettes and more daring song structures. The Zombies' four-track recordings subsist on the band's unique style and succinct composition: carefully crafted vocal melodies, bold chord changes and winding resolutions, all colored by heavenly harmonies and strings. The Zombies released just two proper albums, and, as they broke up immediately after recording Odessey and Oracle, had little impact on the pop music of their day. Time, nostalgia, and perhaps the pop critic's penchant for underdogs sewed considerable retroactive gains for our visionaries, who mined the subtleties of 60s pop and found hints of melancholy wistfulness buried beneath the more pedestrian, sunny harmonies they competed with. The band's biggest hits (""Tell Her No"" and ""She's Not There"", both from the band's eponymous 1964 debut) had cynical undertones, a trend that continued on Odessey. The album's first cut, ""Care of Cell 44"", strongly recalls the wide-eyed innocence of Pet Sounds' famous ""Wouldn't It Be Nice?"" but for the fact that the narrator's lover is, more explicitly, daydreaming in jail. Odessey's single, ""Time of the Season"", is the album's only stereotypically summer-of-love moment; for the most part, darker tones and the dramatic third person feel are ahead of the present-tense late 60s. While it wasn't exactly ""freakout"" music aimed at squares, Odyssey and Oracle is still notable for its experimental bend. The Zombies convinced EMI to let them record it at Abbey Road free of all corporate influence (read: no producers), allowing the band to indulge whatever musical fantasies they came up with. Some members of the band-- most prominently keyboardist Rod Argent-- would go on to careers in prog-rock, and seeds of that genre poke through here. The first clue is an unhealthy preoccupation with historical and literary figures, from the Shakespeare quote in the liner notes, to the Faulkner-derived ""A Rose for Emily"", to ""Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)""-- inspired by bassist Chris White's WWI obsession-- The Zombies wore over-education on their sleeves. In many ways, Odessey foretells the flowery baroque prose of 10-minute prog epics to come. Classicism extends to The Zombies' playing as well; they were formally trained musicians with overt interests in ""art music"" and jazz. More overtly, there's the sectional composition of their songs, apparent in ""Changes"", which is most emblematic of the jarring cut-and-paste thematic shifts that separated the fans from the great unwashed. This reissue, not to be confused with 1998's 30th anniversary import, is sharply re-mastered and contains bonus tracks produced and recorded by various Zombies shortly after their breakup. The bonus material is welcome, offering fascinating distillations of each member's personality, although few listeners will probably care much about the archival mono mixes and edits of some tracks. Though it may not represent the sprawling, tripped-out experimentation of their times, The Zombies' unique brand of lyric wit and daring arrangement expanded the limits of pop. Odessey and Oracle stands as the band's fully realized statement of intent, the parting shot from one of the few originals in the devolving tail-end of the 1960s.","The Zombies' 1968 classic is generally categorized as a psych-pop treasure, but despite what its cover art and legacy suggest, its complex arrangements and baroque instrumentation-- much like The Kinks' Village Green Preservation Society-- were idealized harbingers of today's indie pop. Decades ahead of its time, Odessey and Oracle is the final statement from an unfortunately short-lived band, and stands as one of the late 60s' greatest achievements.

A Tribute to Brother Weldon,Monk Hughes & The Outer Realm,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab089d034d5c69bf3f4d/1:1/w_160/b83196e3.gif,2004-07-29 05:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8882-a-tribute-to-brother-weldon/,Stones Throw,"It's tough not to love a schizophrenic genius. Changing personas like t-shirts, Madlib has produced a rich, impressive body of work, breaking boundaries and pushing his genre forward with the restless ease of a prodigy. His credentials are stellar: His jazzy, rough-edged production has been the driving force behind Madvillain, Lootpack, Quasimoto, and a slew of major hip-hop luminaries. But it's not Madlib's talent that's in question on his latest release, Tribute to Brother Weldon-- it's his discretion. It's hard to figure out who to blame for this washout. When he fell back into the Bomb Shelter studio at Chateau Stones Throw to meditate on the death of one of his heroes, Madlib was most likely experiencing less a moment of inspiration than a period of mourning. Critically acclaimed keyboardist and composer Weldon Irvine helped set the stage for the soul jazz that came to dominate seminal 70s jazz labels like CTI and Prestige, and had lauded Madlib's work under the Yesterdays New Quintet moniker. After Irvine's suicide in 2002, Madlib produced a suite of songs inspired by Irvine and his adventurous bridging of James Brown-style soul and improvisational jazz. These tracks sat for two years before Stones Throw, presumably with his blessing, released them earlier this month. Recorded under the name of one of his fictional Yesterdays New Quintet bandmates, Tribute to Brother Weldon is nothing short of baffling. These songs billow out like a nebulous cloud, thick with swirling eddies of meandering percussion and fleeting splashes of melody, but the storm never comes. Madlib is reaching for the expansive free jazz of Pharaoh Sanders and the electric funk of Eddie Harris, but without the direction provided by their blazing solos, the music just blows over. I'm still trying to pick out high points, or at least notable moments, but these sketches are too indistinct. Why he would go this murky route in tribute to a deeply lyrical soloist like Irvine is a mystery. Still, the album carries a vaguely reverential tone, as if Madlib were glancing towards the heavens for a sign yet to come. The instrumentation is diverse-- at one point or another he noodles on kalimba (thumb piano), flute (or synth?), Rhodes, and Hammond, and contributes indeterminate electronic murmurs from his reliable Roland 303. The beats he sets in motion on each track almost approach a formal structure, and technically sound great-- muffled bass drums, cowbell, woodblock, and hand drums all get a spin-- but they never fully gel or form complete melodies. A song-by-song breakdown is sort of pointless, as every distinctive glimmer flashes and is gone before settling into the consciousness, but I'll give it a shot: The blubbery analog throb of ""A Piece for Brother Weldon"" adds interesting texture, as do the song's tweeting high-end keys, and there's a brief commingling of sounds that, in a rare moment of clarity, actually make sense. ""Time"" stirs with layers of keys and organ dappled by chimes and shakers, spotlighting Madlib's gift for intriguing arrangements, but, like all of these tracks, does so without a satisfying buildup or resolution. A warm rush of bass and pitch-shifted keys opens ""Nodlew's Sea"", and its somewhat consistent, mellow mood is a welcome (if temporary) refuge. ""Welldone"" builds a narcotic haze on atmospheric effects, and the opening bass and rimshot beat of ""Keys"" shows promise but quickly reveals a half-finished idea. In fairness, any sliver of song taken outside the album's context could entice listeners, as all the right elements for an intriguing jazz record are in place. But for heads looking for beats, rhymes, or life-- even the minimalist kind found on Yesterdays New Quintet's recent Stevie album-- 65 minutes of freeform Madlibbing will likely be too much to stomach. Madlib has said of his music, ""I'm just trying to get it done and go to the next."" Studio time is for rehearsal time, basically, for someone so endlessly prolific. And that's exactly what this experiment sounds like: a rehearsal that was probably never meant to see the light of day. Fortunately, his brilliance is so formidable that even a bruiser like this one won't do him much harm. Tribute might be a chink in his armor, but Madlib is on a personal musical crusade that demands he never look back.",,5.5,
Duh Yellow Swans,D. Yellow Swans,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab1d5e6ef959693216cf/1:1/w_160/59aa0442.gif,2004-07-29 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8910-duh-yellow-swans/,CDR,"If you need to anger one of those creative types in a pinch, go ahead and politely ponder their paintings, sit through their show, or read their newest story. Then kind of lean back, take a bite of food (if available), and confidently intone, ""I don't get it."" It's the phrase surest to infuriate somebody who's spent hours in the basement attempting to pour the contents of their head into a perceptible form. And though I used to nod appreciatively for fear of seeming stupid, it's also the way I once felt about a lot of abstract, texture-based music that was presented to me-- anything from Black Dice and the No-Neck Blues Band to John Zorn, Stockhausen, and Xenakis. Without objective criteria like virtuosity, beauty, or complexity with which to judge its quality, I felt I was missing something that others could hear, some scale on which to separate works of genius from the incoherent stabs of a musician incapable of anything else. Of course, when I succeeded in relaxing and opening my mind to such music, I realized that there really is an easy scale of quality-- whether or not anything about it makes you want to listen again once it's over. I came to understand that if the journey created in such works is worth taking again, for any reason, then its value is determined by your level of interest. I offer my own revelations to clarify the compliment, then, when I say that D. Yellow Swans make sprawling, noise-based pieces, half-organized out of improv sessions, that I'm interested in hearing repeatedly. D. Yellow Swans, comprised of Gabriel Mindel and Peter Swanson, formed about three years ago in Portland, Oregon, and have recently relocated to the Bay Area. Though they began with structured experiments in aggro punk, they became increasingly interested in the results of their improvisations, and adopted a freer, textured, drone-driven sound that might just establish them as a jam-band for the Lightning Bolt set. Their music still contains elements of punk, but it's punk pried apart and splattered across 15-minute canvasses. Though they don't shy away from the abrasive, their style channels the psychedelic sprawl of Yume Bitsu as much as the feedback walls of Thurston Moore (whom they've opened for). And D. Yellow Swans are all about uplift. Their stated goal is attaining ""Freedom, Happiness, Love, and the sharing and incitement of these feelings in others. Positivity. Total Liberation."" The band's first proper release will be out soon on the Narnack label, but they've been selling the self-released Duh Yellow Swans on their recent tours and over the web. As dissimilar as certain sonic aspects of D. Yellow Swans are to Tortoise and their Thrill Jockey labelmates, such music shares a common principle of process over material-- that is, the nature of the musical building blocks they begin with aren't as important as the manner in which they're manipulated. This focus on evolution and texture, as well as a struggle to remain open to all musical directions, is what gives the pieces their sense of coherent expansiveness. In the music of D. Yellow Swans, disparate, seemingly aimless musical elements drift together and coalesce into a block of sound. Seamless transitions usher you from one place to the next, until you find yourself in an entirely new landscape. As in Tortoise's ""Djed"", the context is constantly widened, nothing beyond manipulation or reconsideration. The two nameless pieces of Duh are built out of guitars, samples, amplifier hums, drum machines, effects processors, and, when the spirit moves them, garbled screaming. They move from atmospheric drones to Boredoms-style chanting and pounding, fearless of either extreme. Duh Yellow Swans is clearly an early album from two people who are still fully learning what makes the other musically tick, but such apparent conflict gives the music a palpable feel of its creation. D. Yellow Swans are struggling to free all possibilities in playing and listening, and convert those who might not perk up at the mention of ""improvised noise."" Duh demonstrates their propensity to head any number of directions, and if they don't get too caught up in defining themselves then they'll be able to take them all at once.",,7.1,
"Chilltown, New York",Erick Sermon,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6785e6ef95969320d4b/1:1/w_160/fa62ee1f.jpg,2004-07-29 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7769-chilltown-new-york/,Motown,"For rappers, no never means no. Even when the world has duly rejected their latest reunion/remix/throwback record, few MCs ever bow out gracefully. For all you ex-retired rappers in the midst of ill-fated comebacks (cough, Ma$e), recognize the intellect of EPMD's better half, Mr. Erick Sermon. More than 15 years after the release of Strictly Business, the green-eyed bandit still switch-hits, producing and rapping on a solid hip-hop release that skillfully blends an old-school aesthetic with a Class of '04 flow. Chilltown opens with an impressive agenda. Against the dreary MIDI brass and pale keys of ""Home"", Sermon drifts from one critique to another, boasting that he's one of the last old heads yet to be snared in gilded web of commercial hip-pop: ""You won't hear the bling or the champagne. Nuttin'/ Won't hear a nigga on the microphone frontin'/ And no love songs, I'm not serenadin'/ I'm just narratin' the streets on my beat."" Without naming names, Sermon makes his mission clear: to snatch back hip-hop at any cost. Two tracks later, on ""Relentless"", he spits pure fire, volleys another diatribe against the industry, and restates his thesis, claiming to ""punish the game for its foul behavior."" What separates Sermon from his pedantic underground counterparts who hopelessly eschew the mainstream with an unwavering (and often obnoxious) conviction is that he treats his genre as a fallen and commodified art, yet still acknowledges its beauty and potential. His production credits for headliners like Jay-Z and Ja Rule may reek of contradiction but Sermon dissipates any wisp of duplicity with the Judeo-Christian credo: Don't hate the player, hate the game. Filling the Kanye-inhabited space between mainstream and underground, Erick Sermon further blurs the line by adopting the timeless ethos of sniping sucka MCs while still opening his doors to a polished commercial thump. Besides, you can't hate E-dub; he's just too nice on the mic. Sermon boasts both his production and rapping talents on ""Wit EE's"", rocking against a dancing, wood-percussion club banger and flaunting microphone gymnastics with ease. He dismisses any potential opponent with two 16-bar dynamos, rhyming each one with the song's title. On ""Chillin'"", Sermon, Talib Kweli, and Rah Digga (er, Whip Montez) deliver animated verses over sparse, tinkling bleeps and a loitering breakbeat, weaving seamlessly with each alternating verse. Sermon puts his authenticity plainly: ""I sound like me/ You sound like Jay-Z."" No doubt, Chilltown consistently delivers solid hip-hop cuts. But in comparison to his 2002 release React, Sermon's well of creativity might be running dry. For a producer who's pushed the past decade just as much as he's adapted to it, Sermon is starting to show his age. When he showcases the funk on tracks like ""Feel It"", the man can't be touched. But when he tries his hand at hip-hop soul on ""Do You Know"", he can only muster a lazy derivative with Dahlia Anderson doing karaoke Mary J. Blige. And although Sermon splits his time between New York and Atlanta, you wouldn't know it from ""Future Thug"", on which he overcompensates with greasy organs and makeshift scratching, only adding to the growing list of listless Southern bounce tracks. Still, Chilltown charts more wins than losses, giving us a taste of Sermon's home-cooked, bass-heavy goodness. Although his versatility is peerless, it's scary to thank that E. soon might not have anything left to say in the booth or on the boards. Sermon could easily drop dozens better-than-average releases until R. Kelly learns to read, but unless he finds another patent, we can only expect more of the same. Sermon's had a long, successful career: If he wants us to remember his best, he'll make Chilltown his last.","Fifth solo album from EPMD's better half skillfully blends an old-school aesthetic with a Class of '04 flow.

Something Grand,Shrimp Boat,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a679c0084474cd0c0990/1:1/w_160/8b00d03c.jpg,2004-07-29 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7770-something-grand/,AUM Fidelity,"If you're a typical indie rock fan, you probably hear that you follow obscure bands because they make you look good, because your niche tastes set you apart, and because your music snobbery won't allow you to enjoy anything that's on the radio. But you probably wish, for the one or two best unknown bands that you've discovered, that more people had heard them. A band like that never leaves behind enough recordings. They put out more home-burned CD-Rs or hand-labeled cassettes than actual CDs, score an indie label deal that falls apart one album later, and only make it into the studio by the time that their set has changed three times, leaving all the early songs in the dustbin. You know what the rest of the world is missing, but you have no proof. So I'll admit my heart went out to AUM Fidelity's Steven Joerg when he told me that he actually founded his label with the hopes of finishing this project, a multi-disc collection of music by Chicago's Shrimp Boat. And the final product is the kind of compilation that's better than the sum of its recordings. In 3 CDs (4 if you get a copy with the bonus disc), Something Grand features entirely out-of-print or unreleased material, without repeating any of the songs on the two Shrimp Boat records that are still in print. (Duende and Cavale, on Bar/None, are both highly recommended, but only offer a snapshot band's history. Something Grand documents the whole story.) Shrimp Boat remain a legend from the start of Chicago's early 90s rock renaissance, flourishing right before Billboard put the city on the map as a post-Seattle grunge factory; Shrimp Boat's Brad Wood recorded and played with Liz Phair, among others, and Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge went on to form The Sea & Cake, which includes John McEntire, who plays with all of the bands that, like them or not, make up the Chicago post-rock scene. As the root of all of these influences, Shrimp Boat is better known by reputation than recordings. The three high-minded art school students who formed the band in 1985 proudly didn't know their instruments. (That was also a requirement for Wood, a successful recording engineer who had learned the drums after the other members dragged him into the band.) The earliest recordings, which feature the line-up of Ian Schneller, Sam Prekop and David Kroll, are acoustic and shambolic, kicking off the set with the tunelessly meandering banjo on ""Rocks are Oil"", the hypnotically circular ""Collecting Me"" with Kroll's keening, inexpert saxophone, or the midget-army martial drums on ""Only Making Fools"". The songs sound exactly like when your roommate who's learning guitar finds four notes that sound great together and repeats them until you're sick, except they're great; and Prekop's slurred vocals distort the lyrics-- which, according to the Miles-Davis-box-set-quality liner notes, were mostly made up back then anyway. Something Grand also includes tape collage experiments, most tiresomely on a 12-minute instrumental that slouches across Ollie North's Iran-Contra testimony, but these art-school excesses are shunted aside by the short and deeply unpretentious songwriting that the band once described as ""Midwestern folk."" The liner notes describe the ""circle dances"" that would spontaneously start at their gigs at Phyllis' Musical Inn, where the open-faced friendliness that covered their harsh noise noodling would inspire the crowd to dance and stomp together around the bar. The first disc is full of these pieces, some better than others, and many of them come from the barely released cassettes that the band sold at gigs. The earliest Shrimp Boat shows were long, improvised jams that cleared out many pretentious loft parties, but by the time they started recording to four-track, they were writing actual songs and assembling actual sets. Discs two and three introduce them as a ""real band,"" through live recordings from clubs and college radio sets, and outtakes from their two main long-players. Duende and Cavale collected the strongest of the band's material, and discs two and three of Something Grand admittedly focus on outtakes and oddities-- Wood and Joe Vajarsky on sax unwinding with ""I Loves You, Porgy"", or experiments with the vocal tracks from ""Limerick"" and ""Oranges"". But this is more than a B-sides collection. Hearing the band evolve on these albums helps explain the wild stylistic leaps from pop to rock to blue-eyed soul on Cavale, and the concerts-- ""Medea Rising"" or ""Draught '43"", where the crowd's shouts punctuate the song-- capture the live side of the band. Shrimp Boat became clean and tight, and Prekop's idiosyncratic voice has more confidence, finessing his barks and yelps while developing the gaspy credulity and breathy wonder that dominate his style today. The real odds and sods are confined to the bonus disc, which ships with the first 2,000 copies of the set. This fourth disc includes a lot of sludgy old recordings and working tapes, as well as some strong, straightforward live cuts. Listening to this material can make you wonder: What if they had simplified the jams, streamlined Prekop's emoting and turned into the Dave Matthews Band? Or dumbed down to dirgey rock songs and fallen in line behind Veruca Salt and Red Red Meat to make a small dent on alternative radio? What would Beavis and Butthead have done with a video for ""Free Love Overdrive""? ""Chicago's Shrimp Boat are the best band on the planet,"" gasped CMJ in 1990. (And you thought Pitchfork was hyperbolic.) But before they could take over, tensions inside the band caused first Brad Wood to quit, and then the rest of the members to disband. The Sea & Cake retains the unironic pleasure of Shrimp Boat's material, but refines it to glass-like perfection on their laptop-on-the-beach albums, like last year's One Bedroom. Ian Schneller went on to form Falstaff, and build musical instruments under the company name Specimen Products. Brad Wood now produces records in L.A., and although his early work with Liz Phair-- like the barest tracks on Whip-Smart-- evoked some of Shrimp Boat's later, hazy afternoon-on-Milwaukee-Avenue laziness, he most recently got acclaim off-Broadway for producing the soundtrack to Hedwig and the Angry Inch. David Kroll quit the band even earlier, to paint, and his recent work graces the covers of this set. If this box set were a movie, it would tell your generic coming-of-age story-- except that most bands at this level never tell the whole story, except through the occasional bonus demo tracks. Something Grand is more than a scrapbook: It completes the fossil record of a legendary indie rock group, sets the trajectories for the guys who learned to make music in this band, and revives four hours of floor-beating, drunkenly whirling, homemade Midwestern circle dances.","New three-disc box set documents the early rare recordings of the pioneering mid-80s indie rock band whose members would go on to become pivotal figures of Chicago's 90s post-rock scene in bands like Tortoise and The Sea & Cake.

The Futureheads,The Futureheads,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be9c5e6ef9596932328f/1:1/w_160/041e47bd.jpg,2004-07-29 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3316-the-futureheads/,SireStarTime,"I've never understood the fascination with a cappella groups, and I doubt I ever will. To me, they represent one of the worst possible manifestations of unfettered personal expression, a noxiously cheeky release of pent-up inhibitions. I like to think my problem with these groups lies mainly with the material they perform, and isn't just some blind phobia or intrinsic prejudice, but until now, I've never had any solid evidence to back me up. The Futureheads' self-titled debut not only affirms my journalistic integrity, but justifies what is essentially a totally groundless position. While not a cappella, per se, The Futureheads are endowed with a gift for gilt vocal harmonies not far removed from that tradition, and they've just made one of my favorite pop records this year. The Futureheads aren't looking to raze any musical foundations; they've simply put their ample vocal talents in a novel context: Their record recalls nothing so much as The Whiffenpoofs and The Lemon Drops of this world, if greatly scuzzed-up and adorned by jangly guitars and ferocious drumwork. Like 70s post-punks Wire, The Futureheads show little regard for traditional verse/chorus/verse structure. Rather, they indulge in multi-section pieces that rapidly cover an immense amount of ground. The album's runtime speaks to how much they accomplish with this method: 14 tracks and a surplus of ideas in 33 fast minutes. What's more, almost the entire first three-quarters of the album is single-ready material, including an actual foray into a cappella (""Danger of the Water"") and the massively anthemic ""Carnival Kids"", one of the truly great songs I've heard in some time. The album opens with a stellar triptych of songs that recalls and even, arguably, surmounts the best work of 70s pop/punk icons The Jam and The A's. But if tracks such as the blithely anthemic ""Robot"" and the unrepentantly chorus-milking ""A to B"" smack of bands 30 years bygone, The Futureheads manage to incorporate a series of startlingly fresh flourishes into their fast-paced pop: Leadoff track ""Le Garage"" temporarily rides on stuttering martial drumming before resuming its determined stomp; the background vocals alternate between vintage punk shouts and chorused reiterations of the lead vocal line; and a three-second breakdown between the verse and chorus loops an unintelligible distorted phrase like an extended rhythmic fill Indeed, the vocals are the uncontested centerpiece here, evoking a decidedly Anglo brattiness, but the band's angular guitar/drum interplay provides an equally impressive framework, summoning a Gang of Four more interested in delivering sparkling melody. (Coincidentally, the Four's Andy Gill produced five of the album's tracks.) Here, The Futureheads prove themselves as tight as Dischord's finest post-punks, with the riffs and hooks necessary to flesh out their raw technical skill. My complaints with this record are small ones, but nevertheless detract-- if just marginally-- from its overall success. The album is frontloaded to a degree, as is the apparent protocol in these days of quotidian rock parvenus. For all its shining moments, The Futureheads would have been doubly impressive had the band cut out filler like the admittedly naive ""Stupid and Shallow"" or the melodically lacking ""Trying Not to Think About It"". Even so, I'm hard-pressed to think of many albums of this stripe from the past few years that aren't similarly spotty, right down to potential classics like Is This It or Mclusky Do Dallas. The Futureheads are at their weakest when they abandon vocal harmonies in favor of a more direct melodic approach; their greatest strength lies in their utilization of voice as a distinct melodic instrument in a loud, often strident context. Instead of affecting wanting vocals in a stylized atonal mishmash (as unskilled punk and pop/punk vocalists often resort to doing), The Futureheads rely on actual chops and the kind of melodic astuteness usually associated with piano-pop balladeers, and in doing so, they exhibit complete control over their music and intertwining vocal deliveries. Like a Greg Maddux of pop/punk, the band show an unassuming hand, but the erudite skill with which they deliver what may initially sound like run-of-the-mill concoctions is surprisingly potent and defiantly consistent. ","Like 70s post-punks Wire, British rockers The Futureheads show little regard for traditional verse/chorus/verse structure, yet still manage to come away with irresistably hook-laden songs that cover an immense amount of ground in impossibly brief periods. Riding elaborate four-part harmonies and frequently injecting unexpectedly weird segments between verses, the band prove themselves as tight as Dischord's finest post-punks, with the riffs and hooks necessary to flesh out their raw technical skill.

Blue Cathedral,Comets On Fire,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6355e6ef95969320ca1/1:1/w_160/1e055c62.jpg,2004-07-29 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1563-blue-cathedral/,Sub Pop,"All ye indie hacks dressed in psych's clothing oughta hang up your underused echoplexes and unprocessed Blue Cheer albums, because from here on in, y'all shall be measured against Blue Cathedral, Comets on Fire's blistering full-length number three. Hyperbole's a scam-- and most shameful in the voice of a seasoned critic-- but from the initial sawhorse pummeling of ""The Bee and the Cracking Egg"" to the last-gasp strains of ""Blue Tomb"", it's clear this intense collection commands a sense of largess, as well as some sort of mystically heightened language. With all sincerity, I can report that these sludge denizens have burnt-to-a-crisp every ounce of ashy acidic energy currently floating around the hazy rock 'n' roll atmosphere. Though Ethan Miller and Ben Flashman formed Comets on Fire less than five years ago, these hymns feel centuries old: Sometimes bludgeoning, always regal, Blue Cathedral is a calcified, hippified holy place. Begin your pilgrimage... Expanding the multi-textured promise of Field Recordings from the Sun, here Comets throw down even more explosive hyperactivity. Still nodding to Pink Floyd, Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Hawkwind, and the less known sounds of Monoshock, the crew lights out into its own sweaty territory. With these eight tracks, the quintet's completed an impressive transformation from crunchy garage-rock stonemasons cribbing tropes to heady, mathy enfant terribles decimating Freakout City, USA. Like Field Recordings, Blue Cathedral was recorded at Louder Studios by The Fucking Champs' Tim Green-- so there's really no explanation as to why these sounds are so stadium-sized and crystal clear. Better mics? A new dose of inspiration? More likely, it's the official addition of Six Organs of Admittance raga whiz Ben Chasny on guitar two. He'd played with the band in the past, but now that he calls himself a bona fide Comet, perhaps he's allowing himself a few more aesthetic liberties. Or maybe, just maybe, leaving Santa Cruz for San Francisco and Oakland offered differently processed water and a worthwhile change of scenery. Whatever the case, the Bay Area group's purity of intention and sound is stronger here than on any previous offering. Musically, there are a bevy of fierce rockers, occasional saxophone distress signals, blissful chill zones: The instrumental, ""Pussy Footin' the Duke"" drifts into a relaxed milky way space probe with regal organ breakdowns, tender ebony-and-ivory arpeggios, and a my-guitar-gently-weeps melodic sense. As such a title would suggest, ""Whiskey River"" features gravelly rock vocals and frolicking echoplex that twists and darts within an overhauled Southern rock template; it dissolves into the wistful ""Organ"", an anomalously brief, melancholic fit of stargazing. The spiraling asteroids of ""Brotherhood of the Harvest"" performs triumphant astronomy-- I can see the metal guys getting teary over its discordant-to-majestic ebbs and flows. The knockout punch, ""Blue Bomb"" whips up the most languidly, ecstatic opus of a career built upon such outer-realm ecstasy: Lay back and whittle acid-rock and solar boogie-woogie notations on the surface of the sun as it expands. Beyond individual tracks, Blue Cathedral is a well-curated whole: The song cycle mixes noise and rest with stops on a dime-- in the midst of a sludgy solo, a hook dismantles itself and reforms, turning repetition into mantra. Living up to their evocative name, Comets on Fire's music is loud and harsh, and despite that Miller's screamed lyrics are largely indecipherable, Blue Cathedral is surprisingly not at all difficult. Avoiding sentimentality and the weight of an overblown intellectual message, this hedonistic outing could bring fans of all persuasions together as one tinnitus-toting family: stoners, indie rockers, metal heads, classic rock fans, open-minded gutter punks, non-ironic mullet owners, and even your older sister will join hands and find some riff or virtuosic accent to hold close to their heart and enjoy. In anticipation of that inspired moment, lift up your warm brews and repeat after me: Here's to the hard rock album of the summer and the backyard barbecues it will inspire, and to uncontested tofu pups basting alongside all-beef hot dogs, forever and ever, amen.","Sub Pop debut from these chaotic Santa Cruz psych-feeders beefs up their production values to touch down as their hardest-hitting record to date. Drawing influence from Zeppelin, Hendrix, and Hawkwind, Blue Cathedral scales back the wanton experimentation of their previous albums to fire off post-Vietnam rounds of knotted feedback, monolithic riffs and outer-space jams. And perhaps its most impressive feat? At 53 minutes, it almost feels short.

Terrorbird,The Mae Shi,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c5615e6ef95969323ad8/1:1/w_160/503f8685.jpg,2004-07-28 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5599-terrorbird/,5RC,"The Mae Shi are another band that's ""influenced by all types of music, maaaan!"", but let's cut the shit: On their debut LP, Terrorbird, the Los Angeles quartet for the most part straddle that fat, comfy pummel horse between hardcore and no-wave. On one side are the yelps and screams and gymnastic bursts of mathy noise; on the other are the herk-and-jerk guitars, swishy cymbals, and funk-contorted basslines. The Mae Shi occasionally manage a song that welds elements from both genres, but for the most part devote their energy-- of which there is a ton-- to jumping back and forth between the two, often in a matter of seconds. The ultra-fragmented nature of the songs will draw contemporary comparisons to labelmates Deerhoof, XBXRX, Pink & Brown, or Brooklyn's Ex Models. More so than those bands' albums, however, Terrorbird's 33 tracks demand to be taken as a whole. Unfortunately, this turns out to be a double-edged sword. While the fragments themselves are never short on energy, they are short on substance-- Terrorbird simply doesn't equal the sum of its parts. After the quick bursts of drum noise that comprise the album's title track, The Mae Shi pull out all stops for ""Power to the Power Bite Two"", the album's early highlight. Scratchy screams fight across the stereo panning, drums play catch-up with the guitar line that taunted it in the first place, and a steady bassline does its best to hold things together down low-- until it just can't take it anymore, and must join the guitar for a unison breakdown. Two ""Revelations"" follow, beautifully smogging the album's mood after such a relatively potent pop. On ""Revelation Three"", The Mae Shi mistakenly tread some embarrassing 311 terrain, which thankfully disappears into waves of snare triplets and antsy guitar intervals. This seems to be The Mae Shi's modus operandi on Terrorbird: Brief exercises from Noise Rock 101 surround the band's more carefully composed numbers, providing a harsh contrast for the album's otherwise immediately accessible moments. That said, when these straightforward songs aren't up to ""Power to the Power"" snuff, all the guitar gymnastics comes off as talentless bullshit, drenched in noise to mask an inability to play. It happens on ""Jubilee"", whose forced recombination of plucked guitar, Casio beats, and vocal harmonies are so unintentionally out-of-tune that it makes Liars' Angus Andrews sound like a barbershop quartet. It happens again on ""Takoma the Dolphin Is Awol"", which sports a solid narrative lyrically, but musically falls back on some seriously obnoxious Rage Against the Machine white-boy funk trills. Perhaps the biggest offender is the one-two guffaw of ""Surf's Up"" and ""Testify"": After the band prove they're ""down"" with Garage Band's hip-hop loops on the first one, The Mae Shi try their best to emote and come out sounding like The Starting Line unplugged. Thankfully, the band does strike some solid gold on a good deal of Terrorbird. The straightforward discopunk stomp of ""Hieronymus Is a Dead Man""; the nervous lawnmower drum rim snapping on ""One Mississippi, Two Mississippi, Three Mississippi""; the tom-tom breaks and tambourine rattles on the minimalist Stones mock-up ""Do This""; and the deranged Sousa-meets-Les Savy Fav breakdown of ""Virgin's Diet, The Hand of Wolves"" are all seriously great hooks that keep Terrorbird afloat. The album's closing ""Repetition"" suite, despite its Erase Errata ""no-wave lite"" attitude, is at the least conceptually interesting: The suite's opening movement experiences four subsequent reincarnations, each brief but very distinct, save their common thread of the band members singing, ""We learn by repetition."" The Mae Shi end on a somber piano progression, a surprisingly mellow passage for an otherwise irate Terrorbird. While the rest of the album sometimes barely holds together, ""Repetition"" is well thought-out and still manages to be just as mean as what proceeds it-- the suite seems a good place for The Mae Shi to pick up from on their next album.","5RC issues the uneven 33-track debut full-length from these nonetheless promising Los Angeles-based avant noisemakers.

Santagustin,Tom ZéGilberto Assis,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab469d034d5c69bf3fc9/1:1/w_160/59428e12.gif,2004-07-28 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8950-santagustin-with-gilberto-assis/,Milan,"Tom Zé is a genius. The Brazilian (with a stopover in Salvador) singer, guitarist and composer has floored me over the last couple of years with records like 1972's Se o Caso é Chorar, 1973's Todos os Olhos, 1976's Estudando o Samba and 1978's Correio da Estação do Brás-- all featuring his buoyant, idiosyncratic songs and peculiar takes on traditional Brazilian folk music. In the early 60s, he made a name for himself among musicians by performing with icons Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil in Salvador, playing in musicals, which led to the lot of them being courted by RCA as solo artists. Yet, despite a background in both folk and classical music, Zé's music was virtually ignored outside of his peers. Though his first solo LP was released in 1968, it wasn't until David Byrne issued a greatest hits set in 1990 on Luaka Bop that Zé received anything close to his due. In fact, for much of the 80s, Zé was retired from music, working as a gas station attendant for his nephew. Byrne had Arto Lindsay supply info on the all-but-lost composer, and over the course of the 90s, Zé was transformed from obscure cult figure into revered songwriter, rightly placed alongside his early collaborators Veloso and Gil. I can say that I have yet to hear a bad record by the guy, including his 90s comeback albums Hips of Tradition (1992) and Fabrication Defect: Com Defeito de Fabricao (1998). Strike that. I have yet to hear a Zé record that wasn't pretty great-- and in light of Animal Collective's recent Brazilian odd-ysseys, now is as good a time as any to seek out one of the country's original outsiders. Santagustin finds Zé returning to his roots in theater, as he teams with composer Gilberto Assis to provide music for the ballet troupe Grupo Corpo. Ballet? Yes, but check it: It's got homemade answering machine IDM, discordant guitars and flutes with ""Tom Sawyer"" drums, non-discordant guitars and mandolins that will appeal to the same sect of Brazilian music lovers who dug Sung Tongs, guys and gals going, ""Gee-ahhh, oh-way-oh-way, oh-waaayyy!"", and lots of pitter patter Brazilian percussion. Apparently, Zé based his music on the ideas of Christian philosopher Saint Augustine, though to read a translation of his comments in the CD booklet is to enter a convoluted world of whimsical theory: ""The technique of inducing a controlled infection in order to produce an antidote is well known. In this instance, through controlled error in the tonal functions we create a ferment ranging by degrees between rage and inoculation."" It goes on like this. Fortunately, most of this (wordless) music is its own reward. Opener ""Marco da Era"" begins as a cold, repetitive cell-phone ring, moving subtly into tones from other phones and eventually morphing into micro-beat electronica. The high pitches and digital precision sound closer to Mille Plateaux than Bahia, and when the messy splatter of brass that ends the piece hits, I wonder if I somehow managed to insert the wrong CD. However, ""Ayres da Mantiqueira""-- with synth-flute, off-key whistling, pizzicato plucking and counterpoint of acoustic and electric guitar-- betrays Zé as the heart of this music. Likewise, the bouncy, classically tinged ""Nogueira do Monte"" sounds practically lifted from one of Zé's mid-70s LPs, with immediately distinctive guitar figures and a vocal melody fit for restless kings. ""Pixinguim-Rasqueira"" also features a Zé trademark of short, wordless vocal accents like ""oh!"" and ""ah!"" used as percussive thuds and pings, amid more intricate acoustic guitar arpeggios and bizarre horn lines sounding part of a demented circus orchestra. Throughout the CD, there is a faux-chamber orchestral feel (which gets the better of my interest on the fairly tedious ""Ciro-Gberto""), though its best moments are invariably the bubbliest and most infectiously catchy. I wouldn't recommend anyone start with Santagustin as an entry into Zé's music, but fans will easily pick out the joyous, eccentric strains of his stuff.","Revered Brazilian singer/guitarist returns to his roots in theater, teaming with composer Gilberto Assis to provide music for the ballet troupe Grupo Corpo.

Lovers Need Lawyers EP,The Good Life,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bffb13d197565213b994/1:1/w_160/5eb0386c.jpg,2004-07-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3645-lovers-need-lawyers-ep/,Saddle Creek,"The Good Life is Cursive bandleader Tim Kasher's side project. At least, that's how it began. ""Side project"" implies something peripheral-- a catchall for fallout from the main band's songwriting process, an opportunity for collaboration and stylistic deviation (e.g. The Postal Service or Gorillaz), or a lower-profile testing ground for experiments that might besmirch the reputation of the primary project. Often, side projects are like the aberrant pieces that well-known writers publish in low-circulation literary journals, or genre fiction published under a pseudonym. But sometimes, they accumulate gravitas until it's difficult to qualify them as side projects, unless the term simply describes a band the artist formed while already in another band, which seems fatuous. The Shins, for example, began as a Flake Music side project, but we'd hardly consider it one now. With a volume of output that nearly equals Cursive's, a solidified line-up, and a feeling of completion that amplifies with each release, The Good Life have made the transition from side project to independent entity. This wasn't always the case. The first Good Life album, Novena on a Nocturn, was a prototypical side project-- a record of fluttery boudoir ephemera; remnants scraped from the mental sieve that caught whatever grains of song wouldn't sift into Cursive's oeuvre. But even then, The Good Life was more than Cursive's rough drafts, with an emphasis on starry ballads and minimal electronic embellishments. The second Good Life LP, Black Out, saw those appended beep-tracks insinuated more deeply into the songs' spinal columns to become structurally integral. Its recurrent ""Black Out"" motif and intricate dynamics lent it a ""front project"" feel, yet it was still distinguished from Cursive by its splintered, percolating electronica, and a guitar sound that bent toward the stadium anthem more than dissonant, prickly hardcore. Lovers Need Lawyers, a teaser EP for the new Good Life full-length due out in August, is ballasted by both of Kasher's constant themes-- the inevitable failure of romantic relationships and the futility of art. And it downplays the importance of its electronic trappings, focusing on verse/chorus dynamics in a manner that approaches traditional guitar rock and indie pop. ""Leaving Omaha"" opens the disc with melancholy strumming and Kasher's tormented version of twangy arena rock, teetering on the brink between restless road song and jaded hometown elegy. ""Entertainer"" exemplifies his ""beat them to the punch"" mentality. ""I'm not an artist, I'm an asshole without a job.../ Making money off of calling myself out,"" he sings, the harsh sentiment jarringly juxtaposed with a swinging, peppy melody. There's a cognitive short circuit built into these lyrics: Like Dave Eggers' Heartbreaking Work, every sin of solipsism or over-self-consciousness of which the author might be accused is admitted to (therefore forgiven?) in advance, and the effect is like looking at an object between opposing mirrors, infinitely regressing into complete metaphysical abstraction. The title track yokes Ray Manzarek keyboards to choppy guitar chords and Kasher's wheedling plaints. And ""Friction!"" is an unexpected bleat of punk rock amid all this sardonic Americana, its ardently screamed chorus emphasizing the tossed-off, bone-tired quality of the other songs. It may seem as if a record that leaves the listener feeling so vaguely apathetic and depressed should deserve a lower rating, but the music is well-composed, and we must rate it according to what it sets out to accomplish, which seems to be to pummel us into jaded submission. On that score, it succeeds admirably.","The side project of Cursive's Tim Kasher is quickly evolving into its own self-sustaining entity, as this teaser for the band's forthcoming third album attests.

A Strange Mess of Flowers,Davíd Garza,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bffaabf31b7dc71563b6/1:1/w_160/e48bbf15.gif,2004-07-28 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3644-a-strange-mess-of-flowers/,Wide Open,"Like almost every grassroots artist who's done time in the trenches, Texas-bred, Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Davíd Garza has two histories. The first and generally accepted history, chronicled on albums, in press materials, and in magazine articles, goes something like this: A very young Garza started playing Deep Ellum bars before he was old enough to get past the bouncers, opening for local and national acts. He played with the lamentably named acoustic band Twang Twang Shock-A-Boom before striking out on his own. His first two albums, Eyes Wide Open and Culture Vulture were bubblegummy mishmashes of ebullient pop music, jam band rhythms, and occasional Tejano flourishes and were popular on the college circuit during the early '90s. Around the time his non-local fans were graduating and earning their own disposable income, Garza abruptly switched styles on the leaden Blind Hips in Motion, whose most redeeming aspect was that it led directly to his major-label debut, This Euphoria, on Lava/Atlantic. Despite falling off toward the end, This Euphoria-- especially the single ""Discoball World""-- captured the more motional style of his early recordings without losing any imaginativeness. After relocating to Los Angeles, Garza sat in with the likes of Jon Brion, Rhett Miller, and Fiona Apple at Largo and occasionally in the studio. Though his second major-label album, Overdub, earned a spot on The New York Times' top ten albums of 2001 list, the record didn't fare well commercially, and recently, he was cut loose from Atlantic. If that history tells a linear story of artistic development and frustration, A Strange Mess of Flowers, Garza's first release since the dissolution of his major-label contract, documents a very different story-- one less dependent on industry machinations. From 1990 on, Garza has been recording prodigiously and assembling songs onto unofficial albums and EPs that he sells at shows and through his website; it's a not-unheard-of practice, but it's perhaps the one constant in a career seemingly defined by restless musical nomadism. A Strange Mess of Flowers collects 71 of these rare tracks over four discs and one DVD. Some are early versions of songs that saw official release on proper albums, but most of them are commercially available for the first time. Longtime fans will be fascinated; first-time listeners may be intimidated by the bulk of material. What makes the collection more than just another catch-all comp is its organization: Instead of ordering the tracks chronologically or as they appeared on the original albums (which would have been intriguing, although less rewarding), Garza shuffles them all together, in no discernible order. As a result, A Strange Mess of Flowers gently reinterprets his decade-and-a-half career, revealing the similarities between his myriad styles and sounds. Beneath this immense shuffle of songs lies a career that has evolved dramatically over 15 years, from bouncy pop to more sonically inventive dance-inflected grooves. To a large degree, it's the difference between songs developed on stage and tracks developed in the studio. His early material, like ""Conmigo"", ""Butterflies"" and ""My Sister"", possesses an exuberance derived perhaps from the need to entertain audiences impatient for headliners. His more recent material has a very different energy, perhaps born out of the confines of the studio. But he never lost his strong sense of melody, his ululating vocal style, or his penchant for clever lyrics (""If you're looking for that blind love/ Mine's deaf and dumb, too"" from ""Your Sister's Leopard Coat"") and biblical imagery (""She parts the oceans like she parts her hair"" from ""Jezebel Grin""). If his early material occasionally sounds saccharine, his more experimental stuff can tax listeners' patience, and some of his 2003 L.A. sessions-- especially the KDRN tracks-- are much too conceptual to be rewarding to much of anyone other than him. A Strange Mess of Flowers erases the straight line of evolution from early to recent material, setting songs from every point in his career side by side and creating fascinating parallels and intersections between them all. If Eyes Wide Open and Overdub sound almost irreconcilably different, the tracks from those periods meld nicely here, complimenting each other in surprising ways and revealing the consistent human voice and imagination behind them. For instance, ""Neva"", recorded in 2003, shuffles along on staticky production and Garza's murkily intoned verse, as if trying to shake a postmillennial dread through lyrics that reference Radiohead, Autechre, and The Heartbreakers. It's immediately followed by ""Butterflies"", recorded 13 years prior, which marries organic dance rhythms and major-key melodies to verses about hopelessness and betrayal. Played back to back, the former brings out the sour lyrics behind the latter's upbeat melody, while ""Butterflies"" highlights the strange two-part structure of ""Neva"" as well as the low-key rhythmic progressions that churn against Garza's voice. With each listen, A Strange Mess of Flowers posits new juxtapositions, so that it seems to mutate over time, never a set thing but always challenging the listener's ear. To an extent, the collection is a triumph of sequencing, which excuses throwaway tracks and half-baked ideas because they play so well against the more solid songs. As a result, it never sounds like history disinterred, but history reinterpreted and revised: the culmination of an intensely creative career that makes most sense when heard out of order.","Four-disc box set from this Californian singer/songwriter documents the non-album side of his career over the course of 71 tracks spanning 15 years.

Let's Make Our Descent,The Waxwings,by: Stephen M.

Similar to past releases like Low to the Ground, the group's third album, Let's Make Our Descent, is certainly worlds removed from the rougher sounds emanating from Motor City-- it may be just as nostalgic, but then, it's also far more poppy and polished. Context, however, is everything: Outside the Greater Detroit area, The Waxwings are blandly indistinct, a single-A ball club in a major-league playoff. There's a by-the-numbers quality to Let's Make Our Descent, as if the band had a checklist they were trying to fill: Hooks and guitar riffs that are catchy, but not catchy enough that you'll be humming them the rest of the day? Check. Moderately clever lyrics that occasionally stumble (""Your hesitation's like a telescope, girl/ And I can see that you are looking low too low"" promises a punchline it doesn't deliver), but never fall hard enough to derail the song entirely? Check. Guitars that sound agreeably rough and textured, but not quite loud enough to piss off the parents? Check. The problem isn't that The Waxwings play retro garage-rock; it's that they play such obvious retro garage-rock. For a genre that defines itself so completely by the past, their influences are unfailingly nebulous: They have a vague mission to play 60s rock qua 60s rock, as if all they need is a general idea of what it sounded like. What's more, whenever they get near a sonic touchstone, they usually make the most blatant choices (The Kinks, The Who, the Stones, et al.), effectively derailing the record on premise of playing it too safe and rarely (if ever) taking any musical, imaginative, or emotional risks. Let's Make Our Descent isn't atrocious or embarrassing, but neither is it exciting or memorable. For bands like The Waxwings, only the dubious pantheon of obscurity awaits. On the other hand, perhaps context is everything: Maybe today's also-rans will be tomorrow's Nuggets.","Detroit garage-rockers attempt to live up to their city's oily rep, but never rise above mediocrity.

Utopia,Murcof,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c560c0084474cd0c3720/1:1/w_160/e410f1d4.jpg,2004-07-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5598-utopia/,Leaf,"Fernando Corona is a producer from Tijuana who is one of the central figures in Baja, California's Nortec Collective. He started by releasing Matmos-ian traditional Mexican cut-ups as Terrestre, and in 2002, he debuted with the album Martes under the name Murcof. Along the way he's remixed, cut vinyl as the mastering engineer for the Static Discos label, and scored the independent film Nicotina. He's a busy guy with a lot of talent, this Fernando Corona. Remember the name. With Martes, Corona took fragments of 20th Century classical by composers like Morton Feldman and Arvo Pärt and combined the tense arrangements with micro beats. It was an interesting record with an unusual sound, but it wasn't ultimately great; something about the loops and repetition of Martes didn't seem to gel. Corona's conception called for freedom and openness, music unconstrained by the snap-to grid. For that we would have to wait another 18 months. The 12-inch single ""Ulysses"", released earlier this year, delivered completely on Martes' promise and immediately built anticipation for the next Murcof full-length, due by the end of 2004. On both ""Ulysses"" and the B-side ""Urano"", Corona ditched samples to write and record his own charts, melding percolating minimalist beats with his subtly dissonant and open-ended phrases for strings. On this CD, Leaf has rewarded those without turntables by compiling the two tracks from the ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, two previously unreleased tracks, and seven remixes of material from Martes. Beyond the exceptional ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, both unheard tracks here are good but sound like holdovers from the Martes sessions. ""Una"" loops and chops a short section for strings and sets the melody against an undercurrent of catgut groans and plucks. It's like a duet between two instruments from the violin family-- one set to play ""music"" and the other focusing on ""sounds."" ""Ultimatum"", which foregrounds the drum programming and uses bits of piano and violin more as seasoning, is probably the funkiest track Corona has released as Murcof. The remixes are mostly strong, with the two best coming from familiar names. Jan Jelinek's ""Der Abschied von Dawson City Mix"" of ""Maiz"" is an excellent meeting of the minds that finds Jelinek using clipped fragments of plucked violin and double-bass slides for his own jazzed-up rhythmic ends. Deathprod's take on ""Ulysses"" leaves little of the original identifiably intact, but creates the kind of vast, doom-laden half-speed drift that will be instantly familiar to those familiar with his excellent Morals and Dogma. Colleen's mix of ""Muium"" is inspired and imaginative, as Cécile Schott burrows deep inside the original track, emerging with handfuls of individual notes that are stretched into drones and reassembled into weird melodies. On the beat-friendly tip, Sutekh's ""Triasgion mix"" of ""Memoria"" is highly danceable and driving techno infested with squirming samples pushing in several directions simultaneously, while fellow Nortec Collective member Fax (Ruben Tamayo, not Pete Namlook) offers a dubby and comparatively warm take on ""Maiz"". Fernando Corona's distinctive stamp is clearly affixed to every note of his originals, so his music lends itself to the remix treatment.

Light Is Calling,Michael Gordon,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bff913d197565213b991/1:1/w_160/cc11d5ad.jpg,2004-07-27 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3643-light-is-calling/,Nonesuch,"Michael Gordon is one of the founding members of the Bang on a Can ensemble, who, for over a decade, have concerned themselves with injecting the vitality and relevance of popular forms into the world of modern art music. Such attempts have ranged from embarrassing to completely gripping, and Gordon's work has usually fallen on the positive end of the spectrum. His newest release, Light Is Calling, is an endeavor to join electronic influences with his distinctive style of shifting polyrhythmic structures. You'd be right to approach such an attempt warily-- many modern composers' hybridization of strings and electronic production can give listeners too little credit, or sound like a bookish recluse's attempt to hang with the cool kids. It can be especially cringe-inducing when an aging composer ""discovers"" modern electronic equipment and genres, demonstrating only a basic knowledge of drum 'n' bass and ending with a product that in no way gets it. Michael Gordon avoids these pitfalls, enlisting the contributions of electronic musicians/producers Luke DuBois and Damian LeGassick as well as Ethel quartet violinist Todd Reynolds, and their collaboration has resulted in an accessible work that remains uncompromising in its subtle complexity and is a truly coherent meeting of styles. While the album isn't completely consistent, it achieves at its best moments a totally strange and unheard beauty. The cover photo of Light Is Calling is taken from a short movie by filmmaker Bill Morrison (included as a Quicktime video on the disc) for which Gordon provides the soundtrack. Morrison's short was made through the process of reshooting decomposing black and white film, and the result is a dreamy, melting, light-drenched scene that could very well be occurring within the technicolor woods on the cover of Tortoise's It's All Around You. The aesthetic of Morrison's film is inexorably intertwined with many of Michael Gordon's pieces, and is key to understanding the album's intent. Both image and music act as meditations on memory and the warping effects of time, the beauty of decay, and the role of an outdated romanticism in the present day. In the movie, we watch a decomposing film reel of a soldier who meets a mysterious woman in the woods. Gordon provides the sounds of a quartet playing time-warped instruments against a bent metallic background-- the innocent beauty of a silent-film soundtrack attempting to break through the rusty barrier of years passed by. Its particular conjoining of electronics and acoustic instruments calls to mind Gavin Bryars' seminal work ""The Sinking of the Titanic"", in which echoes of the ship's famous string quartet resound from the depths of the ocean floor. Most pieces on Light Is Calling take a similar concept as their genesis, offering the sounds of dead genres being dusted off and made to run their course through all the complications of the present day. Light Is Calling establishes its thesis in the opener ""Tinge"", a track that echoes the unfettered dramaticism of Björk's Homogenic years, where orchestral hits and a Vivaldi-esque violin section are tempered by a winding found-sound percussion loop and plodding bassline. Measures of brilliant strings drop in and out of the following piece ""Instrumental"", offering some of the greatest moments of beauty on the album as it blurs the lines between live instrumentation and manipulated samples. Gordon falters with overblown sections of dissonant disco in ""My Frig"" and ""Receiver"" that upset the careful balance he achieves elsewhere of melodrama with musical humility and reservation. But the album regains its footing in ""Idle"", a piece that successfully enters the dangerous territory of world-folk influences and emerges a surreal, hypnotic interlude. While the varied influences in each track of Light Is Calling are apparent, the result is an admirably focused and specific realization of an original aesthetic concept. Like most Nonesuch releases these days, this album's design is beautiful, and here, the art and music conjoin to present a fully unified work. The facade of decay is as integral as the past itself in the art of Gordon and Morrison, transmitting the glow of distorted memories and ache of the past's inaccessibility.","Neo-classical solo release from this member of NYC's Bang on a Can collective echoes the unfettered dramaticism of Björk's Homogenic years.

Kiss & Tell,Sahara Hotnights,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3375e6ef959693205ce/1:1/w_160/24811414.jpg,2004-07-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6969-kiss-tell/,RCA,"2001's Jennie Bomb portrayed Sahara Hotnights as a scrappy petty theft street gang. Their pug faces smudged and newsboy caps on backwards, Mouth (Maria Andersson), Muscle (Josephine Forsman), and those grudge-holding sisters Jennie and Johanna Asplund (they never forget a face!) searched the crowd for rubes and never stepped down from a fight. ""Alright Alright"", ""On Top of Your World"", ""Fall Into Line""-- the Swedish quartet rocked with backs to the wall, as though they'd miss the blindside left hook if they didn't strip their music down to the gristle. Her little gang could be stuffed in the back of a squad car on the way to the clink and Andersson would still be flailing, fists clenched, and trying to kick out the windscreen. Between 2001 and 2003, she and the Hotnights strengthened their grip. They kept turning up on countless Hives and Mooney Suzuki support slots; they put a lot of sweat through vintage tees; and they proved to the naysayers that they weren't a novelty. And yet, as powerful and legit as they were, Sahara Hotnights still had an identity crisis. Hate to say I told you so, but in the U.S. at least, a combo of foxy Swedish girls playing flinty rock 'n' roll puts dollar signs in the dead eyes of A&R; flacks. Luckily, the band's big-time debut doesn't feature any Dianne Warren writing credits or Matrix-like makeovers. Kiss & Tell might be ridiculously catchy-- the perfect package for a world where chicks with attitude rock the Maybelline-- but it's still based in reality, and serves the band's strongest statement yet. Whereas Jennie Bomb never took its fist out of your face, Kiss & Tell leaves room around its hardened core for engaging subtlety. Opener ""Who Do You Dance For?"" crackles with Fender swagger, but incorporates a 50s sock-hop chorus and slight new-wave overtones. ""Hot Night Crash"" is a great example of the old ""puttin'-our-name-in-the-song"" trick, but it's also a chance for the band's frontline to lean into their mics. Andersson's lead vocal is typically fork-tongued-- a hybrid of jab and come-on-- but the backup vocals of guitarist Jennie Asplund and bass playin' sister Johanna are cleverly done and just as forceful. In its punchy production and eagerness to mix hard rock with boppy little guitar leads and cheeky catchy choruses, Kiss & Tell is a direct throwback to that fertile crossroads between thickheaded 70s AOR and the pop/new-wave nexus of the early 1980s. The thumping shoulder blade shake of ""Mind Over Matter"" and ""Empty Heart"" recall Pat Benatar, or the sharp angles of Tom Petty's ""I Need to Know"". The handclaps, buzzing bass, and Tandy 200 guitar of ""Stay/Stay Away"" are concealed deep within the record, as a little gift to those that stay the course. ""The Difference Between Love and Hell"", too, appears out of nowhere at the bottom of the lineup with one of Andersson's most appealing vocal turns and another wily amalgam of tinkly chorus keys and a wiry verses. Is this an old Police album? Does that guitar remind me of Rick Springfield? Where's my rayon sport coat? All these questions and more are answered by Kiss & Tell. But the record's greatest feat is balancing expertly between mainstream accessibility and validation for the Hotnights themselves. It's a ballsy doll revolution.","Major label debut from these Swedish garage-rock girls one-ups their previous releases with totally 80s-drenched throwbacks to Rick Springfield and Pat Benatar.

Riot on an Empty Street,Kings of Convenience,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbaeabf31b7dc7155b45/1:1/w_160/fcf0c8df.jpg,2004-07-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4450-riot-on-an-empty-street/,AstralwerksSource,"No, your copy of Riot on an Empty Street is not defective. Electro-pop fans who've followed an AMG breadcrumb trail from Erlend Øye's fantastic DJ Kicks set and loop-heavy solo album to his work with Kings of Convenience can now quit flooding the label's switchboard with complaints and concerns: Nobody accidentally left the beats off your copy. Even listeners familiar with the Norwegian duo's whisper-folk back catalog may be jarred by this pristine and peaceful Riot; the three-year interim between this album and Quiet Is the New Loud spawned both a deconstructing Kings remix album and Øye's DJ booth sojourns, so it would make sense that some of that dancier material might have found its way into the Kings' sound. But it was not to be: The group's third full-length finds the pale Nordic singers with the library voices puttering past the intergalactic autobahn onramp to re-immerse themselves in their Simon & Garfunkel collection, effectively warding off any potential infiltration of Øye's popular moonlighting excursions. Riot on an Empty Street leads off with an evocation of musical solace: ""Homesick"" tells the tale of a sales clerk falling in love with ""two soft voices blended in perfection"" on a found tape-- a bit of meta playfulness, perhaps, as the Kings' sound itself sends critics scrambling to thesauri in search of ever more extravagant ways of describing the band's Charmin-like quietude. Throughout the album, the duo justifies this practice by cloaking their reposeful, melodious-- nay, even mellifluous-- sound in almost uncomfortably intimate production. Microphones are positioned millimeter-close to mouths and guitar bells, picking up every string vibration, finger squeak and glottal pop. The zoomed-in sound may be intended to add some intensity to the album's drumless opening and closing tracks, but Øye and Erik Glambek Bøe's stiff English pronunciation and obtuse lyricism (maybe ""Surprise Ice"" is just a Norwegian thing?) still make for paper-thin bookends to the album. The Kings' sound doesn't begin to grow roots until the end of ""Know How"", where their bossanova-tinted folk builds to a sing-along with guest vocalist Leslie Feist. The four songs that follow add a support structure of polite percussion, which provides a soft rhythmic backbone upon which the duo builds a richer sound: Psychedelic strings buttress ""Sorry or Please?"", while doubled piano lines and pizzicato plucks underscore ""I'd Rather Dance with You"". Of course, Riot might have left a bigger impression if that last song title had served as the album's mission statement; the only dancing appropriate to most of these 12 tracks is a slow sway while sitting Indian-style. Indeed, the Kings of Convenience would do well to assimilate more of Øye's electronic leanings into their original sound, rather than merely mining sad troubadours past for inspiration and leaving these tracks as sparse source material for the obligatory remix album. Only ""Love Is No Big Truth"" appears to take a hack at translating a club bangah into the Kings' delicate language, combining an insistent bass drum, crisp little electric guitar figures, and banjo to construct a passable folk-bred techno. More experiments of this sort would help the Kings of Convenience update their harmonies-and-fingerpicking sound for a modern world, rather than continuing to exist as a museum piece profiling musicians who like ""The Boxer"" way too much. It would also build a bridge to listeners drawn in by Øye's extracurricular activities but who might not be willing to make the leap to as rhythmless an environment as is found in most of Riot on an Empty Street. Should the duo ever decide to cut out the professional remixer middlemen and create the hybrid sound their backgrounds suggest, Kings of Convenience might finally become the rare 6am comedown band that actually sounds like it recorded during this century.","Following the breakthrough success of Erlend Øye's phenomenal DJ Kicks, as well as his more dance-oriented solo material and a Kings of Convenience remix record, it would make sense for this hushed Norwegian folk duo's new album to move towards the electro realm. Rather, Riot on an Empty Street stands by the duo's famed motto-- ""quiet is the new loud""-- and sends home another round of Simon & Garfunkel whispers and strums.

Not Exotic,Dolorean,by: Stephen M.

Which, all pretensions aside, is a pretty apt descriptor for this Oregon band's debut full-length, Not Exotic. Their atmospheric indie folk plumbs the depths of everyday despair in nine tracks whose narratives and narrators suggest a short-story collection set to music. These songs are heavy on lyrics, but light on instrumentation: only a little livelier than Low and neither as exotic as Pinetop Seven nor as tranced out as Bedhead. Usually, the songs feature just an acoustic guitar, shuffling drums, and a quiet piano accompanying Al James' plaintive vocals, but when the band's feeling crazy, they throw in synths or a quietly burbling organ. Almost as a consequence, the songs have an unhurried slacker's pace, a walking tempo. ""Morningwatch"" sets the tone early, as James identifies himself with ""those of us who cannot sleep/ Just because of things we've done."" The songs that follow depict acts of physical or emotional violence, ineluctable catastrophes that create crippling regrets in his characters. There's the adulterer in ""Traded for Fire"" who runs from his sins, praying, ""Don't let me settle down in a small northern town to die."" A woman withholds a dark secret from her lover in ""Still Here with Me"", although it takes it toll: ""And you kiss like a corpse,"" James sings, ""and you smile like a crow."" On the blandly Gothic murder ballad ""Hannibal, MO"", a small-town mechanic confesses to killing his college-bound true love. Fortunately, James has the good sense to imply the narrator's regrets instead of stating them directly: ""Her father says he'll shoot me down if I don't do it myself."" A poet before he founded Dolorean, James traffics in a self-conscious brand of indie verse, full of gentle pretensions and casually evocative imagery. For example, in the town of Hannibal, Missouri, ""where the Mississippi turns flat and wide/ We'd lay out on the sandbars and fall asleep to the barges and the fireflies."" Both his writerly and his physical voice meld together nicely, coasting on the last word in each phrase and drawing it out lazily to something halfway between a conspiratorial whisper and a resigned sigh. For every just-right line, though, there's another in which James' lyrical approach is either too much or not quite enough. The rest of ""Hannibal, MO"" is so conversational in tone that it sounds clunky: ""Summer was ending and she was leaving soon to study writing on the East Coast."" Even set to the rueful melody, this line jambs against the others, and despite the nearness of betrayal and death, the song never breaks its patient tone, its unexcitability undercutting-- rather than conveying-- its deep regret. On the other hand, the jaded ""So You're a Touring Band Now"" contains a pointed commentary on the life of a musician: ""My friends are knives that cut out my tongue/ No songs and no beats no words left to speak, just utters and grunts,"" he sings. ""Drive 10,000 miles just to tear off your arm just to play the guitar and recite a poem."" The sentiment-- that the life of a small-time indie rocker can quickly corrode your self-worth-- sounds achingly autobiographical, but James overstates it almost to the point of abstraction. As its title suggests, Not Exotic has a modest goal: to spare no pain as it ferries listeners from one morningwatch to the next, with as little fuss as possible. Perhaps a little more fuss would have made the journey more memorable.","Oregon-based band's atmospheric indie folk plumbs the depths of everyday despair in nine tracks whose narratives suggest a collection of short stories.

Never Bring You Pleasure,Tangiers,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72f9d034d5c69bf3723/1:1/w_160/29e40594.gif,2004-07-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7935-never-bring-you-pleasure/,Sonic Unyon,"The pop vernacular has always stretched to accommodate loads of dumb misnomers and meaningless subdivisions. Blame toothy marketers waving one-sheets or all that clunky/obsolete record store signage, but the tension between dynamic, varied artists and their one-dimensional nametags has rendered even the most basic genre classifications meaningless. ""Punk"" and ""rock"" surrendered most of their borders years ago; now watch as their respective subspecialties are bastardized into comparable uselessness: Check, especially, the ""garage-rock"" revival of yesteryear, and the piles of contemporary bands that were mercilessly pummeled into the archetype, without ever actually embracing any of the genre's gnarled, boxy traditions. Tangiers, Toronto's snappy, t-shirted response to The Strokes (and little brother band to The Deadly Snakes), were instantaneously filed as revivalists (see: outfits, hair), and subsequently forced to prepare for the dismissal that almost always follows a sudden, unchecked press explosion. Still, it all seemed sort of stupidly unfair: Despite having been preemptively lumped in with a whole mess of nu-garage outfits, Tangiers were always a party band, more easily likened to Richard Hell & The Voidoids than The Troggs or Paul Revere. Now, following up their excellent 2003 debut, Hot New Spirits, Tangiers are dealing with more than just being misunderstood by overeager CD-sorters: Guitarist Yuri Didrichsons and drummer Marco Moniz bailed last year, cracking the original lineup and leaving remaining members (singer/guitarist Josh Reichmann and singer/bassist James Sayce) to reassemble Tangiers. Recruiting former Guided by Voices drummer Jon McCann and keyboardist Shelton Deverell, Sayce and Reichmann shouldered the songwriting duties and plowed ahead. The resulting record, Never Bring You Pleasure, is a squirrely, bouncing homage to the Rolling Stones, with stacks of pert guitar riffs and plenty of lusty vocals. Like a more convincing Hot Hot Heat, Tangiers play sticky rock music that demands some kind of leg-kicking; Never Bring You Pleasure is a raucous, jerky combination of punk guitars and brash disco flourishes, a majestically danceable update on staid rock traditions. ""I Don't Love You"", with its deadpan verses and howled choruses is a hook-heavy, VU-indebted bit of bratty swagger, easily capable of tackling the college charts (or snatching some bored Franz Ferdinand fans); opener ""Love Rackets"" is all blips and strums, with Reichmann and Sayce trading off vocal duties over McCann's frenzied stomps. Never Bring You Pleasure is a surprisingly cohesive album (Reichmann and Sayce only penned one song together, mostly writing these tracks independently), a loving, unexpected reinvention that still manages to cash-in on all that misdirected hype.","Toronto garage-rockers best most of the States' overexposed hypes with this squirrely, bouncing homage to the Rolling Stones.

Melatonin: Meditations on Sound in Sleep,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a824b1335d7bf16991f0/1:1/w_160/e0ef2933.gif,2004-07-26 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2050-melatonin-meditations-on-sound-in-sleep/,Room40,"It's 3am on a Sunday. My world is quiet, my room is dark and I am dreaming. There's a parade of old acquaintances and vaguely familiar places proceeding through my head, but it's a jumbled parade, a plotless, random idea stew. Most of my dreams are like this. I'm standing on a sandbar in Tampa with an inflatable raft under my arm one moment and when I turn around I'm looking at the linoleum floor in my parents' kitchen. Old friends show up in incongruous dress or strange places, and I intuitively know what they're saying, even though I can't hear a thing. Since high school, music has been a huge part of my life, creatively as well as from a listener's standpoint, and the possibilities of sound fascinate me to no end. But in my mind's most purely creative state-- dreaming-- there is no sound, and never has been. This has always puzzled me. Why would I be missing such a big part of myself in my dreams? It's now 12:23pm, later that same Sunday. I'm making my way through the two imposing discs of Room40's Melatonin compilation, which bills itself as a collection of ""meditations on sound in sleep."" Coincidentally, my cats are sacked on their pillows, and I'm not holding up so well myself. I've been tired a lot lately, and for about 20 minutes, I experience this music through that half-wakeful haze that inevitably accompanies a dozing session. Seems appropriate. I should hasten to point out that I'm not falling asleep out of boredom. Melatonin is a beautifully realized concept, and the sequencing is near flawless, allowing disparate pieces of music to sit naturally beside each other, the brief-to-nonexistent silences between tracks contributing greatly to the flow. Aside from the general theme of the compilation, the artists involved were given a great deal of freedom to interpret their mandate as they saw fit, and their pieces head in several different directions. Chris Watson, Stephen Vitiello and Philip Samartzis all work with field recordings, though each takes a different approach. Samartzis doesn't embellish his slice-of-life recordings with a lot of chopping or looping, instead letting them speak for themselves as he edits tape of what sounds like a street market opening in the morning, a rowboat ride and church bells in a random, dreamlike and pointedly non-narrative sequence. Watson, whose contribution opens the first disc, molds his insect masses and birds into neon choirs, while Vitiello follows with a piece that weaves its found sound through with mild drones that morph into near-melodies as they become more active. As one might expect, several artists go the purely ambient route, crafting enveloping soundscapes, often with timbres that are hard to source. Ai Yamamoto's ""Dreaming of Swimming in Emerald Green Water"" is quite beautiful, surrounding a harmonium drone with crystalline intonations that together form a bell-like texture. Oren Ambarchi's minimal guitar piece ""Stormy Weather Part II"" is a picture of restraint, while Pimmon's drones billow like an approaching cloudbank. The deep, dark tones of DJ Olive's ""Yard Swing Sunrise"" sound like the surface of water looks, while Frost's ""Svartifoss"" might be a direct transcription of Jimi Hendrix, as heard through three feet of solid ice. Several artists take a much more active approach to their songs, with David Toop and Scanner providing the two nightmare tracks. The voices that rip through Toop's ""Hypnogogmatist"" sound as though they are literally tearing the fabric of sleep, particularly the one that opines, ""At night this theory made sense to me, but now I can't understand it."" Scanner's piece is inhabited by disembodied voices as well, but his foundation of shivering piano is by far the most profoundly creepy thing on the entire set. Meanwhile, Janek Schaefer's closing piece, ""Love Song"", layers voices singing the word ""love,"" the natural waver of the participants' held notes and the random nature of their combinations and recombinations swaying the piece back and forth between unnerving dissonance and comforting harmony. Steve Reich would be proud. On the more rhythmic end of things, John Chantler turns in a tight slab of found-sound jazz, his plinks and pings congealing into a fitful beat as electric piano chords hum softly in the background, as though oblivious to the beat but nonetheless in time with it. The only other thing that approaches the rhythmic drive of Chantler's contribution is DJ/Rupture's ""Heart Murmur"", gathering various scrapings on bowed instruments together over a percussive swoosh that approximates a beat as a panicked man yells, ""Are we shooting people?"" The sprawl of these two discs almost offers too much to really cover effectively in a review, but it bears mentioning that along with all of the standout tracks, there are a few clunkers thrown in. Some, like Timeblind's ""Lust"" (it got more interesting when a prop plane flew over head, mixing with the texture) and Steinbruchel's ""Feder"" are simply too static, while others, like Martin NG & Tetuzi Akiyama's ""Silver-Brown"" are strikingly unpleasant. ""Silver-Brown"" has some interesting minimal guitar passages, but the sine waves that layer on top are just rude, like imposed tinnitus. On balance, though, a grand total of about five dissatisfying tracks on such a large set is hardly a death knell, and Melatonin is mostly a resounding success. As an added bonus, it also offers a fantastic microcosm of most of the trends in 21st Century ambient music in its running order, offering many distinct takes on the genre, with a few well-placed detours breaking things up. It hasn't helped me get to the bottom of my silent dreams, but Melatonin still sounds plenty good when I'm awake.","The experimental electronic label Room40 offers this beautiful 2xCD collection of dreamsongs from DJ/rupture, Oren Ambarchi, Scanner, DJ Olive, David Toop, and others.

The Village Green Preservation Society,The Kinks,by: J.H. Tompkins,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb55e6ef95969322c94/1:1/w_160/8f8d696e.jpg,2004-07-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4457-the-village-green-preservation-society/,PyePye,"It takes a Village Green Preservation Society to love The Kinks. The problem facing The Kinks when they released The Village Green Preservation Society in late November 1968 wasn't merely the competition-- Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, Led Zeppelin's debut, and the Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet offered plenty-- but that this subtle, funny, surreal, and at times almost tender record could have been recorded on another planet. During the summer of 1968, stateside fans were hooked on a high-intensity diet that had them jonesing for aggressive, overstated fare like ""Street Fighting Man"" and ""You Shook Me"" and ""Communication Breakdown"". The disconnect between The Kinks and the rock world's rapidly narrowing palette could hardly have been more pronounced. Compare the Stones' bombastic, urban ""Sympathy for the Devil"" with understated work like ""Village Green"", bouncing along like a horse and buggy as Ray Davies paints the landscape: ""Out in the country, far from all the soot and noise of the city..."" Critics praised the album, the public ignored it, and Davies-- surveying the scene-- asserted that it wasn't created for public consumption. Intentions aside, The Kinks simply moved on, leaving small knots of fans to pledge secret allegiance to Village Green. However, as years passed and the weather changed, its following grew, and finally, one day, the verdict reversed and the album was touted as a masterpiece. Ironically, it might have happened sooner had the band not been so prolific up through the late 80s. Intricately sketched and brimming with unusual arrangements, The Village Green Preservation Society was the first clear look at an iconoclastic, imaginative and sometimes brilliant artist as he came into his own. Audiences used to sizing up work on a scale created for rock gods and counter-culture icons were forced to consider this album as a piece of conceptual art. The Lennon-McCartney/Jagger-Richards duos towered over and shaped the sensibilities of a vast army; Davies explored a deeply personal world that confounded fans even as it provoked their curiosity. There's a clue to who he was in the song ""Animal Farm"", which opens with a cascade of chords played on a warm, acoustic 12-string, the folk music staple once used on songs like the Rooftop Singers' 1963 hit ""Walk Right In"". Davies' opening lines, forced to share space with the tongue filling his cheek, are a mouthful. ""This world is big and wild and half insane/ Take me where the animals are playing,"" he sings, raising the Union Jack, while looking back through the chaos of the day to find a simpler, safer world. The peculiar sensibility that first raised its head on 1965's Kinkdom with the hit singles ""Dedicated Follower and Fashion"" and ""A Well Respected Man"" looks different in light of The Village Green Preservation Society. Before the latter album was released, those songs seemed like parody or blue-collar humor; in retrospect, Davies was showing a quirky, iconoclastic hand that would soon be more relevant to his music than the hard-rocking ""You Really Got Me"". It's also interesting to consider Village Green as a carefully sculpted product of Ray Davies' singular artistic vision. The album is commonly regarded as having the feel of solo work, and if this is a matter of opinion, the songs are singular enough as to probably make collaboration difficult. More than that, at a time when rock instrumentalists were beginning to stretch out, The Kinks' playing here always serves the songs, and Davies' vocals in particular. By 1968, as the prevailing rock idiom tended to position music as an armored vehicle ready for battle, Davies did his best work with a quiet, ironic smile. The album-opening title cut begins with a simple groove built around acoustic guitars, over which Davies offers a bend pledge of allegiance to the mundane curiosities of modern life; in ""Do You Remember Walter"", he reminisces, perhaps as a geriatric adult; and on ""Last of the Steam Powered Trains"", he borrows and bends the first few bars of Willie Dixon's ""Spoonful""-- an ode to the miseries of heroin. The Village Green Preservation Society has been declared the band's masterwork in some quarters, and I'll agree-- if only because my favorite Kinks album, built around ""You Really Got Me"", ""All Day and All of the Night"" and ""Tired of Waiting for You"", has never been released. Even so, the album had received proper recognition long before the release of this three-disc set, which repackages the original album and adds a slew of extras: Bonus tracks are here in spades, along with a collection of period studio noodlings and a separate mono version of the entire LP. Of course, while the special presentation does include a few interesting pieces-- looser non-album tracks like the humorous ""Mich Avery's Underpants"", ""King Kong"" and ""Wonderboy"", while hardly worth the price of this set, offer added insight into the album's sessions-- it's mostly padded by mono mixes that would be of little interest to anyone but the staunchest archivists. As such, disc one, the original album expanded with four bonus tracks (including a knockout version of ""Days"") provides the real meat: 36 years after its first release, The Village Green Preservation Society, loaded with so much imagination and possibility, stands more than ever as a vital work, and as one of rock's first classic, one-of-a-kind albums.","Though widely disregarded at the time of its release, The Kinks' 1968 apex, The Village Green Preservation Society, has had a profound impact on the present state of indie rock. Now, Sanctuary reissues the album in an expanded 3xCD box edition, compiling every song recorded during its sessions, restoring the original artwork, and fattening the package with extensive new liner notes.

Their eponymous debut retained an epic minimalism, a micro-rock melancholy that even in its stainless steel production radiated a fleshy, clear-eyed warmth. Voiceovers from local MC Young Churf lightened the tone and hinted at the group's guarded B-boy predilections, but were so incongruous they could've been smarmy indie-isms. So to snuff any doubters, Ratatat's two lone gunmen, guitarist Mike Stroud and beatsmith/producer Evan Mast, essentially plundered the HOT 97 playlist and laid down fresh instrumentals to back a grip of vocal tracks from some of rap's biggest hitmakers on this new tour-exclusive release. The band's source material sends an instant message: They proudly indulge in the mainstream, and for the most part, spurn any artists who might cast a shadow of underground elitism. (Even Dizzee Rascal, a somewhat exotic phenom in the States, gets radio play in the UK.) Along with crossover heroes like Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Missy Elliott, 50 Cent's G Unit and a host of Wu alumni appear. The ominous thug melodrama is curious-- I have a hard time envisioning two skinny white kids personally relating to the desperate urgency of ""Run"", Ghostface Killah's panicked rant with Jadakiss. But such is the voyeuristic, class-spanning pleasure of modern hip-hop, and the gospel organ grind that haunts the track, or the gothic piano tiptoe on G Unit's ""Stunt 101"", keep them dark and deep. More than the rappers themselves, the production of the original tracks must've appealed most to Mast's hip-hop sensibility. Ratatat's glitchy metallic rhythms lean heavily toward the syncopated sci-fi bounce of platinum rap architects, and for that reason the remix's potentially risky stylistic collision actually works. Mast's sparse, intuitive production and Stroud's teetering guitars slide in beneath the vocals, slyly replacing the original big-balled crunk with lustrous geek funk. Coming early in the mix, Missy and Timbaland's ""I'm Really Hot"" blazes with staccato bass and murmuring synths, proving the power of this album's worth of dedicated tinkering. Later, Elliott's ""Wake Up"" false-starts with a similar one-count beat before heading into glazed emo-hop territory. Jay-Z's booty serenade ""Sunshine"" receives similar understated treatment, led by a prog-rock bassline, handclaps, and folded layers of guitar. Somewhat surprisingly, the more aggressive, lyrically heavy tracks fare just as well as the floor-fillers-- though it must be said that extreme volume will be required to rock the party with these mixes. Raekwon's ""Smith Bros"" surfs an ominous broken beat rumble, while ""Cutting It Up"", his pairing with Ghostface, gets razor guitar licks and creepy keys. Like Ratatat's debut, these tracks are unified by a common instrumental format that mediates their mood and somewhat limits their sound. It seems Mast and Stroud have honed in on their grand vision and are meticulously refining it on tape. But if it's a work in progress, it's still entertaining-- there's only a couple missteps along the way. A disappointing amputation of Dizzee Rascal's ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"" suffers from a trembling bassline where a seismic blast used to be, and a throwaway freestyle from Lazer Life of obscure around-the-way crew/ODB homies Brooklyn Zoo quickly goes nowhere. Even as the band comes remarkably close to distilling the musical essence of hip-hop, their crossover appeal is a one-way street. Fans of Ratatat's original material will naturally flock, but only a handful of Wu acolytes and radio-rap lemmings will catch whiff of the project, and of those that do, even fewer will find their way past the lack of trunk-bumping bombast to pick up the subtle gravity of Ratatat's inspired revisions.","Ratatat's first self-released CDR plays into the mashup craze, as they back a cappella hip-hop tracks by Jay-Z, Kanye West, Missy Elliott, G-Unit, Ghostface and Dizzee Rascal with their guitar/electronics fusion.

Backstroke,Matthew Dear,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb585e6ef95969322bbd/1:1/w_160/7393a3e3.gif,2004-07-25 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2527-backstroke/,Spectral,"Every morning, Detroit tech-house artist Matthew Dear has to wake up to the painful realization that, for the rest of his career, he might never again release anything as good as ""Dog Days"". This is hardly a slight to Dear-- ""Dog Days"" just happens to be one of the most irresistible house numbers to come out in years, and the song casts a long, pitch-black shadow over the rest of his work. Even Dear's 2003 solid debut LP, Leave Luck to Heaven, which tried to keep ""Dog Days"" tucked away until the sixth track, ultimately suffered from this emergent disparity. Dear definitely feels the pressure. After Leave Luck to Heaven, he tried his best to match the hook and energy of ""Dog Days"" with the feisty 12-inch single ""Anger Management"". The fractured acid-house groove had just as much energy as ""Dog Days"", but lacked Dear's breathy vocal hook, relying instead on the warmth of the synth sounds themselves. B-side ""Future Never Again"" fared similarly with gorgeous high- and low-end production, and from the release, it seemed that Dear had decided to forgo the ""Dog Days"" formula entirely and instead to concentrate on this very exciting warm acid-house approach. Dear's abrasive debut Kisses EP as Audion only fortified this expectation, the 12-inch bearing the faint hint of a denser, club-friendlier Pan Sonic. Given this trajectory, Dear's new Backstroke LP comes with two surprises: For one, Dear relies much more heavily on his vocals to carry the songs than before-- more than half of these tracks prominently feature his vocals. What consciously results are Dear's first pop songs, most of which make recourse to traditional verse/chorus/verse structure. The other surprise is more frustrating: Dear's instrumental tracks are remarkably flat. They hardly match the energy of ""Anger Management"" or Kisses, let alone Dear's fantastic earlier EPs. What's worse, since the instrumentals come between the vocal tracks, an otherwise exciting Backstroke suffers from some serious drag. The torrent of noise that delays opener ""Another"" for over a minute finally gives way to a pulse of timid synth straight out of Warp's back catalog. Dear updates the line halfway through with a bubbly glitch treatment, but given the line's fragility, he can't do much else with it, and the song stagnates. Dear himself must have realized this about ""Another""; in fact, the vinyl release of Backstroke pulls it from the tracklist altogether. Percussion sounds on ""Tide"" fire off and recoil while Dear snakes a simple but gargantuan bassline and some twitchy guitar action into the mix. By the time Dear enters in verse with modest reverb, the song's chorus is about to take over: The guitar drops out, and Dear's catchy nanny-nanny boo-boo potshot (""I don't care 'bout you anymore"") is closely followed by a trail of deadened vocals, used to bewilderingly great effect. Unfortunately, what life ""Tide"" manages to breathe into Backstroke is enervated by ""Takes on You"", a seven-minute instrumental that boasts the precision of Kompakt but none of its heart. Dear won't reclaim the listener's rapt attention until ""Grut Wall"". Here, Dear contrasts trench-deep but well-defined low-end with bright clicks, while a tired bee-like buzz flutters between the two. Shortly thereafter, the song's colorful electric piano melody-- perhaps a sinister counterpart to Jurgen Pääpe's line on ""So Weit Wie Noch Wie""-- settles in for good. ""Grut Wall"" would have killed even as an instrumental, but Dear's exorcised vocals send it rocketing up to meet ""Tide"" as an album highlight. After ""Grut Wall"", Backstroke becomes particularly disappointing. ""I Know Howser"" is Dear's lazy attempt at schaffel-pop; the possibly tongue-in-cheek ""Huggy's Parade"" is an undeveloped, infantile ""Dog Days"" rehash; and there's not much to say about ""Good Girl"" other than that it's just fucking terrible. Thankfully, the album's epic closer, ""And in the Night"", redeems some of the album's second-side sins. Though definitely out of place on Backstroke-- it sounds more like an overloaded Happy Mondays than the minimal house approach to which Dear primarily subscribes-- its storm of horns, keyboards, bell sounds, and tape hiss work quite well behind Dear's multitracked vocal melodies. It's unclear if ""And in the Night"" marks a new direction for Dear or just a fluke, but it stands as one last reminder here of how much Dear is capable as an artist. In this sense, Backstroke could become even more of a burden to Dear: The album makes it strikingly clear when he's dead on, and when he's miles off.","Tech-house hot boy's second full-length for Ghostly International's Spectral Sound imprint fails to reach the peaks of his previous 12-inches and debut full-length.

The Eye of Every Storm,Neurosis,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b973c0084474cd0c25f6/1:1/w_160/ddd29118.jpg,2004-07-25 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5903-the-eye-of-every-storm/,Neurot,"""The eye of the storm."" An interstice of calm at the tempest's center, the inert hub from which radial spikes of chaos erupt. It's a formulaic metaphor that requires little explanation. However, it's important to remember that clichés only become clichés by possessing a measure of intrinsic truth, a universal resonance that warrants their overexposure. That innovation is not the last word in achievement is a fact often overlooked in appraisals of value. The transmission of a heritage can be more aesthetically fulfilling to some listeners than a new permutation of aural components. The unrequited love poem is a cliché, yet we continue to read and write them. The bildungsroman narrative arc is a cliché, yet countless novels and films continue to potently employ it. Cognition is binary: The human desire for novelty is twinned with an equally imperative desire for continuity. All this is important to remember vis-à-vis Neurosis, who've been refining their formula for complexly symphonic disharmony over nearly two decades, and have won a legion of dedicated fans who wouldn't change a thing. The Eye of Every Storm. I see what they mean, but have a hard time connecting the concept to this record. There are periods of respite within the maelstrom, but these are so tense and tightly coiled that they still imply an unabated cacophony. The quiet intervals don't impart the sense of fleeting tranquility one associates with the eye of a storm, and soon enough, the tortured, elongated riffs continue to topple ruins, uproot trees, move mountains and evaporate seas. Some records lull, some kick ass, others rock; this one simply lays waste. Mad Maxian, apocalyptic badlands music, death metal puked out at one-quarter speed and interleaved with weirdo folk interludes. This is the fourth Neurosis record that Steve Albini has produced, and it's well-suited to the man who used to notch his metal plectrums and sing about Kim Gordon's panties. Albini's method of pristine sound separation within a metallic, murky overall aspect fits The Eye of Every Storm like a leather scabbard over a broadsword (caveat: unlike more palatable-for-cynics, epic noise-rock bands like Zeni Geva, Neurosis records contain the ghosts of clattering twenty-sided dice). The primal percussion and piercing feedback of ""Burn"" gives way to a sinuous, snake-charming lead and the guttural assertion: ""You lie in the snow/ Cold but not dead."" The song is soon complicated with proggy guitar aerobics and sub-surface detonations, gaining intensity until it threatens to sunder load-bearing walls and bring the house down around your ears. ""No River to Take Me Home"" starts slower, guitars ebbing in staticky pools beneath the ominous vocals, with a central section of quietude (is this the elusive eye? I do not feel calmed) that is sharply juxtaposed with the reemergence of trudging drums and massive guitars. And the title track's eerie alien spacescape is 12 minutes of modulated drones, shifting minor key(board)s, and some of the album's less shredded singing. If every storm has an eye, Neurosis' latest psychic thunderclap must follow suit. They just neglected to commit it to tape. It's not that there aren't quiet parts; it's that even in their midst, there's no sense of diffused tension. If there is an eye to this storm, it can only be the hole in the center of the CD-- undeniably there, but gallingly inaccessible and remote.","Metal-sludge masters find renewed vigor after 2001's disappointing A Sun That Never Sets, with Steve Albini again behind the decks.

Cosmic Cleavage,Busdriver,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a400ea9e61561daa4ddc/1:1/w_160/84a05f3b.gif,2004-07-25 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1032-cosmic-cleavage/,Big Dada,"As an emotional defense, density beats machismo hands-down. Nobody can see your weak spots if you move too fast and deluge them with so much verbiage that the Freudian slips and incidental confessions are hidden by the onslaught. Busdriver talks about the trials of L.A. life, divorced parents and bad breakups, but he slides on without a pause; the listener's too busy with the form to feel the content. He changes the subject before you can even give him a simple, ""That's a bummer, dude."" Listening to a Busdriver album is like getting rhymes out of a fire hydrant. That's not a criticism: His hyperactive flow and hyperarticulate assertions are pure pleasure, and so is his delivery, where he's made leaps in technique since his earliest CD-Rs. He stomps and sputters in (mostly self-)frustration, and his stentorian voice lurches in tempo and pitch; one minute he gulps his lines like a fish, the next, he spits out lyrics like nails. Humor and vivid disgust weave together in his lyrics, which are convoluted and cliche-free: ""Falling in love in L.A./ Is like being pricked with a manicured thorn/ Innocent girls who look like they used to star in amateur porn/ One financial disaster, an exotic dancer is born."" And the intensity comes and goes. His rant at his ex on ""She-Hulk Dehorning the Illusionist"" is hilarious (""Somehow I've weaved the myth of a decent person around your good looks""), and becomes world-class caustic even before he hits the kiss-off: ""You have a playful fetish of having your anal crevice rammed in by a four-door sedan full of football players."" Producer Daddy Kev sticks to jazz breaks, from swing to stride to cool to modern, with drumming that propels Busdriver's stumbling tempos, and raunchy horns that mimic the swing of his third leg. Though the dustier breaks bring up unwelcome echoes of ""Lucas With the Lid Off"", Kev rarely leans on his sources for nostalgic ear candy. Dig the way he turns the upright bass into a throbbing, almost electronic pulse on ""Beauty Supply and Demand"", or the way he fits the burlesque of the title track to the gutter-probing lyrics. With no breaks or gasps for air between the tracks, Cosmic Cleavage is Busdriver's tightest, most consistent album. But it might not be the best starting place for new listeners. It's not as obviously clever (or corny) as his collaboration with Radioinactive and Daedelus, The Weather, and it's harder to penetrate than his full-length debut, Temporary Forever. One of the most effective tracks on that record was a tape recording of Busdriver freestyling at the order booth of a fast food drive-thru. From the passenger seat, we got to hear Busdriver take a breath before he went back to be the life of the party again. Without rests like that, Cosmic Cleavage has the whirlwind ""watch what I can do"" pace of an EP, and as it reaches the final track, the density threatens to make it collapse on itself: The thudding, slow bass guitar and jabbing keyboards melt into a hot mass, and Busdriver drops out altogether. Like that scene at the end of The Black Hole, we're trapped by the gravitational pull-- what'll we find on the other side? The meaning of life? The answer to our voyage? God?-- but when we break through to the end, all we get is a titty joke sampled from an old Seinfeld episode. Busdriver, you got away from us again.","Having made waves in underground hip-hop with The Weather, his acclaimed collaboration with Radioinactive and Daedelus, Busdriver returns with beatmaker Daddy Kev on his tightest, most consistent album yet.

Arabesque,Korekyojin,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc36abf31b7dc7155c82/1:1/w_160/bd245eb4.gif,2004-07-25 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4580-arabesque/,Magaibutsu,"Dinosaurs: On the Discovery Channel they get big crowds, but in music they're usually given the fossilized bum's rush. I've never completely understood this. Weren't dinosaurs streamlined models of evolutionary efficiency, perfected over millions of years into refined predators, environmentally friendly herbivores and the sleek ancestors of birds? Well, yes, but they had the misfortune of being selected for extinction and having their good names applied to bad stadium rock and lumbering, progressive rock sideshows. It's easy to slander Boston and Emerson, Lake & Palmer as obsolete cousins of the brontosaurus because it's funny, and there's a kernel of truth in the notion those bands were designed to fail; their best tunes were 6-minute studio concoctions that relied on you being either drunk, stoned or acutely drawn to unremarkable frontmen. Still, to buy into standard rock-crit ideas of ""dinosaurs"" is to assume the only worthwhile thing those old lizards ever did was die. Over the last 20 years, Japanese drummer and composer Tatsuya Yoshida (Ruins, Koenji-Hyakkei) has made a point to disprove this idea, resuscitating various species of lively dinosaurs. His Ruins duo hijacked hardcore punk with the intention of bringing the savage theatrics of France's Magma, Italy's Area and Sweden's Samla Mammas Manna to an audience beyond the usual dark, clinical corridors of prog. Those three influences-- all particularly rare and exotic species-- would indicate Yoshida's penchant for obscure beasts, but his Korekyojin trio (also featuring Bondage Fruit guitarist Natsuki Kido and Altered States bassist Mitsuru Nasuno) reveals a more bloated collection of fossils: Led Zeppelin, Yes (circa Relayer, no less) and Rush. Yet, ever the organized paleontologist, Yoshida cleans and polishes his bones, removes the excess mud and clay, and constructs aggressive, razor-sharp skeletons of intimidating beauty and concision. Arabesque is Korekyojin's second album, and betters their 1999 self-titled release on John Zorn's Tzadik label. The tunes are more focused, generally forgoing Yoshida's tendency to either splatter songs with chaotic improv or maddeningly acrobatic ""melodies."" Make no mistake, these guys flaunt their shit-- check the locked-in fireworks of ""Freestone"", especially Kido's virtuoso funk-inflected lines, or Nasuno's ridiculously dexterous bass work on ""Quicksilver""-- but it's the kind of shit that, believe it or not, actually gave a prog a good name for a short period in the early 70s. And for good reason, as Arabesque could school any number of modern ""brutal prog"" acts (cf. Lightning Bolt, Guapo, Flying Luttenbachers) on how to string together 12 disparate sections into a 5-minute tune and not have come out a) disorganized, b) disjointed or c) too fucking insane to listen to. Furthermore, Korekyojin is an all-instrumental project, so if you were holding out on this camp until they got the vocals under control, your ship has come in. The title track busts out the Zep riffs right off the bat, and where Ruins would just as soon sour the punch with all manner of screeching histrionics, these guys pounce like brawny assassins all over you. Yoshida's drums are big and spacious, like they had to reserve a symphony hall just to get the right reverb on his China. You better believe he's a dinosaur. ""Counterpoint"" rams it all back home with a guitar riff born from ""Immigrant Song"", but allowed to zig and zag through Yoshida's head until coming out a raptor of a decidedly more violent, sadistic bent. After a particularly muscular bout of group improv (again, check the bass), the trio lands on another Zep-informed riff, though this time it's ""Dazed and Confused"" gone Bartok. Ai-o! There are a few calm pieces on Arabesque (particularly the Eastern-tinged ""Presage"", about as pretty a piece of music as Yoshida has ever released), but Korekyojin's main appeal lies in their abilities to rawk as calculating carnivores and make even their ad-hoc moments seem bound to perpetual forward momentum. Mind the claws.","Japanese drummer and composer Tatsuya Yoshida (Ruins, Koenji-Hyakkei) teams with Bondage Fruit guitarist Natsuki Kido and Altered States bassist Mitsuru Nasuno for another round of stunningly precise psych-prog insanity.

"Seven New Songs of Mount Eerie / Two Songs 12""",Mount Eerie,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c55cea9e61561daa81b7/1:1/w_160/f8c820e4.jpg,2004-07-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11784-seven-new-songs-of-mount-eerietwo-songs-12/,Department of Safety,"Being a Phil Elvrum fan is torture. Since the remarkable one-two punch of It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water and The Glow, Pt. 2, the boundlessly imaginative singer/songwriter has seemed to intentionally evade the indie rock spotlight, offering vague explanations for his unpredictable actions and flooding the market with limited-edition releases under the Microphones name that more often beguiled than intrigued: Blood and Little Bird Flies into a Big Black Cloud, two handmade 12-inches, featured alternate versions of existing tracks sandwiched between curious sound experiments and song fragments, while the 2002 compilation Song Islands compiled the band's seven-inches and other unreleased material. In 2003, at the height of this deluge, Elvrum released Mount Eerie, the long-awaited official follow-up to The Glow, Pt. 2. It would be his final studio release under The Microphones guise: a daunting concept album on which the man and his guitar played a diminished role amidst waves of atmospheric noise not far removed from the spotty material that had dotted his odds-and-sods compilations. Here, Elvrum also took a backseat vocally to the album's many players, whose extended vocal turns and character acting made the record's belabored plot a difficult listen for many fans. Shortly after that record's release, Elvrum announced plans to disband The Microphones altogether. Lacking the grand public unraveling of a full-on crash-and-burn, the move couldn't help but feel somewhat anticlimactic: As excellent as It Was Hot and The Glow were, they were also terribly irresolute, and left Elvrum's legacy uncertain; the records, perhaps for their epic scale and overt ambitiousness, seemed to promise that even greater material could be in store-- for Elvrum to pull the plug just as he began to gain real momentum was a monumental letdown. That was nearly two years ago. Rather than hunkering down in the studio with a new cast of players, Elvrum has since played vagrant, embarking on circuitous touring spells, here and there dropping the odd sketchy detail about the studio endeavors and future plans of his new group, Mount Eerie. With any forthcoming debut perpetually ""in-very-early-progress,"" it has lately seemed that this band's priorities lie on the road, and that Microphones fans might never receive the satisfaction of a worthwhile successor to The Glow, Pt. 2. Alas, those Anacortes-based deviants thought they could hide their clandestine labors from us. Mais non: After a year of honing new material in concert, nine tracks have officially made it to tape. Two new studio releases-- the Seven New Songs of Mount Eerie mini-LP and the Two Songs 12""-- document a transitory year for Elvrum and his horde, as well as the devolution and distillation of a persona and sound. Given a proper studio treatment (and an additional year of practice), Mount Eerie are far more engaging here than on this year's lukewarm Live in Japan. Unsurprisingly, the organic, close-mic'd sound posited on that collection has been reined in by Elvrum's masterful studio touch, allowing the music to retain an unaffected, live-performed spirit without ever sounding sloppy or unfinished. Additionally, the advent of a live band has enabled Elvrum to reconcile two contrary elements of his erstwhile output: a penchant for epic experimentation and a deep understanding of the moving commonality of simplistic folk tunes. Together, these elements coagulate into some of Elvrum's finest moments to date. The bulk of new material is found on Seven New Songs of Mount Eerie, which provides an impromptu mission statement for a band that's still yet to release a debut full-length. Featuring a half-dozen apparently complete songs, the EP essentially amounts to the meat and potatoes of a Microphones full-length. His presence previously scarce amongst indulgent asides and meandering experimental one-offs (The Glow, Pt. 2 featured only a handful of what can be considered true pop songs), Elvrum has nowhere to hide; his vocals are the focal point of each song, tip-toeing timorously but unfailingly alongside the accommodating instrumental mix. The minute-and-a-half of delicately strummed chorus guitar melody that opens ""Wooly Mammoth's Absence"" is just about his longest downtime on the record. After the brittle, unassuming prologue, Elvrum enters, double-tracked and wontedly demure-- and it becomes immediately apparent that nothing much has changed. He coos and mumbles his familiar confessions, but there's still something ineffably engaging about his verses. Elvrum remains a magician of the mundane, and the underlying candor of his compositions still sets him apart from his contemporaries. But as striking as he is, Elvrum's not acting alone. In fact, because these records are greatly stripped down from The Microphones' dense, studio-abetted sonic milieu, Mount Eerie's members are arguably more invaluable to Seven Songs and Two Songs than The Microphones collective was to Elvrum's previous work. Flitty and vulnerable, Elvrum constantly threatens to dissolve into tape hiss (especially fragile is the somber ""With My Hands Out""), and his lo-fi orchestra is all that's there to buttress him. Fortunately, the players are up to the task, ably facilitating Elvrum the way his own amorphous textures once did. Rarely, on either disc, does the band assume a starring role (the anachronistic psych-rock of ""November 22nd, 2003, 4:45 PM"" is a glaring exception), but their knack for balancing Elvrum's intimacy with an unobtrusive sturdiness is notable. On Two Songs, they bear an even greater burden, seemingly attempting to simulate expansive Elvrum epics such as ""The Glow"", to somewhat inauspicious results. The eleven-minute-plus ""Fuck the World"" shows a more brazen, even somewhat stylized Elvrum. Mount Eerie are dependably tasteful, by turns subordinate and arch, but the song is altogether too dour to sustain its imposing length. Elvrum's frustrated lyrics occasionally permeate the orchestral mix, stauncher than usual. At one point, he seems even to risk breathlessness, belting in a steady stream, ""If you think that going camping will undo a long life of slow dying, then go ahead and go camping."" Similar moments of uninhibitedness dot the nine-minute ""Do Not Be Afraid"", which ends with a blissfully defiant chorus. But overall, Two Songs is no match for the better moments on Seven Songs. If the group could somehow reconcile the cut-loose emotionality of the former with the musical appositeness of the latter, Mount Eerie could potentially strike a very winning alchemy. If Elvrum's minimal aural finagling has bridled the fragmentary orchestra, so too, then, have Mount Eerie harnessed the unpredictable Elvrum. The two are seldom less than a boon for one another, and their collaboration promises to be fruitful. Whether there's another ""The Moon"" or ""The Glow"" waiting in the wings remains to be seen, but these records are clearly the fodder Microphones loyalists were yearning for, and cast a faint beacon of hope that Phil Elvrum's best years may yet lie before us.","Now recording under a new name, The Microphones' Phil Elvrum assembles a Microphones-like crew for his first studio releases since 2003's enigmatic Mount Eerie. These tour-exclusive offerings-- the first, a mini-LP featuring seven new songs; the second, a 12-inch showcasing two tracks spanning 20 minutes-- together total more than 45 minutes of new studio material, and should please fans offput by his last outing's inscrutability.

Circa: Now! +4,Rocket from the Crypt,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a293c0084474cd0c0091/1:1/w_160/75077d67.gif,2004-07-22 05:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6813-circa-now-4/,HeadhunterCargoHeadhunterCargo,"Rocket from the Crypt's Circa: Now! was the band's sophomore album, originally released by Cargo/Headhunter Records in 1993. You'll recall that, in the early 90s, major labels seeking to emulate the runaway success of Nirvana were signing every promising indie band they could get their hands on, and Rocket from the Crypt's distinctive blend of meat-and-potatoes rock, raging punk, tattooed and pomaded greaser style, and kitschy Americana must have fit the bill. Interscope took the bait, and the record was a minor hit, garnering college and commercial radio play, and even MTV videos for ""Ditchdigger"" and ""Sturdy Wrist"". But the circumstances of the signing remain shrouded in mystery, as RFTC has an odd propensity to fill their press releases with apocrypha: The band hilariously claims to have signed to Interscope for $70 million, and sold the label the rights to re-release Circa: Now! for an additional $32 million, which reveals RFTC as an ambitious band that doesn't shy away from a publicity generating hoax here and there. And who could blame them for doing whatever it takes to separate themselves from the horde? Allegedly, Interscope asked RFTC to record four new songs for their re-release of Circa: Now!, but got tired of waiting and released the record with its original tracklist intact. Regardless of whether this is fact or another red herring, it's certain that there are four never-before-released tracks on Swami's reissue (hence the ""+4"" in the title). The original and bonus tracks have all been remastered from the original quarter-inch transfers, and profit from the hi-fi yet dirty tone. As Circa: Now! +4 is an early album in a long and storied career that's seen the band amass a devout cult following (as well as for frontman John Reis' other projects, the seminal post-hardcore band Drive Like Jehu and its modern scion, Hot Snakes), it lacks the polish and realization of vision displayed by later albums like the Interscope-funded RFTC, but is solid nevertheless, and resolutely pointed in the direction RFTC would eventually take: distorted, sneering vocals; deep licks of pummeling bass and revving guitars; and brassy saxophone flourishes galore. Drony and propulsive at once, with more midtempo swagger than can be found on their amped-up later fare, Circa: Now! +4 might even be preferable to the more refined later work to listeners who like to take things a little slower. Circa: Now! +4 opens with ""Short Lip Fuser"", a deviation from the prevalent loud/soft dynamic of its grungy era. It's just fucking loud, a sonic embodiment of the screaming headache I'm nursing as I write (occupational hazard: why couldn't I be reviewing Low today instead of Chris Ott?). It's a dramatic and pace-setting start, with a raw-boned opening riff that gradually accelerates through a morass of feedback to find its counterpoint and lock on to the marshal cadence of the drums, before suddenly DOUBLING IN VOLUME with an effect akin to that of opening a rock club's door midset. (By the way, before you write in to point out my self-contradiction, the correct volume signature here is not loud/soft, but loud/LOUD. Make a note.) ""Hippy Dippy Do"" represents the rockabillyish side of RFTC, with its initial, flash-fried guitar figure going up and down like a rusty zipper, then jamming up in little tangles of pop/punk chugging. The uncharacteristically mopey ""Ditchdigger"" (by the Swami's turban, is this Social Distortion covering Jawbreaker?), with its regal, harmonic-laden ice sculpture of a melody, is an early standout, as is the swaggering dick-walk of ""Hairball Alley"". The first bonus track, the seemingly underdeveloped ""Lamps for Sale"", does become more engaging when a fleeting horn line and upper-register guitar enliven the uninspired riff. ""Crazy Talk"" is more distinctive, with pointillistic drills of tightly controlled thrash pinioned by rigid percussion, a lively vocal melody, and hair-raising reiterated rock breakdowns. The bonus tracks are rounded out by the lubricated, unfettered thrust of ""Flight of the Hobo"" and pop/punk prototype ""Over the Rail"". As I said: solid.

Tres Cosas,Juana Molina,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46813d197565213bf51/1:1/w_160/6e3ec423.jpg,2004-07-22 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5593-tres-cosas/,Domino,"In a past life that came to a close sometime around 1996, Buenos Aires' Juana Molina was a well-known comedienne and television host, something akin to Argentina's Tracey Ullman, or say, Carol Burnett. It was a role she dutifully fulfilled for almost seven years before succumbing to a twerk of conscience and retreating to Los Angeles in the hopes of starting again, this time as a musician. Tres Cosas is Molina's third full-length since she abandoned television outright in the mid-90s, but her past as a successful comedian still clings closely to her brand. The obvious reason for that is because it's a compelling backstory in its own right, the kind of anecdote that journalists and publicists don't easily forget. But in the context of her work as a musician, the dogged funnylady characterizations begin to make even more sense; modest, meandering and resoundingly uncommercial, Molina's is just not the kind of music you would anticipate from a former star of any kind. Conceived as a bare-bones response to 2000's comparatively elaborate Segundo, Tres Cosas consists of breathy, wafer-thin Argentinean folk that occasionally flirts with the vanguard. Excepting the underwater synth piece ""Filter Taps"" and the gonzo pitch-wheel bonanza of ""Yo Se Que"", everything here hinges on Molina's nimble voice and a guitar, and yet it'd be misleading to stop at calling it acoustic music. Part of Molina's appeal-- and this is what's getting her namechecked by more than just the world music set-- lies in the way her songs incorporate subtle additions like xylophones, strings, synths, loops and ambient washes without ever changing shape. One gets the sense from tracks such as ""No Es Tan Cierto"" (which slyly sneaks a xylophone and some sparse percussion behind its opening guitar motif) and the beautiful ""Curame"" (a three-shades blend of guitars, keys and vocals) that she's seeing the spaces in her songs and arranging them to match. The end result is a record of mixed materials that still sounds natural; a far cry from some of folk music's more hamfisted attempts at acoustic/electronic collusion. Because Molina's compositions tend to be guided by stream of consciousness, sing-songy word trails, some of them need lots of time to fully take root; others-- like the clumsy ""El Cristal""-- may never germinate at all. On the whole, however, Tres Cosas is still remarkably lean in fat. Neither particularly immediate nor eager to please, it's also absolutely nothing like a punchline, but who said Molina had to be funny anymore?","Following last year's brilliant but sadly ignored Segundo, Domino Records releases Argentinian indie/electronic folk artist Juana Molina's second pleasant outing.

Acoustic Citsuoca EP,My Morning Jacket,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42c5e6ef959693239cd/1:1/w_160/c8e9522e.jpg,2004-07-22 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5534-acoustic-citsuoca-ep/,ATO,"""Watchin' a crowd roll in
Out go the lights it begins
A feelin' in my bones I never felt before
People always told me
that bars are dark and lonely
And talk is often cheap and filled with air."" My Morning Jacket's Jim James sings those words on ""Golden"", the effervescent centerpiece of last year's excellent It Still Moves. It's hard to think of a more poignant evocation of the mix of nerves and adrenaline that precede a live performance. But when he sings it over a spare arrangement of two acoustic guitars on the new live EP Acoustic Citsuoca, there's no hint of nervousness or hesitation-- he just goes for it. James is one of those people who's been blessed with a voice that you could never mistake for another-- it's a clean, piercing tenor that reveals vulnerability when needed, but mostly just soars. James doesn't even need to be saying anything to shiver spines, and when he lets his falsetto rip on a wordless passage of ""mmm's"" and ""aaah's"" at the end of this version of ""Golden"", it's one of the absolute highlights of a pretty strong set. Perhaps what makes the passion behind the playing and singing on this EP most remarkable, though, is the fact that it was recorded at a very casual Halloween gathering in the most excellently named town in Massachusetts, Braintree. There's a laidback, unrehearsed feel to most of it, particularly the three stripped-down solo tracks. Around the two-minute mark in a run through At Dawn's unrelentingly gorgeous ""Bermuda Highway"", James slips for a second on his acoustic and utters a barely audible little ""oop!"", and soon after that, almost bursts out laughing as he sings the verse twice by mistake. Yet, these mistakes lend the music a sense of jovial intimacy, especially when set against the powerful directness of their content. To hear these songs presented on record without the pools of reverb that My Morning Jacket's albums tend to float in is intriguing; they hold up very nicely. The two fully arranged tracks that open the set are especially revealing. ""The Bear"", from the band's debut, kicks off with the classic ""Be My Baby"" drumbeat, but with just the natural reverb of the Startime Pavilion, it sounds very different. The effect is interesting, the band shuffling along with an easy groove while James climbs up into the ionosphere with his vocal booster rockets. The version of ""Sooner"", originally from the Chocolate & Ice EP, actually bests the original in some respects, particularly in the late verses when the guitars are replaced with an ominously beeping keyboard (featured in the original, but buried under a lot of other stuff) nicely befitting the Halloween milieu in which the song was performed. It's not really going out on a limb to say that this is required listening for any established My Morning Jacket fan, even if newcomers would do better to start with one of their three full-lengths (take your pick; they're all fantastic). It's a well-captured and spirited performance-- ""a most enchanting night,"" as Berman puts it-- and a fine between-albums teaser for fans can't get quite enough of My Morning Jacket's unique brand of sonic seduction.","Southern psych-rockers turn out this new EP recorded live at a casual Halloween performance in Massachusetts.

White2,Sunn O))),by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b65e6ef95969320b83/1:1/w_160/9c4491fb.jpg,2004-07-22 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7579-white2/,Southern Lord,"In the flawed 1997 space-horror trip Event Horizon, an experimental craft achieves fabulous feats of locomotion via a mechanism that displaces time and space. Sweet! See you at Uranus. Unfortunately, this spontaneous generation of black holes is like requesting gold circle seats in Hell, and a torrent of horrifying shit befalls the ship's crew. While ultimately an unrewarding genre exercise, there's a kernel of spooky genius in the film's concept: It imagines a future where humanity's technological itch finally scratches open a purely metaphysical wound, an evil-bleeding gash in reality that neither David Bowman nor The Oracle can help sew up. It suggests that IT and machines are only stacking our teetering tower of sanity higher. Innovation doesn't destroy our collectively freaky history-- it just pays it to go away for a while. And when similarly dangerous black holes are conjured from psycho sonic depths, our sick, dark, peanut-brain past comes forward to complete the real circle of life. Earth knew this; so does Sunn 0))). The former's 1990s Sub Pop releases were long-form experiments in monolithic tone that tweaked our brain pans and smudged the margin between metal riff and irritable bowel. Naturally, they were incredible. For a few years now, Sunn 0))) has been paying tribute at Earth's altar with a series of mostly guitar-based releases that flow from a similar vein of doomy trance and sickly noise. But while Earth eventually settled on imagining what would happen if a muscle car's energy was harnessed, flattened and pounded into the shape of a bong, Sunn's sonic signature has drifted from post-stoner rock thrum into uncharted regions of stalagmite drone. 2003's White1 genuflected to the black arts while deconstructing doom metal and sludgy trance; even when there were vocals, its sonic power tried to cut a hole in the world. The resulting White2 is defined by its cover art. On the front, faceless, cloaked peasants gather bounty as a lookout stands watch up a tree. Are they boldly stealing the fruits of their evil master's garden? Or are they feudal discards, their souls broken, content to wait out death working for the whims of another? The answer might lie somewhere in the circular diameter of the grid on its back cover, or in its cryptic statement, ""Optimized for blackened sub-bass systems."" Likewise, though the artwork may depict the Old World, it's an inside-out version, the result of serfs falling, limbs flailing, into that metric black hole. Sunn offer salve for the hole walls with White2's three lengthy pieces. There's a kind of bliss in the folds of ""Helloween""'s distorted bass and tensile, wavering electric guitars-- its thick, repetitive chord changes might be the steadily gaining footfalls of a giant whose friends have already left you beaten and bloodied. Appropriately, the song's second half descends into droning death knells of tonal squall, a requiem for humanity. On its surface, ""Helloween"" are riffs made miles long by sustain. But that length is like a timeline, or a trajectory from the simple fears of man's formative years through the powerfully unsettling simplicity of two distorted guitars and an enormous bass cabinet. On White2, Sunn set their amps on ""primeval."" If ""Helloween"" is human history distilled, ""Bass Aliens"" is a 23 minute-plus representation of queasy creeping death, filled with the echoing plinks of guitar strings and giant, sea monster swells of bass noise. 'Noise', because after a few minutes the low rumbles are matched and intensified by a processed feedback rattle, its insistent clapping and rattling a tense preamble like the clatter of an unlatched storm door before a F5 twister. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), the track doesn't quite deliver on its foreboding run-up-- with a final flurry of chop, the storm blows over. But the world isn't getting off that easy. Sunn end White2 with ""Decay 2 [Nihils' Maw]"", and a guest appearance from Mayhem affiliate vocalist Attila Cishar. Clocking in at nearly half an hour, it's a hissing, howling piece of ambient death that suggests angry souls escaping from a manmade tomb. Guitar notes and basslines shudder and eventually buckle, reassembling into unrecognizable strings of sound. Melody falls away as atonal sediment sifts into a gaping black maw. Faraway echoes could be manic laughter, but they also sound like that incessant, humid drip that persists inside the reptile houses of zoos. The high-pitched whisper of disembodied choral groups rise in crescendo as peels of breathy screams course beneath Attila's wordless throat singing. And when he finally begins to make words, it's in a terrifying dead language scarier than Sam Neil's eyebrows. ""Decay 2"" might be ol' crazy humanity's last hope for redemption, but Sunn 0))) leave us no indication of survival or death.

Grapes from the Estate,Oren Ambarchi,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a075c0084474cd0bfba4/1:1/w_160/57e96a03.jpg,2004-07-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/152-grapes-from-the-estate/,Touch,"On a day when your transmission drops to the asphalt and the humidity's enough to fry brains, Oren Ambarchi's resonating, disembodied guitarisms establish a soothing alternate universe. With his third solo project for Touch-- following 2001's Suspension and 2000's Insulation-- the Australian guitarist unwraps the warm chilliness of past efforts, organizing a languid, abstract world of lulling harmonics and slow-drip tones with the on/off attenuation of strings, bells and percussion. Raised in Sydney, and of Sephardic Jewish heritage, Ambarchi's performed and recorded with labelmate Christian Fennesz, Sachiko M, John Zorn, Keith Rowe, Phill Niblock, Toshimaru Nakamura, Martin Ng, and others. But while he's been performing live since 1986, guitar in tote, I'd prefer to keep Ambarchi as a one-dimensional wraith flittering about my cramped apartment: Nothing like seeing a guy sweating over knobs and cables to drain the magic from twilight overtones. As is, Grapes from the Estate's ambient clusters navigate a field of emptiness. The first composition, ""Corkscrew"", would make an ideal soundtrack for one of Bill Viola's single-channel watery videos, especially the moments in which a microscopic lens outlines the surprisingly complex contours of each droplet. The piece consists of electric guitars, but sounds like an echoed tone generator, the occasional circles surrounding a submerged stone, or a fading gong. ""Girl with the Silver Eyes"" bulks up with Hammond organ and drums, but casts a similar shadow. The most noticeable difference is a fairly distinguished bass overload. These gentle, heavy pulsations are the only cacophonous wavelengths on this album, and they're pretty minor. Otherwise, at the near-midway point, regulatory brushes and snare wraps surface, followed by an intermittent kabuki melody that rises like an afterthought. The track resolves as the pantomime of a quietly corroding music box unleashes its last gasps. ""Remedios the Beauty"" opens with a hook and maintains the ""riff"" throughout: Mixing acoustic and electric guitars, piano, bells, drums, and the strings of Veren Grigorov and Peter Hollo, it comes off like sheets of crystalline snow spiked with a looped Four Tet yarn or a twangy western Matmos two-step at its center. Entering the pop realm, it's the most obviously musical, least enigmatic of the compositions. Still, it works in setting up the starkness of the final 20-minute ""Stars Aligned, Web Spun"", which brings the album full-circle. Ambarchi, again alone with this electric guitars, ups the enveloping absence of ""Corkscrew"", doubling its duration. Over time, the sprawl unfurls like found inhuman frequencies: Ambarchi's patience in allowing calm tones to live healthy, long lives creates a blinking grid. It's what I imagine a black and white Lite Brite would sound like if it were allowed a temporary whisper. No matter how camouflaged, a guitar is a guitar. Though it may be hard to believe this flickering six-string sunspot emerged from an instrument that established Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen, Ambarchi makes his solo talk without resorting to a single spell-breaking finger-tap, mathy scale, or screeching whammy bar. Wonder what he could do with ""Hot for Teacher""...","England's prestigious Touch label offers this collection of hypnotizing ambient alien drones from experimental guitarist Oren Ambarchi.

Detroit Deli,Slum Village,by: Jamin Warren,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a463b1335d7bf1698949/1:1/w_160/37f475cf.jpg,2004-07-21 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7252-detroit-deli/,Capitol,"Before 8 Mile, there was Slum Village. The Detroit trio of T3, Baatin, and Jay Dee managed to produce a phenomenal chest-thumping debut full-length, Fantastic, Vol. 2, two years before Em hit the silver screen. The record crystallized Unmah all-star Jay Dee's patented ass-rattling bump and established him as one of the hottest producers in the game. Unfortunately, after Jay Dee's departure in 2001, Slum Villa's sophomore release, Trinity: Past, Present and Future, left significant questions as to the group's longevity, despite notable production work by Bling 47 counterpart Waajid and promising returns from the duo BR Gunna. 2003 delivered more surprises when Baatin, Slum Vil's in-house Rasputin, was diagnosed with schizophrenia after increasingly erratic behavior on tour and a two-day shark steak-induced coma. By 2004, hope was fading, deals were drying up, and the frequent lineup changes were wearing heavily on the remaining members. Detroit Deli, unfortunately, meets every expectation for a group as battle-weary as Slum Village. Tag team producers Young RJ and Black Milk (aka BR Gunna) possibly could have offered the benefit of solid backbeats, but they themselves are still searching for finesse. Tracks like the 80s faux-funk of ""Do You"" and the Egyptian twist of ""Things We Do"" bear hints of hotness, but in the end only paraphrase J. Dilla's genius. Emphasizing beats over rhymes is purist anathema, but let's be honest: Elzhi, T3 and Baatin historically never have had the subtlety or dexterity to hold court by themselves. Even on Slum Village's debut, Jay Dee was the visionary, and the rest of the gang was playing catch up. Detroit Deli only emphasizes this disparity further: Baatin's sexistential ramblings are sorely missed; T3 has yet to push past his own penis; and Elzhi drops some flatout trash verses, as on ""Count the Ways"": ""You're screamin' in our semen/ We get done."" On the opening volley, ""Zoom"", T3, Elzhi and Detroit counterpart Phat Kat stumble like amateurs at the 106 & Park tryouts: ""Catch me in Range with the rims, spinnin'/ Spinnin', sorta lookin' like its windmillin'."" Even Wu-Tang fugitive Dirt McGirt comes off lazy on his feature track ""Dirty"", serving up the anthemic worst line of 2004 and a surefire lady-slayer: ""If you're flexible, intellectual, bisexual/ Can I get next to you?"" Despite its many shortcomings, Deli manages a few brilliant moments. On Kanye West's addition ""Selfish"", Slum Village enlists the help of neo-neo-soul crooner John Legend to create a simply ephemeral R&B; cut (although I wonder if Kanye's knack for homonyms on his verses is wearing thin). The baby's-bottom vibe on ""Closer"" displays an understated me-so-horny romanticism few can match, and the inspirational ""Old Girl/Shining Star"" demonstrates Slum at its playful, gritty best. That Detroit Deli even exists as an album testifies to T3 and Elzhi's determination, but Slum Village's ambivalence prevents the record from the organic smoothness of days past. Without the production ethos of Fantastic, Deli only further complicates the group's turbulent history. On ""Reunion"", Jay Dee quips, ""You thought we broke up / But we were just re-assemblin'""; if they even survive to make a fourth album, Slum Village will need to find a better configuration.","Though they burst strong out of the gate in 2000 with Fantastic, Vol. 2, this once-promising Detroit crew has since fallen apart amidst lineup changes and unfortunate production work.

Flashlight Seasons,Gravenhurst,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bff4eb335119a49ed2ed/1:1/w_160/2d4c1f8a.jpg,2004-07-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3640-flashlight-seasons/,Warp,"It's 2004, and we've fallen in love with acoustic guitars all over again! From the clawhammer inspired folk songs of Iron & Wine to the ramshackle orchestras of Mirah, the confessionals of Sufjan Stevens to the postmodern ballads of the ""freak-folk"" balladeers like Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom, the sounds of wandering minstrels are filling our stereo speakers with rainy-day melancholy and old timey lore. But be forewarned: If you're planning on releasing your very own acoustic guitar album (and well you should, young plucker) you'd better be ready for comparisons to just about anybody who's whispered sad melodies over fingerpicked minor chords in the last 40 years. Gravenhurst's Nick Talbot has discovered this the hard way since releasing Flashlight Seasons on his own Silent Age label in 2003; he's since been likened by reviewers to Belle & Sebastian, Neil Young, Nick Drake, Jeff Buckley, Simon & Garfunkel, and Elliott Smith, to name a few. Now maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that not even God himself, armed with an acoustic guitar, could write a song that simultaneously juggles all of these artists' varied styles. Yet a hushed tone and pastoral feel can seemingly overwhelm all other musical influences in the ears of some listeners, leading to cries of ""folk!"" from all directions. In truth, Gravenhurst's songs are as indebted to Britpop as any songwriting tradition, as shades of The Smiths are evident throughout Talbot's midtempo, gracefully arranged works. Regardless of press angle, Warp Records' reissue of Flashlight Seasons should end up finding a wide audience; it's a dark pop record that continuously revels in its own ennui, and will be blasting through many a pair of snow-covered headphones in the winter to come. Most of the artists to which Gravenhurst has been compared are revered as much for their brilliant songwriting as their performance styles-- they've created songs that can transcend individual interpretation. Talbot, though he's put together a dense and appealing album, is no craftsman of such a caliber. Relative to the musical company into which he's been thrust, his vocal melodies are insubstantial and lyrics pretty but vague. Flashlight Seasons' songs are actually driven more their specific atmospherics and production, each bathed in a haze of carefully constructed ambiance and accompaniment. Flashlight Seasons is a bedroom album, a recording approach that Talbot prefers to the frustration of expensive studio work. The home-recorded nature here is apparent, not because of anything lacking in the production-- in fact, the high quality of recording and mastering that Talbot attained are admirable-- but because of the obvious amount of care put into the arrangement of each track. He's managed an intimate and unpretentious sound, and taken the time to get it exactly right. Nick Talbot has named the shoegazers among his primary influences, and the reverb-drenched guitars and low drones of the genre are apparent in the background of almost every Flashlight Seasons song. ""I Turn My Face to the Forest Floor"" is an unabashedly dark and dramatic number with a chilling chorus. The bleak, industrial landscapes channeled through the music of the post-rockers are evoked by the instrumental interlude ""East of the City"". One of the album's strongest tracks, opener ""Tunnels"", features Talbot's icy harmonies over a funeral-march inspired drum and organ. As a whole, the album makes for a moody journey of consistent beauty. Unfortunately, the fact that Gravenhurst's atmospherics are not employed at the service of truly gripping songs means that, though Flashlight Seasons never hits a wrong note, its impact is made in muted shades rather than the sharp tones of direct emotion.","Warp Records takes a surprising turn away from glitch-powered electronica with the delicate second LP from this serene Bristol-based folkie.

Shanti Project Collection 3,Various Artists,by: Stephen M.

The vagueness of that mission statement speaks more to the breadth of the organization's services than to the specificity of its actions, which range from education and research to care and transportation coordination for AIDS and cancer patients. The organization also performs a distinct service to music fans by acting as a raison d'etre for three installments of the Shanti Project Collections, a series of benefit albums that collect rare and/or unreleased songs from a disparate group of artists. SPC1 featured Low, Red House Painters, and Idaho, while SPC2 showcased dusky-voiced female singer/songwriters like Julie Doiron, Paula Frazer, and Edith Frost. Compiled by Badman Records' Dylan Magierek and again illustrated with Nyree Watts' photography, the series' third installment is a departure of sorts: Whether purposefully or not, the first two comps focused on songwriters, but the five bands on SPC3-- The Black Heart Procession, Califone, Sigur Rós, Arab Strap, and Kinski-- all emphasize sound over songs. Each group contributes two songs to the album. Ironically titled for a lead-off track, The Black Heart Procession's instrumental ""Exit Out"" floats along languidly, structured only by Mario Rubalcaba's Moebius-strip drums and some strategic chord changes; it's repetitive, but its endless loop builds and swirls evocatively. The band's penultimate ""Sort It Up"", however, is just repetitive. Califone's ""Michigan Girls"" is a subdued blues track worlds removed from the backporch jamble of their take on the traditional ""Cluck Old Hen"", with its ramshackle groove and lengthy coda. Arab Strap's dramatic ""We Know Where You Live"" and ""Devil Tips"" sound almost like The Streets without the garage beats-- spoken-word narratives that emphasize local details and let listeners insinuate larger meanings. Kinski's two tracks (live-on-the-radio versions of ""Semaphore"" and ""Schedule for Using Pillows and Bean Bags"") build to intense peaks, much like Sigur Rós's ""Dánarfregnir Og Jaroarfarir"", which forms a louder counterpart to the quieter, lusher ""Bíum Bíum Bambaló"", both of which originally appeared on the N\xFD Batterí single. Obviously, there's no lyrical consistency across these tracks, as only a few of these songs were recorded specifically for the Shanti Project, and only about half of those even have lyrics to begin with (and that's counting Sigur Rós's songs in Ice-/Hopelandic). But SPC3 compensates for this lack of cohesion with sonic juxtapositions that constitute a subtle act of rock criticism. The collection draws out the similarities and differences between these five fairly distinctive bands, juxtaposing The Black Heart Procession's languorous lull with Sigur Rós's ethereal atmosphere, Califone's unobtrusive earthiness with Kinski's jet-fighter dramatics and Arab Strap's words-as-instruments creations. The similarities between them all-- their devotion to songs that arc gradually and patiently, their sense of structure and dynamics, their occasional long-windedness-- become all the more obvious as their differences dissolve. The overall effect is that rarest of rarities: a charity collection that sounds sculpted and cohesive, that has shape beyond its individual songs and life beyond its origins as a fund-raiser.","Third installment in Badman's thematic compilation series offers two previously unreleased tracks apiece from Sigur Rós, The Black Heart Procession, Califone, Arab Strap and Kinski.

One Plus One Is One,Badly Drawn Boy,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1fa9d034d5c69bf2aad/1:1/w_160/a49c4250.jpg,2004-07-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/529-one-plus-one-is-one/,Astralwerks,"You need not have your head buried too deeply in your iBook to catch a whiff of bias against Nick Hornby from the independent music press. The balding, perpetually thirtysomething pop novelist has lately been trying his hand at rock commentary (a passion second only to soccer-- er, football), crafting articles for The New York Times and The Believer, editing a popular critical anthology (Da Capo's annual Best Music Writing series), and even publishing an homage to his 31 favorite songs, titled, appropriately enough, 31 Songs. Like it or not, Hornby is a relevant cultural figure who has used his clout as a novelist to help develop an ancillary career in music journalism. Though his work in the field is certainly passionate, Hornby is undoubtedly a novelist first and a critic second. The backlash, then, is understandable, when he exhausts 2,000 words on sentimental lauding over uneven Philadelphia schlock-rockers Marah, or incessantly pontificates about his bygone youth and its tenuous-at-best connection to music. It seems wherever the man lays his pen, it serves as a clarion call for the press to root against his new favorite band. The task for fans becomes deciding if, in fact, the death knell is warranted. Witness: Damon Gough. Gough is an artist who has been handily and, some may argue, unfairly smote by Hornby's approbation. After hearing his wonderfully enigmatic debut, 2000's The Hour of Bewilderbeast, Hornby was smitten, and asked the Badly Drawn Boy to score the big-screen adaptation of his About a Boy. Both film and score, however, were met with equal parts acclaim and enmity, leaving Gough's standing in flux. While many insist the entrapments of commercial success (About a Boy, a contract with ArtistDirect BMG) have led Gough down an ill-fated path toward mainstream banality, I've willingly given him the benefit of the doubt. A gleeful champion of Bewilderbeast, I've been searching for some hard evidence-- any evidence-- with which to refute Gough's intensely biased detractors. I concede that, since his wily debut, the threadbare Briton hasn't crafted anything approaching the idiosyncrasy and charming verve of Bewilderbeast. But while the flaccid one-two punch of About a Boy and Have You Fed the Fish? festered in light of his momentous debut, those lackluster efforts surely weren't so awful as to rule out a potential return to form... were they? Well, it's beginning to look that way. Back with a new label (Astralwerks), and a shot at a new beginning, One Plus One Is One finds Gough accelerating his concerted drive toward commercial success, and the results only offer more fodder for the fallen auteur's ruthless gadflies. There's nary a strong song here-- not even a retread of ""Silent Sigh"" or ""Something to Talk About"", much less another ""Once Around the Block"" or ""Everybody's Stalking"". Sadly, Gough has firmly and perhaps inevitably cleared, as ex-PFM writer Jesse Fahnestock put it, the ""fenceline between execrable REO Speedwagon pomp-pop and touching, emotive songwriting,"" and landed on, well, you can guess which side. The troubling thing about Gough's undoing is that it hasn't come in the form of a mere stasis, but rather a willful regression to a by-the-numbers approach to songwriting, devoid of pretty much any substance. On top of being simplistic, sonically unadventurous, and poorly recorded, these songs aren't the slightest bit catchy, a consequence of Gough attempting to balance his dour, nine-o'clock-shadow persona with FM radio aspirations. The album's most immediately memorable aspect is its indiscreet prologue and epilogue: a pointless sample of what sounds like shopping carts being jostled in a supermarket, only without the telltale ch-ching of cash registers. Gone are the sultry orch-pop orchestrations that characterized his debut and parts of the spotty Fed the Fish, replaced by a more pared-down palette of maudlin grand piano, close mic'd drums, plenty of indiscriminate strumming, and, for good measure, some new-age flute. Even Gough's trademark demure croon seems oddly self-conscious, doubtless a result of his voice sticking further out than usual from the tepid instrumental mix. Points of interest are few and far between. With their staid textures, the songs tend to blend into one another, sounding at best like a spiritless hodgepodge of About a Boy's weaker moments. The title track opener features a smattering of glockenspiel, trumpet, and overwrought strings, but the parts fail to coagulate, and the finished orchestration sounds like a bush league Fleetwood Mac. Elsewhere, Gough's lyrics are regrettably schmaltzy, as on ""Year of the Rat"" he croons (with some help from a completely unironic children's choir), ""Everybody needs to know it's the year of the rat/ Everyday we've got to hold on/ 'Cause if we hold on, we could find some new energy."" Elsewhere, ""Summertime in Wintertime"" feebly acknowledges Jethro Tull, juxtaposing a bouncy flute against a generic prog riff. In context, it's something of a tour de force number for Gough, but ultimately a stone better left unturned on an album best left unheard.","After two full-length releases that failed to come at all close to the simple sweetness of his debut, 2000's Mercury Prize-winning The Hour of Bewilderbeast, Damon Gough again switches labels to Astralwerks for one last shot to prove that his early success wasn't just a fluke.

...It Falls Apart,For Stars,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdfbabf31b7dc7156084/1:1/w_160/7a9abf08.jpg,2004-07-20 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3153-it-falls-apart/,Future Farmer,"If, for some reason, you're in search of a savior in these relatively fertile times for underground music, For Stars may be more than happy to oblige. ...It Falls Apart, the band's fourth full-length, has arrived, quavering vocals, organ dirges, and bubbling synths ablaze. Sonically overwhelming throughout its eight tracks, the album affirms the enduring significance of alt-rock's most pervasive clichés. As such, the album feels important, but behind its earnest and not-so-clever ruse lies little more than well-articulated fluff. For Stars seem to be angling for a happy medium, and in some ways, they achieve it. Like Radiohead without the intellectuality and studio precision, or Grandaddy without the endearing sloppiness, the California group hover between stylistic opposites, trying ardently to grasp both extremes, but ultimately fail to match the scale of their unrealistic ambitions. ...It Falls Apart is essentially a mottled amalgam of alt-rock truisms, overloaded with grandiose piano ballads, backwound guitars and glistening synths. The record can be viewed a historical tribute of sorts, as virtually every song closely (and perhaps accidentally) approximates one or more of rock's most widely canonized artists, to the point that a track-by-track litany could be recited. Listening from that perspective, sadly, does little to absolve the album of its abundant faults: Most devout music fans have already heard all the bands For Stars ape, and in their shadow, this group is revealed as a feeble doppelganger, tiredly reiterating moot points for which only the most gluttonous listeners will reserve patience. The jig is up from the get-go. Opener ""I Should Have Told You"" recasts Radiohead in the wan light of airy American orchestral pop, riding an OK Computer-nostalgic riff over a well-trodden ground of arena rock piano and painfully over-affected vocals. Equally ludicrous are Carlos Forster's lyrics, chief among which is the refrain, ""I took her down/ And I made her cry."" And as if that acerbic salvo wasn't enough, ""Calm Down Baby"" impedes the point with the devastating chorus, ""Friends again/ You're just my friend again/ There's a million things I'd rather be than your friend."" A breakup album if nothing else, ...It Falls Apart adheres to its role consistently and appropriately, a lot like, say, Tom Green in Freddy Got Fingered. It Falls Apart isn't completely devoid of pleasurable moments-- just severely lacking in them. Pinioned by a four-on-the-floor drumbeat, ""It Doesn't Really Matter"" avoids disintegrating in For Stars' typically overzealous wall of sound, allowing listeners a rare chance to appreciate Forster's lilting vocals and the band's amply reverbed guitar fronts. Here, when the usual monotony begins creeping in near the two-minute mark, in comes a sultry trumpet break, performed subtly and limberly enough not to deluge the song in cheese. Unfortunately, it's back to the piano and more spiritless love ballads from there. What For Stars lack in originality they overcompensate for in emotionality. I have no doubts about Forster's sincerity when he belts lyrics like, ""Make me a sailboat/ And put me in a bottle/ 'Cause I got a dream/ Of seeing the sea""-- and that's the troubling part. His simplistic, declaratory verses are par for the course in pop music, but when they're presented as quixotically as on the maudlin ""Calm Down Baby"", they cease to merely be part of the mix and grow intrusive. And on the grand scale of pop music history, For Stars are certainly very unobtrusive, but there's nothing more unnecessary than callow attempts like this to mask something that's already been done masterfully as an original statement. It's one thing when cover bands make unabashed efforts to eulogize the work of others, but there are few things so obnoxious and ill-fated as when a group borrows established motifs and attempts to brand them as their own. In fairness, Forster does have one thing right: On the soporific, Pink Floyd-copping ballad ""Shattered Glass"", he observes, ""This is no ordinary world."" If only For Stars were successful at abiding that verity in their music, we might be talking a much different game.","And indeed it does, as this dream-pop outfit's Statement Album waters down Radiohead, The Flaming Lips and Grandaddy with asinine cliches and cringe-inducing melodrama.

Honey for Dinner,Peggy Honeywell,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c156c0084474cd0c330a/1:1/w_160/6a7d8ac6.jpg,2004-07-20 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3978-honey-for-dinner/,Agenda,"You can see her singing on a 1960s TV set made to resemble the Midwestern plains, all fake trees and tumbleweed, and a cardboard cut-out moon. You can see her performing blind and oblivious in the midst of a saloon-bar brawl, strumming and humming to herself while fists are thrown. You can see her as some speechless, shy introvert, only experiencing love through romance novels and crackly old country records, playing songs in her bedroom that no one will ever hear. Whatever images Honey for Dinner conjures of its author, they're all fascinatingly out-of-time. While anyone with a four-track and a few Robert Johnson records can feign some form of retro authenticity, it's much harder to mine the styles on display here and still sound like an intriguing, individual artist in your own right. Produced by Will Oldham's brother Paul and featuring Papa M's Dave Pajo on bass, drums, and banjo, Peggy Honeywell's curious debut collection of delta blues, bluegrass, and classic country yodel achieves this better than most. Still, despite the noteworthy guest appearances, Honey for Dinner lacks any kind of technical proficiency. Opening shot ""Sympathy Date"" alternates between sharp, graceless guitar jabs and eloquent wisps of slowed-down melody. Pajo backs it all with the barest of banjo lines. Musically, the track is crude and brash, but by lacing it with the endearingly self-deprecating lyric, ""I took advantage of your kind, kind heart/ 'Cause I'm really not as smart,"" Honeywell comes off coy and sweetly bashful. Just past a pair of 50s blues 'n' boogie pastiches lies a brace of gorgeous ballads: ""Hug My Heart"" and ""Moon"". The former is a fluttering heartbeat of fixation and longing, while the latter's cries of ""I don't wanna live on the moon"" rail against green-eyed ambition, reveling in simplicity and home comforts. Honeywell's voice displays straight-edge honesty and emotes with an almost-weeping wilt, providing these tracks with even greater allure. Of course, while the ensemble's technical incompetence can be quite charming, its limited musical pallet proves somewhat frustrating. It's baffling that Pajo is sidelined here, given his talent for arrangement; he offers only the slightest flicker of bass or slide-guitar, allowing Honeywell's clumsy three-chord strum to drive the record. As a result, the title track and ""Bower Bird"" are stunted by a lack of variety-- and clocking in at just over 20 minutes, the record does seem somewhat slight as a result. The litmus test for whether you'll enjoy or despise this album lies in the closing cover of the Elvis Presley standard ""All Shook Up"". Swapping rock 'n' roll stomp for a folksy flutter of panicked plucking and off-beat singing, Honeywell's version casts love as less the adrenal sensation that pulsated through Elvis' original, and more her own flush of blushes and half-stuttered sentences. If you enjoy watching your love songs struggle to express the depth of emotion by which the singer is tormented-- offering only a glimpse of the passion exploding underneath-- you may find Honeywell's ""All Shook Up"" completely entrancing. But Honey for Dinner's self-imposed musical limitations do keep it from being something truly special, and as such, the album simply stands as a charming, impulsive, and beguiling collection of awkward bluegrass and mannered southern strum.","Peggy Honeywell's debut collection of delta blues, bluegrass and classic country yodel aims high, but lacks technical proficiency.

Wall of Noise,Dr. Mix and the Remix,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb82eb335119a49eca5c/1:1/w_160/b18c4132.gif,2004-07-20 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2566-wall-of-noise/,Rough TradeRough Trade,"My slow crawl around the world in search of new music from the past-- a crawl that finds me falling further behind with each passing minute, as thousands of records in an uncountable number of styles continue to find their way in and out of record bins-- has not yet taken me to the French punk/new-wave scene of the late 70s. And there's a good chance I'll never get there, since punk was never something I identified with much, and I've even been sluggish about hearing all the important stuff released by countries that speak my own language. Given my slight background in the Continental new-wave of the late 70s, I can't tell you exactly where Frenchman Eric Debris, who was a member of Metal Urbain before he started recording solo as Dr. Mix and the Remix in 1979, fits in. But listening to this compilation of his complete works under this alias, I can tell you he was onto something pretty great. Debris' M.O. as Dr. Mix and the Remix was to record covers of late 60s/early 70s rock 'n' roll and avant-garage classics on which he'd overdrive the guitars to ridiculously trebly lengths, and then sing a bit like Ian Curtis, in a clunky French accent, through a pitifully cheap reverb unit while letting a rudimentary drum machine handle the beats. During Dr. Mix's short run from '79 to '82, Debris released a handful of singles and one full-length album (also called Wall of Noise), mostly on Rough Trade. In the 1995 Spin Alternative Record Guide, The Jesus & Mary Chain's Jim Reid pegged that album his third favorite record of all time-- which says something for Reid's courage, since the distinctive sound of Psychocandy appears to have been lifted wholesale from select Wall of Noise cuts. The Stooges' standard ""No Fun"" appears in three different versions: The single, which leads off this disc, was a full-band leftover from a Metal Urbain session; the original album version included later is cheaper and noisier (and better); and then there's a great instrumental ""version"" (also recorded solo), which served as the B-side of the single. The Dr. Mix treatment of ""No Fun"" finds Debris sounding like a dork and yet managing a certain cool, democratizing Iggy Pop's sexuality by making it available to anyone with the energy that a few meager tools creatively deployed. Even more exciting, the insistent and stiff 4/4 kickdrum on a 10-minute version of The Velvet Underground's ""Sister Ray"" could become proper dance music with the right EQ settings, and Debris' slurred and drooling vocals lead one to believe he did, in fact, hit the mainline-- possibly sideways. The Troggs' ""I Can't Control Myself"" finds Debris turning down the guitar a bit to focus on his vocals, the barking cadence of which suggest that Wolfman Jack might have done a radio tour of France at some point. Not all the old chestnuts fare so well (""You Really Got Me"" is dinky synth-pop, and its clean recording makes it seem amateurish rather than inspired) and the Dr. Mix originals are generally pretty bad, mostly warmed-over rockabilly forms without the wit and energy Debris brings to the covers. Despite these serious dull patches, when Dr. Mix is good, he is very good. Most of all, Wall of Noise gets to the heart of why American rock music became a worldwide phenomenon: The format is supple and can be endlessly shaped and re-imagined without losing its essential identity.","Originally issued by Rough Trade in 1979, this bizarre outing from one member of Metal Urbain features low-tech synth/noise covers of punk classics by the Stooges, Velvets, Troggs and others.

"The Venezuelan Zinga Son, Vol. 1",Los Amigos Invisibles,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd5dea9e61561daa76ba/1:1/w_160/f4c52aa5.jpg,2004-07-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4861-the-venezuelan-zinga-son-vol-1/,Luaka Bop,"It seemed that with their last album, 2000's Arepa 3000: A Venezuelan Trip into Space, Los Amigos Invisibles had shot their load and were hobbling on the crutch of their own hype. The raunchy salsa-disco-funk-fusion they'd previously pioneered had gone flaccid, drooping under the weight of its own gratuitous hyphenation. Even the flowery influence of David Byrne's Luaka Bop label couldn't give Los Amigos the creative boost they needed. A band that was once an international phenomenon was in danger of being completely forgotten. Then, something wonderful happened: lightning struck, planets aligned, genius intervened. Someone put a call in to production team Masters at Work. As the elder statesmen of the club-friendly blend of throbbing Latin rhythms and breezy electronic textures known as the Nuyorican sound, ""Little"" Louie Vega and Kenny ""Dope"" Gonzalez were the perfect choice to sculpt the band's post-millennial image. Whereas Arepa took a hesitant, flailing step towards dancefloor electronica, The Venezuelan Zinga Son, Vol. 1 dives gracefully into its swirling currents. The album's filtered percussion, insistent backbeat and silvery, synthesized sheen mark it as a mood enhancer that could've been borne out of the OM or Ubiquity Records incubator. This is the sleek, globe-spanning lovefest Los Amigos always had in them-- Masters at Work just peeled away the fluff. There's no question that these six Venezuelan funboys have grown up, but they're still far from mature, which is ultimately a good thing. For instance, they again present an unabridged 70-minute marathon, but this time it's due to extended track length (another house-mix touch) rather than an excessive number of tracks. Also, their playful horndog tendencies have become humorous asides rather than a fratboyish focal point (the album's name loosely translates to ""The Major Venezuelan Fuckfest""), a misstep in their older work that led to song titles like ""Masturbation Session"" and ""El Disco Anal"". Most importantly, though, the overall sound is much richer-- singer Julio Briceño's voice has been mellowed into the instrumental mix, an arrangement relying more on lush, multi-tracked layering than aggressive shredding. Since their beginnings, Los Amigos have blended an array of dance-inspired influences, and Zinga Son emphasizes each while maintaining a well-balanced mix. There's Brazilian flourish in the batucada breakdown of ""Playa Azul"", comedic P-Funk crowd noise in ""Majunche""'s bubbly funk, Willie Bobo-style boogaloo in the horn-accented ""Calne"", and a whole lotta Steely Dan-ish AM radio swish in ""Diablo"". But calling these songs out by name diminishes the album's convivial continuity-- like the best dance music collections it flows seamlessly. ""Comodón Johnson"" opens the record on a shy and atmospheric note, its birdsong and wind chimes building a summery, front porch vibe. Soon, a cover of Touchdown's 70s disco anthem ""Ease Your Mind"" delivers Hall & Oates-evoking synth and sax, and the festivities approach full-swing. This song specifically stands out for its silky production and corny, infectious vocals, and with its blissful, ""golden age of disco"" flush, could well become an international club hit. Whether it's Los Amigos' newfound dynamic sensibility or the studio savvy of Masters at Work, there's an intuitive progression to the album that works like a little white pill and makes everything flow just like it should. By the time the dreamy, libidinous ""Bruja"" closes the album with its reverbed vocals and loose guitar massage, a warm corporeal pleasure has set in. This is the point when the aphrodisiac effects of the music take over and it becomes imperative to find a dark, private spot and the companion of your choice. From Caracas to Rio to Manhattan, Zinga Son is a musical tour of glittery discotheques, sunny beaches, and sweaty underground clubs that's surprisingly sophisticated and undeniably sensual.","After 2000's disappointing Arepa 3000, this Latin funk/disco crew turn their shit around with production work from house icons Masters at Work.

Little / West of Rome / Drunk / Is the Actor Happy?,Vic Chesnutt,by: Stephen M.

don't count my scars like tree rings.
My jigsaw disposition, its piecemeal properties
are either smoked or honey cured by the panic pure.""
       --Vic Chesnutt, ""Panic Pure"", West of Rome Whether as a critic, devoted fan, or casual listener, it's difficult not to count Vic Chesnutt's tree rings, just as it's hard not to overestimate the significance of his wheelchair. It's become something of an icon to the Chesnutt cult, who scour his lyrics for commentary on the traffic accident that left the then-18-year-old Chesnutt paralyzed. The wheelchair looms Changeling-style in songs like ""Isadora Duncan"" and ""Supernatural"", and one-time drummer Jeffery Richards used to play it as an instrument in live shows, when it would be rigged with microphones. And yet, the tendency to trace the Pike County, Georgia, native's first four albums-- Little, West of Rome, Drunk, and Is the Actor Happy?, all of which were originally released on the now-defunct Texas Hotel label-- to that accident is more reductive than instructive. As these and subsequent albums proclaim, there is more to Chesnutt than his wheelchair: There is a fondly, even desperately remembered childhood; a tumultuous marriage; a wicked sense of humor that played/preyed on pop culture like a musical Mystery Science Theatre 3000; a sharp mind; a caustic self-loathing; and a beautifully conflicted Southern man. After releasing last year's Silver Lake, New West Records is reissuing those first four Chesnutt albums in handsome new editions full of bonus tracks culled from live shows, demos (many of which are early versions of tracks from 1998's The Salesman and Bernadette), alternate takes, and non-album tracks. Each reissue includes new liner notes by Chesnutt's friends and collaborators: producer/sidekick Michael Stipe (Little), friend and photographer Jem Cohen (West of Rome), fan Ian McKaye (Drunk), and poet Forrest Gander (Is the Actor Happy?). Drunk is given a bright new cover, and thankfully, New West has upgraded the packaging on all four, vastly improving on Texas Hotel's cardboard sleeves. The label even allows Chesnutt to right some wrongs: on West of Rome, for instance, he relegates the original opener, ""Latent/Blatant"", which Texas Hotel demanded lead off the album, to bonus track status, thus restoring his intended tracklist. Little was released in 1990, after producer and R.E.M. frontman Stipe caught one of Chesnutt's shows at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia. The most elemental of any of Chesnutt's albums, it features just his warbly voice and precarious acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by Stipe's keyboard flourishes. As its title suggests, Little is about Chesnutt's Pike County childhood, a theme he would return to repeatedly as if thumbing worn and creased snapshots found at the bottom of a drawer. ""Rabbit Box"" begins, ""While I was still in elementary school I discovered Daddy's tools,"" following the songwriter as he builds a rabbit box out of scrap lumber, but only catches a cat and a possum. In one sense, his youth represents an uncomplicated time-- pre-crash-- when all of life's possibilities lay before him, before they were whittled down to the point they are now. This theme similarly haunts West of Rome. On ""Panic Pure"", he sings, ""My earliest memory is of holding up a sparkler/ High up to the darkest sky/ Some Fourth of July spectacular/ I shook it with an urgency I'll never ever be able to repeat."" But Chesnutt isn't lamenting lost innocence, nor does he trust himself not to whitewash the past; memory is something to be wary of, childhood to be reckoned with, and his nostalgia alternates between guardedly wistful, recklessly jaded, and sometimes simply observational. From Little to Is the Actor Happy? Chesnutt's themes grow from childhood to more adult matters like friendship, romance and community, while the music grows fuller and more dynamic, losing only a bit of Little's casual intimacy as his backing musicians rotate in and out. West of Rome has a warm sound, thanks to Stipe's increasing confidence as producer and Chesnutt's hesitant electric guitar on songs like ""Withering"" and ""Sponge"". As its title suggests, Drunk is Chesnutt at his darkest, but its songs and scope suffer a bit. ""One of Many"", ""Supernatural"" and ""Kick My Ass"" all crackle with self-reckoning, but too often the album meanders boozily, which is perhaps the point. Is the Actor Happy?, his fourth album and last for Texas Hotel, is not just arguably his finest release, but also his most extroverted. His subject isn't just himself, but also his place among friends and amid the sprawl of the South. Namedropping acquaintances like Bill Lowery as well as cultural figures like Larry Flynt, Upton Sinclair's Babbitt, and Stipe (in the apologia-cum-duet ""Guilty by Association""), he turns his observational eye outward, from the military convoy rumbling through ""Gravity of the Situation"" to the kudzu-covered apocalypse of ""Free of Hope"". Then there's ""Onion Soup"", a travelogue-via-epistolary song that crafts perfectly understated tragedy from an unsent letter: ""I wrote you an eloquent postcard once/ About this most exquisite onion soup/ But of course I never mailed it, though/ 'Cause it was your turn in the loop."" What connects these four albums is what Stipe calls Chesnutt's ""economy of gesture and brilliance of character."" Chesnutt's writerly voice is as literary as it is lyrical, not merely because he writes in stories and often even in scenes, nor because his subject matter aligns very closely with the concerns of Southern writers like Barry Hannah and Eudora Welty, but mostly because Chesnutt can cajole words into new shapes and meanings. On ""Speed Racer"", a song about Kierkegaardian victimhood from Little, he sings, ""I used to watch Speed Racer with that hyper attitude/ That carried me here to this fluorescent enlightenment."" Against this curious juxtaposition of afternoon cartoons with European philosophy, the pun ""fluorescent enlightenment"" evokes anonymous college classrooms with their institutional lighting and the naïve freshman epiphanies therein, which spark briefly and eagerly like an overhead idea bulb. Chesnutt's physical voice, shaky and high like a cartoon character, works the same way, drawing out odd syllables into strange, onomatopoeic sounds, even as he rushes to fit all his words to the melodies. On ""Isadora Duncan"", he shifts the syllable break on the word ""attitude"" so that it sounds like ""a-tit-tude,"" but without turning it into a raunchy joke. He uses the British pronunciation of ""advertisements"" on ""Supernatural"", with the accent on the second syllable and a soft ""i"" in the third, and growls the word ""gravity"" so that it becomes ""grrrrrr-ravity."" The cumulative effect of this approach to songwriting and singing is that these four albums sound like they all come from a very specific, very singular brain, pickled with alcohol and self-loathing but still prickly with highly personal insights. Taken together, these albums form a quadrilogy of complex self-definition and self-loathing that is as contradictory as it is utterly compelling. Few artists could hope to fill their music with as much humor, insight, personality and ""panic pure"" as Chesnutt crams into these songs.","Oft-overlooked Athens, Georgia-based singer/songwriter finally gets his due with beautifully expanded reissues of his first four releases, potentially exposing his powerful lyricism and naked tunefulness to a much-deserved (and deserving) new audience.

Frequently Asked Questions,Tram,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f4c0084474cd0c0cfd/1:1/w_160/250c4df9.gif,2004-07-19 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8130-frequently-asked-questions/,JetsetJetset,"FAQ regarding Tram's Frequently Asked Questions Q: Well, what do they sound like? A: Tram, a band frequently likened to Low, happens to be similarly atmospheric and slow-paced. But the resemblance ends there. In place of Low's Spartan restraint and Duluthian Mormon mystique are a tendency toward sedative multi-instrumental lullabying and a heavy dose of wispy, British melancholy. Tram's arrangements are vibrantly lush, even orchestral at times, but never crowded. Paul Anderson's buttery, androgynous voice and a constant presence of liquid, full-bodied acoustic guitar strumming are the mainstays of Tram's soporific sound. Tempo-wise, I'd say a tree sloth could really rock out to this shit. Q: So, they're like British, huh? Can I expect glib riffs and pop hooks galore? A: Uh, well, no. Not really. Poignant, pretty memories abound, but not quite in ""galore"" concentrations. Anderson's singing is actually somewhat understated. He'll often place his accents on the first beat of every measure for an effect of stoned, rolling, wavy momentum. A second, instrumental melody-- mostly slide guitar or arpeggiated chords-- often lurks in the shadows and embellishes the vocal line. The singing won't embed itself in your tossing, turning head, but the dissembling, subtle beauty of the overall music will reward repeat listens, without exhausting itself. Q: So, why exactly should I give a shit? A: Jeez, who said anything about giving a shit? There's nothing groundbreaking here. Not even close. What Tram does well is synthesize the soothing, grief-addled pace of Mazzy Star with the melodic sensibilities of James' quieter songs, while flexing their own talent for arrangement and low-key melody. For a four year-old band putting out a sophomore album, Tram displays a great deal of maturity and grace. So, if you happen to come by a copy of Frequently Asked Questions, you'll be glad you have it. If not, don't worry; it won't knock you out of ""the know."" Q: What's the deal with the title? A: So glad you asked. Now I've got a cheap excuse to pull out my Paul Anderson quote: ""We had no previous experience with computer-based recording software and were faced with the daunting task of getting to grips with new technology; hence the ironic album title Frequently Asked Questions (for it seemed that we were spending our whole lives staring at instruction manuals). The title also seemed to tie in appropriately with the themes dealt with on the album."" Q: I noticed trumpet, strings, and oboe. Did Tram play all the instruments? A: No, smart guy. Actually, a whopping eight additional musicians took time out of their busy schedules of recording commercial jingles and drinking away their sorrow to lay tracks down for a pittance. Even PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish was dragged in to produce ""Once I Was""-- a Tim Buckley cover, and the only track not produced by Anderson and Nick Avery. Adding to the name-drop miasma, the Buckley track was recorded at the Cocteau Twins' September Sound studio. Which, in turn, sat on property owned by the Who's Pete Townshend. The studio was subsequently demolished to make room for high-end apartments. No, it's true. Q: So, like, can I rock out to this?

This Is for Real,Pink Grease,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17cea9e61561daa47f2/1:1/w_160/ead8fcae.jpg,2004-07-19 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6545-this-is-for-real/,Mute,"Rhyming ""fuck"" with ""suck"" is on the lyrical dealbreaker list next to ""fire/pyre"", ""tonight/right"" and ""fly/high/sky"". Nevertheless, there's Pink Grease's Rory Lewarne yowling just such a couplet over ""The Nasty Show""'s throbbing glitz. Lewarne hoots and hotfoots his way through the red-lit alleys and beaded curtains of This Is for Real-- which turns out to really not be-- dropping lines like, ""I want your fingers inside this song,"" and suggesting ways to spend the day horizontal as his five mates fluff every inch of the strutty rawk and preening glam their seemingly petri dish-activated name suggests. Take a whiff of their pant leg, baby. This Is for Real has its moments, but it's not the sex-punk triumph these Sheffield-based narcissistic debaucherists seem to believe it is. It wants to be Phoebe Cates popping tops to The Cars, but it's more like the pool house and oily Mike Damone. Throughout the album, the guitars and Lewarne's leering yelp are supported by sax and synth. And yet, for a band with a guy devoted to ""machines and inventions,"" there's very little exploration of sonic possibility. ""Emotional Retard"" and ""Fever"" are dirty rock stompers, the former layering in florescent keys for generic effect; the latter highlighting a squawking saxophone that sounds sampled from INXS. Indeed, glammy and/or punkish rock augmented with smirking electronics just doesn't get the sex trade moving in 2004-- that sound's been done in more ways than one. Which is why, after a while, Pink Grease's come-on just starts to sound superficial. Lewarne must believe that the number of F-bombs dropped corresponds directly to the music's randy qualities. And maybe it does, kind of. ""Superfool"" sufficiently grits up new wave, and even gets away with the old breathless orgasm sample. ""Pink G.R.EASE"", too, ties all the elements together-- kicky glam rockin', slutty horn blown', vintage key-tar playin', and high-pitched lyrical struttin' all gel in perfect R-rated harmony, to make Elton John get thoughts about beddin' down with Jon Spencer. And there's no way opener ""Remember Forever"" isn't an in-the-red anthem for the Urban Outfitters elite. Its verses' clangy guitars and unstoppable shadoobies might never go out of style. Still, This Is For Real just doesn't resonate. Pink Grease's brash swagger is pretty admirable-- they believe in their freaky-deaky awesomeness so fervently that it's fleetingly addicting. But sex has gotten riskier since the 1970s. In fact, its attendant hoops can make the whole bit more irritating than exciting. This is probably why so many groups, the Grease included, look to the bowls of pills and freedom of the swingin' Me Decade-- getting rocks off in real time is tougher than unhooking a third-form bra. But that it's so difficult means we can't keep reveling emptily in the past. We need new aphrodisiacs, and new methods for the new makeout mores. Some of the cats Pink Grease thank in their liners have the right idea: Liars aren't sexy, but there's a danger in their music that makes it attractive; Ladytron's machine music makes androids dream of electric sheep, and humans in angular haircuts hook up like bunnies; even Spencer, amidst his infamous posing, conjures some hot and bothered kinetics. Pink Grease's initial EPs and this resulting full-length have flashed potential, but finding the elusive rock G-spot is more difficult than pushing pulsing synthesizers into tweezed gutter-punk rhythms and yelling about sexin' over its surface. So, in the end, Pink Grease offer what amounts to a quickie-- not nearly enough sexual energy to fuel an entire party. Like Phoebe Cates climbing out of the pool, their reality is more an illusion.","These British garage-rockers were formerly known as The Buttfuckers, which should offer some indication of the intelligence level we're dealing with here. It's not as bad as it could be, but their full-force 70s sex anthems ultimately fail to satisfy.

Those Are Not My Bongos,Fuck,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be55c0084474cd0c2e88/1:1/w_160/e119320b.jpg,2004-07-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3237-those-are-not-my-bongos/,Future Farmer,"Regardless of how little (or how much) you've got invested in crusty old notions of ""selling out to the marketplace,"" there's still something undeniably-- if stupidly-- charming about Fuck's preemptive commercial bellyflop. While total disregard for mainstream acceptance/placement on Wal-Mart shelves may not be as powerful a virtue as some would like to think, the glib, art-for-art's-sake balls of naming your band after America's most noxious expletive continues, after nearly 10 years, to stand as a puzzlingly impressive choice. The Rammstein collection may go untouched, but please pluck Fuck from the shelf before Grandma comes to visit. They're just that fucking dangerous! The abrasiveness of their moniker will inevitably inform any first impression of Fuck, but their name is ultimately unrelated to the gentle swoon of their lush, folky musings. Despite meeting in a police holding cell and churning out songs with dumbly enchanting titles (see ""Panties Off"" or ""Motherfuckeroos""), Fuck's relationship to ""fuck"" provides what might be the single, crowning irony of the band's career: They've wrapped themselves up in a word that's both wholly definitive and comically irrelevant. With their skewed, airy take on traditional folk-rock and Timmy Prudhomme's bizarre, cooed lyrics, Fuck are occasionally subversive-- but mostly they're just pretty. Since forming in Oakland, California in 1993, Fuck have ripped through a mess of labels, making their footprints harder to trace; after two full-lengths on Rhesus, Fuck signed with Matador in 1997, who released their third and fourth records (1997's Pardon My French and 1998's Conduct). 2001's Cupid's Cactus appeared on Smells Like, while Goldbricks and Those Are Not My Bongos were snatched up by Italian label Homesleep, a move which rendered both albums virtually nonexistent on U.S. soil-- until 2004, when Future Farmer finally opted to release Bongos stateside. Like most Fuck records, Those Are Not My Bongos is a whispery haze of giggly jokes (some excellent, some less so-- skip through the ""Does the penis offend you?"" intro, but savor the momentary idiocy of ""I saw Betty and Veronica/ Juggling Jughead's harmonica""), docile folk strumming, and sweet, breathy harmonies. But, thankfully, Fuck aren't all snark: When Prudhomme bravely whispers, ""When cool things happen, I think of you,"" it's obvious that the band's lyrical agenda isn't exclusively preoccupied with landing prime dick jokes. ""Nowhen, or 'Now, Hen'"" sees Prudhomme wheezing delicately over a lone electric guitar and gentle keys; ""Table"" is similarly non-confrontational, with bits of piano, bouncy drums, steady guitar, and domesticated lyrics: ""She sets the table/ Rechecks the table."" Fuck haven't totally abandoned their more experimental tendencies, but Bongos is a softer, more cohesive effort than anything else in the band's discography, and worth just as much consideration as that word on the spine.","Former Matador recording artists continue to blur the line between curious novelty and poignant romanticism on their first U.S. release since 2001's Cupid's Cactus.

Sorry I Make You Lush,Wagon Christ,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9b6b1335d7bf1699528/1:1/w_160/5d26e6d1.jpg,2004-07-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8556-sorry-i-make-you-lush/,Ninja Tune,"Is Luke Vibert too prolific? A man with more personalities than that cross-eyed guy in Identity, Vibert has, under his various guises, released records on Warp, Rephlex, Astralwerks, Mo'Wax, and Ninja Tune. His resume reads like a directory of essential electronic labels, and his output-- be it the experimental drum 'n' bass of Plug, the jungle jumble of Andrew Amen, or the scrap heap house of his eponymous releases-- all reflect his imperative to push established genres into territory just beyond the usual. Now Vibert returns with his fifth album under the Wagon Christ moniker-- the one reserved for the, um, quirkier side of his quirks. But does his almost mythical work ethic amount to genius or expose the disposability of his music? The answer lies closer to genius than junk. Sorry I Make You Lush is an extremely listenable, laughable album, a futuristic freakshow of deep, stirring melodies and innovative beat arrangements. There's a great variety of android emotions at play here, wrought by a fluctuating sonic density that explodes one moment into galactic proportions, and contracts into padded cell claustrophobia the next. Even with ""Shadows""' haunted overtones and ""UBFormby""'s bug-eyed schizophrenia, Wagon Christ's trademark sense of humor is always evident, both in musical form and in the use of outlandish vocal samples. The latter show up most notably in the aptly titled ""The Funnies"", a patchwork funk knit mostly from chop-shop percussion (with plenty of cowbell) and manic guffaws, and the zero-gravity roller boogie of ""Kwikwidetrax"", which lies creepy Cockney toddler vocals over a rubber Bootsy bassline and a whiplash hip-hop break. Ultimately, though, these songs come off like smart-alecky gimmicks, almost too reliant on the easy laugh to set their sights on higher goals. But they're also Wagon Christ's patented weirdo shtick, and devoted fans will undoubtedly be tickled. The real gems are found on the less slapstick tunes, where Vibert's nuanced composition is at its clearest. These tracks, like the album-opening ""Saddic Gladdic"", are deeply indebted to Vibert's purring Moog melodies, naturally flouting their heavy-handedness (can something called a ""Moog"" ever sound grave?). ""I'm Singing"", submerged in a wash of acoustic guitar, gentle ambient effects and electro breaks, is a soothing Tron torch song that eventually slides into anesthetized planetarium-show exotica. Wagon Christ's elusive sense of humor is mainly a by-product of clever juxtaposition. For instance, Vibert balances the Twilight Zone paranoia of ""Sci-Fi Staircase""'s high-register melody with a sweetly breaking beat. It's a ridiculous, unparalleled combination that, as the song moves through a concentrated, stuttering tweak and ethereal synth solo, takes on grandiose proportions. The album's title track hides a plodding drum 'n' bass rumble beneath what sounds like a banjo jam and Mellotron string section, then segues into squishy electro breaks halfway through, and adds what sounds like a snippet of The Police's ""Synchronicity"" synth and some light-saber samples for comedic effect. Taken as a whole, Sorry I Make You Lush can be seen basically as a breakbeat clinic, a kitchen-sink rhythmic workout splayed across a surreal, Dali-esque melodic landscape. Vibert consistently makes a solid case for his mastery of the form, stripping his beats down to their engines and souping them up with the most outrageous, flamboyant finishes he can muster. The album's closer rides on a wiry, insomniac beat and aquatic synth that recalls Air's ""Premiers Symptomes"" on Ritalin. As a closer, it's a truly enthralling track, hardly worthy of its ""Nighty Night"" title. If Cool Hand Luke can keep the vibe this strong, he may as well keep shooting-- Lush is pretty close to a bulls-eye.","It's been less than nine months since Luke Vibert's last outing for Warp, but that's not stopping Ninja Tune from issuing this fifth LP under his more playful Wagon Christ guise.

A Sun Came [2nd Edition],Sufjan Stevens,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a574c0084474cd0c0714/1:1/w_160/54a1ffdd.gif,2004-07-19 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7513-a-sun-came-2nd-edition/,OrchardOrchard,"Turns out Sufjan Stevens didn't come out of nowhere. While most of us first encountered him as the Brooklyn bard behind last year's precious Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State, Stevens had in fact made two very different recordings prior to that album's release. Proceeding in reverse chronological order, in 2001, Sufjan put together Enjoy Your Rabbit, which was, for all intents and purposes, a noise album based on the Chinese zodiac cycle. Sounding more like a side project than a juicy bit of Stevens' history, that record understandably throws new Sufjan devotees for a loop, especially given the sparse acoustic sound of his most recent release, Seven Swans. In contrast, Stevens' 2000 debut, A Sun Came, makes much more sense as a Michigan prequel. The disc's music was written and recorded in 1998-- back when a collegiate Sufjan played whistles for the Michigan folk quartet Marzuki-- and provides a backstory rich enough to suggest that his music could have gone in any number of directions. Over the course of the album's original 18 tracks, Stevens revealed his Celtic, Middle-Eastern, Indian, American folk, and indie rock influences, experimenting with noise and vocal samples, and playing no less than 14 instruments. In this respect, A Sun Came suffers from a double-edged bloat. Stevens had many disparate ideas here, and his songs were necessarily dense as a result, yet he refused to censor himself. After a sprawling 78 minutes (the reissue adds three tracks), A Sun Came bears more than a few missteps and a good number of head-scratchers, but by chance also documents some bright beginnings for this increasingly popular songwriter. Sufjan's whistle tenure with Marzuki betrays itself instantly: ""We Are What You Say"" opens briskly, with swoops of guitar plucks providing a cushion for the harmonized flutters of wood flutes. The song's Celtic current surfaces most noticeably when heavy-handed percussion ushers in a chorus of dense countermelodies. Maybe the theme from Titanic ruined me, but the wood flute begins to grate by the song's midway break, after which Sufjan steams through an instrumental outro stuffed with violin screams and even another recorder that had been tucked deep into the mix. Unfortunately, the density of these compositions doesn't always make for an interesting listen-- particularly when the song's building blocks are themselves uninteresting. ""A Winner Needs a Wand"" is a good example of this: The track retains the crowdedness of ""We Are What You Say"", but the predictability of its flute melodies is a setback. Throughout A Sun Came, Sufjan routinely summons these prominent wood flute flutters-- which is admirable as a thematic link among the album's quite different moods, but ultimately feels like a superficial gimmick. Messy, distorted guitar molasses slurps back and forth on ""Demetrius"", Sufjan's surprisingly rocking track that recalls Sebadoh noise and the melodies of a lo-fi Jesus Lizard. It's one of the album's best tracks, until midway through, Sufjan mistakenly launches into a Middle-Eastern instrumental rant that talks loud but says nothing. Later, the deliberate piano line and Sufjan's chilling, hushed vocals could have resulted in a fine post-rock outing during ""Dumb I Sound"", until those flat wood flute lines reappear and ruin the moment. And on the gimmick-free Elliott Smith-via-Sonic Youth tribute, ""The Oracle Said Wander"", Sufjan sounds out of his element, and the song comes off cold. There are a few instant groaners, too. Two chords into ""Rake"", Sufjan's adds a lame third and unwittingly relegates his possibly interesting self-duet into Goo Goo Dolls territory. ""Wordsworth's Ridge"" begins like an unaccompanied acoustic improvisation, only for an insistently lame flute and piano parts to muzzle its bite. ""Happy Birthday"" revisits acoustic alternative radio, this time with perhaps the album's most obnoxious vocal melody. These days, Sufjan manages the impression that he's serious about his music and his faith, and maybe to the point of sacrificing his sense of humor. It's unclear how true the appearance matches his reality, but three times on A Sun Came, Sufjan seems to indulge in light genre parody, to pleasing results. ""Rice Pudding"" marinates in the absurd Sonic Youth noodling he apes on ""Demetrius"", while the fiery woodwind squelches on ""Satan's Saxophones"" seem an unwitting musical satire of free jazz. Most directly humorous is ""Super Sexy Woman"": Did Sufjan really just sing, ""She'll shoot a super fart/ The deadly silent kind""?! For all A Sun Came's directions, its most relevant one comes as the last track on the remastered version of the album. ""You Are the Rake"", which Sufjan recorded in 2004, is a remake of one of A Sun Came's sore spots, ""Rake"". Six years after he first wrote the vocal melody, Sufjan bids farewell to all the bells and tin whistles that clogged up the song, and instead simply picks up his banjo. His chords are retuned and delivered more sparsely here, which accommodates the addition of the ever-present Smith sisters, who further tease out the song's deep hook. The difference between the two renditions is remarkable, and testifies to how much Sufjan has progressed as a musician and songwriter. As a bloated reissue, A Sun Came ironically proves that for Sufjan, less is often much more, especially when melodies are as convincing as the ones he writes.","Originally released as his debut full-length in 2000, A Sun Came shows singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens not yet certain of how to shape his sound, but also reveals a much more experimental side not evident on his recent baroque folk records. This newly released version-- subtitled 2nd Edition-- has been remastered, and branded with new (weird) artwork and bonus material unavailable on the original pressing.

"EP C / Tras, Fantasy EP",Battles,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1015e6ef959693200b5/1:1/w_160/1c05a22e.jpg,2004-07-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11693-ep-ctras-fantasy-ep/,Monitor,"As pliable and starkly gorgeous as Ian Williams' guitar playing was with Don Caballero, he was never the group's driving force. Despite serving as lead guitarist for a band that came to typify a genre, Williams always played a somewhat diminished role, relegated to ancillary status by drummer-cum-frontman Damon Che's beguiling polyrhythms. I always wondered how Don Cab would fare with a less audacious (if not just lesser) drummer, and Battles' EP C and Tras, Fantasy offer the answer: Buoyed-- never obscured-- by John Stanier's competent but unspectacular timekeeping, Williams flourishes, spearheading a set of hardened guitar harmonies that summon the likes of Philip Glass and Unwound. EP C and Tras, Fantasy are the first in a succession of three EPs scheduled for release this year by Battles (a third sees issue in September), a collaboration between Williams and emergent avant-jazz composer Tyondai Braxton. The guitarists' styles harmonize uncannily well, and EP C underscores their individual abilities while simultaneously siphoning them into an adherent combo. Somewhat protracted in the development of their central ideas, these consciously static songs, once unleashed, bottle enough tension to topple a house. Dreary, postmodern and monolithic throughout, EP C stays a rigid and weary course, unflinchingly dialed-in to Stanier's cagey ostinatos and Williams' confrontational anti-melodies. Stanier's utilitarian playing serves as sturdy accompaniment to Williams and Braxton's brittle fingering, but he knows how to pour it on-- in his minimalist way-- when it serves: ""Tras 2"" carries EP C out with an two-minute drum ""solo,"" almost completely devoid of fills, during which Stanier verily delivers the disc's hardest groove. On opener ""B + T"", his drumming stays a rigid course, pounding a Spartan but insistent rhythm until a roaring triplet fill brings the song to an abrupt halt. Exceeding six minutes in length, it's an early potential breaking point, a sophisticated and confrontational slog that tries the listener's patience. And that's pretty much Battles in a nutshell. Williams & Co. aren't here to dick around; their shrill dynamics offer an immediate and unsettling clarion call. Chances are, if you're not feeling EP C from the get-go, you won't see it through to the next track, much less the fifth. Yet, in only 24 minutes, Battles turn in a holistic statement that fulfills its ambitions and leaves no end untied. If ""B + T"" is the heady statement of intent, ""UW"" is the cordial palette cleanser; for three expansive minutes, Battles' dense rhythmic onslaught is supplanted by an ambient synthscape. In contrast with the confrontational instrumentation of the opening track, ""UW"" is devoid of live acoustic performance, relying instead upon the noncommittal jabbering of synthesizers. Fortunately, the song neither wanders too far from the band's concise style, nor indulges too liberally in textural experimentation to be a detriment. From there, however, the poles posited on the opening two tracks coalesce into a more fully-formed representation of Battles' sound. ""Hi/Lo"" opens with a chiming, arrhythmic Rhodes riff before stiffening up to a sludgy bass-and-drums vamp. Understated synths are slyly interwoven throughout, fleshing out the staid textures produced by the band's acoustic core. Elsewhere, ""Lpt-2"" dabbles in trip-hop-style beat manipulation, while closer ""Tras 2"" further deconstructs the band's sound, featuring curt start/stops and counter-rhythms that channel Don Cab more directly than any other song here. As the disparate elements drop out, Stanier persists, carrying the groove for nearly two minutes before removing his syncopated snare cracks and leaving his kickdrum to erratically feel for the beat. The band wastes no time with intimations or foreshadowing on Tras, Fantasy, blending electronics into the acoustic mix from the outset. ""Tras"" conveniently encapsulates many of the themes sprinkled about on EP C, reining in Battles' penchant for odd-time syncopation, angular guitar harmonies, and electronic tinkering in a prompt 3\xBD minute package. Though its central riff isn't as compelling as any of those on EP C, the song nevertheless underscores the musicians' intricate communication while highlighting their individual talents. ""Fantasy"", the album's B-side, turtle-turns the directness of ""Tras"", eliminating all semblance of melody and replacing it with a hard-driving house beat that meanders for 8+ minutes over several subtle variations. Brazen and uncompromising, the ""song"" is a real backbreaker, cryptically reflective of Battles' jarring compositional style and opaque aesthetic. If these records are a testament to Ian Williams' skill as a frontman, they also shed new light on the talent of Damon Che. While Battles play an intentionally much grimmer style of music than Don Cab, Che had an astounding knack for evincing vibrant textures from his sonorous kit, and as a result, lent color to Williams' playing. Here, Williams is bleaker, clearer and firmer, making Battles a much different-- but no less muscular-- beast than his former band.","Fans have long anticipated a debut from Battles, the new band featuring Don Caballero guitarist Ian Williams and avant-jazz freak Tyondai Braxton. They've given us two.

The Spine,They Might Be Giants,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a773c0084474cd0c0bb6/1:1/w_160/85956e37.jpg,2004-07-18 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8000-the-spine/,Zoe,"I've discovered that if you Google my name and click on ""omitted search results,"" you'll be given seven or eight pages of links to archived They Might Be Giants email discussion lists that I contributed to during my middle and high school years. Typed excitedly at lunchtime on state-of-the-art UNIX terminals, these eternal reminders of some painfully awkward times feature discussions on the latest Giants' releases and arguments as to the meaning of lyrics like ""put your hand inside the puppet head."" TMBG were the first band I ever became obsessed with, acquiring any and all singles, bootlegs, and videos I could find. To an eighth grader in the age of grunge, they were the only known alternative to ""alternative,"" and offered a musical safe-haven for anyone who might have thought that wearing a ""Normal People Scare Me"" t-shirt was a good idea. Because of my history revering the band, it's hard to face the fact that TMBG's output is gradually becoming less consistent and inspired. Their newest release, The Spine, is, like so many of their other recent releases, not a bad album, yet contains too many mediocre tracks to be comforting. The most disappointing aspect of The Spine is its musical conservatism. John Linnell's prowess at arrangement and instrumentation, on full display in his excellent solo album State Songs, seems to become increasingly buried by walls of heavily produced guitars upon each release. This wouldn't be so bad if the duo were still writing hooks that left you singing for three days upon a single listen, but there are only a few truly memorable melodies here. Much as the eighth grade girls would usually squint at me and say ""you're so random"" after I'd attempted a joke, TMBG have long suffered the upsetting label of ""quirky."" Like fellow lyrical innovators the Talking Heads, they've tended toward the topics of household appliances and sinister characters rather than life's emotional highs and lows. Because their lyrics have reveled in puns and surrealist wordplay, they've usually been dubbed ""silly"" rather than ""arty,"" though neither term really encapsulates the evil robots and grinning skulls at the core of the Giants' imagery. Thus, while TMBG have been no stranger to Dr. Demento over the years, a dark tone or manic absurdity has always kept their humor slightly shy of straight-ahead novelty territory. Increasingly, such complexity is lost in TMBG's output, and on The Spine, the attempts at humor are spotty. ""Au Contraire"" fully succeeds at humor, featuring Jodie Foster and Mahatma Gandhi playing a contentious game of cards; similarly, ""Wearing a Raincoat"" contains the streams of nonsensical associative thought at the center of the band's earliest work. Then again, the songs ""Prevenge"" and ""Some Crazy Bastard Wants to Hit Me"" are no wittier than the basic premises of their titles. It is readily apparent that The Spine was produced by Pat Dillett, who helped TMBG craft 1990's hit-heavy Flood. Both Flood and The Spine have a smooth, session-musician production quality that tempers the Giants' more experimental musical tendencies. Yet, where Flood made a successful approach at greater accessibility, The Spine's radio-friendly sound goes way overboard. The rampant vocal manipulation and techno-inspired turns are ridiculous against the Johns' matter-of-fact singing tones, resulting in tracks that sound more like Flansburgh and Linnell at a Karaoke night than on an album of their own songs. There are successful tracks here, though they're usually reminiscent of past hits. The anthemic opener ""Experimental Film"" nearly replicates the lyrical conceit of Severe Tire Damage single ""Dr. Worm"", both sung by excitable but inarticulate narrators with minor artistic ambitions. John Flansburgh has spoken of his love for Sinatra, the influence being particularly evident on ""Kiss Me, Son of God"", and here, he croons on the excellent track ""Trapped in a World Before Later On"". ""Stalk of Wheat"" also manages a distinctly 1930s tone in its big-band style call-and-response. And TMBG do up the intensity on the energetic and catchy ""Damn Good Times"", a poppy piece with a klezmer-style ending. Over the last five years, TMBG have involved themselves in an array of exciting projects. Like Danny Elfman and Mark Mothersbaugh, they're headed down the route of heady rock musicians turned soundtrack composers. Currently, they're working with Dave Eggers and director Spike Jonze to release a Moveon.org benefit album featuring Elliott Smith, R.E.M. and David Byrne. By all accounts, they're still putting everything they have into their live shows. With all this going on, it seems like their real creative energy is being turned elsewhere, as The Spine doesn't give me the sense that the Giants particularly wanted to make it or had much fun in the process. Still, as long this band's output continues to offer middle schoolers out there some kind of alternative to Hoobastank, I really can't complain.","Ninth proper album from these once-brilliant geek-rockers marks another entry in an increasingly uninspired string of releases.

Fall Back Open,Now It's Overhead,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43beb335119a49ed8d0/1:1/w_160/f379a51f.jpg,2004-07-18 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5853-fall-back-open/,Saddle Creek,"Right now, someone is exclaiming, ""Oh, Now It's Overhead!"" More than a few people have told me they thought it was ""Now It's Overheard,"" and one friend said he always heard it as ""Now It's Over, Ed"". The latter would be somewhat appropriate, considering that Now It's Overhead's debut was song cycle tracing a romance's arc from initial spark to luminous apogee to guttering finale. But as a bandname, it would have been profoundly stupid. And Andy Lemaster's name isn't Ed. It's Andy. Now It's Overheard would be a passable bandname, but one with little logical currency. Then again, Now It's Overhead doesn't make much sense, either. Both do evoke a vague impression of something just out of reach, or placed at a certain remove; an abstraction too large (although ""large"" is a sort of inappropriate term to append to an abstraction) to be apprehended except by its absence. Certainly there is no spark of recognition upon finding out it's ""head,"" not ""heard"" (like, ""Why is Hendrix saying to excuse him while he kisses this guy? Oh, sky! Sky!""). Even if the precise mechanics of Now It's Overhead's music are as enigmatic and slippery as the name, the pleasures it yields are much more concrete. The debut was easy enough to describe as Engine Down covering Depeche Mode (or the inverse, if you like), and while this sophomore release retains its superficial characteristics, it's more difficult to accurately triangulate among musical reference points. A sort of sculpted synth-pop composed of impossible shapes that cohere into perfectly smooth and easy-to-swallow lozenges, it's a rare music that sounds as if it were extremely complicated and difficult to construct, yet seems remarkably simple and immediate upon completion Like the band's debut, Fall Back Open is a cousin to albums by XTC and The Flaming Lips, where production techniques aren't a medium for the music so much as an integral part of it-- not a bolstering agent but something inextricable from the whole. Which isn't surprising, considering that band leader Andy Lemaster, who runs the increasingly sought-after Athens studio Chase Park Transduction, is establishing himself as an enfant terrible of production and proving himself capable of creating huge, intricately textured spaces for songs to reside. Fall Back Open is more reminiscent of the arid, slow-burning side of the debut (""With a Subtle Look"" comes to mind) than its upbeat fare, a reverb-drenched cruise missile flying in relentless slow-motion, like Calla with a pulse and a cherubic blond singer who could have gone boy-band as easily as indie-land. ""Wait in a Line"" rolls over the windshield like reflected streetlights, nightclub-bound and smelling of sex, a feverish nightlife anthem with crisply syncopated drum patterns and sultry lap steel weaving through the ever-present reverb cascading down in sheets. ""Surrender"", meanwhile, is a sweltering torch song of exponentially intensifying guitar glissandos and unfettered angst. If a Georgia boy on the usually Nebraska-centric Saddle Creek strikes you as odd, note that Lemaster is a veteran of Bright Eyes's backing band, and that Now It's Overhead includes both members of Azure Ray-- and those aren't the only names checking in on Now It's Overhead's sophomore outing: Conor Oberst offers backup vocals on the title track, a vaulted echo chamber with so much reverb you almost watch it carom back and forth like a spectator at a tennis match. And Michael Stipe even checks in to sing backup on ""Antidote"", his composed mid-range ballasting Lemaster's febrile chorus to good effect. It should be said that the overall sameness of Fall Back Open's tempo and atmosphere may wind up truncating its reply value. And I'm still not sure what, exactly, is overhead. Whatever it is, though, its impact can only be enhanced by the fact that you can't look at it straight on, only perceiving red and gray vestiges of movement in your peripheral field.","Saddle Creekers' second album improves on their meandering debut, and features a slew of big names-- Michael Stipe, Bright Eyes, Azure Ray-- to lend heft to its wispy pop.

And This Is Our Music,The Brian Jonestown Massacre,by: J.H. Tompkins,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3919d034d5c69bf2e60/1:1/w_160/ac0ce3fd.jpg,2004-07-18 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/928-and-this-is-our-music/,Tee Pee,"The crucial moment in the career of Anton Newcombe came with the release of 1998's Strung Out in Heaven. Somewhere around that time-- though it's difficult to peg exactly when-- Newcombe became too old to die young. Until then, life was scripted as surely as the last swim of the band's namesake; the once-young artist, whose battle cry even today is ""keep music evil,"" knew his lines: brilliant, erratic songwriter/bandleader hurtles forward sustained by life-provoking drugs, alcohol and rock 'n' roll-- the very same things that threaten to take him over the edge into nowhere. The problem is that, at the crucial moment when life gives way to life support, you turn a page and the script has nothing but blank pages (and trust me, I speak from experience). Newcombe and his band, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, have spent the ensuing years since this unfortunate rite of passage trying to figure out what comes next. The results, in general, have been mixed, but Newcombe has had some great moments, especially considering that cosmetic surgery and dispensing wisdom-- two of three time-honored options-- weren't really within his grasp (the third, denial, has proven a bit more useful). The key moment on And This Is Our Music comes during ""Prozac vs. Heroin"", in the form of a righteously head-turning phrase from a rock 'n' roller who is desperately driven to turn heads. More than merely moving units, the song's title articulates the dilemma facing those who won't or can't surrender: What's a guy to do when life offers shitty choices, he seems to be asking, and in doing so, he exposes what may well be the band's first-ever moment of human fragility. Through a typically rich acoustic haze, the lyric ""they will be done,"" comes floating to the surface; were it not so surprising, I'd describe it as blissful resignation. My friend Richard and I used to laugh and make lists of Newcombe's 60s references each time a new Brian Jonestown album dropped, and had Richard heard ""When Jokers Attack"", built around The Yardbirds' ""Over Under Sideways Down"", he'd have nodded happily, except a couple of years ago he went to Amsterdam and nodded off and out one day, case closed. ""Joker""-- upbeat and slyly aggressive beneath the fat warm 12-string-- harkens back to an earlier BJM moment, and to give Newcombe credit, he knows it's one that's past. Today, the band's music bears a deliberate, meditative quality, as if it were possible for a guy known for brawling, taunting and taking too much of whatever was available to sit cross-legged with a sitar in his lap and touch souls with some divine spirit or another. Life isn't easy for hell-bent artists who live past their point of departure. While there's only one Keith Richards, there are thousands who've wrecked themselves the same way, and in Newcombe's defense, he realizes he's getting off light. Most of us, if faced with that outcome, would pack it up and go home. But even while Brian Jonestown Massacre are moving into a future that permits zero visibility, this is still their music, and I like it a lot.","Latest from these notorious San Francisco garage-rockers isn't up to some of their previous records, but still establishes why their music should be as well-known as their stage antics.

Set Yourself on Fire,Stars,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a549c0084474cd0c06ae/1:1/w_160/7cd8c633.jpg,2004-07-18 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7472-set-yourself-on-fire/,Arts & Crafts,"Stars are a pop band who sound best on a rock equalizer setting. They aren't loud and don't need to be-- their third and best album, Set Yourself on Fire, is a great example of sonic efficiency. Its songs are packed like a Geo Tracker for a cross-country road trip, yet nothing gets crushed or stuffed or buried. It might be the best orchestral pop album of the past year, only it doesn't sound orchestral, at least not according to the outsize string-and-reverb model favored by bands like Oasis or Spiritualized. If you find me a recent album that towers higher with fodder so virtuosically managed and manipulated, I'll give you 20 dollars and jump in a foreboding body of water from a height. It took me two months to plow through Heart, Stars' 2003 sophomore effort. Two songs, ""What the Snowman Learned About Love"" and ""Elevator Love Letter"", sailed so high above the rest, I demurred at the possibility of imperfection. The album relied on standout riffs and jags of cathexis; it was, in essence, a collection of rifftastic one-liners, and one-liners sometimes fall face first. Set Yourself on Fire is more full-bodied; nothing is so singular it isn't worth fleshing out or adding to, which bolsters the weaker songs without watering down the cream. The album opens with a disquieting epigram: ""When there's nothing left to burn, you must set yourself on fire."" A procession of lugubrious strings gives ""Your Ex-Lover Is Dead"" the hugely premonitory feel of Heart opener ""What the Snowman Learned About Love"" without its flimsy grandiloquence. Amy Millan may whisper the refrain, ""live through this and you won't look back,"" but the song is no chore; in fact, it's an apt segue into the astonishing title track. ""Set Yourself on Fire"" takes Millan's mandate and soars with it. A lo-res synth arpeggio carries the song alongside a propulsive drumbeat and cascading strings. The song performs a nimble time change in its bridge before staking a final salvo-- ""20 years asleep before we sleep... forever""-- over an icy coda. You might hear it on a Peter Pan bus, north of New Haven all industrial barrens, sunny cold mid-December afternoon after leaving your girlfriend, and you might cry. The subsequent two tracks defibrillate the heartbroken. ""Ageless Beauty"" will sell Arts & Crafts' first ringtone, just watch. Its simple changes are dusted with zippy auxiliary lines playing peek-a-boo. ""Reunion""'s chorus is so bathetic it's entrancing: ""All I want is one more chance,"" sings Torquil Campbell, ""to be young and wild and free."" Rather than a second refrain, they give us a spry guitar lick that could make its chorus and secede if it wished. Set Yourself on Fire is about breaking up and breaking down, and as such the album feels wontedly cathartic, like the moments right after you hit your emotional nadir and start getting your shit together. Stars handle the mood delicately with few slip-ups; my only complaint is that they never handle much of anything else. Save ""The Big Fight""-- which is tame, slow and lounged-out-- there's no controversy, only half-smiles and the soggy aftermath. But even the dearest numbers have faint, nagging undercurrents. The band make no effort to avoid the inevitable charges of over-sentimentality; in fact, they indulge the calls: ""The cold is a vindictive bride,"" reads their website bio, ""she'll trap you between her thighs and turn your heart to ice if you're not careful."" Despite overblown romanticism run rampant, Stars somehow remain understated. It's the ""Soft Revolution"", as the terrific penultimate track declaims. Hop aboard. ","Broken Social Scene associates Stars return for a third set of beautiful, eloquent indie pop.

The Concretes,The Concretes,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63fc0084474cd0c08fd/1:1/w_160/916a1b80.jpg,2004-07-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1571-the-concretes/,AstralwerksLicking Fingers,"The logistics of rock 'n' roll aren't glamorous. While Page, Plant, Jones & Bonham were getting ink for the holes they left in hotel room walls, some poor schlub who worked for the band was on the phone, discussing terms of payment for damages. And when that call ended, he had to make sure the trucks hit the road for the next city on time. Most big tours are actually registered corporations, and they're insured out the ass, but chances are, no one in the audience knows that, because it's just not what people want to hear about their music. Outside of superstar acts and their traveling caravans, though, you have the more common occurrence of a band jamming themselves into a single van, looking for a place to stay every night and dealing with a different promoter in every city, and this is no less fraught with tedious details-- in the end, everyone's just trying to make a living, and if everything doesn't come together like it should, well, everybody loses. Trekking around and making group decisions is difficult enough when you have three or four band members and the occasional lackey, but it's even more ridiculous when you've expanded your lineup to a full-on octet. Just try scheduling studio time for eight people with other things going on in their lives. The Concretes, who first blossomed almost a decade ago as an all-female trio in their native Stockholm, have engaged in just such as expansion project. And although they admit that sometimes eight is a few too many members, they have no plans to kick anyone out for the time being, preferring to stick to their pluralistic, collective way of doing things. The band's democratic process is immediately evident in the music of their self-titled album, which is essentially their debut long-player (their only previous LP-length release, Boyoubetterunow, was a stateside compilation of two early EPs). So even though it took them nearly 10 years to cut a full-length, it seems to have been worth the wait-- the tracks on The Concretes are easily their most accomplished, fluid statement to date. Vocalist Victoria Bergsman initially seems to be rather firmly at the helm, her hazy Edith Frost-y croon providing an axis for the band's swirling Mazzy Starscape. But as the album wears on, it becomes clear that the band is on equal footing with her. She's cast almost totally adrift on ""Lonely as Can Be"", riding rapids of noisy guitar and battling the two-member horn section for melodic supremacy. At any given moment, the music might peel back to reveal a delicate piano or organ motif, only to close back over in a wash of cymbals and massed backing vocals. And even with all that going on, The Concretes still rope in a dozen collaborators, including a string quintet and a harpist, who lend an ethereal hand to closer ""This One's for You"", the band's most overt nod to Mazzy Star's So Tonight That I Might See. While much of the record dwells in deliberately paced big sky country, The Concretes do whip up two amazing up-tempo pop tunes. ""You Can't Hurry Love"" is not a Supremes cover, despite the presence of a song three tracks later titled ""Diana Ross"". Rather, it's a bouncy (and exceedingly short, at just 1:56) blast of summer that sounds more like The Jesus & Mary Chain than Phil Collins. ""Seems Fine"" opens with a horn theme while drummer Lisa Milberg lays down a surf beat, and the band runs through just about every conceivable instrumental combination at their disposal through the verses. And again, it's got concision going for it, running through dozens of variations on a simple theme in barely two minutes. As tough as it may sometimes be to sift through eight different opinions in search of a definitive decision, it sometimes works to a band's advantage: Groups like Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Broken Social Scene face the same obstacle, yet manage to consistently overcome. So maybe there's a democracy at work within a larger group dynamic that can yield greater results-- or perhaps great minds simply think alike.","Swedish day at Pitchfork! Debuting in 1999 with a promising compilation on Up Records, these Stockholm girls' proper debut is a sloppy but satisfying homage to Jesus & Mary Chain and The Pastels.

What the?! Oh, hey, boss... Yikes! The bossman says it's due in a half hour! Guess I'm gonna have to shit this one-sheet out like the rest of them! Okay now, let's see what this album's called. * Tyrannosaurus... oh, brilliant! I've got an idea. A brilliant fucking scheme. Hot hell, I am the world's fucking greatest genius. The press is going to eat this bio up. I won't even need to listen to the album! Ladies and gentlemen of the press, I present to you the first line of the one-sheet...* ""Tyrannosaurus Hives is the biggest party of the year and you're all invited-- even you, Pangaea."" A fine opener! Give me the pulitzer, Mr. Pulitzer, because I am the fucking prize! Shit, did dinosaurs live on Pangaea or Panthalassa? Thalatta Thalatta! Ha. Funny, Xenophon. Anyway, that's a terrible opening line. I better start over. Ahhh finger-snapping fuckface, keep your pants on! I got a good one. ""This album's got rock, it's got roll, and it's named after a dinosaur-- what more could you ask for!"" BAM! Give me the daytime Emmy for press writing, because I am watching TV right now. Hmmm... ""what more could you ask for?"" I guess you could ask for more rock. And I guess it could be named after two dinosaurs instead of one dinosaur. This won't work. * Tyrannosaurus... oh mando, this is it.* ""Tyrannosaurus Hives? More like Tyrannosaurus Awesome!"" That's it! Press packet gold! Good morning, Mr. Newbury. Hello Dr. Caldecott. * Wait, even better!* ""Tyrannosaurus Hives? More like Awesome Hives!"" God, how awesome would it be if there were a dinosaur named Awesome Awesome? Pretty fucking awesome! You know, I'm writing all this stuff... I wonder if Tyrannosaurus Hives is awesome. Maybe I should put on this album. Where's that CD? Oh, hot. Holy drum roll! Mando, this is already better than * Barely Legal and Veni Vidi Vicious. Hmm...* ""Ladies and gentlemen of the press, The Hives are back-- in dinosaur form!"" Nah. I bet everyone is saying that one. ""Finally, the world's first meat-eating album."" Is that true? I don't think that's true. ""Finally, the world's best meat-eating album."" Better. ""You motherfuckers like dinosaurs?"" Back in business! Grammy me, Dr. Caldecott. Oh, this reminds me-- time for a press joke! ""Roar! I'm the Hives' press guy!"" Ha ha, I'm funny. ""Tyrannosaurus Hives sucks!"" Man, am I hilarious. Fuck, I only got 15 minutes now! I gotta buckle down and listen to this album. Okay, this song's called ""Abra Cadaver."" That's pretty good name, maybe I can just whoa! * Sounds like the Stooges on* Raw Power*! So much energy! I got it, I know the opening line now:* ""Tyrannosaurus Hives? More like Diplodocus Stooges!"" Jeez, that song was short! And it wasn't even about dinosaurs! Well, back to square one. ""You're not gonna believe this, but this album isn't even about dinosaurs."" But I can't say that! I haven't even listened to the whole album yet! What's this? ""Walk Idiot Walk""?!?! This has to be about dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are such idiots! They're so stupid! Oh my god, this song sounds like a thousand dinosaurs, all jamming at the same time. The drummer is seriously holding this together with those tom beats, and oh damn, the way Howlin' Pelle Almqvist matches up in unison with the guitar staccato, that's pretty badass. Man, I know what this sounds like-- the fuckin' Stones! ""Mick Jagger's a dinosaur, but Howlin' Pelle Almqvist is a dinosaur."" Ha ha, but the Stones are dinosaurs if you know what I mean! Motherfucking Mary, whenever something sounds like the Stones, I'm gonna say it's stoned*!* ""Get it?! Ha! 'See the robot walk, see the robot talk!' What a great line!"" Ha ha, I love robots. Oh man, ""No Pun Intended"" is straight-up Buzzcocks! The chords are flying here! And that bass drum on the upbeat is killing me. Ha, Pelle just sang, ""So you look for authenticity, but I can't say why it's bothering me."" Pelle, man, relax, this is garage rock*. We're not looking for some new sound here. We're looking for* energy*, dude. We're looking for hooks and unexpected turns and momentary freedom from musical boredom. Smart songwriting and energetic delivery-- you guys have both of them down damn well, and you know what? I don't think you get enough credit. It's really obvious on this album: You guys don't want to change the face of rock music-- you said you just want to be the greatest rock 'n' roll band ever, and I'm happy to meet you on your own terms. But maybe I'm just really high right now.* ""Roar!"" Ha ha. Delete delete delete delete. Whoa, is that a synthesizer I hear now? What's this song called? Hot hot motherfucking heat! ""A Little More for Little You"" swings like a power-pop song! Mandorino, that huge chromatic surf-rock riff on ""B Is for Brutus"" just topples over some solid blues Stones work! I mean, it's fucking stoned*! Wait, new song. ""Diabolic Scheme."" Do I hear strings? Disco time!* ""Arthur Russell is Dinosaur L, but Howlin' Pelle Almqvist is just a Dinosaur."" Damn, Pelle's howlin'. This is terrifying! ""Diabolic Scheme"" has to be the best song on the album. Man, how am I going to tell people about how awesome this crazy fucked-up blues waltz sounds? Oh, I got it! ""Let me tell you something about Chaos Theory, Jeff Goldblum-- The Hives invented it."" Ha ha, that nerd. Oh damn, the boss is back! Stop screaming at me, dude! Shit, I need to give this fucker something prontorino! ""What would you do if I told you a dinosaur was going to make rock 'n' roll extinct?"" Almost done! ""When I say Tyrannosaurus, you say Hives. Tyrannosaurus! Okay, I'll say Hives, too."" Almost almost done! ""Not since the soundtrack to A Land Before Time has an album about dinosaurs been so moving."" One more push! ""Ladies and gentlemen of the press, join me in welcoming Tyrannosaurus Hives into this Jurassic Park we call life."" Whew.","With four years gone since they recorded their worldwide smash Veni Vidi Vicious, Sweden's hardest garage-rockers have had plenty of time to rise to their aspirations of becoming the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band.

Whiskey Tango Ghosts,Tanya Donelly,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f55e6ef95969322aae/1:1/w_160/65b08a90.jpg,2004-07-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2418-whiskey-tango-ghosts/,4AD,"Man, it's gross when mom and dad act cute together. She has to grab his butt every time he's brushing his teeth, and he always has to shout upstairs for ""one last kiss!"" before he heads out the door. Or there's the way she sings to him in the kitchen, ""Let's just gaze in the space between your face and mine,"" and then they smooch 'til everyone's sick. It's great that they have marital bliss-- most couples sure don't-- but do we have to watch it? ""Suddenly I'm in a sea of honey pouring down on me,"" sings Tanya Donelly, and I'm glad she's enjoying that Bath & Body Works gift certificate. All this cooing has the intimacy of a living room music session, with Donelly and hubby Dean Fisher leading a mostly acoustic set of guitars, piano and pedal steel. (That's the Throwing Muses' Dave Narcizo on drums, but he's mostly passing through on his way to borrow the weed whacker.) And as always, Donelly gives us her exquisite punky-pop soprano, which stands on its toes to scratch off a piece of heaven. But even if her solo work has grown calmer and more domestic over the years, she's still handy with a ballad-- especially in the stunned ache of ""Divine Sweet Divine"" or the melody of ""Every Devil"". The title track moves with a nice sashay, but as on her other solo albums, she frontloads the breathtaking songs: Whiskey Tango Ghosts stays satisfied, to the point of sounding undifferentiated. The choice to record this with a small ensemble and spare production makes it cozy, the swells of passion never hit as hard as they should, or sound as lush as they did on 2002's Beautysleep. Donelly sings about a love so strong that she almost loses herself in it, but the music doesn't follow her. It's hard not to compare this album to her half-sister Kristin Hersh's acoustic set, The Grotto, which came out last year on 4AD: Both use stripped-down bands, but more importantly, both albums are focused on marriage. Hersh's record prodded the difficulties and tensions in any relationship, healthy or otherwise, and caught the times that you doubt how healthy it is to begin with. By contrast, Donelly sings as if she's just a week past the wedding and they're still unwrapping each other like presents. Her marriage is her balm. She hints at bad memories and anxieties-- the ""devils"" and ""ghosts"" that float through the lyrics-- but that's all firmly in the past, and her husband is the rock she can turn to, the presence that saves her from rattling around the house alone. Tanya Donelly has earned her contentment. But where does she go from here? Even to a married guy like myself, whose take on the ties that bind falls somewhere between the Hersh and Donelly perspectives, Whiskey Tango Ghosts' happiness overplays its hand. The note of doubt cast by the last song, ""Fallout"", barely sinks in before you hear the bonus track-- a brief a cappella performance of ""Dona Nobis Pacem"" (""Give Us Peace"", for those of you who missed glee club), where Donelly's seraphic voice ushers us away from a domestic scene cast in a snow globe, whose glass must not, will not break.","Third solo outing from the former alternarock queen is her most vapidly domestic to date.

Fight Back!,Icy Demons,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99ec0084474cd0c265c/1:1/w_160/c5f0b802.jpg,2004-07-15 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4155-fight-back/,Cloud,"As collaborations go, Icy Demons are not exactly unprecedented. Featuring Need New Body drummer Pow Pow (née Chris Powell) and Bablicon bassist Griffin Rodriquez (known here as Blue Hawaii), as well as three Chicago musicians sporting their own clever nicknames, Icy Demons' Fight Back! is really more the consummation of an old friendship than a new deal. Bablicon featured heavily on Need New Body's 2001 debut, and there was always bound to be a serviceable halfway point between the bands' respective freeform melting pot and frenetic exertion. Which is all good background, to be sure, but what I really want to know is, if the demons are icy, has Hell frozen over? Because they all look kind of chilly on the album cover (which, incidentally, folds out into an awesome six-panel icy demon family portrait on the reverse of the liners). The album art is weirdly apropos for the music contained within-- the hodgepodge of funky little demons in all kinds of strange colors looks a lot like how the band sounds. Their music is dense, weird and full of strangely hued interludes. It's tempting to call the music a grab bag of styles, but the twist is that these guys are combining styles that never really had names to being with. The odd falsetto vocal melodies that Powell whips up usually spring from an instrumental line buried somewhere in the music, often on a cello or one of Dave ""Thousand Rabbits Running"" McDonnell's many reed instruments. On ""Manny's"", his melody is indirectly doubled by guitarists Matt ""Young Master"" Schneider and Dave ""Moylando Calrissian"" Moyland-- but rather than simply duplicate his vocal line, each guitarist weaves his own slightly dissonant line beneath that roughly follows the same arc, giving the verse an odd Beefheartian flavor. The song later takes off into a prolonged instrumental fantasia led by McDonald's clarinet and Powell's jazz-inflected drumming. Rodriquez's history as an Elephant 6 cohort and the band's standing on Circulatory System's Cloud Recordings label seems all the more logical as you read through the extensive list of guest musicians, who are credited with everything from simple trombone and backing vocals to ""spirit wind."" The free-wheeling structure that trademarks Bablicon's labyrinthine albums is also the guiding principle here, as songs veer into passages of psychedelic bop and florid music box electronica, with subbass beats supplanted by clicking percussion and spoons. ""Desert Toll/Spirit Guide"" is a Fender Rhodes-led dive into Miles Davis' fusion period via Islands-era King Crimson, while the vocal tracks brim with Zappa weirdness and multi-tiered arrangements that suggest Mingus had he given up jazz for Krautrock in his final days. ""Bitter Moon"", meanwhile, is almost a straight pastiche of Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 circa Equinox, with guitar figures that might fit on a Jobim record-- if Robert Fripp was Jobim's guitarist. ""Simian Warlords"" leads Boards of Canada into inhospitable lo-fi territory, while ""The Silent Hero"" opens with Spanish piano and settles into a dub groove coated in shivering guitar interjections and kalimba. Which is all to say that Icy Demons don't really sound entirely like anything else. There are apt comparisons to be found within individual songs, but as a whole, Fight Back! is one hell of a unique concoction, like a prog-fusion orchestron gone completely nuts. As such, it's also unfortunately given to a few long passages (a couple lasting more than one track) of exhausting pasta preparation-- I wish I could say having passages that remind me of the Peter Thomas Sound Orchestra and Mancini spy scores was enough to make for a killer record, but it's really not. That said, most of the material is very strong, and the album is frontloaded with several sublime snatches of out-and-out strangeness. It's not going to cause any major climatic shifts south of Heaven, but it's should please a lot of people in search of their next fix of almost indescribably odd indie rock.","Circulatory System's Cloud Recordings drops this extremely weird collaboration between members of Need New Body and Bablicon.

Corymb,Boom Bip,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3475e6ef959693205f6/1:1/w_160/78c93fa8.jpg,2004-07-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/859-corymb/,Lex,"Like a lemming at a cliff, or a fork-wielding child before a wall socket, I am forever destined to impulsively purchase remix collections and collaborative efforts touting my favorite artists as its contributors, despite the fact that such albums have disappointed for years. These releases promise the potential inherent in a wide spectrum of creative minds refining each other's best qualities, yet tend to instead showcase talented musicians on autopilot. Like anybody else, artists are prone to phoning it in when the stakes aren't high, and can be reluctant to let go of a great idea in the service of someone else's name-- sentiments bluntly summed up in the title of Aphex Twin's last release, 26 Mixes for Cash. Happily, Boom Bip's new offering, Corymb, is one of the few recent remix collections into which it is apparent the contributors have invested thought, effort and care, resulting in an appealing investigation of the variegated sounds surrounding Boom Bip's musical peer group. Corymb is a combination of two EPs released in the last two years, From Left to Right and Morning and a Day. Replicating the coffee-stained packaging concept of his debut, Mr. Bip makes it clear that this is not a new album proper. It is Seed to Sun's companion disc, offering six remixes, three B-sides, and two Peel sessions. All of Boom Bip's new tracks are appealing uptempo instrumentals sharing more in common with each other than do any three songs from his schizophrenic debut. Both ""From Left to Right"" and ""Morning and a Day"" feature spacious guitars laid over bouncy synths; ""In the Tree Top"" begins to explore similar territory, but ends prematurely. The included Peel session versions of Seed to Sun tracks feel a little sprawling against the tight, focused sound elsewhere on this CD, but coherence is not the goal of this collection, and the new version of ""Pulse All Over"" makes for an epic closer. For the most part, Boom Bip's remixers thoughtfully walk the line of augmentation vs. obliteration regarding their source material. The chilly, muzak-laden dissonance in the Boards of Canada's ""Last Walk Round Mirror Lake"" remix adds a sinister touch to the lo-fi guitar that closed out Seed to Sun, and recalls the Boards' 2000 single ""In a Beautiful Place out in the Country"". Venetian Snares' Aaron Funk coaxes a jittery, paranoid track out of ""The Unthinkable"", while (surprisingly) leaving the song-- featuring the voice of Buck 65-- in recognizable form. Conversely, cLOUDDEAD's deconstruction of ""Closed Shoulders"" jumbles Boom Bip's beat-driven original into a drone reminiscent of the instrumental passages on their self-titled debut. Four Tet's excellent take on ""Third Stream"" stutters through a slew of rhythmic typewriter keys before introducing the double bass that anchors both versions of the song. Lali Puna crafts a subdued, uplifting track from the darker and more expansive original ""Awaiting an Accident"". Mogwai's contribution, a sparse remix/retelling of ""The Use of Unacceptable Colors in Nature"" is the only piece without much immediate impact. Listening to it directly in conjunction with the original, however, you can get a sense of the band's intentions as they take one of the most catchy, emotive and dense tracks from Seed to Sun and strip it down to its bones. The process gives interesting insight into what a ""remix"" of a mostly-electronic artist by a mostly-live band can possibly entail. On both of his albums to date, Boom Bip has tended toward contributors whom he himself has remixed, collaborated with, or toured alongside. This is a good way to combat the syndrome of mediocrity often plaguing collections such as Corymb; after all, contractual commitment can compel a track into being, but it is personal commitment that will probably produce a good one. For those artists here who aren't beholden to Boom Bip, the care of their efforts is a telling sign of the respect this multifaceted figure has managed to establish for himself in the music world.","Warp Records' blossoming hip-hop subsidiary Lex Records offers this remix album of the Cincinnati hip-hop artist's work, featuring Boards of Canada, Mogwai, Four Tet, Lali Puna, cLOUDDEAD, and others.

Conductor,The Comas,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a711c0084474cd0c0ae0/1:1/w_160/e182f729.jpg,2004-07-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1771-conductor/,Yep Roc,"At the heart of the indie mindset is a profound disconnect between perception and actuality. The ideal: D.I.Y. ethics, an emphasis on art above marketability, and a purity of purpose that is resistant to fads and monetary influence. The reality: indie bands are receiving six-digit recording advances from major media conglomerates, and are just as ripe for demographic targeting, strategic media placement, and lifestyle branding as ""mainstream"" bands. Indie groups like The Shins, Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse can be heard on teen dramas, late-night talk shows, and in Target, automobile and fast-food television spots. More power to them. I don't posit that the increasing permeability of the membrane between indie and mainstream is an insidious development; instead, it should be acknowledged in the interest of foiling nonsensical Puritanism. While truly market-exempt, homegrown music exists (let's call it indie with a lowercase ""i""), it's undeniable that capital-I Indie Music (i.e. music aimed at the charts that is ""indie"" only in its external mien) is here. Indie Music is big business, and it's absurd to act like it's still being run out of someone's garage. The central paradox is that Indie Bands are marketed as personal choices that express the consumer's highly specific personality and separation from the herd by grouping them within, natch, one large and faceless herd-- at least Avril Lavigne makes no bones about being for the masses. Enter The Comas, who tread this imbricate middle ground between indie and mainstream. Teen dramas on the WB have become a fertile market for Indie Music song placement. Comas singer Andy Herod has done Death Cab and The Shins one better by dating Dawson's Creek's Michelle Williams for a couple years, then writing an album about the relationship and its demise. Conductor was at least partially banked by Warner Bros., who released it overseas before selling the rights for the American release to Yep Roc. Not to mention that the music itself-- alternately dreamy and rocking, aching and pissed indie (make that ""Indie"") pop-- has both the sort of accessible, mainstream appeal and the aura of timeliness that comes from the confluence of elusive cultural currents, the stuff of which crossover hits are made. But the market is fickle, and what will break big seems almost arbitrary. Regardless of whether or not The Comas push through, Conductor is an accomplished pop/rock album that, while being more sonically akin to The Stills, shares Death Cab's sense of accessibility and emotional transparency. The album opens with ""The Science of Your Mind"", an ominous minor-key guitar drone bolstering a mobile lead melody and Herod's sleek, hooky vocals: ""Help me make this go away/ Like you burned up all my faith."" Like all the superbly sequenced and tonally contiguous songs on Conductor, it conveys a sense of starry darkness and alien landscapes inspired-- if one believes press release mythology-- by Herod's repeated viewing of the film Dark City. ""Moonrainbow"" is an acoustic-sounding ballad that moves through subtle orchestral pop movements and breathy falsettos. And ""Tonight on the WB"" represents the more woozy, fuzz-rock side of The Comas, blurring the lines between Williams' role in Herod's life and her role in sundry dramatic entertainment: ""We love it when you fall apart/ You turn it into higher art."" The album is accompanied by a DVD, Conductor: The Movie, which was written and directed by filmmaker/animator Brent Bonacorso. It features videos for each song that seamlessly blend into a unified aesthetic statement, an elliptical science-fiction love story with appearances by Williams and Herod that is visually informed by a blend of live footage and polished animation (robots and weird floating schematics galore), the technologically haywire topology of the aforementioned Dark City, and a rather cool visual effect of light pouring off objects in bubbles. Like Conductor the album, the film pulls no punches in its quest for a highly refined effect: It is resolutely hi-fi, looks unabashedly expensive, outsourced and D.I.W.C.A. (Do It With Corporate Assistance) and is-- paired with the songs-- the product of a distinct and ambitious intent to be a veritable event, to distinguish itself from the throng of decent yet interchangeable indie rock releases.","Third album from these Chapel Hill indie rockers shares Death Cab for Cutie's sense of accessibility and emotional transparency.

Lesson No. 1,Glenn Branca,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37d13d1975652138ad5/1:1/w_160/85163b1c.jpg,2004-07-15 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/910-lesson-no-1/,9999,"When Glenn Branca's ""Symphony No. 8"" was performed in Denmark at an arts festival attended by the queen and several dignitaries, the press described the effect of his music as ""sound terror."" For Branca, there is no such thing as ""too loud"": His most recent composition is an ensemble for 100 electric guitars. But Branca's album releases are far less grandiose than his live performances. While works such as ""Symphony No. 1"" for sixteen performers have overwhelmed audiences with their disorientingly high volumes, oil-drum percussion and Branca's spastic conducting style, the live sound is too large to be even approximated through two speakers, leaving a listener to wonder what the big deal was about. In contrast, last year's reissue of The Ascension and this year's Lesson No. 1 contain earlier works for small ensembles. They may not have shattered as many eardrums, but on CD the sound remains close enough to grab hold of you and lift you into Branca's intense world. The first two pieces on this album, ""Lesson No. 1"" and ""Dissonant""-- originally released in 1980-- comprise Branca's first solo release after leaving punk/no-wave outfit Theoretical Girls. The liner notes quote him as regarding ""Lesson No. 1"" as a simple experiment in minimalism. Simple or not, it is most certainly huge. It begins with two guitars picking out pulsating Reichian riffs, before introducing a triumphant one-note wall of sound with organ and bass shifting underneath to give a sense of harmonic movement. It contains the seeds of Branca's future work with cells of tonal noise, and today can't help but bring to mind everything from the seared distorted walls of My Bloody Valentine to the triumphant crescendos of Godspeed You Black Emperor! to Oneida's ultra-repetitive jams. The guitars increasingly bend in pitch as the piece continues, exploring a microtonal world of detuned strings. Like minimalist composer Rhys Chatham-- with whom he briefly played before they became rivals-- Branca was interested in highlighting the harmonics extant in battling waveforms and the sounds that naturally emerge from repetition. As ""Lesson No. 1"" encapsulates the ecstatic drama of future instrumental post-rock, ""Dissonance"" foretells the broken industrial sound of many composers to come, especially that of the Bang on a Can collective with whom Branca has associated himself in recent years. Scored for guitar, keyboards, bass, drums and sledgehammer, ""Dissonance"" replicates the pounding honking perpetual motion of city life, shifting in and out of polyrhythmic experimentation and more chugging guitar work. ""Dissonance"" dispels any notion that Branca's complexity might only be rhetorical. Whether you want to call it punk-fueled anti-prog or recontextualized art music, it is complicated stuff, requiring great practice from the instrumentalists and mental engagement on the listener's part. Some classicists proclaim rock incapable of the emotional subtlety and variation of orchestral music. The extra inclusion of ""Bad Smells""-- a piece written for Twyla Tharp's dance company in 1982 and played by an ensemble including Sonic Youth members Thurston Moore and Lee Renaldo-- spends 16 minutes dispelling that notion. Though still a relatively early composition for Branca, it contains an overwhelming variety of moods and textures-- reverie, humor, triumph, anger, struggle-- and makes this CD worth considering even if you own the previous reissue of Lesson No. 1. This release also includes a video showing Branca conduct a part of his ""Symphony No. 5"", and it is a powerful thing to watch as this composer frantically embodies the electric energy of his own music-- or maybe it's the other way around.","Originally issued in 1980, Glenn Branca's first symphony for guitars now sees reissue through the Acute label that re-released his essential 1981 masterwork, The Ascension, last year. Lesson No. 1 is Branca's first great work, and documents the birth of a career whose influence would spread to everyone from Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine to Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Mogwai and Black Dice.

Animal Serenade,Lou Reed,by: Stephen May,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a244ea9e61561daa49cf/1:1/w_160/08cefae8.jpg,2004-07-14 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6738-animal-serenade/,Warner Bros.,"When Lou Reed recently posed with The Strokes for a photo shoot in Filter magazine, the connection was clear: Julian Casablancas has appropriated, if not completely ripped off, Lou's trademark sing/speak delivery and older-than-its-years vocal texture, and the band's guitar sound-- approximately two parts chug, one part ring-- owes no small debt to the ringing chug that Lou honed to syringe-tip perfection in The Velvet Underground. Unquestionably, Lou's legend lives. But what about his music? Given his recent dalliances into updating Edgar Allen Poe (The Raven) and exploring possum life (""Like a Possum"", from the lyrically unambitious Ecstasy), the faithful had begun to worry. And so, inevitably, it was time for a live album; enter Animal Serenade. Last time Lou released record with ""Animal"" in the title, his career was in similar (if more potentially promising) straits. Fresh off 1973's Berlin, the critical and commercial disappointment we now know to be brilliant in its own self-consciously morbid-as-fuck kind of way, Lou-- still just a year removed from ""Walk on the Wild Side"" and the Billboard Top 20-- rallied the troops, donned pancake makeup and a studded dog collar, and spat out Rock 'n' Roll Animal, a slick, hard rock reconsideration of his career, and the definitive live document of Lou Reed, Clown Prince of Smack. Animal Serenade, released a non-coincidental 30 years later, aspires to be the live document of the more refined Lou: he of the leather pants, sunglasses, and the obligatory sleeveless black t-shirt; he who is presumably inclined to ditch his buddies for three-hour tai chi sessions and readings of Faust; he who is on a one-man, Neil-from-Real World: London-like crusade to find the sound so pure as to cause people to shit themselves (""I had an acoustic guitar with the sound of diamonds,"" enthused Lou in the liner notes for Perfect Night: Live in London). The song selection, that of an aging artist dependent on his cult, works something like a Rush setlist. Lou and his band offer subtle updates of some but not all of the old favorites (""Men of Good Fortune"", ""Venus in Furs"", ""The Day Jack Kennedy Died"", ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", etc.) Newer and/or ""overlooked"" cuts are hidden inside clusters of more familiar ones, presumably with the implication that, the occasional fuck-up (""Sex with Your Parents Part 2"", ""Egg Cream"", the aforementioned ""Possum"", etc.) notwithstanding, Lou can still write powerful, smart, deceptively simple songs. Maybe. Still, the old warhorses are the draw on Animal Serenade, and for the most part, they're given tasteful, appealing (if unspectacular) readings, with cellist Jane Scarpantoni adding texture and Lou's rhythm section laying down the usual workmanlike, just-a-little-too-diligent-for-its-own-good foundation. Lou is in good voice and in a fine mood, even playful in places. (""As in most things in life, it's that little hop in the end,"" he jokes of the fourth chord in ""Sweet Jane"". Of course, he doesn't actually play ""Sweet Jane"".) The two-hour-plus runtime is gratuitous; probably the idea was to present the complete show (a la Alive by Kiss), but the effect is mind-numbing, and most of the successful experiments are lost in well-mannered gray. Two songs cut through the fog. The Fernando Saunders-penned ""Reiven Cherie"", the title apparently French for ""Ersatz Stevie Wonder"", is painfully out of place, overlong, and almost completely unrewarding. Antony, a bold if appropriate choice for a singer on ""Candy Says"", re-imagines the number as a tragedy, his quivering voice practically dripping with knowing pain, peeling decades of rust off the lyrics, imparting them with feeling, making them new. Maybe Lou Reed can't be vital anymore. Maybe he's too old, too far removed from the experiences that shaped him. But Animal Serenade proves that his best songs are locked forever in the present-- ageless, timeless, constant, and true; unlike their author, they are immortal.","Lou Reed's new double-disc live release, recorded last year in Los Angeles, offers updates of several old favorites, with some more recent material sandwiched between.

Road Movies,John Adams,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a3b1335d7bf16982ea/1:1/w_160/839bd47c.jpg,2004-07-14 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/448-road-movies/,Nonesuch,"When John Adams was awarded the 2003 Pulitzer Prize in music for his September 11th memorial piece ""On the Transmigration of Souls"", he was expected to greet the honor with polite gratitude. Instead, he blasted the awards committee for ignoring ""many, if not most of the country's greatest musical minds... in favor of academy composers"" over the past 50 years, noting that they had failed to recognize popular figures Philip Glass and Laurie Anderson, pioneers like John Cage, or any jazz artists such as Thelonious Monk. Adams cares deeply about the state of American music past and present, and has always been a populist post-minimalist. Where his peers have turned to world or academic music for inspiration, he's comfortable referencing the sweeping pastorals of Aaron Copland, the jumbled marching-band Americana of Charles Ives, or the so-called ""Jewish melancholy"" embedded in the past century of New York art music. It is his unique style, as well as a tempering of any romanticized views of his country, that usually prevents these influences from carrying his music into realms of fluff and cheese. Road Movies gathers piano pieces written throughout most of Adams' career (the selections were originally composed between 1977 and 2001). Unlike most of his peers, Adams' music has grown neither stagnant nor obtuse as he's aged, probably because he hasn't committed himself to a particular musical dogma. That's not to say that the works on Road Movies don't vary in quality; however, the two standout pieces, ""Hallelujah Junction"" and ""Phrygian Gates"", are both inspired compositions that stand as prime distillations of Adams' style. 1996's ""Hallelujah Junction"" is a vertiginous composition for two pianos, exhibiting the unbroken stream of consciousness apparent in Adams' best work. The music effortlessly flows from one rhythmic and harmonic figure to the next as each piano compels the other into new territory. After exploring grand pastoral beauty in movements I and II-- and hinting at various styles of folk and popular music along the way-- movement III loses itself in a frenzied, dissonant boogie. It's not the ending I'd have chosen, but when you've been composing for more than 20 years, I guess you get sick of transcendental finales. The composition recalls both Steve Reich's experiments in combining several instruments of the same timbre, as well as the shifting rhythmic fluidity driving Louis Andriessen's more frenetic works. ""Phrygian Gates"" (1977) for solo piano is the piece that Adams considers his official ""Opus I."" It established a sound that would come to be recognized as uniquely his, attracting wide attention upon its release and unofficially challenging Philip Glass to the title of ""world arpeggio overlord."" It was written as Adams' attempt to evoke the constantly modulating, shifting structures of waves, which it does beautifully. Rolf Hind's interpretation on this recording, though less emotive than others, is admirable in its machinelike virtuosity. It masterfully highlights the subtle rhythmic shifts and angular transitions that lend resonance to the work's unique momentum. Less exciting are ""American Berserk"" (2001) and the title piece (1995). ""American Berserk"" explores the chaos approached at the end of ""Hallelujah Junction"". Its Bartok-like application of folk rhythms to a disjointed and ferocious melodicism is interesting but on the whole, not very exciting. The title is taken from Philip Roth's American Pastoral, a phrase used to describe the ""desperation of the counterpastoral"" that confronts the book's characters through the realities of the Vietnam War. Given this context-- and the year of the piece's composition-- one can infer that ""American Berserk"" was most likely written in the months directly following 9/11, and it cannot help but resonate with the event. Like much of the reactionary art created during that period of initial shock, it is powerful in context but does not retain its impact independently, a fate avoided by the his distanced and thoughtful Pulitzer winner ""On the Transmigration of Souls"". ""Road Movies"" is a piece for solo violin and piano, and while its second movement, ""Meditative"", is a quiet masterpiece, casting a fragile fog of empty fourths and fifths around a slight bluesy lilt, the first and last sections of the piece are underwhelming. Adams attempts to capture the frantic energy of bluegrass fiddling here, but the solo violin turns out to be a misjudgment of instrumentation. It doesn't have enough harmonic complexity to carry the force of its repetitive motives and static sixteenth notes against the percolating figures of the piano. Still, this-- along with Shaker Loops & Phrygian Gates-- is a good place for those unfamiliar with Adams. Piano works serve as a good entry point when it comes to a composer such as John Adams, whose orchestral output might alienate some, many of whom could consider his classical works all pomp and circumstance.","Nonesuch Records issues the new release from this minimalist composer who won 2003's Pulitzer Prize for his September 11th memorial piece, ""On the Transmigration of Souls"".

Sixteen Songs,Don Zientara,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab4ec0084474cd0c134f/1:1/w_160/4060c704.gif,2004-07-14 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8958-sixteen-songs/,Northern Liberties,"Toward the end of ""Sing a Song with You"", from Don Zientara's debut solo album Sixteen Songs, a phone rings in the background, its insistent digital purr interrupting his acoustic guitar strumming and stage-whisper vocals. Seemingly unrehearsed, it more or less determines the song's finale, as Zientara quickly wraps it up and answers the phone: ""Inner Ear."" Yes, it's that Inner Ear, the studio Zientara founded in Washington, D.C. during the late 1970s, where he has produced acts like Fugazi, Q & Not U, Bad Religion, Rites of Spring, and Deceased. And yes, to record Sixteen Songs, Zientara forsook all the technological marvels of the modern recording studio and apparently set up his analog machine at the receptionist's desk. Whenever Zientara gets excited and the song builds to a climax, as on ""Waiting for the Muse"", the machine can barely capture all the sound, and the resultant muddiness implies real intimacy and vulnerability. The sub-demo quality of the album, like a field recording or some 60s troubadour's lost tapes, is purposeful, the underproduced and lo-fi-primitive sound intended to convey unprepossessing spontaneity: Zientara wants you to think he recorded these songs off-the-cuff, possibly during his coffee break. And most likely he did. He calls his approach ""minimalism"" in the short liner notes: ""Most important is the fact that with a single voice there is a littleness... a feeling that the singer is no more important than the person listening, probably less so."" As a veteran producer's manifesto, those words are a bit meandering and unedited, much like the music itself, but the album's basic cardboard packaging and matter-of-fact title would seem to bear out his message of ""littleness."" But Zientara is a producer first, a musician second. The intimacy on Sixteen Songs sounds practiced, which makes the album's murkiness seem a little calculated. He wants to remove himself from the music completely, to subjugate his ego to the songs themselves-- a noble effort, but an impossible feat. The more he tries to erase his own identity, the more obvious such machinations become, like the guy in the bar whose pick-up line is that he has no pick-up line. Sixteen Songs isn't a lie, though; it's just a casual feint. Lyrically, these songs try to be about real things, but ineluctably they circle back on themselves. As the song title ""Sing a Song with You"" implies, the album's evocations aren't emotional but musical, which Zientara seems to realize deep down. These aren't songs about life or love, pain or happiness, but about how cool Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens were, about recording at the office and taking your work home with you, about music being the single defining aspect of your life and the excitement of pure creation.","Founder of D.C.'s legendary Inner Ear Studios and producer of classic Fugazi, Dismemberment Plan and Minor Threat albums offers this solo release via the Dischord-distributed Northern Liberties label.

I didn't do this. I'm going to have to throw this couch out. But where? How can I even ask myself something like that? Fuck, I need... I need to go out. Where are my cigarettes? I have to turn the music off. Was this going on the entire time? I can't remember playing this. Don't forget to erase the messages. Don't start crying. Come on, fuck, stand up. Pick yourself up. Did anyone hear me? He still seems awake. Maybe he is awake. Do you think he'd be mad? Should I pick him up? I have to move him and clean this room. How am I going to do that? I have to do it tonight. He would hate me if he could see this. I can't think about this now, I have to go out. Where are my cigarettes? Fuck, cats, where did you put my cigarettes? Turn the bathroom light off. Turn all of them off, don't forget. Set the alarm clock. I can't think about this right now. Don't look at him, it makes you sick. I have to write tonight. Nothing will be open now. I can go to the field near the highway and sit down. This shirt is sweaty. I hope no one is there. I already miss you. How are you? Where are you? Could you see me? Were you mad? I was mad, I know it. I'm sorry for everything, and I really do hate myself. I hope you know that. I think you're going to haunt me until the day I die. Listen, I have to write tonight, so I'm going to have to file you away for a while. God, we came so close. We went to the very end, and I know you didn't mean everything you said. Or maybe you did. Heh, you bleed like a motherfucker. I'm sorry, I just didn't expect it. I don't know what I expected. I have to write tonight. Houston's premier avant-folk trio has done it again. Ack, what a terrible way to start a review-- especially for this band, for this record. Charalambides (Tom and Christina Carter, Heather Leigh Murray) have a way of making openers and brief descriptions seem worthless, like covering cakes with the bodies of grasshoppers and dead leaves. Haha, no. Like the knowledge of your own end: Whatever you might want to say about it seems overwhelmingly lacking, disrespectful. The estimable Peter Pott says any review that reveals its own uselessness is doomed from the start, yet in the case of Joy Shapes*, that's entirely fitting. Its music dooms, from Tom Carter's opening three-note toll to Murray's obscene ghost-calls to a rotten garden of mutated strings and hollow bodies panging away into my blank face. I wish you could hear it. I'd love to see the faces of a million frozen capitalists (me and Bob hate you, Pitchformula) forced to listen to this, held captive in a theater a la* A Clockwork Orange*, with visions of their assorted ideas of a black, holy void playing before them to this music. Yeah, Charalambides have done it again, and I wish

                                                                                                         could

                                                                                                                      it.* What a beautiful night. All the cars passing by look like fireflies. They move by slowly and resolutely, but I can't really hear them. I can hear the grass, and I think that's a breeze. Sometimes the wind sounds like someone singing. What a stupid thing to say. I've really got to start writing greeting cards, there's probably good money in that. But it's true, sometimes the wind sounds like a fucked-up cabaret singer, just letting loose with moans and whispers like she doesn't care who hears it. Why should she care? What did Madison say? ""All the bad choices ppl make for themselves come down to thinking they're a person that they're not."" Maybe so. But this singing couldn't care less. It winds through desperate weeds and my hair, and would sooner level the city behind me than stop to consider who it is, why it's singing. Crazy, what music can do. How am I going to live with myself? The droning, consonant pull of the title track doesn't so much ebb and flow as drift, always towards some pristine reservoir. I don't normally associate ""bliss"" with this band, and though it's unfair to assume soft, major-keyed trance necessarily equates to bliss, I fall into the trap this time. But it's a bliss that discards expected notions of peaceful resolve and acceptance; Joy Shapes plays for people who realize what terrible things they are capable of (or have already done) and are leaping hopelessly into areas of the mind safely buffered from the real world. Some people call this ""transcendent."" ""Stroke"" is similar, at least insofar as it sticks to major keys (and devilish sevenths) and gentle processions, though is wilder at heart. It has distant chimes, ringing in no obvious order or tonality, that make everything positioned on top of them seem heavenly. When the female voices enter almost seven minutes in, I struggle to compare them to anything-- maybe it's reminiscent of the last song on Vision Creation Newsun*, when the savage Boredoms shed their spikes and let the blood on their teeth dry as they slept. Charalambides don't play with sharp teeth; they're wild like vines and centipedes.* Had I known you could bleed this much I might've reconsidered. But we'll see each other again. And I know I'll get everything that's coming to me. Fuck, even now, as I'm standing over you, torn and broken, you seem amazing. Did I do this? You still feel here, not here. I could never really hate you. Jesus, I didn't do this. As Joy Shapes unwinds with a gradual, near-violent climax of howling feedback, doubled by voices disconnected from their bodies on ""Voice for You"", it occurs to me that these songs aren't so much hymns of passing to the other side as murder ballads. They're for murdering daydreams and the outside world; killing off connections to other music, and mental archives kept around in case you forget what ""joy"" and terror are supposed to feel like. I guess I should say that it's the best Charalambides album I've heard, if that makes a difference. And it's not that I think daydreams should be killed, but that some music has a way of sparking more than just your everyday escapism. That's healthy, right? Of course it is.","Houston-based avant-folk trio's latest Kranky release discards all expected notions of peaceful resolve and acceptance; Joy Shapes plays for people who realize what terrible things they are capable of.

The Tipping Point,The Roots,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2aa9d034d5c69bf2c57/1:1/w_160/719400fd.jpg,2004-07-14 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6834-the-tipping-point/,Geffen,"In seventh grade, I caught the bug and paid a really pretty girl $15 for a Roots cassette bootleg she'd made. The group at this point had become a minor street phenomenon in the local alt-weeklies, but Black Thought's city-specific freestyles over ?uestlove's soul-powered grooves still remained a guarded Philadelphia secret. The Roots had also garnered attention then for having attending the prestigious Creative and Performing Arts high school (CAPA), as the school's artistic mission was so rigidly anti-popular and l'art pour l'art. It was win/win: The CAPA tag offered The Roots instant artistic legitimacy, and The Roots made CAPA the coolest place in the world. Six records in, several Roots members are no longer even Philadelphians, let alone CAPA alums. Still, I've always tried to understand each Roots album as capturing the band's original CAPA vs. Pop paradox: smart lyrics and jazz backbeats whose abstract tendencies never came at the expense of accessibility. By 1999's Things Fall Apart, however, The Roots had discovered a balance within that paradox and fulfilled their initial promise, and 2002's experimental Phrenology documented the band at a critical point of self-revision: Beyond the intense creative pressure The Roots put on themselves and their genre, they also added a guitarist, said farewell to Malik B., and welcomed more guest spots than ever before. There's something to be said for the fact that Phrenology housed both The Roots' most difficult songs and two extremely successful radio singles, ""The Seed (2.0)"" and ""Break You Off"". On The Tipping Point, though, The Roots forgo experimentation altogether, focusing their energy on a new direction: adult-oriented rap. For an album borne from jam sessions-- a technique the band employed to guide them toward a looser feel-- this is easily the flattest and most Grammy-conscious album The Roots have made. Its majority carelessly regurgitates the painful cliches of ""enlightened"" hip-hop's critical and commercial darlings, while the band falls back on their organic hip-hop sound as a gimmick and piles on guest appearances to disguise their lack of creativity. In other words, if you thought ?uestlove's cameo on Joss Stone's putrid ""Fell in Love with a Boy"" was a regrettable misstep, pull up a trashcan and get ready to wretch. Opening track ""Star"" reveals that The Roots have become more chimerical than ever: Here, the band drums up a faux-Timbaland beat that fights with a sample of Sly & The Family Stone's ""Everyone Is a Star"", while Black Thought assures us, ""This ain't pop like Kylie Minogue."" Unfortunately, that may be the track's lyrical peak. By the outro, The Roots have slumped into a neo-soul take on The Spinners' ""It's a Shame""-- just the first of many in The Tipping Point's soulless neo-soul fluff-track cadre. Sadly, The Roots seem to be following the Black Eyed Peas' lead on The Tipping Point-- and not just musically. Among the album's giant lyrical flops are: ""Yeah, it ain't nothin' like the rush I get in front of the band/ On stage with the planet in the palm of my hand"" (from the album's atrocious first single ""Don't Say Nothin'""), ""This rap game is like selling coke legally"" (off ""Somebody's Gotta Do It""), and finally, ""Why""'s caricatured insight, ""Some people's chasing their dream/ Some people's chasing their high."" The record doesn't fare much better elsewhere: ""Guns Are Drawn"" is a Reflection Eternal C-side; ""Boom!"", on which Thought impersonates Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap, wants to be Beastie but barely puts up a fight to party; and ""Duck Down"" brings us back to Timbo-esque beats, this time with a kickdrum sound that drowns out the hornlines that may otherwise have served as the track's only saving grace. The Tipping Point does have two bright spots: ?uestlove beats the hell out of his cymbal while managing a slew of stop/starts and a sick minimal stomp on ""The Web"", and the Kranz beat and river of great guest rhymes on hidden track ""The Mic"" is ironically the album's most fun cut. Both songs are straightforward raps, and stick out on The Tipping Point precisely for this unadorned simplicity; by and large, the album is much too concerned with playing it safe, and generally fails for its lack of casual insouciance. Illadelph Halflife and Things Fall Apart opened with the following warning: ""Inevitably, hip-hop albums are treated as though they are disposable. They're not maximized as product even, you know, not to mention as art."" The sample is appropriately absent from The Tipping Point. There's no doubt that The Roots have maximized their product with this record; unfortunately, it's resulted in their first disposable release.","Sixth studio album from Philly hip-hop mainstays The Roots forgoes the experimentation of 2002's Phrenology in favor of a safer-- and less rewarding-- approach.

Birth of a Lover,Nice Device,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9729d034d5c69bf5216/1:1/w_160/98bebca7.gif,2004-07-13 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5902-birth-of-a-lover/,TND,"Too much pop can make you dizzy. It fizzes up inside; you start saying things like ""neato."" Pop's better in moderation, but it's best with whiskey, and The Nice Device know it. For a self-released debut EP, the Detroit fivesome's Birth of a Lover is one professional package, punching out seven songs in under 20 minutes and preferring bare-knuckle performance to bubblegum pussyfooting. Andrea Gbur wails like a female Jim Ellison, and something in the harder edge of her voice says she knows what girls want, too, but on a track like ""Never Be My Man"", their racket is focused like solid state fuzz. The Nice Device aren't going to get all cute on you and start chirping about love puppies over syrupy string sections. No, ""My Little Birdie"" and ""Oh Me Oh My"" are powered by a blown tweeter rhythm guitar that cranks like it's trying to kick over an old motorbike. The keyboards are in the garage-rock vein, adding color to the choruses with vintage tones. And yet, the hooks keep bringing Lover right back to pop. Indeed, The Nice Device aren't staying in the garage, and they're certainly not wasting time noodling in the studio; they're playing out in the street, busting open fire hydrants with bursts of summertime-friendly hard pop. Okay, they did have to spend some time in the studio. But the gritty straightforwardness brought to the proceedings by White Stripes and Mooney Suzuki producer Jim Diamond keeps these proceedings sufficiently raw, while the Brendan Benson-produced tracks showcase a rare poppy economy. The Nice Device even layer some dynamics into the brief Lover. ""How Low How Obscene"" slices up bibles at a slinky crawl, and features a few more of the clever vocal overdubs that surface throughout. These, of course, only further characterize Gbur, constantly preventing a fade into the chick-singer fog. ""Back to the City""'s coed harmonies are great as well, and the song's ambitious, Bowie-meets-The Go arrangement makes for a nice change of pace. Still, The Nice Device's knockout shot is straight-up, stripped-down rock 'em sock 'em hard pop bop. On ""Gotta Get It"", Gbur's brassy wail is like a come-hither finger from the darkest alley in the city, and ""My Little Birdie"" strikes a balance between charming sugar high and nuts 'n' bolts junkyard cacophony.

Skalpel,Skalpel,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67713d19756521391ba/1:1/w_160/e6868d65.jpg,2004-07-13 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7768-skalpel/,Ninja Tune,"After over a decade operating under a distinct musical aesthetic, Ninja Tune's electrified nu-jazz template is so well established that it's now become a reference point for most downtempo breakbeat releases. Signature artists like Amon Tobin, Cinematic Orchestra and Coldcut have set the mold by which the London-based label combs for artists, and for the most part, it's been uncannily successful in tracking down their ilk wherever they lurk. Their latest project dips into the unlikely breeding grounds of Wroclaw, Poland to spotlight an emerging duo who've gained major acclaim in their homeland but not much further beyond. Skalpel, first ""discovered"" by Ninja Tune's Russian futurist DJ Vadim on an Eastern European tour, is comprised of Marcin Cichy and Igor Pudlo, two jazzophile DJs whose slinky, filmic debut fits perfectly into the Ninja Tune template. The question is whether or not that's a good thing. Skalpel are certainly more than adept at what they do; their seamless blend of dusty 50s and 60s Polish jazz records is technically flawless and their subdued, dramatic compositions are stirring. If you're looking for a new kick, however, you won't find it here-- the recipe, though originating from an ethnically left-field kitchen, is tried and true. You've heard it done before by their labelmates and others, a reverence for fantasy basement jam sessions peopled by the likes of Miles, Elvin, Herbie and Shorter, processed through a funky breaks blender to yield a sonic frappe both thoroughly modern and strangely reminiscent, something almost completely subliminal. Perhaps Skalpel's four shows for Ninja Tune's Solid Steel radio program over the past couple years set the album on its beeline course; right out of the gates it bumps and jostles into warmly familiar territory a la Cinematic Orchestra's seminal Motion. A uniquely playful sense of kitschy humor first surfaces within the rubbery double bass and old-time vocal samples of ""Not Too Bad"" and ""1958"", where a staid female voice instructs, ""Let them play their jazz albums, and dance all night if they want to."" Actually too subdued for all but the most blunted dance floors, these songs possess an understated bounce and horn-led levity best suited for a headphone symphony. The voluptuous sound of hard-plucked upright bass and perfectly crisp snare keeps the pulse just above comatose, floating in a comfortably lullabied middle ground. But most of all, it's the album's fluid, meandering solo samples that help push Skalpel above decaffeinated café jazz. The inclusion of liner notes detailing the original players they've sampled here gives some insight into their modus operandi, and a pleasant effect of the duo keeping enough of the original players' bars intact is that the music absorbs some of the soloists' stylistic overtones, without ever feeling like shameless plundering. A few tracks midway through Skalpel raise the album to its peak. The rolling cymbals and electronic atmospherics of ""So Far"" pair with minor-key piano and horns to progress through nighttime byways; ""Break In"" leads off with a psychedelic flourish before delving into an indiscernible horn current broken by ethereal vibraphone and dubby studio tricks; the kinky organ run on ""Quiz"" steadily builds and changes as the song progresses. On these songs, Skalpel smudge the line between organic and electronic effortlessly, like a landscape artist working with charcoal, creating deep nuances of light and shadow that give the work its overall depth. The Polish language samples on ""Theme from Behind the Iron Curtain"" are a welcome reminder of the music's origins, coming right before the serene dream of ""Sculpture"" that gently closes the album. With Skalpel, Ninja Tune adds to its roster another peddler of dreamy, jazzy breaks-- the kind of innocuous, idealized electro jazz that smacks to some people of played-out formula. But for fans of the style, there's a whole lot of to enjoy on this debut. Its rhythmic dexterity and melodic sweep are hard to deny-- as long as you can swallow that sense of having heard it all before.","Ninja Tune exports Skalpel cut up dusty 50s and 60s Polish jazz records, but those looking for a new kick won't find it here-- the album is strictly tried-and-true.

Light Flows the Putrid Dawn,Blackout Beach,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45c5e6ef95969320861/1:1/w_160/c9a574d4.jpg,2004-07-13 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1117-light-flows-the-putrid-dawn/,Soft Abuse,"Imagine you're drifting off to sleep after having just performed for two hours to sweaty indie freaks in a smoky, rundown venue when a stout, woodsy Canadian shoves The Odyssey in your face again and forces you to keep reading. An unlikely scenario, to be sure, but it apparently happened repeatedly to Dan Bejar this past spring when Carey Mercer and his band Frog Eyes supported Destroyer on tour: hyper-literate (though not in any rigid academic sense), Mercer almost religiously takes every possible chance to digest the classics and proclaim their greatness to others, as if the works were his own personal discoveries. His enthusiasm, for all the quirky ways it manifests itself, is very genuine-- 500 years from now, I can imagine someone touting The Beatles, who by then will surely be relegated to historical academia, with the same intensity. We're given some vague sense of Mercer's high-pitched Homeric fervor on his Frog Eyes recordings, but on Light Flows the Putrid Dawn, his solo debut as Blackout Beach, it's very clear that the British Canadian bard has internalized a distinctly classical vocabulary and all its accompanying metaphors. Combine these anachronisms with Mercer's fragmented, imagistic approach to lyrics and his feral, operatic delivery, and Light Flows the Putrid Dawn proceeds like some dense Delphic prophecy-- for our own sake, we can't keep ourselves from deciphering it. The album's brief runtime (less than 24 minutes) is more than compensated for by the overwhelming density of the music. Opener ""If I Were Not Alexander..."" proceeds slowly, but remains impossibly disorienting: Mercer's impenetrable Central Park soothsaying competes with his equally cryptic guitar soloing, to which tickles of piano and accordion are distantly allied. ""The Swineherd Sings..."" follows as the more melodic and intelligible counterpart, as Mercer sings of Stalin, ""I ain't no great fan of men/ It is men that built this damn pen."" Mercer switches gears for the psycho-waltzes ""Krull Courtship"" and ""The Stuttered XXX Breeze XXX"", two songs that aptly justify the frequent Bowie comparisons. Elsewhere on Light Flows the Putrid Dawn, Mercer situates himself firmly on the Rock Side of the burgeoning freak-folk movement: Sparse, overdubbed guitar tracks like ""The Putrid Dawn Is Only for Us Baby"" and ""New Soft and Shimmering Motherhood Alliance"" might draw comparisons to the San Francisco noise-pop outfit Iran, and especially on ""Meadows and Pleasant Madames..."", Mercer's lupine croons and the accompanying hellish miasma are closely reminiscent of Tim Buckley. On the relatively stiff closing march ""The Quiet Merchant Gets His Song Too"", Mercer tries his best to rhythmically mask the intense pain with which he wrings out alcohol's often devastating consequences: ""Oh mothers, I feel for you."" For all Putrid Dawn's musical merits, Mercer's voice is still admittedly a tough sell. On Frog Eyes' past releases, he's sometimes sounded incongruous, either because the instrumentation didn't match his bravado, or because the accompaniment simply disregarded it. It's a well-warranted reservation to harbor when approaching Blackout Beach (which was recorded prior to 2003's The Golden River), but one that may safely be put to rest. Mercer is simply never out-of-sync with himself here, and his vocal melodies benefit from his bizarre but undeniably singular orchestrations. As listeners, we can tell Mercer clearly knows what he wants out of these songs-- even if we don't know exactly what that entails.","Up-and-coming Brooklyn-based avant/free-folk label Soft Abuse issues this debut solo outing from Frog Eyes frontman Carey Mercer.

Let It Die,Feist,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be9bea9e61561daa790e/1:1/w_160/13c16771.jpg,2004-07-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3314-let-it-die/,Arts & Crafts,"Anyone who has ever seen Broken Social Scene perform in their A1 configuration knows that Leslie Feist (singer of You Forgot It in People's ""Almost Crimes"") has roughly six backrooms worth of charisma stockpiled in her lighter pocket alone. Yet, despite that her tenure in the scene-stealing department extends back to her days with the middling indie rock outfit By Divine Right, Feist has always approached her solo career with agonizing apprehension. Her solo debut, Monarch, appeared in 1999, and while a serviceable indie rock record, it did little to communicate the swaggery gleam of her stage persona. Nearly five years removed from that debut, Let It Die finds Feist in a radically different state of mind, completely abandoning her guitars-and-strings indie rock shorthand in favor of folk, jazz, French pop, and disco accoutrements. While her propensity for serial genre-hopping makes it difficult for the album to congeal into a whole (Let It Die's scattered closing trilogy comprises covers of songs by Ron Sexsmith, The Bee Gees and 1940s vocalist Dick Haymes), it is nonetheless held together by her wistful song selection and an airy, summery aesthetic. Although many of its originals were sparked in Toronto, where Feist first cut them as four-track demos, the bulk of Let It Die was realized and recorded in Paris with the assistance of fellow Canadian expat Jason Beck, better known as Peaches collaborator Chilly Gonzales. Emblazoned with jazzy guitar shapes, droning vibes, crisp percussion, toothless synths, smoothed-out samples and Feist's slippery vocals, the music sloshes around the stereo channel like liquid in a canister. It's no wonder that, despite her protestation, reviewers have quite reasonably taken to calling it Feist's French pop album; whether intentional or not, Let It Die shares all sorts of characteristics with our archetypal vision of Paris. ""Whimsical,"" ""romantic"" and ""adventurous"" are all adjectives that apply. With five original songs followed by six covers, Let It Die intimates its own Side A/B divide, of which the former is undoubtedly the stronger half. We begin with ""Gatekeeper"", a sparse, jazzy lament on love's inconstancy that at once establishes the album's central theme; namely, the juggling act involved in reconciling boundless romanticism and optimism for the future with the soured relationships and broken hearts of the past. One of the summer's gentlest, most natural pop melodies follows with first single ""Mushaboom"", from which we're gently airlifted into the title track. Featuring a funereal organ line and a weak pulse of a drum beat, ""Let It Die"" yields one of the album's stillest moments. Equal parts relationship swansong, a reproach to a former lover, and a hardening act (chorus: ""The saddest part of a broken heart isn't the ending so much as the start""), it is also the album's emotional centerpiece. Comprising covers of material by FraxE7oise Hardy, Sexsmith and others, Side B is decidedly less rewarding. Among Feist's least essential readings is her version of Sexsmith's ""Secret Heart"", which, although lovingly rendered, betrays the original's vulnerability to a tangle of cutesy string plucks and whiz-bang synth sounds. When things work, as they do on her softly lit, glossy rendition of The Bee Gees' ""Inside Out"" and her black-and-white take on Haynes' black-and-white piano ballad ""Now at Last"", they verge on inspired, but I too often found myself willfully ignoring the implications of her aggregate five original songs over the last four years and stubbornly unwishing some of the more extraneous covers in favor of more of her own material. Ultimately, however, Feist's charm is such that it doesn't matter all that much who writes the songs so long as they're the right ones. Indeed, one of the major reasons Let It Die hits is because Feist finally knows precisely what she's aiming at. For that quantum leap in wisdom, we'll grant her the aforementioned five-year hiatus, but after this record, we're not likely to be as patient again.","Second solo LP from Broken Social Scene vocalist Leslie Feist (""Almost Crimes""), produced by Peaches collaborator Chilly Gonzales, finds Feist in a radically different state of mind.

Blueberry Boat,The Fiery Furnaces,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be76c0084474cd0c2ebb/1:1/w_160/20fa79ca.jpg,2004-07-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3272-blueberry-boat/,Rough Trade,"The Fiery Furnaces' debut, Gallowsbird’s Bark, pegged them as a whimsical but rootsy New York band, one compared numbingly often to The White Stripes. Most of the clean garage revival was as predictable as a Guy Lombardo tribute, but the Furnaces stood apart, both for their The Band-meets-Syd Barrett nuggets and their lyrics, which read like a ransom note made from ripped-up atlases. Frontwoman Eleanor Friedberger sang ""I went to"" as often as James Brown goes ""unh,"" and her brother Matt coupled raucous guitar leads with a piano that rollicked like a fall down the stairs. Yet nothing on Gallowsbird's Bark hints at the ambition of The Fiery Furnaces' second album, the 76-minute Blueberry Boat. The 10-minute opener, ""Quay Cur"", sets the stage: After a two-minute overture with loud, blatting organs that pump like they're driven by bellows, Eleanor is introduced in the character of a child who lost her protective locket, ""and now I'll never never, never feel like I'm safe again,"" she says. The adventure starts: They cut to the next section, where the guitars come in on a deluge of nautical imagery-- and then the frenzy gives way to an acoustic interlude that finds Eleanor singing gently in... Inuit? The Furnaces pull off other mini-operas on ""Blueberry Boat""-- on which Eleanor faces off against a gang of pirates-- and ""Chris Michaels"", whose different parts run together so quickly that its story is almost mashed to gibberish. Matt Friedberger, who-- unlike on the band's first album-- wrote all of the material, emerges as a pop auteur. Matt has acknowledged the influence of The Who's rock suites, ""A Quick One, While He's Away"" and ""Rael"", but instead of taking a single theme and expanding it into one lengthy song, Matt is more likely to concatenate half-dozen seemingly separate ideas in a way that makes every piece-- even a straightforward track such as ""Straight Street""-- feel epic. So much stuff is jammed into Blueberry Boat that you'd think Freidberger put some of it in for kicks. The Noah's Ark of retro guitars and garish prog keyboards initially seems random, and on the evidence of the Furnaces' live shows, these versions aren't even definitive: Their sets rework, split and remake their repertoire into one breathless block of music, one on which a song might show up for only one verse or come back three or four times. But this isn't arbitrary: Matt and Eleanor are just reworking and sequencing the songs for different contexts. The process resembles the way a DJ sets up a mix, and-- like in a club setting-- the final product should be judged not simply on which pieces they use, but on how well those segments work as a whole and how the band controls the energy in the room. Blueberry Boat's 13 tracks form a perfect flow, sticking short tunes between the mini-operas, building up through ""Chris Michaels"" to the brief respite of the ""Paw Paw Tree"" before exploding into ""I Lost My Dog"", the album's dizziest travelogue. As scrambled as Matt's palette may sound, a close listen reveals how perfectly he evokes each song's content: The sighing tones near the start of ""Blueberry Boat"" sound like waves lapping the bow of their vessel, ""Mason City""'s beat chugs softly, like a train gliding into a station, and on ""I Lost My Dog"" Matt captures the frenzy of running all over town by switching instrumentation with every verse. The lyrics keep pace, repeating the encyclopedic references and buckshot wordplay of the last album, but extending the narratives. Matt pulls us in and out of the fantasy-- as on ""Spaniolated"", where Eleanor starts as a grown-up slacker, only to find herself abducted before regressing back into childhood and given pills ""to keep from growing taller."" Gallowsbird's Bark told similarly meticulous stories about Eleanor's real-life wanderings through London or New Jersey, but this time the songs grow into elaborate fictions, and the stakes are higher, with battles and abductions belying the cheerful arrangements. The Furnaces sound tighter here than on their debut, but they still retain a sense of carelessness and spontaneity-- listen to the rambunctious piano interlude on ""Blueberry Boat"" or the distracted spit off his guitar solos. Matt sings more on this record, with a delivery similar to Peter Gabriel in his Genesis days, and Eleanor's melodic, speak-singy vocals show a wider range and more force. Eleanor pushes her crystal-clear enunciation with a more aggressive delivery, especially when she slips into character, such as when she stands up to a mob of pirates and swears, ""You ain't never getting the cargo of my blueberry boat."" John Darnielle's Last Plane to Jakarta devastatingly parodied The Strokes approach to their second album, joking that they would use their money and clout to make a two-album monster with eight-minute jams, tuba solos and a Gregg Allman guest spot. Whether that sounds like a dream or a nightmare, the joke was on us: The Strokes' second album sounded mostly like their first. But The Fiery Furnaces have made the kind of rock behemoth Darnielle described, a record for the overgrown part of our brain that craves engrossing complexity. The exuberant overload of Blueberry Boat will thrill and transport you with the ineluctable force of a great children's story, one whose execution matches its imagination. And like all the best children's stories, it takes off once the kids break the rules-- when they're dragged away from safety but have enough curiosity and faith in themselves to enjoy the adventure. We're just lucky to trail behind and pick up their breadcrumbs. ","Though they made their name on last year's raucous stomper Gallowsbird's Bark, nothing on that album hinted at ...

"Step into My Office, Baby EP / I'm a Cuckoo EP / Books EP",Belle and Sebastian,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a25f13d197565213885c/1:1/w_160/08a1044d.jpg,2004-07-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11671-step-into-my-office-baby-epim-a-cuckoo-epbooks-ep/,Rough Trade,"Back in the days when Belle & Sebastian were as synonymous with marathon soundchecks and amateurish shambolism as they were with cardies, Bowlie, and avoiding the press, you'd have gotten pretty long odds that they'd become an ambitious, sophisticated, sunny pop band. Yet, six years after they began to embrace Northern Soul with the same fervor as ""Northern Sky"", the band that couldn't cut it on Sessions on West 54th is carrying the flag for multi-layered, nuanced indie pop. Granted, it's been a sometimes rocky transition from being a loose collective to a tight unit: 2000's odd grab-bag Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant often sounds labored or cautious, while last year's Dear Catastrophe Waitress sometimes seems too meticulous, clean and stuffy. But over the course of Waitress' three counterpart EPs-- Step into My Office, Baby, I'm a Cuckoo and Books-- the band have grown increasingly playful and are finally fully comfortable working as a studio outfit. Oddly, the best material from these EPs (as well as from the post-Fold Your Hands EPs and Dear Catastrophe Waitress) contradict the old standby critique of Belle & Sebastian Mk. II, that a democratic approach to the band's music spoiled the beauty of Stuart Murdoch's benevolent dictatorship. Murdoch remains the band's best lyricist by some distance, but a communal approach to crafting melodies, hooks, and sonic accents-- which, in some cases, result in heavily layered and multi-part tracks-- is now arguably the band's primary strength. When not lapsing into hippy-dippy Polyphonic Spree territory, Belle & Sebastian's increased penchant for loose grooves, elastic rhythms and playful ideas is a welcome and necessary antidote for a band that threatened to become nothing but neutered, constipated soul or by-the-numbers pastiche. This more relaxed approach carries echoes of early Orange Juice and, arguably, may have been coaxed by the freedom of the single format. Liberated from the pressure of recording and releasing a full album-- and with no need to make each release a definitive statement-- Belle & Sebastian took some chances and ended up releasing a handful of great songs, including ones that morph into interesting directions in the hands of others (The Avalanches' remix of ""I'm a Cuckoo"") or themselves (the ""version"" of ""Your Cover's Blown""). Step into My Office is the weakest of the three EPs. The title track grates as much as it charms, and although everything from its ""Dope Show""-esque opening to its sexual innuendos can't help but produce fewer smiles once you know they're coming, it's still a joy to hear Murdoch's winking transformation from ""working for the joy of giving"" to the joy of, erm, getting. ""Love on the March"" is a bit of wintry bossa nova, the sort of application of Brazilian aesthetics one would except from pasty Scots. ""Desperation Made a Fool of Me"", meanwhile, may be the disc's best track. Recorded with longtime Scottish pop engineer Tony Doogan, it's a daily-grind/killing-me-softly type song about dashed expectations and the harsh yet strangely rewarding reality of an often difficult life-- one on which Murdoch's weary vocal matches the song's sleepy, worn tone and content. I'm a Cuckoo wisely pegs Waitress' most radio-ready track as a single. The jaunty, quotable ""Cuckoo"" is all wish fulfillment and dancefloor daydreams, and it's even more engaging on its own than within the context of an album. The Avalanches remix ignores Murdoch's suggestion that he'd ""like to be in Tokyo"", and instead transports him to North Africa via a chorus of Sudanese children and some sort of hand-played frame and/or wooden percussion (a doumbek? Djembe? Darbukka? Ask Damon Albarn, he'll know). Besides the vocals, the remix's one consolation to the album version is its re-creation of the main melody line on a wooden flute. Sticking with the tourist/traveller's theme, I'm a Cuckoo also rescues Stevie Jackson's ""(I Believe in) Travellin' Light"" from the dustbin. Wisely cut from Dear Catastrophe Waitress (it doesn't fit the record's mood), ""Travellin' Light"" is another of Jackson's Greenwich Village Salesman folk songs, a dusty ballad that avoids the pantomime of Belle & Sebastian's career nadir ""Beyond the Sunrise"", yet isn't as delightful as ""The Wrong Girl"". And perhaps oddest of all, ""Stop, Look and Listen"" shifts from Mike Nesmith to Dick Dale within its seven minutes. Another Waitress favorite, ""Wrapped Up in Books"", leads off the Books EP, but it's merely a teaser for ""Your Cover's Blown"". Described by NME as the ""indie 'Bohemian Rhapsody'"", it's a slinky, sultry mini-suite-- spy vs. spy in the discotheque. Even the re-emergence of the Arthur Lee impression Murdoch debuted on ""I'm Waking Up to Us"" can't detract from its whiplash smiles. The deep bass and hi-hat of ""Cover (Version)"" offer an alternate approach to ""Your Cover's Blown"", serving as a cousin to the Avalanches' ""Cuckoo"" remix. The cut-and-paste approach and combinations of seemingly disparate elements on display here (as well as in the original) echo The Fiery Furnaces and dance culture in equal parts. And finally, ""Your Secrets"" takes us back to the start, recalling bits of the stronger melodies from Fold Your Hands, but retaining the crisp feel of Waitress. Like this EP's literary title track, it could have slotted into any of Belle & Sebastian's past albums-- a trick that ""Your Cover's Blown"" and its companion track will hopefully manage on the band's next full-length.","With the new release of Belle & Sebastian's long-anticipated Books EP, featuring their first newly recorded material since Dear Catastrophe Waitress, Pitchfork's Scott Plagenhoef takes a look at all three of the EPs that have accompanied the band's most recent full-length. In total, the discs feature eight previously unreleased tracks.

Mud,Eszter Balint,by: Catherine Lewis,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45bb1335d7bf1698933/1:1/w_160/e6cf8830.jpg,2004-07-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1116-mud/,Bar/None,"Jim Jarmusch fans would recognize Eszter Balint as the leading lady Eva in his drifting 1983 narrative Stranger than Paradise. Although her IMDb resumé includes small roles in a few other films (including Steve Buscemi's Trees Lounge), recently she has prioritized a musical career over a theatrical one. She started studying violin at the age of six, and in addition to solo albums (Mud is her second; her first, Flicker, was released in 1999), she's played violin on albums by Dayna Kurtz and Michael Gira's post-Swans project The Angels of Light. Though she's developed in the five years since her debut, Mud remains a largely unrefined affair, with a recurring problem lying with arrangements that fail to truly mesh, resulting in songs that feel somewhat tossed together and rough around the edges. This is particularly evident on ""No One"", in which Balint's vocals never really sound as though they fit with the melody oozed out by her accompaniment (which includes three guitars, a French horn, keyboard, bass, drums, and glockenspiel). The song comes close to gelling during the choruses, but these are often too short and easily forgotten in the context of the rest of their respective tracks. ""Good Luck"" sounds like an updated version of Luscious Jackson's ""Naked Eye"", with Balint cramming bland lyrics (""Will you chew me up, spit me out in the end/ Just when I think you're my friend"") into four minutes. Notably, this is the only song on which she doesn't play anything. Mud isn't always shaky, though. Balint's strongest songs seem to be the ones on which she plays violin: With an instrument on which she's so obviously comfortable, she's able to fill in any of the awkward spaces in her arrangements. On the opening track, ""Pebbles & Stones"", Balint sounds more relaxed than on most of the rest of the album, both vocally and musically. The banjo, played by Mud's producer JD Foster, gives the song an alt-country feel, yet the lack of twang in Balint's coarse alto, which at times too closely mirrors that of PJ Harvey, saves it from sounding derivative, and her violin swoops in to smooth out her rough instrumental transitions. The harshness of Balint's voice fits well with the despair that often lies in her lyrics: ""Your God is sick, your God's a joke/ The lovely tales and songs a pile of shit,"" she sings on ""Your God"". She doesn't ever really sound angry, though, which is to her credit: Her voice wouldn't easily lend itself to inharmonious wailing. While the opening of the album's final song, the piano-driven ""Who Are You Now"", comes strikingly close to a Sarah McLachlan intro, its slow tempo allows Balint to reveal more emotion than on her other songs, as she bemoans the betrayal of a lover (""I opened this drawer, found a hotel room key.../ Wish I'd taken a picture of the dent on my chest/ You left when you buried your head there to rest""). Again, Balint's soulful violin complements both her vocal melody and the instrumentation, and she closes the album on a strong (albeit melancholy) note. Even though a few of her songs don't quite gel, Balint shows promise as a songwriter, and with the strength of her violin-playing, her arrangements will surely improve as she grows more comfortable with performing.","Second solo outing from this former indie actress who previously landed roles in films by Jim Jarmusch and Woody Allen.

Satin Black,Paik,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17b9d034d5c69bf2987/1:1/w_160/0a5107da.jpg,2004-07-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6544-satin-black/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Albums are sometimes best understood in terms of the circumstances under which you might want to listen to them. Think of Mojo magazine asking a handful of quasi-celebrities each month to pick a ""Saturday Night"" and ""Sunday Morning"" record; Loren Connors' The Departing of a Dream, for example, should only be legally available between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m., while Sam Prekop's solo record makes sense on a cheery day when the sunlight is streaming through the window. When listening to Satin Black, the fourth record by the instrumental guitar/bass/drum trio Paik, I'm struck with a paradox. This is the perfect soundtrack for a dark room in a dank basement that has been sealed off completely from a disgustingly sunny day, so it's daytime music of a different sort. Paik make the kind of slow, drop-D guitar sludge that alienated suburban kids have been getting stoned to since Black Sabbath entered the fray. Nighttime is about dreams and endless possibility and daytime is for making things happen; Satin Black is about disengaging from the cycle altogether. I mention Sabbath only as an indicator of mood; Paik are not metal, though they are certainly heavy. The touchstones of their sound are ultimately much more contemporary, as they combine Sonic Youth's experiments in tuning and atonal riffage with Bardo Pond's krautrock-channeling rhythmic thrust. Guitarist Robert Smith's instrument often seems as though it has only a couple of loosely wound strings (such is the nature of his bottom-focused stabs and endless ripples of sustain), which is amplified by the fact that he often wraps his lines completely around those of the bass guitar. The drummer focuses on a thudding style of heavy rock ""groove"" while making heavy use of crash and ride cymbals to maintain an air of mysticism, the sharp metal percussion connecting with our subconscious vision of the gypsy caravan. I would say that Paik chug forward like a poorly lubed steam train, but since they're from Michigan, perhaps a souped-up but rusted-out 1978 Crown Victoria would be a better metaphor. In any event, Paik construct an unpredictable ramshackle clang, always just on the verge of falling apart, around a core of serious power. The detuned three-note riff of ""Jayne Field"" combined with the Bonham-esque percussion stomp creates a tension that the tumbling middle refrain releases nicely. ""Dirt for Driver"" and the title track, meanwhile, find the guitar leaving the massive central bass riff to explore acidic upper-register runs, at times exhibiting a touching lyricism. The songs are all on the long side, of course, befitting a band that aligns itself with the Michigan space-rock scene, and Satin Black culminates in the 15-minute closer ""Stellar Meltdown en el Oceano"", an extended feedback drone with the drummer laying out that could be understood as a tribute to the sonic ambience of Detroit industry. Even if Satin Black is heavy and bleak music for dropping out, I'm certainly not knocking it. In fact, we need those kinds of records desperately. A few hours wallowing alone with records like this one can be cathartic in its own way, like pushing the ""pause"" button on your life, and it's sure a lot better for you than heroin. You can always open the curtains after you've spent some time down here working things out.","Combining Sonic Youth's experiments in tuning and atonal riffage with Bardo Pond's krautrock-channeling rhythmic thrust, space-rockers Paik make the kind of slow, drop-D guitar sludge that alienated suburban kids have been getting stoned to since Black Sabbath.

Your New Favorite Band,The Hives,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0fa13d197565213bb0d/1:1/w_160/c923df17.jpg,2004-07-12 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3891-your-new-favorite-band/,Sire,"How fast pop culture moves: The phrase ""your new favorite band"" might have described the then-up-and-coming Hives four years ago, when this catch-all collection was released by Poptones Records in the UK (complete with a ""u"" in ""favourite""). At the time, it was perhaps the band's most audacious move: releasing a greatest hits comp before they even had a hit. In 2004, however, following a hit album, a vaguely defined garage-rock movement, and a Spider-Man soundtrack, The Hives are neither ""new"" nor arguably ""favorite."" In the intervening years, a seven-nation army of nostalgia-minded bands has amassed to exploit the hazy definition of ""garage-rock,"" from The Vines and Jet to The Killers and Thee Shams. Unless this month's Tyrannosaurus Hives pulls some kind of amazing stunt-- and the first single, ""Walk Idiot Walk"", with its Who's Next guitar riff, suggests it just might-- Sweden's brashest and best-dressed pop/punks could fall victim to the harshest backlash this side of The Strokes. However, as Your New Favorite Band still proves, The Hives could very easily erase all doubts. Officially released stateside in anticipation of T. Hives, Your New Favorite Band collects singles from Veni Vidi Vicious, Barely Legal, and the A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T EP, as well as a B-side from the ""Hate to Say I Told You So"" single and a DVD with three videos. Curiously, the collection is arranged in reverse chronological order, beginning with tracks from Veni Vidi Vicious: ""Hate to Say I Told You So"" still retains its churning momentum thanks to Chris Dangerous' perfectly concise guitar riff, and despite the polish, Howlin' Pelle Almqvist's vocals are still sandpaper rough. But, in this context at least, ""Die, Alright!"" sounds like the most urgent song they've yet recorded, its final chorus a true punk epic. The downside of this arrangement is that it frontloads the collection with The Hives' best material, and gradually grows weaker as the disc progresses. Moving backwards, Your New Favorite Band next features five tracks from A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T. While ""Outsmarted"" and ""Here We Go Again"" overflow with swaggering audacity, tracks like ""Mad Man"" and the marble-mouthed rant ""Untutored Youth"" just sound shrill and overeager to impress. The two tracks from Barely Legal, ""Automatic Schmuck"" and ""Hail Hail Spit n' Drool"", are the weakest of the bunch, amplifying The Hives' most cartoonish tendencies. What's missing from this collection is the glue between songs. Veni Vidi Vicious constructed a sovereign nation-state complete with its own nuclear arsenal, functioning economy, police force, and, um, metric system. Your New Favorite Band holds together through sheer entropy as it moves from its strongest to its weakest tracks. It's a strange trajectory, receding backwards in time even as it moves forward, yet it still manages to prove that despite their matching outfits and sights on new-favorite-band status, The Hives rise above their own shtick-- if sometimes just barely.","Dropping just one week before their forthcoming Tyrannosaurus Hives, the Stateside edition of this 2002 compilation spans all the Swedish garage-rockers' singles to date.

Bebel Gilberto,Bebel Gilberto,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf27eb335119a49ed197/1:1/w_160/32a10178.jpg,2004-07-11 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3451-bebel-gilberto/,Six Degrees,"Bebel Gilberto is the daughter of famed Brazilian performers João Gilberto and Miúcha, and has recorded with David Byrne, Amon Tobin and other Brazilian musicians like Caetano Veloso and Antonio Carlos Jobim. Her impressive connections to the heart of modern Brazilian pop might suggest her own music should follow in a direction akin to her father's seminal bossa nova or the tropicalia popularized by Veloso in the 70s. To her credit, Gilberto has usually opted for a more modern approach, incorporating electronics and sly IDM touches into her music, especially notable on her pairing with former Deee-Lite DJ Towa Tei on the 1995 track ""Technova (La Em Copacabana)"". Along these lines, Bebel Gilberto isn't so much a continuation of the singer's esteemed musical lineage as a consistently pleasant affair reminiscent of similarly warm efforts by Björk. Its melodies float atop bossa-tinged arrangements unobtrusively, as if the songs weren't necessarily meant to catch your ear so much as caress your cheek. There are subtle electronic flourishes throughout (courtesy of frequent Björk producers Marius DeVries and Guy Sigsworth)-- though nothing as distinctive as Amon Tobin's work on Gilberto's 2000 solo debut Tanto Tempo-- and the delicate strings conducted by another Björk-collaborator Gavyn Wright betray the disc's affiliations with easy listening music. Of course, this hardly precludes enjoying the best moments-- after all, congeniality isn't a crime. ""Simplesmente"" (""Simply"") takes a facile, but alluring chord progression that allows Gilberto to coo in English and Brazilian, using melodies that don't veer beyond her modest range, yet never seeming meandering or repetitive. Her voice is eerily reminiscent of Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell, and this song could have appeared on any of that group's albums from Good Humour onwards. Likewise, the midtempo, lightly funky ""Cada Beijo"" (""Each Kiss"") sounds like an outtake from Björk's Homogenic, right down to its mysterious textures of bells, strings and flutes. Gilberto is hardly as distinctive a vocalist as the Icelandic diva, but in a way, that makes her music less convoluted. When her songs stick to her strengths (easy, flowing melodies and ability to use her voice as ambient counterpoint, gliding in the background of her arrangements), they can be richly rewarding, even moving. Still, Gilberto has a tendency to run her strengths into the ground on occasion. ""All Around"" could have been an attractive update on her father's streamlined bossa nova at three minutes, but at almost five, it seems a tad indulgent. ""Aganju"", like ""Cada Beijo"", again brings to mind Homogenic-era Björk, and even adds some spacey reverb to the singer's voice that lends the song a dreamy quality. Yet, at a point, ""dreamy"" becomes ""tedious,"" especially during a lengthy vamp at the end. Bebel Gilberto will not likely turn Gilberto's fans off, but often runs the risk of losing their attention.","Latest outing from the daughter of famed Brazilian performer João Gilberto often recalls Björk's Homogenic, at the expense of exploring Gilberto's own strengths.

The Girls,The Girls,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bff3ea9e61561daa7b35/1:1/w_160/1c2c90ef.jpg,2004-07-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3639-the-girls/,Dirtnap,"Seattle glam-punks The Girls aren't interested in burying their influences, assimilating them, or updating them for the internet era; their Dirtnap debut is an unabashed encomium (one might even say ""parody,"" were it not such an obvious labor of love) to a new-wave now old enough for mid-life crises and lower back pain. It's a hi-fi facsimile: the black and white grid of faces and neon-pink cursive that mark the album's cover hark back to the ""garish is good"" aesthetic of the late 70s/early 80s-- only to be outdone by the back cover, which boasts sunglasses, black ties, sleeveless dress shirts, and everyone gazing into the middle distance toward, presumably, The Future, where everything occurs against a Tron-like backdrop; where Max Headroom is George Bush to Spuds McKenzie's Dick Cheney; where Belinda Carlisle toils in obscurity while Gary Numan's Tubeway Army rake in major moon-bucks. Inside, there's a picture of The Girls applying their eyeliner in a mirror. Are you feeling me yet? What I'm saying is, they ain't fuckin' around. But this is no fishnet-hawking electroclash fashionista rock; besides having more sexxx appeal than both Coreys combined, The Girls've got chops like Ralph Macchio. Those of you who know The Cars and The Voidoids can guess what you're in for; for you young'uns, I'll say this: The Girls sound kind of like Stellastarr* (I mean that in a nice way), yet hew more closely to new-wave roots than the more indie rocking Stellas, viz. punchy simplicity over grandiose anthem rock. Vocally: foppish and fey, staccato yelps and hiccups, words padded with more syllables than anything that isn't a British manor has the right to contain (example: ""stereo"" inevitably becomes ""ster-e-ah-e-ah-e-o""). Lyrically: classic Information Age gobbledygook, designed less to convey information about the modern world than to describe its accumulation of surface and signal via verses that rely more on allusive phonetic similarity than actual narrative (example: on ""She's Hysterical"": ""Schematics, schematics/ Mechanical reaction/ Schematics, schematics/ You're in love with your reflection/ Oh no, she's gonna blow!""). Guitars: sleek and buzzing, all sculpted slides and reedy fuzz chords. Rhythm section: crisp and spare, skeletal-- witness the analog man striving toward the pristine precision of the drum machine. (And of course) Synths: and plenty of them, clean and lambent melodic lines fresh from the can, clarion call for the UFO set, gloriously artificial bubbles glowing like fluorescents. I'd be remiss to not mention ""Dope Disguised as Nuns"". It's about... okay, remember that Saturday Night Live commercial parody about monkeys that clean your bathroom? Where the monkey writes, ""Monkey hate clean"" on the bathroom mirror with lipstick? That was funny, right? It seems The Girls agree: The song seems, in all seriousness, to be about that sketch. I'm still confused. I'm not going to insult your intelligence with some dubious tie-in to the rest of The Girls' oeuvre-- I mean, that skit isn't even from the right era of SNL.","Fresh from the label that brought you Exploding Hearts, Dirtnap Records' The Girls revive a later sound, aping the new-wave pop of The Cars and Gary Numan.

Absent Friends,The Divine Comedy,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a613d197565213aed8/1:1/w_160/5b35440e.jpg,2004-07-11 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2342-absent-friends/,Nettwerk,"Please forgive Neil Hannon for taking three years to record a follow-up to 2001's Regeneration. In the interim, he's had to deal with the dissolution of the band whose lineup had seemingly solidified for that effort, but more importantly, he's become a father, so he's understandably had other things to attend to. There's also the little matter of deciding where he wanted to go next-- the band he'd assembled in 2001 was the first true rock lineup The Divine Comedy had had since their nascent days as a jangly three-piece in Northern Ireland (their short album Fanfare for the Comic Muse is actually quite good, though Hannon has disowned it). The breakup of the Regeneration band was assumed by many to be the death of the Divine Comedy moniker, but Hannon apparently realized that it would be pointless to go on without the tag that had effectively become his pseudonym. The decision to keep the name makes sense on more than a business level. Absent Friends is a sort of quintessential distillation of The Divine Comedy's many phases, Hannon handling the production and most of the instruments himself while longtime cohort Joby Talbot conducts the orchestra, which is here back to full prominence. Hannon has always probed for that part of each of us, no matter how well hidden, that swoons for sap and melts for melodrama using the clichés of six or seven decades of pop songwriting to frame the modern era in its own ridiculousness. This formula is pure poison for people who take themselves too seriously-- which, if you ask me, is all the more reason to like it. Even if you're resistant to Hannon's grandiosity, it's hard to deny the lush sweep of the album's opening title track, a song that confirms his place as the closest thing to an inheritor of Scott Walker's mantle as we're likely to get. The orchestration is expert and economical, and Nigel Godrich, bumped from the producer's chair to the mixing board this time around, perfectly stacks the song's elements to make them sound absolutely huge. Hannon's tenor is commanding, and he spins an incredible melody as he runs through a series of tributes to 20th century icons whose lives ended prematurely, from French actress Jean Seberg to Laika, the first dog in space. ""Absent Friends"" is just one of several songs on Absent Friends that rank among The Divine Comedy's finest. ""Come Home Billy Bird"" no doubt has autobiographical implications relating to touring with a band, but Hannon puts them onto a business traveler, whose harried, hungover ordeal at the airport prompts him to give it all up. Hannon captures the blur of international travel with a sticky, hurried melody and hilariously poignant lyrics regarding drinking games with Belgian business partners, cab rides that are more tortoise than hare, and inadequate seating. Elsewhere, Hannon is at his most lovesick, as he intones over dizzying strings on ""Sticks & Stones"": ""You and I go together like the molar and the drill/ Flesh is weak but darling we know/ That the ego's weaker still."" But thematically, there's little that competes with ""The Happy Goth"", a song that moves effortlessly between Latin-tinged passages, Brill Building pop explosions, and an insidiously catchy minor-key chorus. The song essentially consists of Hannon telling parents not to get too worked up about all the time their teenage daughter is spending alone in her room, but the way he couches it in out-of-touch terms that parents might understand (he calls her boots ""Doctor Martens"") makes it both humorous and strangely sympathetic to the parents' concerns. There's an oddly American perspective to ""The Freedom Road"", a hushed trucker's song that bobs along on a throbbing bassline, perhaps a testament to Hannon's extended cross-continent tours of North America, while closer ""Charmed Life"" is a sweet message to his daughter, as well as a very unsongwriterly admission that life hasn't actually been so bad after all. Hannon does slip a bit on ""Leaving Today"" and ""The Wreck of the Beautiful"", two dirges that feel labored-- he's always insisted on having one or two of these songs on each of his records, and they inevitably kill the momentum, though ""Leaving Today"" does thankfully avoid the morbid existentialism of so many of his slowest songs. So after years of Hannon the Bookworm, Hannon the Lover, Hannon the Romantic, and Hannon the Humorist, we now have Hannon the Dad, and it runs out that he was a little bit of each all along-- he had just never found a way to put all of his tendencies in the same place at once. Absent Friends isn't my favorite Divine Comedy record (Fin de Siecle, actually), but it is an excellent record, and one that seems more likely to appeal to non-fans than his more ostentatious outings.","Singer/songwriter Neil Hannon resurrects his Britpop alias, three years after splitting up the band.

Dance the Dance Electric,Shocking Pinks,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a676ea9e61561daa538d/1:1/w_160/4c846145.gif,2004-07-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7767-dance-the-dance-electric/,Pinacolada,"As far as politicking goes, New Zealand-based The Shocking Pinks have got their act together. Rather than waging an ill-fated battle to entice the ever-jaded indie masses with quixotic idiosyncrasy, they've studied the musical zeitgeist, and at first glance, appear to roll with it. Dance the Dance Electric, the group's debut full-length, would blend inconspicuously into the emergent dancepunk section of any hipper-than-thou record store-- that is, until an unsuspecting store clerk actually bothered to spin the disc, whereupon it would be revealed as a sophisticated collection of casual genre-hoppers and tender love songs that far outshines most of the bilge spawned from James Murphy's Chernobyl-like fallout. Dance the Dance Electric is simultaneously one of the most tragically hip and irreverently unaffiliated records of the year, cavorting from unabashed disco revivalism to scuzzed-out new-wave to reggae-tinged psychedelia in a mottled kaleidoscope of brazen idealism. While aesthetically, all indications are of something closely related to the nascent discopunk phenomenon, The Shocking Pinks are only tangentially interested in getting down. In fact, the complexity of their ambitions rivals vastly more established groups, and the youthful intensity with which they attack each objective is a constant boon. At first, the album abides its come-ons: ""Lovehate"" is instrumental discopunk at its purest, enduring for six minutes on a redundant bassline, slap-happy bongo playing and an erratically soloing guitar. While certainly not a vast departure from the cliches being propagated by present-day death-disco revivalists, the song is endearingly sloppy in contrast with the razor-sharp instrumentalism of bands like !!! and Out Hud. That it's one of Dance the Dance Electric's weaker tracks is a testament to the potency and stylistic diversity of the band's songcraft. Any intimations ""Lovehate"" makes at inane trend appeasement are quickly dispelled as the ethereal guitar peals of ""Peaceout"" stagger into focus and Nick Harte delivers the album's first vocals. With all the pieces in place, the song hovers briefly at a blissful stasis, but rather than stagnate in a comfortable environment, the band vary things with a pensive coda section. ""Peaceout"", which finds more similarities in Built to Spill than ""Beat Connection"", proves The Shocking Pinks not merely fluff imitators, but truly competent songwriters. That revelation is amply reinforced by the subsequent track, ""It's Hard to Breathe"", which eviscerates Joy Division and The Smiths, and features the simplistic yet devastatingly emotive chorus lyric, ""This is a love letter/ Straight from my ha-ha-heart."" From there, the album dives back into the rugged, tentatively groove-minded ""Every"", and for two minutes, Dance the Dance Electric actually lives up to its misleading title. Then, suddenly but smoothly, the song metamorphoses into a dream-pop vamp, retaining nothing but a vague variation of its central riff. Conveniently reflective of the album as a whole, ""Every"" channels a panoply of influences, but uncannily emerges with a singular voice. Its 6\xBD wayward minutes easily make for Dance Electric's most scatterbrained track, but also one of its catchiest. Such is the paradox that lies at the heart of this record, and what makes The Shocking Pinks altogether so exciting. Songs like the Dekker-smitten ""Affection"" and the schlock-funk ""In the Labyrinth"" lie two seconds away and a world apart-- it shouldn't work, but most of the time it does. Of course, this eager eclecticism makes for a somewhat inconsistent final package, but any transgressions are forgiven for the indefatigable verve of the album. In- or out-of-context, these are undeniably strong songs from a group of musicians who understand the popular climate well enough to maneuver it, to a staggering effect.","New Zealand-based indie rockers can't decide whether they want to ride the dancepunk wave or explore wistful dream-pop. Fortunately, they're great at both.

Together We're Heavy,The Polyphonic Spree,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0df13d19756521384cc/1:1/w_160/8c03757b.jpg,2004-07-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6395-together-were-heavy/,Hollywood,"If you've never witnessed the spectacle of Norman Jewison's film adaptation of Jesus Christ Superstar, by all means pop some kettle corn and make tonight an Andrew Lloyd Weber night. Proving that all The Passion needed to unite audiences was some wicked psychedelic jams, JCS told the story of Christ's last couple days in quintessential 1973 fashion: extravagant jumpsuits, limb-flailing choreography and racially encompassing cast decisions. Along with Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit in the Sky"", the film is the best time capsule of that weird post-60s fallout period where the hippies that didn't turn militant turned to a bell-bottomed form of Christianity. To modern Jesuphobes, the results are both stomach-ache hilarious and strangely, sneakily moving. The Polyphonic Spree never directly lift up their myriad voices for God (except in an ancient Egyptian Sun/Ra worship sense), yet I can't help but think of their 20+ members as the direct offspring of the Jesus Christ Superstar movie cast. Whereas the film shows a schoolbus full of lax-groomed hippies driving to Israel to perform their songs amidst desert ruins, The Polyphonic Spree pack their bohemian mass into tour buses and bring their robe-clad Godspeed You Prozac Emperor sound to the dingy, beer-reeking venues of America. Though their uniform dress and Jehovah's Witness exuberance often gets them smirkily labeled as a cult, anyone who's found themselves amidst the band's live audience can tell you how difficult it is to keep your indie cynic shield intact and not get drunk on whatever jolly substance the band's audio Kool-Aid is heavily laced with. Which is all a long-winded way of explaining why I sorta like The Spree, despite lyrics like, ""You gotta be good, you gotta be strong"" (not a Des'ree cover), or, ""It's the coolest waterslide""; you might feel suffocated by the band's optimist syrup, but it's clear that, if nothing else, they're not being calculated about it. It also helps that Together We're Heavy finds the group growing musically from the let's-start-quiet-then-GET-REAL-LOUD arrangement rut of their debut, The Beginning Stages Of, with Tim DeLaughter conducting his followers through a near-continuous hour of complex musical ebbs and flows. Following their debut album's usage of section numbers (song titles are in parentheses), and stitching eight-minute epics and one-minute fragments together into a cohesive symphony, the band's sound benefits greatly from DeLaughter's realization that not every instrument always needs to be playing at once. With tracks serving more as chapter-like divisions of an album-long piece than actual song markers, it's hard to spot which standout track will be alchemized into money for new robes by the band's formidable licensing squad. ""Hold Me Now"", however, has been announced as the first single, which makes sense: Its pounded piano and brassy peaks are the best candidates to sell Dell laptops or Sobe juice, which (Pitchformula take note) never even remotely detracts from its sunshiny summer party utility. ""Two Thousand Places"", the aforementioned Des'ree quoter, also aligns the band's swollen instrumental inventory into a joyous noise, despite being slightly marred by a lapse into the repetitiousness of the debut's songwriting (see: ""Soldier Girl""). More impressively layered, if less instantaneously memorable, are the album's lengthier tracks, most bearing multiple segments and melodies and placing The Spree's sound (along with their awesome new curlicue logo) in direct lineage from Chicago Transit Authority. Opening track ""A Long Day Continues/We Sound Amazed"" spends its middle section enmeshed in a mellow trippy vamp that shows off the group's more restrained use of their palette, while ""Suitcase Calling"" works through at least five different ways to express bouncy glee. The climactic ""When the Fool Becomes the King"" shows the downside of this approach, with too many ambitious sections glommed together in seemingly arbitrary fashion, but even this 10-minute journey ends up with a clever reprise of the first album's ""It's the Sun"", locking Together We're Heavy's overarching structure into continuity with the band's previous work. Still, am I the only one slightly bothered by Tim DeLaughter's continued Single White Female-esque desire to become Wayne Coyne? The Polyphonic Spree have begun to carve out their own niche here, so it's troublesome to see their leader shaping his creative energies in transparent idol emulation; if The Flaming Lips' next album took a turn towards hip-hop, even money says DeLaughter would be interviewing MCs within hours. Fortunately, the ensemble makes up for much of this, getting by on taking their primary influence's orchestral good mood to the logical extreme. The Polyphonic Spree's gospel may not be the most original of scriptures, but their non-denominational Indiespell is good enough to flail your arms to while worshipping the planetary body of your choice.","Tim DeLaughter's Dallas-based choir-pop ensemble returns for the follow-up to their 2001 debut, The Beginning Stages.

Please Yourself,Thee Shams,by: Stephen M.

The band channel the ghosts of early 70s-era Lynyrd Skynyrd (two of the four are even brothers), but they're also schooled in 60s Southern pop like The Gants and The Hombres. On their debut, Please Yourself, they never sound quite as vital as Drive-By Truckers (or even Lucero); they're not as much fun as The Hives, nor as derivative as Jet; and they don't overplay their hand like Kings of Leon (although they have similarly time-capsule haircuts). What Thee Shams do is effectively bridge the gap between the recent garage-rock revival and the even more recent Southern rock revival, revealing how interlocked the two genres are. On the other hand, Thee Shams don't bring much new to either revival besides the juxtaposition of the two. Instead of reviving or revising a dated style in a new setting, Thee Shams are content to build new songs that sound just like old songs. In other words, they're living in the past and don't think much of the present. But unlike, say, Beachwood Sparks, Thee Shams display a little more scope and ambitious diversity in their musical mimicry. On ""Want You So Bad"", they sound like the house band at some Jackson biker bar circa 1966. They trudge through dark swamps on ""She's Been Around"" and coast along a mean highway on ""Come Down Again"". Guitarists/vocalists/brothers Zachary and Andrew Gabbard alternately channel non-Southern Man Neil Young and Ronnie van Zant, and Andrew quotes a grindhouse organ riff from quasi-namesakes Sam the Sham & The Pharaohs on the opener ""On My Mind"". As a result (and as a whole), Please Yourself sounds diverse, agile in its canny approximation of so many styles and persuasive in its assumption that these styles are more or less the same, even if they more or less aren't. Even so, like irresponsible time travelers, they've unintentionally copped a 1960s misogyny, if a gentler strain. The album cover features a topless woman posing on a bed, her breasts bare but her face/identity awkwardly cropped out. Cover-art nudity is neither new nor illegitimate nor even unwelcome; it's the album title that makes it overtly-- even ironically-- pornographic. The phrase ""Please Yourself"" is an invitation to both masturbation and objectification of this literally faceless woman. It's an indie-rock cocktail napkin. Of course, album covers are one thing, lyrics another. On ""Love Me All the Time"", Zachary Gabbard blatantly infantilizes the object of his affection: ""You say you need it/ But you don't need anything/ You're just a child."" It's not a darkly sexual come-on like those of fellow Cincinnati Greg Dulli, but a strange and creepy demeanor that pervades most of Please Yourself. This condescension is never mean-spirited or self-righteous, just goofily unself-aware. Nevertheless, the women on Please Yourself all play degraded muses, just as faceless as the cover model: they're present only to provide the inspiration for the songs, which are more about the band's nostalgic obsession than anything else. Taking no emotional risks whatsoever, Please Yourself is at worst a cold exercise in problematic nostalgia and at best a promising band's naïve debut.","Not to be confused with Matador Records' similarly named 90s girl-group, Thee Shams blend the Southern rock revival with the garage-rock one, without adding much to either.

Automatic Writing,Ataxia,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a49d034d5c69bf29e2/1:1/w_160/942f5d0d.jpg,2004-07-08 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/449-automatic-writing/,Recordcollection,"Oscar Wilde advised against any enterprise requiring new clothes. I feel the same way about enterprises requiring serial numbers. So you'll understand why I experienced a brief bout of ataxia (a loss of muscle control) when I received an unsolicited promo copy of Automatic Writing, clad in a yellow-and-black sleeve reminiscent of both crime-scene tape and biohazard packaging. My name and serial number were machine-printed on the CD amid a cluster of unambiguously menacing legal language. The upshot is that if I fileshare Ataxia's music, a digital watermark encoded on the disc will be traced back to me, and Michael Powell will personally come to my house and shove jewel cases under my fingernails. So for the love of God, go buy it; don't ask me to burn it for you. I'm locking it in the safe with my passport and unregistered firearm. Ideas that sound terrible on paper, but work surprisingly well in praxis: Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes; Mudhoney's Mark Arm singing for the reunited MC5; mint-flavored lattes; Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante jamming with Fugazi. You heard me: Ataxia is a collaborative effort between Frusciante, Josh Klinghoffer, and Fugazi bassist Joe Lally. After Frusciante played two experimental electronic shows with Klinghoffer at The Knitting Factory in L.A., the two enlisted Lally as bassist for future performances. But instead of adding Lally to the existing music, the trio decided to strike out in a different direction and compose songs together. Ataxia's debut is the product of these extemporaneous sessions, and it represents approximately half of the 90 minutes of music Ataxia recorded; the second will be released early next year. Automatic Writing, comprised of five long movements, was recorded with little overdubbing or studio chicanery-- just Frusciante on synthesizer, guitar, and vocals; Lally laying down deep waves of cyclical bass; Klinghoffer ranging confidently over eclectic but sturdy percussion. Consequently, the record sounds as organic and exploratory as one would expect. It opens with its most immediately memorable track, the nine-minute ""Dust"". A slow-burning fuse of reiterative bass, supple drums, and the build-and-break ignitions of Frusciante's sinuous and serpentine guitar squiggles, it's also the most ""Fugazi-sounding"" song on the album, especially with Frusciante's ragged and impassioned vocals groaning over the ample foundation. It would have fit pretty well on Red Medicine. The trudging ""Another"" reprises the equation from ""Dust"" with new variables-- the bassline reconfigures but maintains its lockstep pattern; Frusciante's guitar cuts crisp melodic figures that neatly accrue instead of bleeding into one another. And though its skeletal arrangement, restrained vocal collage and keening synthesizer are less instantly engaging than ""Dust"", they nonetheless serve as an effective counterpoint to ""Dust""'s aggressive stance. ""The Sides"" is a stroboscopic echo chamber of percussion, mobile bass, and prickly guitar-- with its discernible vocal melody, it's the closest thing to a pop song on Automatic Writing. The album closes with the epics ""Addition"" and ""Montreal"". The former plows through the record's most dense, difficult and abrasive sonic territory, while the latter's busy guitar and haunting, enigmatic vocals evoke some of Shudder to Think's spookier moments, elongated over 12 daunting minutes. I wouldn't recommend Ataxia to Red Hot Chili Peppers fans (many of whom probably identify more with Anthony Kiedis's ""Mongo, King of the Jungle"" schtick than with Frusciante's chops), but it will come as a happy surprise to Fugazi buffs who are dubious about how well this alliance will pan out.

Free Kamal,RadioinactiveAntimc,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f5c0084474cd0bff35/1:1/w_160/a9bc7514.gif,2004-07-08 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6665-free-kamal-with-antimc/,Mush,"We often think of music piracy as a modern problem stemming from the advent of digital storage and dissemination technology, when in fact, it predates SoulSeek, Napster and Kazaa by a long shot. Barry Kernfeld's article in issue #22 of Stay Free! magazine, ""Pop Song Piracy: Napster in the 1930s and the Story of Fake Books"", recounts the history of bootlegged song sheets. The Tin Pan Alley era of American songwriting (in the early 20th century) was the heyday of sheet music publishing. According to Kernfeld, bootlegged lyric sheets began to appear in 1929, when the dominance of the recording industry rendered obsolete the paradigm of having one person in the home who could play the piano read from 35¢ pieces of sheet music for the household's entertainment. Musical notation became effete because of the easy access to recorded music, and cheap, bootlegged sheets containing only the lyrics to popular songs grew more attractive to consumers. The recording industry reacted to ""songlegging"" exactly how it reacts to filesharing today: it panicked, and began a series of crackdowns and arrests that did nothing to stem the tide. Eventually, music publishers caved to the public desire rather than railing against it, and began to publish their own sanctioned song-lyric magazines, including the long running Song Hits and Hit Parader magazines. The article makes the tacit point that music piracy is not just a problem of unregulated technology, but one that stems from the basic human desire (stoked by an unbridled advertising industry) to imbibe all the stimulus we think will make us complete while lacking the resources to do so-- that is, while the technology makes it easier, it isn't the technology's fault. On their new, supremely organic pop-hop opus Free Kamal, Radioinactive and Antimc seem to have a more sophisticated understanding of the intricate interface between technology and human desire than many artists who deal with the topic on either side of the facile ""technology is awesome""/""technology sucks"" axis. It approaches the problems of information saturation and a society increasingly dependent on its machines in a manner that seems less moralistic or paranoid than honest and realistic, and thus, it becomes like the real world, where oversimplifications break down-- a record of contradictions and paradoxes. For instance, Free Kamal advises one to ""befriend a tree, write poetry"" and ""cook from scratch"" (i.e. to live simply and outside of the mechanisms of modern culture), yet is encoded onto mass-produced discs and sold over the Internet with an accompanying marketing push. Radioinactive's rapid, polysyllabic flow also inveighs against the viral nature of popular culture (on ""Chop Chop"": ""Don't have a PC/ Or MTV/ Or an HIV/ Or an SUV/ Or an STD/ Or any CD by Master P/ No MasterCard/ No Platinum Plus/ No Palm Pilot/ Gameboy or Angel Dust"") while being a perfect mirror to its constant, saturated and dazzling influx. This is not to criticize Radioinactive for hypocrisy; to the contrary, Free Kamal seems less a self-righteous critique of its culture than an expression of its conundrums, a living document of its era. But it's not all technophobic screeds; the record is tempered with minutiae of the mundane and metaphysical musings on spirituality and ancient wisdom, further broadening its scope to evoke a totality of what it feels like to be alive today, caught up between so many opposing poles. Radioinactive's hypnotic, prolix rhyme style veers through pop singalongs and more traditional highbrow undie rap to weave a vocal tapestry of exceptionally high thread-count-- it's pop-hop in the vein of Why?'s recent work that never forgets that it is, at root, hip-hop. And while its themes are often serious, Free Kamal is giddy and upbeat, a bright ray of SoCal summer. A talented multi-instrumentalist with an obvious technical understanding of jazz, rock and pop, Antimc festoons his drum patterns with live playing that scans across the continuum of modern music. From the disco-funk of ""With Light Within"" and ""Movin' Truck"", to the echoing dub of ""First World Justice System"", to the chanting drum circle of ""The Weight of Secrets"", to the flamenco-guitar inflections of ""Stop Me Equals Death"", Antimc fluidly unites style after style under his distinctive and unified aegis. Free Kamal won't make you cut up your ATM card, but it might make you feel better about not being able to reconcile your desire to do so with the infeasibility of actually doing it.",,7.7,
Kalte Sterne: Early Recordings,Einstürzende Neubauten,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc13abf31b7dc7155c2c/1:1/w_160/e5ddc823.gif,2004-07-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2699-kalte-sterne-early-recordings/,MuteMute,"Most Americans seem to be under the impression that German is a very violent, harsh language, and that Germans are constantly yelling and ordering each other around. Granted, the language's emphasis on pronouncing consonants distinctly from one another makes it somewhat less fluid than, say, Italian or Portuguese, but in everyday conversation, spoken German usually sounds quite lyrical, with a distinctive cadence and bounce. I have a feeling that our stereotypes of Germany and its inhabitants are basically holdovers from the 1940s, when our nations were at war with each other and it was propagandistically advantageous to make our enemies appear as raving robot madmen. It seems there should be more than enough distance between us and World War II to have changed this perception by now, but let's face it: Americans by and large don't know shit about things outside their borders, and most of them don't care if their perceptions are wrong. And I suppose people like Blixa Bargeld aren't really helping things, either. Bargeld, as the mastermind behind German industrial provocateurs Einstürzende Neubauten, has realized every ounce of the language's potential for confrontational harshness over the last 2\xBD decades, though in fairness, he makes English sound just as frightening on the rare occasions when he chooses it over his native tongue. In the band's earliest phases, he never bothered to throw any bones to the English-speaking audiences in the world's largest music markets (why should he, really?), just as he never bothered to appease anyone who clung to notions like the one that songs should be accessible things, with snappy melodies and friendly beats that you could groove to. The band's early albums are breathtaking clinics in well-sculpted noise; abrasive, but not so extreme as to be unlistenable or inaccessible to an adventurous rock audience. Records like Kollaps and Halber Mensch may be uncompromising, but the band's early singles actually go them one better in terms of sheer brutal abstraction. Compiled by Bargeld on the new Mute compilation Kalte Sterne, these 13 tracks, most of which predate Neubauten's 1981 debut Kollaps, paint a picture of a band whose goal was to wring as much dread and catastrophe out of as limited a sound palette as possible. Some tracks, like closer ""Durstiges Tier"", consist of little more than skeletal gurgles of indeterminate origin, with Bargeld's whispered brain scrapings weaving in and out. Alexander Hacke is credited with ""amplified bowed wire"" on the track, and the thin, nasal sound he produces becomes the song's hideous, scoliated backbone. ""13 Loecher (Leben Ist Illegal)"" notoriously uses an electric drill as an instrument-- as literally ""industrial"" as music can get. The first five songs feature the duo of Bargeld and percussionist/power toolist Andrew Chudy as they made their first steps into the void in 1980. Here, Chudy's vaguely tribal drums provide a rhythmic drive for Bargeld's guitar string noise, tortured whispers and creepy-as-shit Korg synthesizer drones. The greatest achievement of the band's first incarnation is probably ""Tagesschau-Dub"", a hypnotic, electronically assaulted percussion drone (it's hard to make percussion drone, but they manage it) piled high with incongruous samples from TV and radio. It's an astute collage and one of several tracks that betrays the band's initial interest in dub production techniques. As new members climbed on board over the course of 1981, Neubauten largely left that approach behind, instead focusing on creating dense, martial barrages of noise full of sounds culled from beating sheets of metal, breaking glass and playing guitars as though they were washboards. Watch out with the headphones-- there are bursts of piercing white noise (most springing somehow from Bargeld's poor guitar) that can throw your equilibrium totally out of whack, not to mention leave a ringing in your ear for hours. And they have other ways to make you squirm: I haven't counted the number of times guest freak Lydia Lunch yells, ""Stick it/ Stick it/ Stick it full of holes,"" over the 9-minute course of ""Thirsty Animal"", but it's more than enough to make me uncomfortable. For anyone newcomers looking to acquire a taste for Bargeld's shop of horrors, Neubauten's Halber Mensch is a much better port of entry, but on its own merits, Kalte Sterne is a treasure trove of prime artifacts from the infancy of an important and groundbreaking band.","Newly reissued 1981 release from these industrial pioneers compiles their earliest work, painting a picture of a band whose goal was to wring as much dread and catastrophe out of as limited a sound palette as possible.

"50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong",The Fall,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3dea9e61561daa767a/1:1/w_160/1a8ce071.jpg,2004-07-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2976-50000-fall-fans-cant-be-wrong/,Beggars Banquet,"The Fall have seen so many compilations and reissues of their work during the course of their 26-year career that they named their latest full-length The Real Fall LP for clarification. Given the reputation of these numerous shoddy anthologies, however, and the fact that, with the exception of the excellent 2002 Rough Trade release, Totally Wired, there has never been any truly ""definitive"" Fall retrospective, the best a potential convert could hope for was to pick whichever disc bore the prettiest packaging. While other Fall comps pride themselves on monochromatic slabs of cover design more appropriate for Rothko retrospectives than tumultuous punk albums, 50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong instantly has one thing going for it: Its artwork is absolutely hilarious, keenly referencing Elvis Presley's billion-selling 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong. With its image of countless self-replicating Elvises hailing down in dashing suits, that original cover was a perfect embodiment of pop music's narcissism and weirdness-- incidentally also the two subjects of nearly every song Mark E. Smith ever laid to tape. As the first legitimate career-spanning compilation, 50,000 Fall Fans begins at the band's inception in 1977. Smith was a mere 20 years old, weaned on garage rock, kraut-rock, and a one-year stint as a dock worker. Like all young adults, he named his band after a Camus novel, quickly releasing a series of singles before 1979's full-length debut, Live at the Witch Trials. Represented by ""Repetition"", the pre-Witch Trials band consists of simple angular guitars, teen-pop rhythms, and drunken charm without any of the complexity or chaos that would later become integral to their work. Around 1980's Grotesque, The Fall began to seriously investigate other genres, channeling spiraling rodeos (""How I Wrote Elastic Man""), steely noise-pop (""Totally Wired""), and rhythmic shrapnel (""New Face in Hell""). 50,000 Fall Fans spends its leisurely time in this nascent stage, but the brunt of the album is understandably spent exploring The Fall's near-perfect run of albums in the mid-80s, from 1982's Hex Enduction Hour to 1986's Bend Sinister. A staggering 13 tracks from this era find their place on this two-disc set, forging a truly brilliant sequence. Ranging from the blustering, seismic noise of ""The Classical"" to the schizophrenic death-rattle of ""The Man Whose Head Expanded"", the album provides a convincing case that The Fall were the most uncompromisingly progressive and reliable band of the 1980s, whether they assumed the guise of punk heavyweights or sweet electro-divas (with the assistance of Smith's wife, Brix). With this sort of lead-in, even the most questionable song of the band's notorious early-90s phase seems challenging and substantive. Considering that this anthology's second disc includes the band's stab at Europop/ska-rap (""Why Are People Grudgeful?""), this is truly a feat. As a general rule, this disc pulls one song from every album released from 1990 to the present, distilling each allegedly mediocre release to one stunning single. If anything, however, these selections compel listeners to return to the band's 90s output with their tranquilized synths (""Masquerade"") and brash genre-blenders (the Cocteau Twins-vs.-AC/DC dynamics of ""The Chiselers""). Of course, with a career that's spanned four decades, 50,000 Fall Fans inevitably winds up omitting some of the most crucial songs in their canon, including ""Oh! Brother!"", ""Slang King"", ""Bombast"", and ""Oleano"". Still, the songs represented are consistently fascinating and invigorating, many standing as among the finest of the last quarter-century, chaotically navigating punk through ever more adventurous territory, from Countrypolitan to house music. As a result of this willed diversity and comprehensiveness, 50,000 Fall Fans has finally stepped up to assume its rightful position as the most successful and essential Fall compilation in existence-- a convenient summary for fearful neophytes reluctant to dip their toe into the black hole of the band's discography, as well as die-hard fans seeking a distillation of choice cuts from the group's more wayward 90s efforts. Smith is never less than inspiring on any of these 39 tracks, flaunting his confrontational sneer and leering sarcasm over some of the most erratic, riled riffs in punk. In his oft-ignored later period, Smith sounds even more unhinged, furious and battered, cloaking criticisms of governmental policies in lunatic poetics that the most pretentious high-school fanzine dadaists would cower before. Smith quite literally sounds as if his mouth has been pierced full of gaping holes leaking bile and cancer. Incidentally, this is also the fundamental difference between Smith and Elvis. Elvis was pure sexual dynamite, basking in his own libidinal juices; in sharp contrast, Smith is the ugliest, grimiest beast of Lucifer to ever drag his expanding head from a pub's water closet. Elvis may have drooled sex, but it was artificial, manipulative, cheap. The Fall, like all truly great sex, climaxes in rage, regret and release-- the three criteria for all utterly essential rock music. 50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong chronicles more than two decades of those climaxes, perhaps to one day be held in similar regard to the album its artwork parodies.","Finally, after an endless parade of spotty and/or unofficial compilations, legendary post-punk band The Fall are given their proper due with this two-disc, career-spanning retrospective, which at last offers a convenient summary of their best material-- from their 1977 roots to the present day.

Out of Nowhere,Hepcat,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19fb1335d7bf16982e3/1:1/w_160/c5cbdc26.jpg,2004-07-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3823-out-of-nowhere/,MoonMoon,"It's strange how, in discussing modern ska, talk often wafts into the dreaded subject of America's brief, ill-advised affair with swing music in the mid-1990s. We can all agree on neo-swing's pointless reanimation-- it was a style that was so deeply rooted in the period of its inception that fast-forwarding it to the post-grunge era and adorning it with tattoos and wallet chains smudged the dapper snap it possessed in its heyday. Plus, the music lacked soul, even in its prime; a whitewashing of the jitterbugging jump blues that steamed up many a segregated juke joint, swing just wasn't dangerous music. Ska, even in its revivalism, is a different story. Ska was soul, channeled from studios in New Orleans and Memphis, through transistor radios in the streets of Kingston in the early 60s, and then tilted onto the upbeat. Bands like The Melodians, The Skatalites, and Toots & The Maytals crafted the original Jamaican dance music, which of course was mellowed by age and ganja smoke to become reggae. The ska revival bands of late 1970s England added a brash, lefty political element and interracial Wayfarered cool, keeping the sound fresh even as it was appropriated. Some contention, however, arises in the mid-90s when the third wave crashed onto MTV, first spiking California pop/punk with a little Two-Tone two-step, then forsaking the skank altogether. So, that's the rough timeline of ska's evolution. Hepcat stands proudly outside it all. With syrupy three-part harmonies and horn-laced swoop, L.A.'s Hepcat hit the scene in the early 90s and immediately gained a reputation for their faithful re-heating of old-school Jamaican flavors. Their attention to the originators was immediately apparent in their buttery shoo-wop vocals, jazzy horns, and stylish, laid-back posture. For these guys, the term ""derivative"" was the greatest compliment, and their well-studied approach, coalesced during a tour with The Skatalites in '92, yielded some fantastic music that would fit comfortably on a '62 Studio One comp. After two early releases on small labels, the band was picked up by Epitaph in '98, released two more albums, and enjoyed limited mainstream success. Epitaph recently reissued Hepcat's hard-to-find '93 debut, Out of Nowhere, on its Hellcat subsidiary, a thrilling prospect for fans of the band and the genre. With its detailed liner notes and photos, this reissue is an intimate glimpse into the roots of modern ska's greatest roots band. While perhaps not as memorable as some of the group's later, greater tracks, these songs still show the same soulful, playful charge that made the band such a fan favorite. A joyful innocence pervades the record, present in the golden vocal harmonies their bubblegum subject matter. The band shows a bit of the reggae, Latin, and Caribbean influence that would be more fleshed out on later works like Scientific and Right on Time, but even songs introduced by an exotic dub echo or fancy piano trill quickly settle into that skittering, shuffling beat that serves as the happy-footed rhythmic foundation of their sound. A few songs (""The Secret"", ""Nigel"", ""Clarence Thomas"") are presently here in early versions that would show up fully realized on successive releases, and within these comparisons listeners can gauge the band's progression-- for the most part, Hepcat's arrangements, basslines, and overall passion only improved with experience. Still, Out of Nowhere stands as an early expression from a band that managed to remain forever young, looking back to the old days to keep their sound fresh when it really mattered.","Hellcat reissues this early release from one of the few redeeming bands to weather ska's third wave-- true to the genre's original 1960s form.

Monument,Tom Carter,by: Catherine Lewis,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70eb1335d7bf1698f84/1:1/w_160/cbbf5d90.jpg,2004-07-07 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1770-monument/,Kranky,"A few days before a solo show in 2001, Charalambides' Tom Carter recorded an improvised session on his lap steel guitar. The recordings were released in a very limited run-- only 55 CDR copies were sold-- on Charalambides' own Wholly Other label. This two-track, 49-minute record is neither as eerie nor as elaborate as most of his band's work; rather, it's a test of endurance and restraint as Carter repeats and tweaks his simple sonic notions, sometimes letting minutes go by with barely a discernable sound. The two-minute ""Monument 1 (Memorial)"" opens the album so faintly that in order to hear any of Carter's light rumblings, I had to pump the volume up to 11, creating so much hiss and distortion that it was nearly impossible to tell where the limitations of my speakers left off and Carter's guitar-tweaking dropped in. However, that subtle guitar scratching is just a warm-up act for what follows. ""Monument 2"" clocks in at 47 minutes, making it as much of an stamina-stretcher to listen to in one sitting as it surely was for Carter to record. The piece opens quietly, shimmering and wriggling out of Carter's fingertips as he lightly plucks a few notes. These sounds build on themselves, seeming to stay within a range of just a few notes as Carter varies the duration and volume of each pulse, focusing more on his brushstrokes and textures than on changing colors. He gradually incorporates more sounds and effects: the low, swooping moans at 12 minutes, the almost frantic shrillness at 16 minutes, and the climaxing flirtation between the two a few minutes later. This is where many would call it quits. Instead, Carter continues, backtracking almost to the beginning as his guitar's ringing tonalities slowly pulse and echo and fade away only to be picked up by the next slightly expanded repetition and carried just a little further, like waves slowly covering more ground as the tide comes back in. This continues for a rambling 10 minutes, until Carter finally pushes the volume up a notch for a momentary crest, then quickly sinks back down again. The tide gradually begins to ebb away with one last wail at 40:00 that pulses and resonates for several minutes as a few undercurrents fight their way to the surface, finally reaching some sort of harmony as the song shimmers into the distance as quietly as it began. It's these final few minutes that do seem interminable; the focus and drive of the piece's first half is gone and, like hitting the wall at a marathon's 22nd mile, all you want is for it all to end. Although there are certainly moments where Carter pauses long enough to imply a new thought-- or to call to question his continued focus-- this is just one track, one on which he somehow ends roughly where he had begun almost an hour earlier. Carter glares at a few simple sounds, stretching and pulling at them to conjure flickering images, transcending his self-imposed constraints through hallucination. This solo outing certainly won't have a widespread appeal (even among Charalambides fans) but Carter's restraint is, if nothing else, a marvel. For those willing to attempt to wade through Monument, it's a journey preferably taken with headphones on a dark night, with someone to pull you out if you slip too deeply inside its lulling trance.","Kranky offers this solo release from the frontman of free-folk icons Charalambides. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot to it.

Kompakt 100,Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8015e6ef959693210f0/1:1/w_160/d821e1e3.jpg,2004-07-07 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2020-kompakt-100/,Kompakt,"In interviews with preeminent German techno label/distributor Kompakt's principals (founders Michael Mayer and Wolfgang Voigt), the notion of ""family spirit"" often comes up. Since the Cologne-based enterprise originated as a record store, many of the artists, producers and other associates not only share aesthetic ideals, but close physical proximity. Aksel ""Superpitcher"" Schaufler started out working in the store before releasing his music on the label, and was already close friends with Mayer, Voigt and DJ Tobias Thomas; Tobias worked with Jörg ""The Modernist"" Burger on the scene mag House Attack prior to making his first production appearance for the Kompakt clan (via the sibling label Profan) on ""Sweet"" Reinhard Voigt's M 12-inch in 1996. Yet, despite Kompakt's incestuous nature, the label has succeeded in avoiding being pigeonholed as merely a purveyor of Kraftwerk-born, minimal dance music. In 2000, their Schaffelseiber compilation promoted ""shuffletech"" as a new slant on techno's time-honored 4/4 pulse by shifting the upbeats over a tad to produce a lightly swinging groove more related to the blues than the ultra-white Kraftwerk/Giorgio Moroder template. And unlike Paul Van Dyk-style arena-rave extravaganzas, Kompakt artists are more likely to bathe in puffed bliss than pump out PLUR-oughfare for space cadets. Artists like Kaito, Markus Guentner and The Orb have more in common with Brian Eno than The Bee Gees: Clear, uncluttered productions and an ambient, electronic sheen provide the spark in their near-colorless (yet intricate) structures and midnight vamps. Kompakt 100 celebrates the label's 100th vinyl release (not counting the subsidiary labels) filling four LPs (or two CDs) with Kompakt artists remixing Kompakt artists. This differs from past compilations (like the Pop Ambient and Total series) in that none of the original tracks are actually new, but taken as a whole, the collection is a convenient summary of the imprint's first six years. However, it doesn't necessarily represent the current state of Kompakt, where artists like Justus Köhncke and Superpitcher are pushing its traditionally understated ideals to the brink with comparatively extroverted disco, approaching pure, shiny pop via excellent 2004 releases. Though both of these artists are represented on this compilation, I'd like to have heard more of their influence throughout. Kompakt 100 is a decent introduction to the label for newcomers, but fans may feel the remixes don't improve or update their sources enough to warrant repeated plays. Though the set isn't programmed to flow together as a continuous mix, the best moments occur when the track sequencing cooperates with the songs' momentum. On the first disc of the CD version, there's a three-song stretch featuring The Modernist's remix of Köhncke's ""Weiche Zaune"", Joachim Spieth's pounding mix of Mayer's shuffle ""17 & 4"" and the first of two versions of Superpitcher's ""Tomorrow"" that suggests Kompakt 100 could make a fine party starter. Coming out of the hard, squelched bassline of ""17 & 4"", Kaito's mix of the Superpitcher song glides by with precision and grace, accentuating Schaufler's original vocal with airy synths and fashion show chic. Wassermann (a Mayer alias) almost keeps pace with a smooth, dreamy mix of Reinhard Voigt's ""Robson Ponte"" but the CD recedes into cloudy floss prematurely with two melancholy remixes by Guentner (Kaito's ""Respect to the Distance"") and label elder statesman Olaf Dettinger (Closer Musik's ""One Two Three [No Gravity]""). The second disc follows a similar pattern, right down to the final two tracks of warm, fuzzy ambience. The obvious highlight is Köhncke's version of the Freiland (aka Wolfgang Voigt) track ""Frei"" mashed with Marc Bolan's ""Hot Love"", transforming pleasant shuffletech into glam-rock for androids-- at press time, Köhncke is arguably the only person in the world who can sell a line like, ""He ain't no bitch, and I love the way he twitch, uh-huh,"" convincingly. Jurgen Paape's mix of Schaeben & Voss' ""The World Is Crazy"" and their own reworking of ""Dicht Dran"" works well as a double shot of aggressive microhouse (also featuring micro-melody), while Closer Musik's Matias Aguayo teams with Leandro Fresco to turn Fresco's ""Cera Uno"" into a burning, bass-heavy tech-samba. Elsewhere, as on ScSi-9's mix of ""Tomorrow"", inoffensive pleasantries threaten to steal wind from the disc's sails, but as with the Kompakt label itself, 100 generally returns whatever interest you care to invest.","For their 100th release, tech-house monolith Kompakt issues this celebratory two-disc compilation showcasing its artists remixing their labelmates.

"Oh, My Girl",Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6755e6ef95969320d42/1:1/w_160/6e378b21.gif,2004-07-07 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7766-oh-my-girl-with-the-sweet-hereafter/,Barsuk,"There's no way around that voice. On her second album leading The Sweet Hereafter, Jesse Sykes tries valiantly to showcase her crack backing band, favoring phrasing that leaves room for Phil Wandscher's meticulously crafted guitar peels, or a subtle mood affirmation from violinist Anne Marie Ruljancich. But the sailors know it's Sykes' alto dashing ships on the rocks, and challenging the alt-country tag at the same time. ""Your black eyes remind me/ Of the dreaming dead,"" Sykes sings over some kind of reworked psych-folk rhythm, and she sounds like a suddenly un-shy Chan Marshall flirting dangerously with her inner Arthur Lee. Hailing from the wet winds of Seattle, Jesse and Wandscher-- together with Ruljancich, bassist Bill Herzog, and consistently understated drummer Kevin Warner-- have been crafting sleepy meditations on American music and the human condition since 2002's gorgeously strong-jawed Reckless Burning. Still, it's Oh, My Girl that will give them their due, since (paging Seth Cohen and Death Cab for Cutie) their new label, Barsuk, has promotional balls. Example? Girl recently broke through to the l'il smokies 'n' cocktails affluence crowd with a fawning review on NPR's All Things Considered. Damn right it was fawning-- with their new record, Sykes and The Sweet Hereafter easily trample the confining fences of y'allternative, instead aiming steadily for mystery salons held in the narthexes of brokedown cathedrals. ""He took the fall/ 'Cause some things in life are still worth a good brawl."" ""Tell the Boys""' hard-hours morning light shuffle is only a blank page for Sykes' pointed suggestion of a lyric. The story doesn't finish-- there's regret, and people getting sober, and the title's resigned request-- but the images shuttle through Wandscher's guitar leads like otherworldly newsreels. On ""You Are Not Gotten Here"", Ruljancich's violin suggests the brittle melancholy of Nick Drake's ""Cello Song"", but there's something purer and darker in Sykes singing ""there's fire on your tongue,"" backed up by guitars that are either sad drinking partners or friends enlisted to help bury a body. As striking and evocative as Jesse Sykes & The Sweet Hereafter can be, many will map their favorite spots. Yes, Oh, My Girl does continually return carrier pigeon-like to the warm comfort between Sykes' elongated vowels and Wandscher's inky twang leads. But isn't this is what we want? One or two notes of that prairie fire smoke and we're hooked on Sykes' vocal; her supporting players are proven soul-tweak pros. We want our Americana to resonate with a mixture of warmth and scratch, of death and love. And, like a trusty old radio, Oh, My Girl delivers. ""Troubled Soul"" and ""Winter Hunter"" are as tart as Washington apples, alive with feeling but sweetly, sultrily inviting. This is the album of sad beauty the Scud Mountain Boys were too suicidal to make; it's what happens when fronting on style is shunned in favor of inventive songwriting that focuses (perhaps too closely, but whatever) on the unique talents of a lineup. Throughout Oh, My Girl, it always seems like Sykes and her people are holding back, as if they might throw the cloak off a thundering acoustic version of Heart's ""Magic Man"" at any moment, and send us all caterwauling back to a time when genres weren't micro-managed, bras weren't worn, and evocation was a necessity borne with learning how to sing. This never quite happens, though the weird psychedelic overtones that keep welling up do wonders for overactive imaginations wishing to contextualize Girl as an understated look at the legacy of late-60s/early-70s rock.

Autour de la Lune,Biosphere,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b0c0084474cd0c00d1/1:1/w_160/2952333a.jpg,2004-07-07 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/710-autour-de-la-lune/,Touch,"Biosphere's Geir Jenssen knows from cold. Residing as he does near the Arctic Circle in Norway, Jenssen understands the psychological implications of a sun that, like a lamented deadbeat parent, routinely disappears for months at a time, and the absence of that essential lifeforce takes an inevitable emotional toll that informs Jenssen's art. It's tempting to say that Biosphere's bleak music sounds as it does for the same reason countries of Norway's approximate latitude make the world's best Vodka. But then Jenssen's other great passion is mountaineering (he has climbed the 26,906 foot Himalayan peak Cho Oyu without oxygen), suggesting a kernel of inspired humanity frozen in the tundra. The vacuum of space gets pretty close to absolute zero, cold's recognized ideal, so it makes sense that the conceptually minded Jenssen sets albums there. His latest trip into the beyond started when French radio commissioned Jenssen to create a piece using their archives. He selected sounds from a radio dramatization of Jules Verne's space travel story De la Terre à la Lune (""From the Earth to the Moon"") and pulled additional material from recordings made at the MIR space station, then combined the fragments with his own new music. The result is Autour de la Lune, a single 74-minute piece in nine movements. The samples are used sparingly throughout Autour de la Lune, and the beat-driven side of Biosphere is completely absent. Mostly, the record is a showcase for long and impossibly deep drones. The 21-minute opener ""Translation"" is an exception here, as a cluster of midrange notes that braid to form a definite melody. Rather than referencing found sound or environmental recordings, ""Translation"" seems inspired by film music, with tense throbs and horn-like synth lines that suggest captured images of a spacecraft leisurely moving in front of stars. The scene is set. The following ""Rotation"" does away with the fanfare to send faint pings and bass swells into the blackness, but the exceptional ""Modifié"" is where the record starts to get creepy. Jenssen processes human voices-- hard to tell if they're from the radio broadcast or MIR cosmonauts-- in a way that merges them completely with the electrical noise that carries them. They sound lost and unreachable, the last little whimpers of a doomed crew about to be swallowed by the event horizon. And yet, they're singing, kind of. We follow them into darkness with the next few tracks, which consist of little more than the most punishing bass tones I've ever heard on a CD. On ""Déviation"", sounds hover at the bottom end of human audibility, causing all but the heartiest subwoofers to sound like an open newspaper flapping in a strong wind. I've approached this bass from three different sources (two sets of headphones and my living room speakers), and I can only guess the genuine sound through triangulation. Strange things happen when I listen to ""Circulaire"" loud on headphones; the low end is total and all encompassing, but with the kind of throb that happens when you can hear your heart beating in your ears. The contrast means that the ambient sounds wherever I happen to be create ""notes"" in between the pulses. Because it seems so grounded in biology, I can't help but imagine this middle section as a musical approximation of the ambience in a suit during a spacewalk, where you hear nothing but your own body. If that's so, ""Tombant"" is accompaniment to the final drift back into the docking hatch, as it reprises the textures and symphonic swell of the opening ""Translation"". Autour de la Lune is an excellent record that is nearly victimized by its awesome conceptual success. It offers such a compelling and internally complete idea of interstellar space-- moods, textures, samples, cover art, all of it-- that it loses some flexibility when it comes to individual interpretation. Still, Jenssen gotten exactly where he wanted to go. Upon reaching the icy mountain peak, he kept climbing into the stars.","Seventh album from this ambient mainstay draws its source material from recordings made at the MIR space station.

Golden Apples of the Sun,Various Artists,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20d9d034d5c69bf2ae1/1:1/w_160/cc07ef15.gif,2004-07-07 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/549-golden-apples-of-the-sun-compilation/,Bastet,"About 10 years ago, I put a copy of Morton Subotnick's Silver Apples of the Moon on hold at a used record store in New Jersey. I've avoided picking it up mostly because I like the idea of it still being nestled away somewhere, forgotten by everyone. Devendra Banhart's title Golden Apples of the Sun neatly references the final line from W.B. Yeats' ""The Song of Wandering Angus"", where it's paired with those silver moon apples. (""And pluck till time and times are done/ The silver apples of the moon/ The golden apples of the sun."") It's also an album by Judy Collins, a collection of stories by Ray Bradbury, and a low-budget 1971 film about violence and hippies. But perhaps Banhart chose the title to contrast directly with Subotnick's famously chilly modulations, because even while this compilation functions as a kind of now-sound capsule of the contemporary neo-folk scene, its best artists share an anachronistic, misfiled air with Subotnick's dusty gem, patiently awaiting discovery. Whatever the title's derivation, as head curator, Banhart assumes the tricky role of scene definer. I can't imagine the man behind ""This Beard Is for Siobhan"" subscribing to locked-door scenesterism, but Golden Apples of the Sun draws a clean line in the sand. Unlike Brian Eno, who kept his No New York sampler to just four acts, the bearded bard here musters a generous spread of 20 diverse freakfolk acts to serve as representatives of the various facets of the underground's most recent (and most promising) pigeonhole. Not intended to flood the market, Golden Apples of the Sun is limited to 1,000 copies and can only be had through Arthur magazine, which released the disc on its newly founded Bastet imprint. For this disc, Banhart wisely pairs spankin' new tracks with a number of previously released ones. In an interesting change of pace from most compilations, however, the non-exclusive cuts are the real draw here, and they greatly benefit from both Banhart's careful sequencing and separation from their original full-lengths. Saddled between two downcast instrumentals, Little Wings' ""Look at What the Light Did Now"" absolutely sparkles. Kyle Field owns a preternaturally heartbreaking (and charmingly off-key) voice even at his happiest, and here, outside the context of his spotty K Records albums, his syllables are remarkably affecting. Viking Moses also kicks it Little Wings-style; his ""Crosses"" (from the album of the same name) displays a pawnshop sweetness: ""Without love, life is gone/ Without life, love goes on and on."" Golden Apples' shifts in gradation keeps the narrative from stalling-out: Espers' ""Byss & Abyss"" balances boy/girl contrast with just the right amount of Philly opiate haziness; six-stringer Jack Rose ups the finger-picking ante with the careening notes of ""White Mule"" from his Red Horse, White Mule; Iron & Wine beautifully represent for soft strums with ""Fever Dream"" from their hugely popular Our Endless Numbered Days; and Banhart himself shows up dueting with folk legend Vashti Bunyan on the title track of his recent masterstroke, Rejoicing in the Hands. Anti-folk singer/songwriter and nutritionist Diane Cluck's ""Heat from Every Corner"" (from Macy's Day Bird) comes complete with ambient footsteps and a click of the off switch, and sounds as though it was placed on tape by Chan Marshall 40 years ago. Current 93 collaborator and one of NYC's most compelling voices, Antony, closes out the disc in style with a musical interpretation of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Lake"", featuring his signature heart-rending, androgynous operatics and mesmerizing piano. (If you're unfamiliar with his work, check out the I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy EP and be blown away by the brilliant camp heartache.) Displacement breathes life into Currituck Co.'s ""The Tropics of Cancer"", a smiling but subdued acoustic instrumental from the often enjoyable Ghost Man on First, while Vetiver turn in ""Angel's Share"", a collaboration with Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval that marked the standout on their self-titled debut. White Magic's ""Don't Need"" isn't the most riveting track from the Brooklyn trio's Drag City debut, but this meandering twanger makes more sense in the compilation's context than any of Through the Sun Door's witchier tracks. Meanwhile, inherently strong numbers continue to shine: Joanna Newsom's ""Bridges and Balloons"" feels just as triumphant torn from The Milk-Eyed Mender. It functions as a lead-in for Six Organs of Admittance's ""Hazy SF"", a wee ditty that swims in the suave-dude realm of Compathia rather than the gorgeous spaciousness of the recently reissued gem For Octavio Paz. The real treats, however, come courtesy of two lesser-known acts. Chicago's Josephine Foster (of Born Heller and The Children's Hour) rustles backwoods memories amid banjo, flute, and the indescribable air of English romanticism on the unreleased home recording ""Little Life"". It's a stunning fragment: Shirley Collins collides with and bows gently within the cleansing mud of a rocky stream. Likewise, ex-Matty & Mossy vocalist Jana Hunter blows the roof off the barn with ""Farm, CA"", a section of hauntingly whispered lo-fi dreaminess. Not everything here achieves the understated power of these aforementioned tracks, but Golden Apples of the Sun's sprawling landscape presents a persuasive case for the depth of a scene that seemingly sprung up (like mushrooms) overnight. It's impossible to pick apart intentions, but this music feels far more sincere than other recent buzzes, and even if these artists are pulling the wool over our eyes (which seems unlikely), it would appear that perhaps a few of these players will outlast the current critical harvesting. To see if I'm right, hide this disc in your bedroom after one listen and wait a decade before that second date.",,8.6,
Selected Recordings,Eberhard Weber,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa99ea9e61561daa5bfe/1:1/w_160/abfa7d77.gif,2004-07-06 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8777-selected-recordings/,ECM,"Imagine the scene: You're in your seventh hour of practicing your instrument and you're ready for some nice wine and cheese, when the phone rings. It's Manfred Eicher from ECM, head of the world's most famous art music label, calling to say that he's kicking off a new series of anthologies. Not only does he want to give you a disc, but he wants you to pick the tunes. So you go to your record collection and dust off up to 30 years of old vinyl, and as you flip through possibly dozens of albums, you have to decide: Who are you? And what do you want to say about yourself? Like the most well-adjusted guy at the high school reunion, Pat Metheny used his set to rattle off hit after hit and reminisce in the liner notes about all the good times he had, before leaving for a bigger label. Chick Corea left out his influential experimental work with Circle, while Keith Jarrett packed his set with material that he didn't think we paid enough attention to the first time, including a bunch of weird stuff with clavichord and recorders. And at the other end of the ""look at me"" spectrum from Jarrett, Bill Frisell included a piece that he didn't even write or perform on. No matter how strong the collections tend to be, no artistic or commercial logic-- no hard curatorial judgment-- guides what ends up on them, and that's both revealing and flawed. German bassist and composer Eberhard Weber has worked with the ECM label almost since its founding. Weber performs on an electric, five-string bass of his own design, which produces a unique, almost rubbery, elongated tone, higher than usual for an upright and elastically melodic. Most of his major work came out on ECM, aside from one stint in pop music-- a few appearances with Kate Bush, who used Weber's distinct tone most notably on ""Houdini."" Nowadays, he tours with Jan Garbarek's group and has only cut two albums of his own in the last decade, most recently in 2001. It's not surprising that Weber splits this album almost equally between sideman gigs and his own bands. But he doesn't explain why he skipped his only masterpiece-- his debut, The Colours of Chloe. One of ECM's earliest classics, Chloe still sounds unprecedented; the only albums I could compare it to are some of the dreamier fusion and prog music of the time from maybe Soft Machine, and its most childlike moments might appeal to fans of Boards of Canada. Weber, keyboardist Rainer Brüninghaus, and fluegelhornist Ack van Rooyen front a chorus of cellos, whose long, drowning tones evoke the feel of crumbling walls: From a European, it echoes the feeling of an old civilization growing older, of an almost epic weariness that threatens to drag down the entire group-- especially on ""An Evening with Vincent Van Ritz"", recently sampled-- and why don't more people sample ECM?-- by Prefuse 73, where they and the wordless, keening voice of Gisela Schäuble tug at Weber's feet. Yet Weber soars across the solemnity, pulling high notes and elegiac melodies onto the foreground to mark the death of one generation with the emergence of another. On the slow ""More Colours"", Weber's bass yo-yos against the heavy silences. And the title song, still Weber's most famous piece, has a simple, sing-songy primary melody that Weber performs on the ocarina, evoking a peeking-over-the-crib revelation like an infant realizing for the first time that the sun rises and sets. And while the through-composed elements frame the album, the solos by Bruninghaus and (on ""Van Ritz"") van Rooyen are so perfectly formed that I can still recall them note for note. Chloe remains Weber's most endearing work, not least because he's so obviously finding his way through the album; he recalls, in the liner notes to this collection, that he had to record the title song in two stages before he figured out how to make it work. Maybe he feels that the album was immature or too rough around the edges, because he doesn't include a single song from it. Weber does tap his 70s work twice, with ""Silent Feet"", where Brüninghaus' extended piano solo takes off like horses at a shotgun blast, and ""Fluid Rustle"", which is nearly as enigmatic as the Chloe tracks. Weber builds the piece from a theme that could've been played by a five-year-old on a xylophone, then gives that theme to vibes virtuoso Gary Burton and reflects it through a hall of mirrors of overdubbed, wordless female vocals. Weber also includes some decently jazzy sideman gigs, including his vigorous accompaniment on Metheny's composition ""The Whopper"", named for Weber's favorite American sandwich. But as Weber entered the 80s, he moved even further towards the neo-classical, largely composed music that he's making now, where the improvisation naps within a refined, chamber ensemble-like environment. Of a track from 1982, Weber writes in the liner notes, ""For my favourite sequence on 'Maurizius' I have to wait 4 minutes and 16 seconds. I guess one has to be a musician to understand that."" Actually, even teenagers know that ""Stairway to Heaven"" doesn't start with the guitar solo. But if the somewhat breathless lilt that hits halfway through the piece is worth waiting for, ""Maurizius"" mostly sounds limp and channeled, especially under the deathly peaceful reeds of Windham Hill artist Paul McCandless. Likewise, the final track, 2001's ""French Diary"", swells and paces like a soap opera-soundtrack. Weber actually sits this one out, so set on being a composer that he blows off his stature as one of ECM's greatest bass improvisers. The piece suffers without him. ""There is a great discrepancy between classical music and jazz in that classical music concentrates more on the tried-and-tested, while in jazz the focus is more on the experimental,"" writes Weber. ""And favoring emotion and spontaneity, however superficial, some people-- critics included-- often lose sight of quality."" He's got me there, because ECM's worst-- by which I mean, coziest-- music favors quality over invention. You can often learn the most about an artist, or a label, from his most boring recordings, because that's when the clichés and old habits come out. ECM has been typecast as gorgeous but complacent, and it's sometimes called the father of new age because it let slip all the tension and conflict that new age dispensed with entirely. So it fits that instead of reevaluating or, God forbid, judging these artists, these artist compilation discs would turn into souvenir-style recordings. But does friendliness make great music? Weber makes a cogent case for how he got to his present work, but he doesn't make room for the pieces that don't fit. He's too busy polishing his epitaph to remember that some musicians make their best work when they don't sound like themselves-- when they wrestle with new ideas, instead of sinking into the same familiar, quality-controlled surroundings.","German bassist and composer Eberhard Weber compiles what he feels is his career's best work-- and leaves off his best work!

A Rare Sensation,The Chinese Stars,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6dfea9e61561daa5473/1:1/w_160/41904ceb.jpg,2004-07-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1726-a-rare-sensation/,Three-One-G,"Well, isn't this just great. The Chinese Stars are now a ""dude"" Erase Errata. Much like their West Coast counterpart, the Providence band has put together a full-length album with nine attempts at playing the same goddamn song. All the tempos are exactly the same, there's a token noisy guitar riff that introduces every track and then sticks with it throughout, and singer Eric Paul consistently rattles off crackpipe lyrics about body parts, bugs and machines. And, save some occasional breaks, there's more fucking swishy hi-hat than anyone could possibly tolerate. Erase Errata's a lost cause, but who told this promising Providence band to start parodying themselves, too? It's a shame. The quartet, constituted of ex-Arab on Radar and Six Finger Satellite members, managed remarkable variety on their debut Turbo Mattress EP, and with perplexing second nature-- it was as if The Chinese Stars had no idea they had dancepunk tendencies. The slow-in-muck bursts of guitar noise on ""The Fastest Horse Yet"", the hyper-intelligent rhythm switchups on ""Arson Hotline"", and the kamikaze fuck-it-all counterbeat on ""Loose Traffic"" all fit into the genre without bowing before its silly self-conscious rule: It ain't good if you can't dance to it. The Turbo Mattress EP did have two fairly straightforward dancepunk songs-- ""Sick Machine"" and ""Eyes of the Secret North""-- but given the band's noisy prehistories, even these songs came off as relentless, spit-happy monsters that just happened to be danceable. These days, it would seem The Chinese Stars are concerned only with being a one-trick dancepunk band. They've streamlined their act to cover just one relatively accessible sound, one friendly tempo, and one swishy hi-hat schtick. This is fine for a track or two on A Rare Sensation, especially considering that guitarist Paul Viera's serrated single-plucks and noisy bone-dry heaves on opener ""Cheap City Halo"" rival his best moments on Turbo Mattress, and Eric Paul's deceptively kind tambourine work loosens up the song's potentially too serious tone. Dance meets punk remarkably midway on ""Girls of Las Vegas"", to a large extent because of bassist Rick Pelletier's rubbery dub line that recalls PiL tracks ""Memories"" and ""Careering"". But elsewhere on A Rare Sensation, tracks follow one another indistinguishably. An occasional this-or-that jumps out of the album's obnoxiously persistent monotony, but in most cases, it's Viera on guitar again, clearly the band's hardest working member. As was the case on Turbo Mattress, Viera has complete control over an entire spectrum of noise, from the mousey snickers on ""Dressed to Get Blessed"" to the speaker specters on ""Electrodes in Captivity"" to the pained whelps in ""Hospital Fly"". Moments like these make me wish that The Chinese Stars would realize something about themselves: They can pull off much more than this. Here, the band happened to put all their eggs into that basket, and A Rare Sensation sells them frustratingly short.","Featuring former members of Arab on Radar and Six Finger Satellite, this band's 2003 EP had them poised to save dancepunk.

Laputa,Susumu Yokota,by: Liam Singer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab0513d1975652139b39/1:1/w_160/8225446a.gif,2004-07-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8877-laputa/,Skintone,"By now, the concept of the ""parallel universe"" probably rivals the theory of relativity as the best-known scientific/metaphysical concept of the 20th Century. It's spawned thousands of science fiction novels and films, countless stoned teenage conversations, and at least one awesome TV show starring Jerry O'Connell. The idea, of course, is that at any point in time, all available choices and possibilities are realized in an ever-blooming flower of multiverses. I mention it because, occasionally, I get the feeling that an album I'm listening to has arrived from one of these parallel existences-- that the artist has, at some point, departed from his or her peers to create music inspired by the same sources, but achieved through a parallel axis of logic. Unfortunately, these albums that fail to appeal to some sense of familiarity and categorization are easily overlooked, and only occasionally rescued from history's cruel used bin. Susumu Yokota makes albums that increasingly worry the boundaries of IDM, ambient and sound collage. Yokota has come at abstract music from the origin of being a house DJ in his native Japan, meaning that his sensibilities are not always aligned with those who balk at the cheesy tropes of techno (warm synth tones playing major seventh chords, heavily reverbed female vocal samples, etc), yet too unconventional and complex for the trance crowd. Laputa is Yokota's most abstract and foreboding-sounding release yet. Almost entirely beatless, its pieces float quietly in and out of existence, operating according to their own logic and leaving the same faint, surreal impressions as dreams upon waking. Initially, Laputa strikes as a sample-based version of Eno's Shutov Assembly or Aphex Twin's Ambient II. But this is not ambient music-- not in the sense that ambient is designed to integrate with its environment, that the musical events in an ambient piece occur randomly within defined parameters, nor in the club-oriented sense of the term. Playing this CD while you attempt to engage with the world around you will likely induce a state of unease, monotony, and (as I discovered) creep out any visitors who decide to stop by your place. It is an immensely subtle album that rewards attention, but to the half-listening ear is an aimless amalgamation of rhythmically incoherent samples. As the record's proclamatory title suggests, Yokota attempts to create a world in itself. His aim is not to transform your external environment, but to form one in your head-- if Eno's Another Green World presents a universe not unlike our own, where they still have swimming little fishes and bouncy pop music, Laputa presents an abstract and entirely unfamiliar space. As much as any electronic artist working today, Yokota is directly indebted to the minimalists of the 70s and 80s, even paying homage in the piece ""Grey Piano"", which takes as its musical cues from Arvo Part's piano work on ""For Alina"". He often employs the musical devices of minimalism, such as interlocking circular melodies and processes of slow transformation, and is especially adept at creating rhythms produced through the interaction of two evolving samples, as evidenced by the interlocking left and right channels of ""Heart by Heart"". Against various droney and spacious backdrops, Yokota presents independently floating and interacting bits of sound that suggest geometric patterns and shapes, such as the woman's voice at the beginning of ""Trip Eden"" that rises and reverses upon itself like a sleek symmetrical object. Laputa does have a couple of lulls: ""True Story"", for example, owes a bit too much to the conventions of pastoral ambient. Which is a shame, because otherwise,Laputa is strikingly original. The album will certainly turn off those seeking instrumental music with direct emotional resonance, as Yokota's impact comes not from his manipulation of feelings, but from his musical transformation of space and time. It may also alienate fans of experimental music who equate complexity with dissonance. Laputa is the sound of Susumu Yokota letting go of any inhibitions regarding his definition as an artist. Hopefully, listeners will allow themselves the same level of freedom, as Laputa is a world that deserves tourists.","Susumu Yokota makes albums that increasingly worry the boundaries of IDM, ambient and sound collage.

The Throes,Two Gallants,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87eea9e61561daa582a/1:1/w_160/b4c38027.jpg,2004-07-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8261-the-throes/,Alive,"If rock music is all about transience, how can a song born decades ago still rev up the engines of romance? ""Tangled Up in Blue"", for instance, is a tale of fading love, but the power and significance of the song itself is timeless. Rock 'n' roll is often an expression of youth or youth's passing, but when music (or any art) endures, its magnetism is only amplified with the passage of years. For that reason, and because the best songs are usually pinned by the listener to some quintessential moment, the classics become classic. Passion is a fleeting feeling, but the best art will evoke that feeling with every exposure. So when youth produces a work of such force, when the raw or supposedly naïve artist comes up with something universal, critics and fans rejoice. We want to latch on to a beautiful thing before its green genius withers under the glare of success. Such is the case with Two Gallants' debut The Throes. The San Francisco duo responsible for this gut-wrenching musical tragedy both just turned 21, yet somehow their musical hindsight extends far beyond recent memory and taps into a rusty vein swollen with grief, heartache and violent desperation. When songwriting this evocative is paired with playing so dynamic, especially in an acoustic setting, Dylan comparisons are inevitable. Given Two Gallants' guitar and drums lineup and rustic blues-based repertoire, many might cry White Stripes as well. There are better analogies, though: More narrative than abstract, Adam Stephenson's lyrics are closer to Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter's romantic Old West allegories, luckless sagas of trains and booze and double-crossing lovers. Meanwhile, Tyson Vogel's shifting thoroughbred pulse on drums is less Meg White then Patrick Carney of The Black Keys. That The Black Keys' and Two Gallants' debut releases were both released on Alive Records is no coincidence; both embrace a hardened revivalist style that owes a lot to the dark Delta legends. But the mug-swinging sea shanty bluster and jailbreak urgency Two Gallants add to indie rock's newfound blues idolatry are purely original, and make The Throes an electric, unforgettable listen. There's a modernizing of old styles here-- the album begins with a frantic garage-rock rearrangement of the 1930s Reverend Robert Wilkins track ""You Losing Out"". The gutsy ""Nothing to You"" opens like an angry country blues rant but tosses in some clever quips: ""My kind's been around forever/ Yet I claim to be one of the few/ And the lost cause of words walks away with my nerves/ 'Cause I'm gay as a choir boy for you,"" and then later, ""I followed you into the party/ That no one invited me to/ But I got so drunk and retarded/ I fell down the stairs and I fell into you."" Forgoing conventional verse/chorus/verse structure, these songs build a creaking work song practicality and archetypal power. ""Fail Hard to Regain"" contains almost no repetition, but Stephenson's reedy voice tears into the subconscious and lodges mercilessly like a tick. It's the albums most raucous, ballsy composition, Stephenson's harmonica and guitar perfectly punctuated by Vogel's storming percussion, and yet with speaks in stanzas reminiscent of a whiskey-soaked Dylan Thomas poem: ""'Twas on a dark March evening, southbound I did ride/ My head was out the window when I found her at my side/ Asked where I was going to, I told her from where I came/ For the jails in which I've done my time, I fail hard to regain."" That soulful Pogues-style urbanizing of down-home bumpkinism, combined with an unbridled, youthful vigor, balances the album's startlingly troubling themes. ""The Throes"" tells intimately of a vicious, abusive relationship; accompanied by cello, ""Crow Jane"" is a haunting version of a traditional murder ballad covered by the likes of Skip James and Nick Cave. Like a course in musicology these songs bring out an incredible richness of history, telling stories based on the half-truths and legends that bring the ghosts of long dead musicians and musical styles into new light. James Joyce was in his early 20s when he finished the short story of shiftless, dissolute youth that Two Gallants take their name from. Dubliners, the collection in which the story appeared in 1905, would later be hailed a literary masterpiece. Suffering only in its somewhat understated production, The Throes could be considered a masterpiece of new American roots music. It's a heavy emotional investment, a struggle of the most fulfilling kind. There's a lot to learn from these young bards, as much as they've learned in their short lives. When brilliance arrives so early it's always that much more profound.","San Francisco-based garage-rock duo modernize ancient forms with soulful Pogues-style urbanizing of down-home bumpkinism and unbridled, youthful vigor.

In a Safe Place,The Album Leaf,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a040b1335d7bf1697f9b/1:1/w_160/7592b532.jpg,2004-07-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/101-in-a-safe-place/,Sub Pop,"When Sigur Rós' breakthrough sophomore record-- the perpetually lingering Agaetis Byrjun-- was released internationally in late 2001, ecstatic scribes across the globe simultaneously tensed and paused, curling over their cheap notebooks, chewing on ballpoint pens, and trying, desperately and collectively, to conjure the perfect glacial metaphor, to birth a descriptor appropriately gnarled and vast, to ink the impeccable (and inevitable) line from Iceland's craggy landscapes to Sigur Rós' dark, desolate compositions. Since then, Iceland's sprawling horizon has become an oddly ubiquitous touchstone for describing contemporary American music, with loads of new bands snatching their spectral bits from Sigur Rós' massive arsenal of otherworldliness. Tristeza's Jimmy LaValle, who has been recording spare, instrumental hymnals as The Album Leaf since late 1998, is the closest North American equivalent to the pale Nordic maestro, and his pockets are well-stuffed with the papers to prove it: After touring extensively with Sigur Rós (who frequently joined LaValle onstage), LaValle was shuttled-via-invite to Mosfellsbaer, Iceland to record at Sundlaugin, Sigur Rós' home studio, borrowing their string section, Amina, and collaborating with vocalist Jon Thor Birgisson and members of (fellow Icelandic howlers) Múm. The resulting record, The Album Leaf's third, is a collection of wispy rock songs peppered with sputtering beats, vocals, Moog, and gently whining strings. Curiously, LaValle's portrait of Iceland presents a far cooler vision than his guides' ever have: In a Safe Place is occasionally chilling, a studied, calming slice of icy serenity. With tinkling Rhodes piano, glockenspiel, and subtly propulsive percussion, In a Safe Place is the sound of slowing down; the record feels tired-but-satisfied, like crawling home after a long night of misadventures, burrowing into the backseat of a cab, squinting your eyes at the light buzzing across the horizon, tying your shoes, and thinking hard about blankets. LaValle has always masterfully straddled the thin, gray stretch between Saturday night debauch and Sunday morning remorse, and In a Safe Place exists almost exclusively in the moments where nothing feels quite real, the place LaValle calls ""safe."" The Album Leaf is a solo effort, but LaValle is famously collaborative (he's also been tangled up with The Locust and GoGoGo Airheart), and, in addition to Birgisson, The Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins is often present to coo along to LaValle's gleaming cuts. Still, it's LaValle's own vocal contributions-- his first time singing with The Album Leaf-- that hit first and hardest. ""On Your Way"" sees LaValle chanting carefully along with Jenkins, singing high and flat over a pinging bit of melodic space-pop; their respective imperfections shine like bits of red mitten stuck to a frozen window, awkward and stupidly beautiful. Birgisson's contribution-- the impeccably weird ""Over the Pond""-- is sung in his trademark Hopelandic, and features backing samples of his own vocals, whirled into cartoon hysterics. ""Over the Pond"" is insistently haunting, a meditative, piano-heavy examination of intangibles, as satisfying as it is vague. Detractors will be sure to note that In a Safe Place can feel numbingly repetitive at moments, but all that expansive diddling contributes equally to the record's allure: Like rolling past the North Pole or through West Texas, this record plays with its own redundancies, building an entire universe from strange, barren pieces. In the end, it all spins into nothing.","After Album Leaf mastermind Jimmy LaValle opened for Sigur Rós on their U.S. tour, the band invited him back to their Icelandic studio, where he cut this record with help from Sigur frontman Jon Thor Birgisson and the string quartet Amina. Birgisson guests, as do members of Black Heart Procession and Múm.

"The Orchestra, Sadly, Has Refused",The Silent League,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a674b1335d7bf1698e26/1:1/w_160/f4336585.jpg,2004-07-05 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7765-the-orchestra-sadly-has-refused/,File-13,"To paraphrase my favorite critic, LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy: I hear you've sold your guitars, and bought an orchestra. Idea-starved and angst-weary, notable indie rock figureheads have been turning to the time-honored 70s supergroup writer's block remedy; namely, when in doubt, just add strings. Following the lush-struck lead of Lambchop and The Flaming Lips, more than a few bands have sought to Soft Bulletinize their sound, from Tim DeLaughter's cult of Coyne, The Polyphonic Spree, to the no-longer-in-denial soft-rock renegades of Belle & Sebastian. As such, The Silent League's aim of getting all orchestrational with their indie-pop doesn't exactly read like the most groundbreaking thesis upon which to base a band in today's underground landscape. Like many other crowded-tour-bus acts, the more personnel-heavy tracks of The Orchestra, Sadly, Has Refused draw heavily upon the Spectorphonics of All Things Must Pass, right down to the George-esque slide guitar filling of ""Goliath"". Sprinkle in some Richard Wright ""Us and Them""-style piano balladeering (there's even consecutive songs called ""Time"" and ""Breathe"") and you have an album that fits in quite well with the sensibilities of Pitchfork's recent best of the 70s list-- but made thirty years and hundreds of similar-sounding albums too late. Unfortunately, the strings and horns rarely do much more than add a thin layer of dressing to the rather plain lettuce of the songs beneath. Silent League frontman Justin Russo is likable in songwriting and vocal regards, but the arrangements seem a far cry from a revolutionary new spin on the chamber-pop sound, and more like a lack of confidence manifesting itself in over-instrumentation. Accordingly, Russo-- who is occasionally joined here by Mercury Rev's Sean ""Grasshopper"" Mackowiack and Interpol's Sam Fogarino-- largely drops the orchestral concepts two songs in, and takes on a more stripped down piano-led band that is thoroughly and utterly uncontroversial. Songs like ""Breathe"" and ""Linus"" content themselves with no more garnish than the occasional vibes and guitar jangle, and succeed in a sort of mom-friendly Classics IV fashion. Still, all things told it's hard to conjure up much active dislike for an album like The Orchestra, Sadly, Has Refused, as it commits no crime other than complaisance. On one hand, it's distressing to hear a new act pass Go and immediately jump to the ""Conducted by Michael Kamen"" stage, with little innovation to add to the field. But on the other hand, as the temples of the indie world continue to grey, it only makes sense that a demand for neutered soft-rock grows stronger. After all, indie kids will someday grow to become dentists, too, and they certainly can't play Fugazi in their waiting rooms.","Guest spots from Interpol's Sam Fogarino and Mercury Rev's Grasshopper can't stop Silent League frontman Justin Russo from pouring on the cheese.

Lost with the Lights On,Simon Joyner,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba31ea9e61561daa7185/1:1/w_160/668c6ae2.jpg,2004-07-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4307-lost-with-the-lights-on/,Jagjaguwar,"Turning a book of poetry into effective music isn't as easy as it might seem, but Simon Joyner insists on doing it every time he cuts an album. Joyner puts down page upon page of stuff like, ""Up in the hot air balloon the priest of lime blessed the wind and gave it reason to cover everything that dies/ But you weren't surprised the mirror had advised you to look no further for a villain/ Still the Senator's thug is sucking your thumb/ Trying to turn a black hat into a white one."" When he's done, he hits the studio with friends like Michael Krassner, Fred Lonberg-Holm and Jim White, where suddenly he becomes the lost son of Leonard Cohen, spreading his words across a skeletal backing with his temperamental baritone. The Cohen comparison comes as much from the dour, literate tone of Joyner's work as it does from the sound of the music itself. Joyner's poems become sprawling, broken ballads, the individual songs almost incidental to the overall epic arc of the whole album. Whereas his last two albums of original compositions, 2001's Hotel Lives and 1999's The Lousy Dance, employed fairly broad instrumental palettes, Lost with the Lights On (his seventh, if you include his covers album) is immersed in gothic folk with occasional steel guitar flourishes. Piano and cello provide most of the album's color, and songs unfold at a pace a 90-year-old man would feel comfortable driving at, lingering for seven and eight minutes with no concessions to such widely employed songwriting conventions as choruses and bridges. In the three years since his last album, Joyner seems to have found more time for, if not outright optimism, then at least lightness. ""Flying Dreams"" is almost joyous, with a buoyant melody and nearly whimsical delivery-- though it's important to note that all of the happiness in the song occurs while he sleeps. And, of course, there's still disaster around the corner: ""Flying dreams can turn ugly, too/ The plane nosedives out of the blue/ And spirals out of control/ When everything was so still before."" The album's most startling song is easily its closer, ""Forgotten Blues"", whose backing sounds essentially like a parlor blues band melting, the instruments combining with Beefheartian random precision as White drops two and three snare hits at a time from his drum part to leave huge gaps of open space for the wandering electric guitars to fall into. As the busted blues staggers sideways and Joyner's poetry book slams shut, the album feels remarkably complete for something uses none of the bookending techniques that so often make records feel like tidy statements. Structurally, Lost with the Lights On is more like a modernist novel than an album, a glimpse into a point in someone's life somewhere between fulfillment and despair with no real beginning middle or end, and somehow it works.","Singer/songwriter's latest album for Jagjaguwar draws comparison, as usual, to Leonard Cohen, with vividly poetic lyrics set to morose, tuneful accompaniment.

Thank You,Various Artists,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8235e6ef9596932113a/1:1/w_160/304855c5.jpg,2004-07-05 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2049-thank-you/,Temporary Residence,"The gap between, say, Puddle of Mudd and the post-rock/electronic underground is hilariously huge. As backwards-ballcap macro-rock lathers more gesso onto radio, pointyheads like Four Tet's Kieran Hebden and Kammerflimmer Kollektief's Thomas Weber having been discovering zany new colors to paint with. The Brooklyn-by-way-of-Portland label Temporary Residence has spent eight years ignoring the grunge fallout while going to the mat for these kinds of experimenters. In a span of time that's seen thousands of manufactured jean-shorts purchased by those who like the way Wes Scantlin slaps their ass, Temporary Residence has faithfully brought the bliss and sticky sustenance. Now, for its 50th release, the label is celebrating those moments of its life with some exclusive and intuitive content from its raft of creative pals. This is stuff that takes its time getting to that land without borders, where fortresses of turbulence rise in EKG spike valleys. Alongside his bandmates in Fridge, Hebden spends nearly 10 minutes doting over ""Five Combs""' sprightly little four-note figure; snatches of a broadcast become an alternating rhythm to the normal tickle of glitchy push-button percussion; and music boxes harmonize with descending pianos. For Weber's incredible Kammerflimmer Kollektief (hooray for consonants!), hiss is the weapon. What sounds like the chatter of a thousand GoBot grasshoppers connects ""Eiderdaunen [Version]""'s subtle snare brushes to damaged jazz soloing and an excerpt from some abandoned love theme. These tracks find the organic intangible in their assemblages of mouse clicks and effects units. But their electronic signatures also heighten the effect of Howard Hello's ""The One"", whose gentle acoustic guitar and vintage keyboard buzz sound nearly exotic. This is what's so rewarding about the nebulous scene Temporary Residence documents: It can be both electronic and organic, wooden and plastic. Tube amps sit in practice rooms next to notebook computers; the warm yellow glow of a Guild Acoustics body reflects an LCD screen's chilly blue wallpaper. While pretty sedate throughout, Thank You does offer some roar with ""I Can't See Anything When I Close My Eyes"", a nervy live number from San Francisco's Rumah Sakit. There's also an extended bout of near-feedback soloing jammed into the center of Kilowatthours and JDV's otherwise tranquil (and awesomely named) ""Jignauseum"". Then, Parlour conjure the thick groove of 5ive Style with ""Landlaked"", before Explosions in the Sky return to Thank You's more formless and peaceful side for ""The Long Spring"". Sybarite follow suit, blurring the line between warm blood and circuitry perfectly, and turning their ""Killing the Moonshine"" into a snaky meander of melody and mainframe. Just now, while you weren't looking, another bar band covered Puddle of Mudd. And, depending on how many inflatable promotional items were in the room, the crowd probably loved it. But at the same time in another room, a tangle of wires just emitted a wavering tone, and three or four dudes riffed on it with jumbles of axes and software. Some people find home in chunkheaded modern rock generica, and that's fine. But for those with the time to explore, there's a Temporary Residence waiting in the goofy cosmos.","50th release from this well-regarded post-rock/experimental label offers exclusive material from its strongest artists.

Hot Fuss,The Killers,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3513d197565213b27f/1:1/w_160/192293f3.jpg,2004-07-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4579-hot-fuss/,Island,"The Killers' press release is surprisingly straightforward, explicitly detailing the punchcard proving ground that this Las Vegas quartet sprang from before phrases like ""bidding war"" and ""headlining tour"" entered their daily vocabulary. But it can afford this bit of honesty, since the British music press has shouldered the load of attendant Killers hyperbole, and because the band's Hot Fuss checks most of its truths at the door to their 800-foot limo. By autumn 2003, their single ""Mr. Brightside"" had secured the usual Best! Band! Ever! overstatements from UK scribes, and the song's happily vacant grafting of New Order decadence to Housemartins bop bounced it hard into CMJ and SXSW. Subsequently, the band's dance card attracted Warbucksian suitors of the largest variety. And now, the resulting Hot Fuss drops on both sides of the Atlantic wrapped in this tabloid backstory, unable to separate its hype from its unabashedly referential sound. Hot Fuss floats boatloads of blasé lyrics about the pressures of being fabulous and the politics of fucking over an easily sippable blend of 80s and 90s British pop influences, rarely pausing to test the end product. Top-shelf mixing and attention to melody helps out the record's appeal as lifestyle music for sheltered bloggers and female professionals who still wear cool hairstyles. But damnit if that demographic leaves little room for a life of The Killers' own. Where are they, besides their wily references to past pop pros and a vague sense of Sin City cynicism? Not anywhere, really: The Killers are just the latest band to be born too quick inside the popular music vacuum, where expectations for broad accessibility kill dudes' potential for deeper creativity quite fabulously dead. This is disappointing, since Fuss' better moments make The Killers' knack for hooks and cool poses clear. Vocalist/keyboardist Brandon Flowers has replaced his tonsils with melodrama; he's hijacked Jarvis Cocker's accent to make his Vegas-boy rep sound that much tighter. ""Brightside"" isn't getting near the dejection of The Stills; it has no illusions about being anything other than a provocative single. Its relentless keyboard 'n' guitar racket shuns dourness altogether, as Flowers remarkably makes lines about a girlfriend getting off with some other guy resonate as some kind of weird triumph. ""Somebody Told Me""'s deadpan couplets about having a ""boyfriend who looks like a girlfriend"" are similarly clever, but the cut's a brazen rewrite of The Strokes' treble-kick heroics. Yes, Casablancas, et al ripped off pieces of their sound, too, but that's the difference-- they already did the ripping. The Killers' recombination arrives too late to be recognized as first-tier thievery. At this point, Hot Fuss is just bringing it from what's already been brought. Hot Fuss opener ""Jenny Was a Friend of Mine"" establishes Flowers' admirable love for tones lost to rockers' rising fears of sounding too fruity. But as the album's singles follow in quick succession, rocking a sound softer than post-punk but full of the stuff that came right after it, The Killers can't figure a way to add resonance beyond adding more keyboards, more layered guitars, more cribbing of established tastemaking currency (check the intellectual-property-case-waiting-to-happen that is ""Change Your Mind""). In other words, Hot Fuss has no use for subtlety. It revels in its appearance as The Shit from day one, allowing for filler-type indulgences like the impossibly aimless-- and quite possibly shitty-- ""Everything Will Be Alright"". Meanwhile, Fuss' UK version excises the brazenly contemporary raggedness of ""Change Your Mind"" for the astoundingly inane ""Indie Rock 'n' Roll"", a blaring joke of thick-chorded guitar and arrogant, pitch-corrected yowling that gives out cornholes to every unknown American group valiantly trying to find the cracks of creativity in its titular sound. So, it's plain that The Killers have made a record more concerned with artifice than artistry. If the intent is to place their album's principal teases on the next Now That's What I Call Music compilation, then bravo. But why does it try to squeak by as another deft pop reversion when it actually seems to be a revisionist cash dance? For the kids, I presume. But Hot Fuss is not hardcore; it's hard evidence that it's tough to focus on making great rock when you're preoccupied with cultivating an image.","Despite hit songs on both sides of the Atlantic and Best! Band! Ever! endorsements from UK scribes, Las Vegas-based The Killers' questionably titled debut album is radio-friendly style-over-substance.

Love and Distance,The Helio Sequence,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0a0eb335119a49ed40e/1:1/w_160/30ab2066.jpg,2004-07-01 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3805-love-and-distance/,Sub Pop,"Let's talk about cheese, the figurative kind. Literal cheese does share at least one trait with its adjectival counterpart (i.e. ""cheesy""): it's polarizing. While many people love cheese, and some hate it, few are ambivalent. Go ahead; test my theory. Ask 50 strangers if they'd like a nice wedge of sharp cheddar. Some will say, ""Cheddar? Hell yes, please."" Others will say, ""No! I cannot stand cheese!"" Many will just walk away quickly and have to be counted as the control group in this flawed experiment, since what the hell are you doing offering cheese to strangers? However, I'd wager that not a single one would be like, ""Cheese? Whatever."" Biggie once asked: ""What's beef?"" (and unfortunately, he found out). I now ask: What's cheese? Cheese is difficult to pin down. Like postmodernism, grace, or pornography, we know cheese when we see it, and can list its qualities all day without attaining its complete essence. For one: Cheese is earnest, although not everything that's earnest is cheesy. For another: Cheese is ostentatious, the dubious life of the party. It does not slip in, fashionably late, through the side entrance. It storms in through the front door in a sequined tuxedo with lace cuffs, recites a ribald limerick and spikes the punch with peppermint schnapps. Cheese is grandiose, and not afraid to be maudlin-- there is no obfuscation with cheese, no artful hedging of bets: Cheese is heart-sleeved and money-mouthed, and it dares you to insult it for being what it proudly proclaims itself to be. Why is cheese important? Well, it isn't. Cheese, by its very nature, is frivolous. But it is important within the context of this review, because your relative lactose tolerance is going to drastically influence your response to this record. See that rating up there? Numerical ratings are troublesome. Numbers are stately and immutable; in their absolute precision, they limn what is, for all intents and purposes, a personal judgment (one heavily influenced, in this case, by my own relationship with cheese, which is not what one would call ""close"") as an objective, universal one. So, what you'll need to do is consider your own personal affinity for cheese, which can be measured by any number of factors: How well do you like Liberace? Notoriously bad sitcoms? Black velvet paintings, preferably of Elvis, bullfighters, or Elvis fighting a bull? Do you enjoy ""theme restaurants,"" especially if the theme is indeterminate and mainly involves a glut of random pop cultural detritus hanging from the walls? Next, rate your affinity for cheese on a scale ranging from -5 to +5. Here, -5 will signify that you have a deep-seated anathema for cheese, and +5 will indicate a deep-seated appreciation. Once you have your personal cheese affinity rating nailed down, add or subtract it to the rating above in order to determine the rating for The Helio Sequence's Love and Distance that best suits you. Now that we've articulated a sort of sliding-scale, individually specific model of cheese appreciation, I can go on record as saying, without it being taken as a putatively objective value judgment: The Helio Sequence's Love and Distance is fucking cheesy. And now that we've pretty thoroughly unpacked the mysterious qualities of cheese and devised a foil to offset its destabilizing properties (as in, my personal disdain for cheese would have pulled the rating unconscionably low otherwise), we can discuss the quality of the music outside of its cheesiness, which is actually not bad. The Helio Sequence is a duo comprised of singer/guitarist Brandon Summers and keyboardist/drummer Benjamin Weikel, who drummed for Modest Mouse during Jeremiah Green's leave of absence. (What, did you think we were reviewing this because I was dying to talk about cheese?). And so you're wondering: How does it stack up to Modest Mouse? Well, you know how there was Death Cab for Cutie, and then there was this side project called The Postal Service, and heads were like, ""Whoa, this side project is better than the main draw""? Well, this is nothing like that. The two bands do, however, share some common traits: The Helio Sequence blend bright electronica, pop melodies, and various stylized sound effects. But vocally, I take issue with their tendency to veer towards the recent work of-- and I really hate to say this, but-- Dave Matthews. And yet, there are some killer melodies peeking out from beneath this band's Velveeta blanket: The songs are sharply constructed, featuring layer upon layer of electronic and live percussion, synth patches, guitars, and sundry other bells and whistles that somehow keep away from the overly dense side of things and manage to blast out in tight pop songs. However, their reliance on harmonica on the opening ""Harmonica Song"" is a troubling sign of things to come, and lends the music a quality not unlike that of the mid-90s road anthem ""Life Is a Highway"". Which is bad to me, but may be good to you. The duo's 2000 debut, Com Plex, and its follow-up Young Effectuals exhibited none of these traits-- rather, The Helio Sequence simply attempted some harmless Beatle mimicry in a show of future potential. Unfortunately, Love and Distance showcases a band that has clearly fully realized its sound, but in doing so have abandoned many of the attributes that once held so much promise. The result is certainly ambitious-- one could never say that lots of care and detail work wasn't put into this record; it's just a shame that their affectations and identity-forming flourishes have led them to a sound that discards their once-unmistakable My Bloody Valentine influence for that of HORDE tour second-stagers. Then again, you might like Blues Traveller.","The Sub Pop debut from this long-running Pacific Northwest duo featuring Modest Mouse drummer Benjamin Weikel buries a bunch of great hooks and even better production beneath gritty, jam-band vocals and a serious penchant for cheese.

Despite high-profile admirers like Elvis Costello and six highly praised albums on three labels, Sexsmith's career has maintained a steady trajectory, neither sinking toward Johnston's obscurity nor rising to Mann's cult status. Retriever is his sixth album in a not quite a decade, and as with each of its predecessors, it's shot through with a shaky optimism to match Sexsmith's boyish looks, light lyrical touch, and charmingly warbly voice. The title suggests someone dumbly loyal, either blessed or afflicted with a canine devotion to a lover, to friends, or to certain romantic ideas about life. In keeping with recent albums like Cobblestone Runway and Blue Boy, producer Martin Terefe sets Sexsmith's voice against a lively full-band sound and bolsters it with dream-weaver string flourishes on ""Whatever It Takes"" and ""Not About to Lose"". Generally, the music recalls Jon Brion's work with Mann and Fiona Apple, but is never so garishly ostentatious. As usual, Retriever also features Sexsmith's studiously plainspoken lyrics, which work hard to reveal a great deal without being stylistically idiosyncratic; he truly wants everyone to sing along to these songs about ""happiness"" and ""sadness."" ""Hard Bargain"" is a surprisingly well-adjusted love song: ""How's a guy supposed to fail/ With someone like you around?"" If he didn't sound so convincingly smitten, you might think this was a parody of those dark ballads so full of self-loathing and self-absorption. And when he sings lines like, ""I've seen tomorrow in her eyes,"" or, ""Dreams come true in heaven all the time,"" not only is he keeping a straight, wholly unironic face, but he's almost self-consciously risking cornball sentiment. He barely skirts this pitfall, but his willingness to tread that line creates an awkward vulnerability that only makes him more endearing. On the other hand, can someone be too earnest? The same indefatigable hopefulness that sets Sexsmith apart also makes Retriever a bit tiresome. He instills every song with such gentle, unaffected feeling that Retriever becomes monochromatic, lacking emotional variety. A smirk or even a knowing one-liner would have shaded that directness with some welcome humor. The overearnestness takes the bite out of more topical songs like ""From Now On"" and ""Wishing Wells"", where his uncomplicated lyrics become a liability. Propelled by Ed Harcourt's piano, ""From Now On"" could even make a rousing theme song for John Kerry's campaign-- especially if the musician-turned-candidate performed it himself. The lyrics, however, are too obvious and hammer-blunt: ""We live in times/ Where choice is frowned upon/ Afraid to even raise/ Our voice in song."" But that same song contains another few lines-- ""They're in the business of panic and control/ We're in the business of the heart and the soul""--that bristle with heart-on-sleeve righteousness. Sexsmith is always a little more complicated than he appears, and his quiet perseverance-- through each song as well as over the course of his career-- carries its own intricate poetry that belies the understatement of his persona.","Latest outing from this below-the-radar singer/songwriter trumpeted by critics and musicians is shot through with a shaky optimism, light lyrical touch, and charmingly warbly voice.

A Guess at the Riddle,David Grubbs,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfb6c0084474cd0c309f/1:1/w_160/fb522ae1.jpg,2004-07-01 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3584-a-guess-at-the-riddle/,Drag City,"For a year or so, a friend of mine lived next to David Grubbs. Because he shared a wall with the avant folkie, he never dared listen to anything by one of his favorite bands, Gastr del Sol-- not even Crookt, Crackt or Fly. I thought his neurosis was fairly amusing, especially because I couldn't imagine those nimble Grubbs/O'Rourke outtakes passing through the ancient Brooklyn plaster. (No, not even the loud parts.) And though said friend has long since relocated to a different, shadier part of the borough, if he had remained opposite the man behind A Guess at the Riddle, I'd tell him to buck up and blast Grubbs' fourth solo album as loudly as he wanted to, since even when Grubbs opts to amp things here, the results seem so spidery and fragile. For the past decade plus, Grubbs has donned a number of hats. There were his raucous Louisville days with the mathy Bastro and the distorted power-pop of Squirrel Bait. Later, he moved to Chicago where he would cut the aforementioned Gastr LPs with O'Rourke, as well as a couple of classy solo records and Pythagorean punk-slaps with Tony Conrad, Pauline Oliveros, and Arnold Dreyblatt, among others. And finally, upon arriving in New York, he presented a split-down-the-middle 12-inch with Animal Collective wood sprite Avey Tare and a disc with outer-realms guitarist Loren Connors. On A Guess at the Riddle, Grubbs eases further into the deep-end of his pristine poppiness-- which is not to say that our master of ceremonies has left behind off-color time signatures, spacy repetitions, or heady lyrical introversion. Even with his tempered outbursts restrained, and despite the lyrical hail storms, this is Grubbs' most straightforward and upbeat album. The album's countless references to precipitation may hide the answer to its title's riddle. Perhaps it's something to do with the weather (inside and outside), and the loneliness or beauty that can spring from sporadic rain showers and shifts in clouds? Or not. But even if Grubbs is just being rhetorical, a close reading of the lyric sheet reveals that during ""A Cold Apple"", Hilda consumes icy fruit on ""an equally cold/ On an equally bright/ Absolutely sunshot/ To-be-savored Sunday morning."" Likewise, there's a ""forecast for cloudy skies"" on the ebullient Eggs-veined opener, ""Knight Errant"". In the Rick Moody-penned ""Wave Generators"", the Ice Storm author mentions a delay of game due to the poetry of ""icicle fringe"" and frozen creeks. Elsewhere, there are eclipses and barometric swoons. ""Hurricane Season"" (another by Moody) features a ""hurricane town, bleached white/ Under black convectionary clouds."" Musically, this lengthy Sufjan Stevens cacophony spins out electronically, spreading wings and becoming its namesake with the help of guesting electronic duo Matmos. Even the Mayo Thompson cover ""Magnificence as Such"" gets in on the rain dance with ""foghorns on foggy days"" as the backdrop for a walk in the countryside wherein the protagonist is struck by the beauty of light reflected off soot. But you don't need words to feel the wind! And so even the majority of the instrumentals partake in the cloudgazing: ""Rosie Ruiz"" finds Grubbs on electric guitar and computer, making Moody's icicles of sound. The fittingly titled final track, ""Coda (Breathing)"", proffers deep listening with its swirling harmonium and Steve Roden's minimalist processing. As on all of his projects, when Grubbs looks for outside help, he assembles a free-range bumper-crop: Adam Pierce of Mice Parade plays drums, as does Calexico collaborator Thomas Belhom. Bar/None vocalist Hannah Marcus doubles in the background, and a bevy of European improv folks like cellist Nikos Veliotis add atmosphere. Finally, Norwegian electronic musician and visual artist Kim Hiorthoy places cumulous formations and blackened raindrops (and arcs and swoons) on the cover sleeve. So now that I've established the forecast, do the songs work? Yes and no. A number of the earlier tracks-- especially the first quartet-- are spot-on and engaging, but roughly halfway through the record, Grubbs squanders this momentum for arty ponderousness. The off-Broadway piano ditty ""Your Neck in the Woods"" snores, and the decidedly tame Matmos collaboration ""You'll Never Tame Me"" is nothing but a noodle fest. Additionally, Grubbs is sometimes so precise in his articulation that the work lacks a properly ragged soul. So, no, A Guess at the Riddle doesn't quite amaze. Nitpicking though I may be, Grubbs' follow-up to Rickets & Scurvy displays a vibrant palette that, despite some duds, offers several slices of inventive and exploratory pop. Just don't forget your umbrella.","Ex-Gastr del Sol member eases further into the deep-end of his pristine poppiness, again working with The Ice Storm author Rick Moody, as well as Matmos, Mice Parade's Adam Pierce, Calexico collaborator Thomas Belhom, Bar/None vocalist Hannah Marcus, and others.

The world of lo-fi pop is already rife with contrived boyishness and adolescent sophistry, but with Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip on an Edgeless Platform, Matheny has lowered the bar to a near-unlimboable level. Emperor X, the ominous-sounding alias behind the Gainesville, FL singer/songwriter's giddy pop alchemy, is merely a feeble façade. The real Matheny is a devout homebody, and his story runs like so: Born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1979, Matheny was tinkering with an SK-1 sampling keyboard, given to him by his grandparents, at age nine, and with a little help from his pawn-shop-patronizing dad, he recorded his first album on a Tascam four-track before turning 20. In fact, throughout his congenital musical career, Matheny's family has played an integral role, and it shows: Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip on an Edgeless Platform is one of the most winsome and charmingly diminutive lo-fi records of the moment, weaving a sturdy matrix of reliable pop nuggets. While Tectonic Membrane embodies and relishes the four-track aesthetic, Matheny's compositions are deceptively complex. Listen carefully and you'll hear intricate overdubbing and a bevy of digital affectations, ranging from retro synths to more up-to-date pedals and tinker toys. The 8\xBD-minute ""Intracellular"" is flooded in amorphous guitar peals and keyboard swells, and would feel right at home amongst the work of similarly lo-fi process artists or latter-day Black Dice. In spite of his sly technological sophistication, however, Matheny maintains an air of trembling innocence throughout the record, which dabbles in divergent styles and moods. Surprisingly, these songs' oft tenuous resolutions and child-like lack of focus are seldom as irksome as they seem on paper, and generally enhance Emperor X's ingratiating aesthetic. Appropriately, opener ""Exterminata Beat"" is the most immediately engaging track. Propelled by a motorik pop beat, Matheny turns in a demure vocal performance and an irrepressible distorted Rhodes harmony, before the mix abruptly cuts off and an audibly conducted choral segue fades in. It's a discomfiting juxtaposition at first, but as Emperor X's ambitions become clearer, the move seems more and more appropriate. ""Laminate Factory"", which features a serpentine vocal melody over jagged acoustic strumming, clarifies things somewhat, but it's not until ""Bashling"" that Tectonic Membrane solidifies its standing as a handsomely potluck gem. Indebted to an array of shoegazer outfits-- particularly Yo La Tengo in its rising, tremolo-laden guitars-- the song adds some gravity to this occasionally flighty collection. Matheny is an unabashedly wanting singer, and while some may see that as part of his appeal, it occasionally edges on bothersome. ""Filene's Basement"" is most off-putting in its cryptic narrative and clunky delivery, but fortunately, the song skirts by in under two minutes, and its effect on the flow of the album is negligible at worst. Elsewhere, ""Unworthiness Drones"" is a directionless rhythmic experiment that does hamper the momentum slightly, especially when it arbitrarily tails off after a bout of spasmodic stuttering. Luckily, such miscues keep a relatively low profile, and the preponderance of enduring melodies is a formidable saving grace. Most will agree that the last thing underground music needs is more Phil Elvrum wanna-bes and lo-fi dilettantes, which is why Chad Matheny's efforts are so impressive. Constantly battling the odds and winning, Tectonic Membrane is an easy album to champion, and a refreshing show for a floundering genre.","Gainesville-based singer/songwriter offers melodies that are deceptively complex for his low-budget, four-track production.

The Blue Notebooks,Max Richter,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ff9d034d5c69bf2d0e/1:1/w_160/875d3ada.jpg,2004-07-01 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6917-the-blue-notebooks/,Fat Cat,"Conceptually, Max Richter's The Blue Notebooks-- German-born composer mixes contemporary classical compositions with electronic elements in a dreamscapy journalogue featuring excerpts from Kafka's The Blue Octavo Notebooks as narrated by Tilda Swinton-- reads like a relentlessly precious endeavor, as new age music for grad students, the sort of record that sagely pats you on the back for being smart enough to seek it out. And yet in practice, despite the fact that it is exactly as outlined above, Kafka quotes and all, there is absolutely nothing exclusive or contrived-feeling about it. In fact, not only is Richter's second album one of the finest of the last six months, it is also one of the most affecting and universal contemporary classical records in recent memory. But how to describe music that relies so completely on seeming familiar? Richter may fancy himself in a class with Philip Glass, Brian Eno and Steve Reich (indeed, his hyperattenuated sense of minimalism owes to all three), but unlike his influences, he's not remotely interested in subverting the traditional rules of composition. Short of one very beautiful moment that plunges an electronic sublow bassline into a deep sea of harpsichords and violas (see: the literally perfect ""Shadow Journal""), there is nothing here to suggest that Richter is concerned with anything other than melody and economy. It's a formula he singlemindedly exploits with staggering effectiveness for the balance of the album's 40+ minutes. Constituted mainly of sparse pieces that lean on string quartets and pianos in equal measure, The Blue Notebooks is a case study in direct, minor-key melody. Each of the piano pieces ""Horizon Variations"", ""Vladimir's Blues"" and ""Written in the Sky"" establish strong melodic motifs in under two minutes, all the while resisting additional orchestration. Elsewhere, Richter's string suites are similarly striking; ""On the Nature of Daylight"" coaxes a stunning rise out of gently provincial arrangements while the comparatively epic penultimate track ""The Trees"" boasts an extended introductory sequence for what is probably the album's closest brush with grandiosity. Richter's slightly less traditional pieces also resound; both the underwater choral hymnal ""Iconography"" and the stately organ piece ""Organum"" echo the spiritual ambience that characterized his work for Future Sound of London. If, however, there is one piece that fires The Blue Notebooks off into the stratosphere, it's the aforementioned ""Shadow Journal"". Featuring a lone viola, some burbling electronics, a harpsichord and a subterranean bassline, it establishes a simple, keening melody and then gently pulls it wide, like warm string taffy, across its eight minutes. The fourth track on the record, it is nonetheless its centerpiece, and on a larger scale, possibly a gigantic beacon for composers searching for useful ways to introduce dance music's visceral, body-jarring qualities into the classical sphere. But make no mistake, this is not Richter's electronic/classical crossover, nor it is really his concept record. In fact, with songs that similarly forgo the temptations of complexity and choice so as to preserve their core ideas, it's perhaps better thought of as his four-track demo, his lo-fi recording jaunt. It's Max Richter testing himself to see what he can produce under restraint. Turns out it's more than he might have otherwise.",,8.7,
Fulfilled/Complete,Broken Spindles,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b29d034d5c69bf2eb0/1:1/w_160/6a206469.gif,2004-06-30 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11685-fulfilledcomplete/,Saddle Creek,"A comparative glance at the cover art for Faint bassist Joel Petersen's self-titled Broken Spindles debut and his new follow-up, Fulfilled/Complete, suggests two thematically linked works, a sequence telling a developing story. This is entirely apt, as Fulfilled/Complete feels incredibly like a sequel to its predecessor, and true to the conventions of a sequel, this one makes the core character of its antecedent bigger, flashier and more extravagant. The first Broken Spindles album grew out of would-be soundtrack work that Petersen was doing for a friend, but developed into a full-blown side project when that friend didn't use the music he'd made, and Omaha superproducer Mike Mogis joined him in the studio to help flesh out the material to album length. What followed was a casually constructed instrumental record that flirted with industrial textures, much like The Faint themselves, and also branched into more atmospheric piano and vibraphone explorations. On Fulfilled/Complete, Petersen adds vocals and a string quartet to that basic formula, and comes out with an album that splits its time rather awkwardly between buzzing, Faint-ish new-wave darkness and drifting navel contemplation for the 4AD set. Petersen's vocals here generally operate in a staid robowhisper, and he leaves the real melodic heavy lifting to the piano and strings. The most startling success among the vocal tracks is the first of them, ""Fall In and Down On"", a skittering beast of a song with vocals that glide by almost unnoticed amidst the cloud of frantically arranged pizzicato strings and bass buzz that surround them, slapping the chintzy, jungly drum programming around like a spoiled child. This song and much of the rest of the album are infected with a gothic flair for ornate decoration and dark sentiment. Piano/string interludes like ""Practice, Practice, Preach"" and ""To Die, For Death"", have a chilly, distant sadness to them that, while often compelling, makes them feel misplaced next to driving, heavily programmed songs like ""Move Away"" and ""Italian Wardrobe"" (think This Mortal Coil meets Public Image Ltd). ""Events and Affairs"" is even more jarringly removed from the elegance that those instrumentals impart to the album, its cracked skin guitar and live drums forming a chassis that's about as quintessentially post-punk as you can get: Petersen's lyrics have him subscribing to the newspaper and buying a television to become more informed, and ultimately feeling let down by the narrow, misguided coverage they provide. As media indictments go, it's not exactly brimming with subtlety. Then again, I'm not sure subtlety is even in the vocabulary of The Faint, so maybe nuance is beside the point. Either way, Fulfilled/Complete succeeds on a number of levels-- Mogis' recording is clear as a bell, there are several fine songs, and the string arrangements are impressively detailed-- but doesn't quite live up to either portion of its title, its sequencing too disjointed to make for a truly cohesive statement. Still, at its best, the album is a pleasantly icy listen and a clearly above-average sequel.","Second solo outing from Faint bassist Joel Petersen offers a pleasantly icy listen, but doesn't quite live up to either portion of its title.

The Blue Album,Orbital,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9fb9d034d5c69bf5354/1:1/w_160/cbff8fcc.gif,2004-06-30 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6033-the-blue-album/,HTI,"Orbital's career is ending, fittingly, on the festival circuit. The duo have announced that they'll be taking their final bow at this summer's T in the Park, after headlining the Other Stage at last week's Glastonbury, the site of the stunning 1994 and 1995 performances that secured the band's legend and destroyed the myth that dance acts can't connect with audiences without the home-field advantage of a club. Orbital, of course, were no slouches in the studio either, producing some of the greatest electronic albums of their time and an immaculate string of singles that effortlessly segue from early acid and rave through the headier ambient techno of their mid-90s. Orbital's swansong, The Blue Album-- their seventh-- is billed, worryingly, as a culmination of their 15-year run-- which, at least conceptually, implies a grab bag of token nods to better-realized ideas, or an unnecessary Cliff's Notes version of their career. Thankfully, it's instead a fitting footnote, one that leaves a much better final taste in our mouths than the mostly disastrous The Altogether-- a record so misguided that it seems to have cloaked its underrated predecessor, Middle of Nowhere, in an ill-deserved shadow of post-In Sides disappointment. The Blue Album being a stroll through the past, innovation is not something one should expect from the record. In a way, the album simply highlights many of the reasons why Orbital have been so beloved for the past decade-and-a-half. However, one wouldn't come to that conclusion from the album opener, ""Transient"". Almost beatless, this kaleidoscopic web of harpsichord, strings and bass, unfurls an almost foreboding yet captivating sound, recalling Philip Glass circa Koyaanisqatsi. From there, Orbital deliver on their promise, taking us on a Russian Ark-like stroll through their career, echoing elements from In Sides (the serene ""Pants""), Snivilisation (""Bath Time"") and The Middle of Nowhere (the remarkable urban clang of ""Tunnel Vision""). Of course, as on The Altogether, Orbital's stabs at humor here produce more cringes than smiles, as neither ""Bath Time""'s blend of children's TV theme music and Jean-Jacques Perrey nor ""Easy Serv""'s ice cream van xylophone-- add much to the record. Perhaps it would have nice to exorcise the tracks in favor of the sadly discarded ""Initiation"" and ""What Happens Next"", but a sense of humor has thankfully always been one element of Orbital's career and, if nothing else, this album is true to their legacy. More than anything else, however, The Blue Album is reminiscent of Orbital's first two self-titled records, more commonly known as the Green and Brown albums. Sparks collaboration ""Acid Pants"" is an old-school, almost tribal banger, while the foreboding, abstract ""Lost"" sounds like an early effort from the Warp camp. Best of all is album centerpiece ""You Lot"", the one track that could be segued into Orbital's first record without the bat of a single eyelash. More track-y than most of their recent efforts-- but with a soft ambient core, over which is layered a sample of Christopher Ecclestone babbling on about the shrinking distance between the power of man and God-- ""You Lot"" is the record's best confluence of what made Orbital so special. The Blue Album closes with ""One Perfect Sunrise"", the sort of post-rave/pre-dawn euphoria that Orbital perfected on ""Halcyon"". And although the track borders on the nostalgic with the same potentially pointless intensity as a Jet track and the same emotional manipulation as a trance version of an 80s hit, here context can melt even the most time-hardened heart. As the sunset to Orbital's glorious career, it's fitting that the track encapsulates the dawn, the time of day that has so often ended the most glorious moments of Orbital's career.","Revered electronic duo Orbital call it quits with their seventh and final album, a nostalgic throwback that's being touted as a culmination of their 15-year run.

Pretty Little Lightning Paw EP,Thee Silver Mountain Reveries,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40b5e6ef959693207a3/1:1/w_160/937948be.gif,2004-06-30 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7167-pretty-little-lightning-paw-ep-as-thee-silver-mountain-reveries/,Constellation,"Thee Silver Mountain Reveries (formerly The Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band with Choir, and before that, simply A Silver Mt. Zion) is, if you want to get down to brass tacks, a different permutation of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the central hub from which the spokes of the Canadian post-rock scene seem to radiate. One of the most common accusations leveled at Godspeed is that their music is ""just one long crescendo,"" and it's a complaint I've never understood. For one, ""crescendo,"" when understood to mean ""a peak,"" describes the moment when the music is at its most powerful, emphatic and cathartic: the aural equivalent of an orgasm. If this is the case, then hey, an hour-long orgasm doesn't sound like anything to gripe about to me (in theory, I should add). But moreover, while ""crescendo"" often describes ""a peak"" in modern usage, that isn't what it means. ""Crescendo"" connotes not just the climax, but the climax and the entire slow-burning build toward it. It's not just the money shot, but all the foreplay and thrusting that preceded it. Calling a climax a crescendo is like calling a birth a pregnancy, and slow, dramatic intensification is pretty much Godspeed's modus operandi-- to deride them for it is to admit that they fulfill the terms of their artistic engagement, and is about as redundant as inveighing against a fantasy/adventure film for the implausibility of its plot. Whatever the word means to you, crescendo-haters who like Godspeed's overall style but can't get down with the bombast might look more favorably on Thee Silver Mountain Reveries' Pretty Little Lightning Paw EP. The disc benefits from many of Godspeed's concrete tactics (diverse instrumentation, nested political polemics, long compositions with several distinct ""movements""), as well as their more abstract ones (a certain incandescence, a tension between beauty and dread, a sense of light falling like rain). And there's nary a blatant crescendo-- be it build or climax-- to be found. Pretty Little Lightning Paw also profits from canning the aggressively off-key Choir who belted out discordant shapenote harmonies all over their previous LP, This is Our Punk-Rock, Thee Rusted Satellites Gather + Sing. Of course, the jarring nature of the choir was intentional, and no doubt absolutely salient in terms of the album's overall political and aesthetic program. But it also frustratingly obscured what was otherwise entirely lovely music, and soon enough emoted the record right out of my collection.' Rather, Pretty Little Lightning Paw wafts through its four movements with equanimity and grace. I've always felt ""post-rock"" to be a misnomer when applied to Godspeed, who seem more ""post-classical"" or ""pre-something-heretofore-undreamt-of"" than anything else, and The Silver Mountain Whatevers have generally followed suit. But the first track on Pretty Little Lightning Paw, ""More Action! Less Tears!"", is exactly what post-rock would be in a perfect world where words meant what they actually mean. It opens with a shout (""Hello? There will be a meeting of the action committee in five minutes!""), followed by flag-waving rock guitars and a production value straight off of GBV's Bee Thousand, which lends the record a startling initial momentum uncommon to the genre. In other words, it sounds like something it would take Godspeed half an hour to build up to. Like the remainder of the EP, ""Microphones in the Trees"" features Efrim Menuck's quavering, paranoid singing about ""cameras in the sky"" and such; on this track his voice is modulated with an echo effect within a glacial piano/bass/guitar figure that repeatedly accumulates and sheds feedback and choral harmonies (small doses, small doses) in a 10-minute quest for cacophony. The title track sounds like a slowed-down, vintage RZA beat, all fractured minor-key shapes and syncopated drums. It sounds how a reflected neon glow on freshly fallen snow looks, and should excite those who pine for the days before Black Heart Procession went bossanova. And finally, ""There's a River in the Valley Made of Melting Snow"" closes the EP with Menuck's most confident singing yet, stretched out over buzzing, staticky sheets of guitar. I don't know what Thee Silver Mountain Reveries have in store for their next recording, but I think they're on the right track with this one. Less is more, and if ""a crescendo"" must mean ""a peak,"" that still doesn't mean it has to be overly dense or noisy-- if you were to drop a straight pin for an hour, then dropping a ten-penny nail might be all the release you need.",,7.6,
The Printz,Bumblebeez 81,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45a9d034d5c69bf304d/1:1/w_160/9f79b083.gif,2004-06-30 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1115-the-printz/,Geffen,"Every year there's at least one: a new band or artist employing a slacker-style penchant for stream-of-conscious lyrics and kitchen-sink production aesthetics who the press hastily and irresponsibly christens ""The New Beck."" From Self to Forest for the Trees to Primitive Radio Gods, these artists rarely succeed on their own merits, patently distilling Beck's multifaceted styles into a calculated formula or half-bred hodgepodge pastiche. Still, they come a dime-a-dozen, parading through rock's history books as footnotes at best on the strength of one radio-friendly sing-along (or less). All of which is fittingly ironic for a man who himself is often referred to as ""The New Dylan."" Oh, it's not all Mr. Hansen's fault, of course. Cheap digital gear and bootleg copies of Garage Band shoulder part of the blame. But corner that pesky Scientologist in an airport and he'll tell you straight out: It's a bitch keeping up with the kids, man, the muthafuckin' kids. And that's where outfits like Boomkat, Samantha Ronson, and Bumblebeez 81 come in. The first was a weirdly addictive combo that tried on tired trip-hop, teen-pop, and energetic yammering; the second will be Rocafella's summer '04 entry into faux-rock hipsterism (Miss Sam's first single sounds like Natalie Imbruglia covering stuff from Pink's M!ssundaztood); and the third is the Australia-via-NYC snip-pop project of one Chris Colonna and his merry coed crew. Their debut, The Printz, compiles pieces of two earlier EPs for a record that's going to make poor Beck puke. It's not like Colonna, his sister Vila, and their assorted collaborators (both human and machine) are better than Beck, or The Neptunes, or The Avalanches, or any other artist their record attempts to replicate; their trash/fash rehash resonates more than The Moldy Peaches' in-jokes only because The Printz is consistently hooky. But as MTV2's Subterranean knows, it's the aesthetic that matters, and to that end, Bumblebeez 81 are where it's at for at least the next few minutes. Frankly, it could be much worse. Vila takes the mic for ""Microphone Diseases"": ""I flow like water in a stream/ I got the mad fuckin' scheme/ All up in my regime."" Okay, it's not exactly Def Poetry Jam, but when she starts blabbering about putting placentas in blenders over a sample of a tennis volley, smart brains start thinking ""guilty pleasure."" And the ESG update on the back end ain't bad, either. Vila offers a much stronger mic presence than her brother, who tends toward mumbling as an affectation, and she wisely returns for ""Pink Fairy Floss"". The song sounds more like Cibo Matto than anything; its hard squelch riff, Latin percussion loop, and elephant and Tone-Loc drop-ins are the stuff memorable make-out parties are made of. She's at her best on the appropriately named ""Vila Attack"". Bragging about her stale rhyming skills is both bold and daring, but the track's overdriven background layers harken wildly to those early 90s days when Mellow Gold was still fresh and Timmy Taylor hadn't yet been struck down in his prime. So, contrary to what most press has already said, The Printz isn't hip-hop, nor does it have anything in common with the wiry post-punk it references on ""Step Back"" and ""Pony Ride"". Still, Colonna's sneer is appropriate, and the nearly tuneless guitar throughout is sort of charming. The album doesn't posit Bumblebeez 81 anywhere near staying-power square, though, because ultimately it's too reliant on recombination. Beck might stay on top because he looks dope in Prada, but he's also intent on building a cohesive product from his myriad mental fragments. The Printz is more of a pose. It has its share of memorable moments, but they'll undoubtedly sound better if you're a) the coolest kid in your high school, or b) Milla Jovovich. The record will also work wonders for Bumblebeez 81 and their burgeoning rep, but they gotta understand-- real recombinant music helps the heartland get some, too.","It seems like ages since MTV last attempted to break a certifiably weird indie-minded rock group, but with this album's first single in heavy rotation, these heretofore unknown Australian Beck-alikes are suddenly garnering airtime on modern rock stations nationwide.

Rocky Dennis EP / Maple Leaves EP,Jens Lekman,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcfc0084474cd0c2da2/1:1/w_160/dfd864f0.jpg,2004-06-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11774-rocky-dennis-epmaple-leaves-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"Critics and fans alike tend to treat EPs like promises, equating full artistic realization only with full-length albums. There are lists of the best singles and albums, but no one's counting down the top ten extended players of the 90s. To an extent, it's because EPs have grown out of traditional vinyl singles and mutated into something less like a single-and-b-side and more like an album in miniature. But where is it written that LPs are the most legitimate form of artistic expression? Jens Lekman, who hails from Sweden, has already released two EPs this year: Rocky Dennis and Maple Leaves. Combine both and you've got a short, choppy album, so it's better to leave them separate as two well-realized half-albums of delicate chamber-pop songs full of waltzing strings, 60s-style flutes, and sundry psychedelias. Lekman sums up his musical approach best: ""I know every song, you name it/ By Bacharach or David/ Every stupid love song that's ever touched your heart/ Every power ballad that's ever climbed the charts."" Of the two, Rocky Dennis is by far the more ambitious EP, and the least successful. Its namesake was the real-life inspiration for the 1985 movie Mask, long forgotten by all but Lekman and a few Bogdanovich completists. Roy L. ""Rocky"" Dennis suffered from craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, which swelled his face to twice its normal size; he died in 1980 at age 16. Lekman sees the perpetual teenager as emblematic of his own skewed emotions and his dreamy quest for depth and meaning in life. On ""Jens Lekman's Farewell Song to Rocky Dennis"", he sings, ""I wish I had a proper reason to cry/ A reason not so abstract/ More like a broken clause in a contract."" While his overidentification with Dennis reflects an intense post-adolescent romanticism, it also seems a little exploitive, as if Dennis were John Merrick to Lekman's Michael Jackson. If Rocky Dennis feels a little truncated, it's because the concept determines the EP's shape. It's too thin to merit a full album, but four tracks just can't develop these ideas enough, especially when one of those tracks is only a minute's worth of orchestrated strings, with no vocals and no discernible theme. It's telling that the EP's best track, ""If You Ever Need a Stranger"", is the only one not specifically about Dennis. Much less troubling and much more rewarding is Maple Leaves, which lacks its mate's overarching concept but still sounds more fully formed and unified. The title track explodes in a symphony of keyboards, flutes, and curiously danceable drums, as Lekman sings about mishearing his lover's doubtful words: ""She said we were only make believe/ But I thought she said maple leaves."" ""Sky Phenomenon"" and the cover of the Television Personalities' ""Someone to Share My Life With"" float along on his nimble piano and gentle baritone, which occasionally recalls Yo La Tengo's Ira Kaplan. The EP's best moment comes with ""Black Cab"", a killjoy's lament about ruining a party, but not wanting to go home. A monologue delivered from the rear seat of a taxi and accompanied by harpsichord and mandolin, it perfectly communicates the unshakable dread of wanting to be anywhere but where you are and anyone but who you are. Lekman's youthful anomie is intense enough not only to excuse some of his missteps as merely oversincere, but also to redeem them as steeping-stones toward a larger goal. You could call him pretentious, but his pretensions are so rawly naïve, his musical influences so particular, that these songs sound genuinely unique and wholly personal. His vision, coupled with his youth (very early twenties), places him in an early-2004 minitrend of young artists like Patrick Wolf and Nellie McKay, both of whom have released staggeringly ambitious debuts exhibiting an incredibly strong grasp of style and genre. Lekman's vision is never as ostentatious as Wolf's nor as charmingly psychotic as McKay's, but he seems to have mastered the subtle and never-so-simple trick of balancing joy and misery, such that neither overwhelms the other. That he does it in such a short time-- both EPs add up to only about 25 minutes-- makes each song all the more bittersweet.","As precursors to his forthcoming debut LP, Secretly Canadian issues two EPs from this Swedish singer/songwriter who bears a strange obsession with the real-life inspiration for the 1985 movie Mask.

Howling...

It Grows and Grows!!! is deceptively alluring: Like Keith Moon's bass drum arbitrarily erupting on live national television, or Ozzy Osbourne yanking down his pants and whizzing little yellow rivers all over the Alamo, there's something vaguely impudent about The Catheters' fuzzed-out guitars, tin can production, yelpy vocals, and jolting rhythms-- and all that blind, sloppy audacity can occasionally create something stupidly appealing. Particularly at first listen. Opener ""No Natural Law"" is a hopelessly twitchy introduction, unraveling at every turn, all youthful indiscretion and awkwardly squawked proclamations, tangling The Catheters up in their own popping guitar strings and beautifully explosive finishes. Their guitars buzz, the disc quivers, and, 30 seconds in, the proposition of flopping face-first into The Catheters' muddy stew is oddly inviting-- much like the ill-fated romance of garage-rock itself (see: recording on an $8 tape deck, sandwiched between lawnmowers, sacks of fertilizer and half-empty paint cans), it's easy to get swept up in The Catheters' spunky impishness, to be inadvertently seduced by something so unapologetically brash and seemingly unconcerned with its own tunefulness. Still: By three tracks in, the band's thick slams start to become numbingly repetitive, the songs grow increasingly redundant. And not much later, it becomes strikingly evident that there's little here to discern one cut from the next, and nothing at all to maintain the giddy momentum of its start. Like nearly all fledgling garage bands, The Catheters' mine the ashes of the Stooges and the MC5 (as well as nodding to labelmates/contemporaries The Murder City Devils and Mudhoney), and Howling is a spotty mishmash of garage kickiness and metal sludge. Yet, something about the album seems prematurely and preemptively tired, and the longer the record plays, their inability to sustain significance becomes increasingly obvious. Despite all the promise of The Catheters' bluster, Howling is startlingly benign. Ultimately, The Catheters are big on style, and troublingly low on ideas-- most of Howling's 33 minutes refries the exact same tired, neo-garage conceits, but without tweaking the components, or injecting any compelling or memorable hooks. The resulting record is sort of like a post-fire apartment: layers and layers of wet white fuzz, with nothing much of worth soaking underneath.","Plucky, loud, and dripping with distortion, The Catheters' third full-length, Howling...

Unlike many two-man collaborative efforts, ego and testosterone are mostly left out of the equation on Hymie's Basement, replaced by misanthropy and self-deprecation. And while suburban ennui and disjointed American ideology sit at the heart of the duo's concerns, there are even yet more introspective and emotional facets to their sound. There's also a lot of almost indecipherable esoterica that ratifies their automatic work ethos. ""Ghost Dream"" kicks off with a monotonous deadpan delivery that recalls Beck circa Mellow Gold (think ""Soul Suckin' Jerk"") in its stream-of-consciousness babble, but its killer scratch-beats and beautifully frail piano render its unintelligible lyrics poignant and melodious. Along with ""Pretty Colors (Smile Your Brains Out)"" and ""You Die"", ""21st Century Pop Song"" was recorded after the original basement sessions as a means of gathering enough material to fill out the album. The track benefited from a little distance, and both its mood and subject matter make it the perfect opener for the record. Here, the pair merge slick hip-hop production tricks with indie guitar riffing to overlapping vocals that tackle ideological cynicism, the futility of mundane existence, and atomic bomb survival tactics. Lines like, ""You put your life in the hands of the highway designers/ Your stride and unforeseen side effect/ Of the urban planner's realized blueprint dream,"" express feelings of marginalization and impotence. The song's melodic chorus (""It's root root root for the home team"") ties the awkward verses together and shows a strong pop sensibility that continually rears its head over the course of the record. ""Props to Ornette Coleman/ For trying to castrate himself/ Males of the world you are despicable,"" sings Broder over a rolling piano and Wolf's poised harmonies on ""America Too"". Forming a silly pun partnership with ""America Won"", these tracks-- sad and angry, respectively-- depict a perception of the modern American male in bitter isolation while echoing the post 9/11 sense of ineffectuality. Both Wolf and Broder excel at offbeat observations that sit happily alongside innovative instrumentals. The band's official website asks us to notice a ""nervous energy"" between the two on their first co-written track, ""All Them Boys"", but for me, the whole record reflects a basic unease and trepidation-- between the artists themselves and the male gender, which they seem to despise. Elsewhere, ""The Pump"" is a superior riposte to the baffling contradictions of the human condition, especially as it's juxtaposed with the magic of the transient moment. ""Moonhead"" captures wide-eyed creepiness of a Tim Burton short story with the postured, thousand-yard stare feeling of Sigur Rós. ""Parrots"" starts like Leonard Cohen's ""The Future"" set to the bossanova rhythm preset of a thrift-shop keyboard before lurching feverishly into a brooding, nightmarish rap. One of many stylistic departures, ""Ben and Joey"", staggers through They Might Be Giants territory. Although the words sometimes evade total comprehension here, the duo's constant revision and development of their sound keeps the album fizzing with originality and unsettling charm. cLOUDDEAD and Fog are hefty legacies to follow, but Hymie's Basement comes up with the goods and then some. The partnership has coaxed the edgier, darker sides of Wolf out to mingle with Broder's naiveté and surrealist monologues. Thematically, the record has a unity that suggests a long-term alliance but the vibrant arrangements buzz with the exhilaration of a new relationship. It leaves you exhausted, fulfilled and with plenty to think about-- not least being whether a second Hymie's Basement project could be in the pipeline.","Hymie's Basement is the joint project of cLOUDDEAD's Why?

Spacesettings,Headset,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c15ec0084474cd0c3319/1:1/w_160/7f212e4e.jpg,2004-06-29 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3986-spacesettings/,Plug Research,"Allen Avanessian, owner and operator of the Los Angeles-based label Plug Research, had always wanted to bring together his entire roster for a collaborative project that reflects his imprint's commitment to progressive electronic music. When Pole's Stefan Betke asked him to put together an album for Betke's own ~scape label, Avanessian jumped at the chance to finally put the record together, and before he knew it, he'd enlisted Jimmy Tamborello (mastermind of Dntel, and the music half of The Postal Service) for production help, as well as a slew of guest producers and MCs for the project. The outcome would finally be dubbed Headset, and released by Plug Research in North America under exclusive license from ~scape. The results are possibly best introduced by comments made by Avanessian himself: ""This is not a hip-hop record, not an electronic record, and definitely not a jazz record, but we're influenced by all of these and love to create our own interpretations of these genres... We were listening to a lot of hip-hop over the years, and sometimes feel that commercial hip-hop producers bring a lot of new ideas and a fresh approach to making music, so yes, this record was influenced by people like The Neptunes, Timbaland, Dr. Dre, Kanye West, as well as producers on our label."" Read between the lines, and Avanessian says it himself: Headset's debut, Spacesettings, attempts to meet some of the greatest hip-hop beatmakers of the past five years on their own terms, with very little of the talent or ear for innovation that made them the most sought-after producers working today. The result, unfortunately, is worse in execution than it reads on paper: Spacesettings is liquidated, hookless, and entirely flaccid. While it's great that Plug Research finally at least sort of respects commercial pop music-- that ""sometimes feel..."" bit just kills me-- there's not much more to Headset than its repetitive, RZA-regurgitating, Tamborello-does-hip-hop gimmick. Opener ""Then Again"" and the unwitting remix track that follows it, ""Back Before"", play into all the bad indie hip-hop stereotypes: forgettably minimal low-tech beats, occasional ambient noises, and some anonymous kid rapping about Truth. Save Non-GENETIC's gem, ""But lookit/ You're steppin' like your boxers on crooked,"" listeners shouldn't expect much from the Headset MCs. It's great that word gymnast Subtitle has breath control-- and mentions it often-- on ""Breath Contrails""; it's just a shame he's so full of shit. Elsewhere on Spacesettings, instrumental tracks are consistently too long and lazy. Daedelus's flute-and-piano sound collage ""Outward Sound"" opens interestingly but then goes nowhere; ""Grasping Claw (The Beginning)"" is where One Word Extinguisher meets Deadringer, but without the technique of the former or the hooks of the latter. The greatest offender, however, is saved for the penultimate track: On ""Previously Smooth Sophistication"", ""smooth"" is the operative word, and ""jazz"" is the missing one. Two moments very briefly rescue Spacesettings from total monotony: Lady Dragon's feisty Japanese rap on ""Grasping Claw"", and the lush, pretty string parts at the end of the Thomas Fehlmann-enhanced closer ""Sound of a Squint"". Sadly, these two temporary high points are not quite high enough to carry the record. So, at its best, Spacesettings is a forgivable misstep with ambitions its creators couldn't hope to live up to; at its worst, it's hip-hop for assholes, another ""enlightened"" set from unskilled collegiate MCs whose piety amounts to little more than deep-seated inferiority crises.","Allen Avanessian, owner and operator of the Los Angeles-based label Plug Research, had always wanted to bring together his entire ...

The Silver Jews' David Berman succeeds by amplifying and multiplying the accretion of image to be found in his songs, steering his compositions away from a singable one-liner quality, and toward more architecturally complex mansions of poetry. Avant-garde MC Doseone, however, could be accused of writing his poems as if they were song lyrics, in his new book and accompanying audio CD, The Pelt. But here's the thing: It works, because his music is so unique, so questionable in its intention to be music. His work with Deep Puddle Dynamics, Themselves, and cLOUDDEAD-- as well as his numerous collaborations and solo projects-- are all wildly experimental and outré, each in their own individual way, but are united by a common thread: Doseone's muttering, baroquely delivered, and remarkably prolix stream-of-consciousness verbal calculus, laden with imbricate image systems and intricate internal rhyming schemes. His song lyrics work as poetry because they don't rely on melodies, hooks, choruses or catchphrases for their force; instead, they document intellection and association in a gloriously raw form. The audio CD that accompanies The Pelt, were it bolstered with beats instead of minimal, atmospheric embellishments such as ambient tape noise, subtle click-tracks and slight vocal distortions, could easily be received as a music CD, rather than a spoken word performance. As it is, it's well-served by the book, (which is really the main draw anyway), in which the words Doseone reads on the CD slither and tumble all over its pages. Beautifully bound for what is essentially a chapbook, The Pelt boasts a bound spine and full-color cover in a handsome card stock. Inside, we find shambling, carefully sculpted poetics that take full advantage of their capacity to surprise and startle: No two pages look the same; the text kinetically rambles over the available surface area. Flipping through, one gets the impression that the text from each page leaps off and scurries to rearrange on the next, skidding into position just as the page becomes visible. The text is offset by various surreal line drawings, creating a three-way aesthetic interface (text/audio/pictures) in which each facet of the triptych deepens the others. There's even a games page in the back, including bizarre versions of the word search, maze, Mad-Lib, and paint-by-numbers puzzles. For the work's intellectual content, Doseone retains his usual methods, most notably that of formal appropriation: He hijacks the semantic and structural tics of the automated help-line, the advertisement, the questionnaire, the play, the multiple-choice test, the table of contents, and the essay. You'll even find elements of honest-to-God Imagist and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry peppering this organic, original and overwhelmingly dense piece of work. Doseone has long been raising the bar for experimental hip-hop; here, he does the same for musicians trying their hand at verse.","When musicians-cum-poets go bad, it's usually due to a failure to acknowledge that poetry and song lyrics\n\ are ...

The Telescope Dreampatterns,Verdure,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a99d5e6ef95969321445/1:1/w_160/2deadf09.jpg,2004-06-29 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8533-the-telescope-dreampatterns/,Camera Obscura,"Last we heard, Donovan Quinn had teamed with Jewelled Antler Collective's Glenn Donaldson to form bubblegum nature buffs The Skygreen Leopards. To date, that duo's One Thousand Bird Ceremonies remains one of the more understated and addictive slabs of lo-fi pop to pass through the treehouse this year. Now going it alone as Verdure, Quinn remains within that marble-green hemisphere, yet, where the Leopards write for the sunniest of Julys, Verdure spins a much more nocturnal cartography. Originally self-released on CD-R and kept close among friends and associates, The Telescope Dreampatterns has been given a proper CD release by the Australian psych label Camera Obscura. Even before listening to The Telescope Dreampatterns, a mood is established by its lush packaging: Chunky purple trees, moths, and skeletal root systems are rendered in glorious psych fashion on the cover by Dream Magazine's George Parsons. It's nearly as satisfying musically: Opener ""Into the Blacktrees"" merges archaic acid-folk with a properly pained and dusted lyricism, relaying the tale of a shape-shifting dream state: ""I watched you take off your dress/ Lay yourself in the open road/ I didn't know if I should eat your flesh/ Or if I should pray for your soul/ Then you were two bluebirds at once/ And I watched you dancin' in the leaves/ And I watched you all of your life/ 'Til you disappeared into the black trees."" Quinn's cough-syrup vocal pacing here (and on ""Graveyard Porchlight"") is at times reminiscent of Dylan, but instrumentally, he shies from simple, straightforward folk by wrapping his dense hums and bows with the shade of a misty-eyed Skip Spence, the vibe of countless downer-psych players, and Native American tradition. ""The Greentrees""' relaxed pacing allows chimes to ring and sustain entirely before dissolving; its interludes are opaque and spacious. Organs drift, inducing a supine, dewy slumber, and when you finally catch a glimpse of these patterns, they feel like time-lapse guitar sparkle strummed and courted by Mr. Sandman: Quinn swivels into nightmare territory, but then quickly drifts back to idealized fluffy sheep and mossy hills. Likewise, ""Fluttering Pastures"" recreates its evocative title with Gregorian chants, rising chimes and all sorts of stringed vibrations. ""The Coffin Split in Two"" suggests the rock howl of The Seeds or The Troggs, and it delivers playful birdcalls over extant guitar wail. In other spots, I can pick out Iran guitar walls and Twisted Village chimes. There isn't much vocal and/or musical variation on the record, but this is a somnambulant daytrip, and, as with any level shoegaze plane, the lack of differentiation works to lull you into its zone. Songs don't emerge from some freakout garden in the sky, but pick at Quinn's roots and you'll find tiny blooming strata twisting through the rocky patterns of decay in Parson's landscaping. And the occasional instrumental adds some respite, giving the album the feel of a mystical found-sound field recording. Through every crag, The Telescope Dreampatterns is the ideal immersion tank for watching fireflies collide under graveyard porchlights. Now listen closely as they smear the summer with their woozy death-rattle glow.","Last we heard, Donovan Quinn had teamed with Jewelled Antler Collective's Glenn Donaldson to form bubblegum nature buffs The ...

"20,000 Streets Under the Sky",Marah,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3aa69fc7814a47cd6d2/1:1/w_160/43f78031.jpg,2004-06-28 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5102-20000-streets-under-the-sky/,Yep Roc,"One of the most geographically defined bands around, Philadelphia's Marah look to Bruce Springsteen the same way the Drive-By Truckers view Lynyrd Skynyrd: as a specifically regional influence. For brothers and band mainstays Dave and Serge Bielanko, The Boss-- with his word-dense songs, layered sound, and romantic conviction in rock 'n' roll's redemptive powers-- is just as much a Mid-Atlantic birthright as the Van Zant brothers are to Southerners like Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. While the Truckers, however, have received mostly praise for their double album about Skynyrd's career, Marah have received mostly jibes and pans for their E Street obsession. For one thing, Springsteen is still alive and touring, thus defying easy mythologizing, and he is generally thought of less as a Mid-Atlantic artist and more as simply an American one. Furthermore, having no Faulkner nor Delta blues, the Mid-Atlantic region-- the eastern Pennsylvania wasteland, most of New Jersey, all of clotted Delaware, parts of Maryland, and, some claim, a few acres in West Virginia-- is neither as defined in the public conscience nor as storied as the South, despite its very particular history and culture. Under the crushing weight of critical and commercial apathy (their first two albums should have been classics), Marah left the Mid-Atlantic altogether and recorded their ill-fated third album, Float Away with the Friday Night Gods, with Oasis producer Owen Morris, who turned their timeless urban rock into the kind of anthemic electro-sludge that was already out of date by 1995. Still, it was never as bad as its detractors (most of whom were former fans) claimed, with Dave's songwriting-- especially on ""Crying on an Airplane""-- softening the winces. Plus, there's always the possibility of a future live album to salvage those tracks. If Float Away proved anything, it was what the Bielanko brothers set out expressly to disprove: You can take the kids out of Philly, but you can't take Philly out of the kids. For their fourth album, 20,000 Streets Under the Sky, Marah return to their southside garage studio, not just as a recording site but as a setting for their gritty urban narratives. They're scarred but smarter (to quote another Skynyrd-inspired southern rock band, Drivin' N' Cryin'), knowing what works and still trying not to be tied to it. One song, ""Goin' Through the Motions"", even hints at what Float Away could have been had they produced Float Away on this side of the Atlantic. The lead-off track, ""East"", therefore, could be a kiss-off to fickle fans who cried sell-out when the band caught that transatlantic flight: ""East is all I need to finally start to feel defined."" Even as it yearns for points beyond the Delaware Bay (New Jersey? Ireland?), the song is anchored specifically in Philadelphia, as Dave describes the rumble of cars on I-95 and the jumble of people on South Street. Likewise, the entire album absorbs Philadelphiana like a sponge: car alarms and cat calls sound between songs, an errant trumpet introducing one track. The monumental ""Freedom Park"" even sets its tale of big-city bleakness against local girls chanting jump-rope jingles, transforming their sing-song rhythms into a lively gospel chorus. Marah's sound is fondly local, incorporating doo-wop, Philly soul, funk, and ambitious Springsteenisms (all those bells and saxes) in a restless depiction of the city as a place where neighborhoods are still defined and demarcated ethnically, and Dave writes songs to match. ""Feather Boa"" is a standout, a tale of a hard-luck transvestite who fears violence and death around every corner. It's a frank depiction of trying to pass, with some of Dave's best street poetry: ""Scratch card rub off silver/ Is the jewel beneath his nails/ His skin is bar room shark fin/ His lashes are sardine tails."" On the chorus he sings, ""This dick between my legs just makes me cry,"" giving the words the gutpunch impact of the last line of ""Round Eye Blues"". And if the second half of 20,000 Streets emphasizes Dave's threadbare vocals in overreaching anthems like ""Soda"", Marah at least bolster them with imaginative accompaniment. Granted, ""Pizzeria"" would probably sound better with Dave singing instead of Serge, but then again, his clearly affectionate vocals, while a bit thin in his overenunciation, at least preserve the album's casual vibe, as if performing these songs in some dingy Philly club for a few friends and family. 20,000 Streets isn't a comeback-- it's a homecoming.","One of the most geographically defined bands around, Philadelphia's Marah look to Bruce Springsteen the same way the Drive-By ...

Don't Climb on and Take the Holy Water,Kinski,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbbdabf31b7dc7155b6c/1:1/w_160/b17098e1.jpg,2004-06-28 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4463-dont-climb-on-and-take-the-holy-water/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Right at the end of the 28th minute of ""The Misprint in the Gutenburg Print Shop"", the ambient sprawl that forms the axis of Kinski's third full-length, you can hear some overenthusiastic audience member shout ""fuck yeah!"" amid assorted cheers and applause. It's not terribly audible, but it's a jarring contrast to the diminutive, steadily tolling bell that brings the piece to a near-silent, plaintive close, and it's also something of a surprise if you haven't yet scoped the album liners, as it reveals the live setting in which the song was recorded. The track certainly sounds studio-crafted, with its layers of guitar effects, flute, oscillator and juno synth, but more to the point, it just doesn't sound like something a band in their right mind would play to an audience-- it's slowly unfolding head music, even as it reaches its bizarre climax with heavily processed vocal whooping and guitars that sound like they're being hurled from balconies. Even stranger, the recording was made at a September 2002 show that didn't even feature Kinski on the bill-- Kinski's frontline of bassist Lucy Atkinson and guitarists Chris Martin and Matthew Reid-Schwartz were moonlighting that night as Herzog, and in fact, all of the recordings on this album were made under that name. Why release it as a Kinski album, then? Well, why not? Kinski's discography was wanting for a bit of variety, as the sound they shaped so nicely on their debut album was already going a bit stale by their sophomore outing, and this certainly fits that bill with its focus on percussionless drift and sound sculpture. By and large, the band works well in this context, but the first two pieces on the album absolutely dominate the last three, making them feel essentially superfluous. ""Never Compete with Small Girls"" is a soft guitar drone that shrinks from the daylight, while the aforementioned ""Misprint"" is unquestionably the band's most substantial piece to date, and not just for its breadth. Over the song's half-hour span, the band meditates on dread and apprehension, rising gradually through tense half-melodies (check the subtle references to ""The Little Drummer Boy"" at around 14:45) to the final freakout. There are unmistakable shades of everything from Can, Klaus Schulze and early Pink Floyd to Mogwai, and pretty much anything ever released on Kranky. It may not be fair to describe them as such on their own accounts, but the remaining three compositions feel like afterthoughts coming in the wake of all that. I've tried listening to the three of them on their own, away from their bigger brothers' shadows, but it only makes them feel incomplete, and even more like sketches for something larger. ""Bulky Knit Cheerleader Sweater"", in particular, is little more than a jumble of politely churning noises, with little-to-no contour. These late letdowns do little to blunt the overall impact of the album's centerpiece, though, and given that they constitute far less than half of the runtime, it's easy to overlook their shapelessness and focus on the good stuff upfront.","Right at the end of the 28th minute of ""The Misprint in the Gutenburg Print Shop"", the ambient sprawl that ...

Family Album,Faun Fables,by: Catherine Lewis,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be9a13d197565213b76a/1:1/w_160/62996a78.jpg,2004-06-28 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3313-family-album/,Drag City,"A Midsummer Night's Dream was never my favorite Shakespeare; I always preferred the familial intrigue of Hamlet or the blood-hungry mass-murders of Macbeth to the trivial shenanigans of lovers under a fairy's spell. Dream was even made into a musical recently-- which thankfully didn't stick-- but if the concept is ever revisited (and it surely will be: Broadway dudes love churning that stale butter), Faun Fables' Family Album would make a suitably awful soundtrack. Faun Fables is the solo project of Dawn McCarthy (aka Dawn the Faun), who has taken the omnipresent folk revival of late to a more theatrical level, her joyful yodels and tongue-twisting chants setting the stage for absurd characters to frolic in their carefree madness. Family Album kicks off with ""Eyes of a Bird"", whose calm flute intro is shattered by McCarthy's wailing vocals. As the song progresses, she grows increasingly shrill (imagine the timbre of Beth Orton's folky drawl stretched to its claws-on-chalkboard extreme) while a second female voice provides distractingly dissonant harmonies. The song's final few minutes disintegrate into tribal grunts and wails, as if Dawn the Faun had gotten a little too near recent Animal Collective without grasping the intricacies that make it work. This transition from calm to chaos sets the stage for the play that's about to unfold: Hermia (in love with Lysander) has been promised to Demetrius, who has captured the heart of Hermia's best friend, Helena. As the four lovers chase each other into the forest, McCarthy spins her tale into a hypnotic dream with the mellow ""Poem 2"" (yes, that is a glockenspiel), moaning, ""Dig the magic from your grave,"" as the Puck she envisions spreads Oberon's magic juice on first one lover, then another. The story deteriorates into absolute mayhem as they awaken to find that their world no longer revolves around Hermia, and the two dashing lads turn to chase Helena instead. McCarthy mirrors Hermia's grief in a duet with Sleepytime Gorilla Museum's Nils Frykdahl, the song crescendoing into a frenzied shriek as her new reality finally sinks in. Song after song, McCarthy falls into that same trap, never allowing a melody to shine through before her vocals overpower it with extreme volume or overwhelming theatrics. Although she occasionally gives the lead to Frykdahl, her piercing attempts at harmonies completely fails to mesh with his almost-goth gruffness. The lovers' inverted world can't last forever, and McCarthy coaxes them to sleep with the melodic lullaby ""Preview"" (one of the few songs, thankfully, that doesn't end in aggressive wails), sanding off the harsh edges of her grating soprano to coo a la-la-lullaby. Although it's never long before she lapses back into shrillness, this song is, I suppose, the best this record has to offer: It's just mellow enough as she murmurs perfect fifths over an arpeggiated guitar and autoharp. Unfortunately, the lulling calm of ""Preview"" is disrupted by ""Higher"", an adaptation of a traditional hymn that opens with a 30 year-old operatic recording of ""Holiest Night"" and deteriorates into a choral sing-along led by Dawn, complete with a distorted haunted house-styled organ. To top it off, after an all-too-serious delivery that's either intended to mimic or mock a church choir's lead soloist, McCarthy stretches to hit the final high octave note-- just like a real opera singer. (One should probably ignore the indulgent single applause that concludes this track.) From there, the lovers' mayhem is sorted out: The quartet returns to town with the tongue-twisting ""Carousel with Madonnas"", and the triple-wedding (Duke Theseus weds Amazon queen Hippolyta) is conducted in front of a bonfire to a rhythmic near-rap translation of Brigitte Fontaine's ""Eternal"". While Family Album will never synch up a Midsummer film like the old Floyd/Oz trick, Faun Fables' folky theatrics are so histrionic that, whether intentional or not, Dawn the Faun McCarthy has created a soundtrack that mirrors the emotional upheavals of those carefree Shakespearean revelers. And therein lies the problem: While the play, like McCarthy's music, captures the hijinx of a drug-influenced summer night, there is very little depth beneath the surface, and at its conclusion, the lovers are back where they started, no better-- and no worse-- for having made the journey.","A Midsummer Night's Dream was never my favorite Shakespeare; I always preferred the familial intrigue of Hamlet or the ...

Kites Are Fun / You Could Be Born Again / Heaven/Earth / Stars/Time/Bubbles/Love,The Free Design,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17e13d1975652138649/1:1/w_160/e2eeeb72.gif,2004-06-28 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11746-kites-are-fun-you-could-be-born-again-heavenearth-starstimebubbleslove/,Light in the AtticLight in the Attic,"The Free Design formed in 1966 in New York's Greenwich Village. Comprised of three of four Dedrick siblings (Chris, Bruce and Sandy), they specialized in a similar style of folk as peers Peter, Paul & Mary. However, doubtlessly due to main songwriter Chris' classical music studies, their music was decidedly ornate and their vocal harmonies precise and complex. The group quickly recorded a two-song demo-- and just as quickly were courted by labels quick to capitalize on the success of other ""harmony groups"" like the Beach Boys and Simon & Garfunkel. The Free Design subsequently found a home with independent easy-listening label Project 3, who promised greater creative freedom than the others. Unfortunately, the group failed to land a hit, likely due in part to the label's inexperience promoting pop acts. Now, nearly 40 years later, Light In the Attic Records has reissued the band's first four LPs, revealing a band unfairly slept on. The band's 1967 debut Kites Are Fun placed them squarely in the realm of sunshine pop acts like The Association and Curt Boettcher and Gary Usher's Sagittarius, but with the unmistakably precious Greenwich Village sound. Its songs are uniformly well arranged and performed, sparkling with some of the clearest sound of the era, and are also consistently pleasant and inoffensive, offering an amiable take on the counterculture's message of peace, love and freedom. The Free Design make no bones about their wholesome convictions in the title track: ""We'd like to be a zillion miles away from everyone/ 'Cause Mom and Dad and Uncle Bill don't realize Kites Are Fun."" The intricate vocal lines, using sophisticated harmonies normally associated with jazz or chamber classical music, carry out its beyond-innocent charms. ""The Proper Ornaments"" adds in ""ba-ba"" vocal counterpoint reminiscent of the Beach Boys and The Mamas & the Papas, in addition to a baroque arrangement featuring harpsichord and trumpets; it's as refined a piece of music as was released in the decade, though did the band no favors in hipper circles. The following year, The Free Design released You Could Be Born Again, adding youngest sister Ellen to the lineup. Having another voice allowed Chris to write more complex vocal arrangements, but otherwise, the album is very similar to the debut. It features several covers of current pop hits, including ""California Dreamin'"", The Beatles' ""Eleanor Rigby"", The Turtles' ""Happy Together"" and Burt Bacharach's ""The Windows of the World""-- and despite the brash dual-trumpet solo attack on the Mamas & the Papas tune, these songs contribute to a faceless professionalism that diminishes the album's impact. Chris Dedrick provides the most distinctive music, especially the gorgeous ""Ivy on a Windy Day"". Opening with a ghostly choral section, the song eventually settles into soft pop, featuring an unusual chord sequence that wouldn't sound out of place on recent Stereolab records-- in fact, Laetitia Sadier has cited the band as one of her all-time favorites. The reissue appends two non-LP bonus tracks: an easy-listening holiday ballad ""Christmas Is the Day"" and the oddly titled ""Close Your Mouth (It's Christmas)"". Heaven/Earth was released in 1969, and for the most part continues the soft, psychedelic pop of the first two records. ""You Be You and I'll Be Me"" spices up a typically elaborate vocal arrangement with an uptempo, percussive rock groove and a horn chart similar to concurrent Blood, Sweat & Tears or Chicago. However, the surprisingly cynical ""2002: A Hit Song"" provides the most spark on the record, suggesting that The Free Design weren't satisfied with their niche market. The singers outline a brief formula for a chart-topper (directed to the ""teenyboppers""), only to admit in frustration, ""We did all this last time, and it did not work."" Elsewhere, the funky jazz take on George Gershwin's ""Summertime"" offers evidence that the band were willing to step out of the mold they'd crafted for themselves. The reissue includes both sides of a solo single by Ellen Dedrick and several tracks featuring the band as backing singers for a 1968 LP by future music-mogul Tommy Mottola. 1970's Stars/Time/Bubbles/Love was The Free Design's best album to date, and also the first one to explore rock and funk with the same gusto as their already well-established brand of soft pop. ""Bubbles"" is its best-known song, and for good reason: The aggressive, odd-metered force of bass and drums, supported by clavinet and modestly searing electric guitar, propel Chris' ace vocal arrangement into similar territory as The Fifth Dimension and The Millennium, but with a crisper, jazzier edge. ""Butterflies Are Free"" is softer, but equally as engaging, due especially to the gloriously regal arrangement of vocals and brass on the fade-out. Best yet is ""That's All, People"", with deceptively dissonant harmonies and an explosive big band performance. The Free Design released two more LPs in the early 1970s (Sing for Very Important People and One by One) that will hopefully be reissued soon. Although the band's sound epitomized ""square"" at the time, its impact is obvious in the work of modern sophisti-poppers Stereolab, Cornelius, Manitoba, The High Llamas and Belle & Sebastian. They were overlooked the first time around, but The Free Design make more sense now than ever.","The Free Design formed in 1966 in New York's Greenwich Village.

Mazatlan,The Plastic Constellations,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a179c0084474cd0bfdf4/1:1/w_160/2b0db32a.gif,2004-06-28 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6542-mazatlan/,2024,"Rock music is all about transience. Wherever style beats substance, youth is a highly valued and unbearably scarce commodity; in rock, and particularly in more traditionally juvenile variations like emo, the hands of time are especially cruel. Bottling and selling precious youth is notoriously fickle; often, bands have long outgrown their lissome twenty-something physiques and lost all their oomph by the time they put a stamp on the completed package. And the music? It's less about conveying the universal reach of emotion than about capturing the feelings and incidental naivety of a very specific time. While we all find ourselves immersed by that glorious pocket of beauty and invincibility at some point, its attitude isn't easy to feign, and so, bands that choose not to hang it up after their sophomore release are more likely becoming The Promise Rings or The Get-Up Kids of this world than The Flaming Lips or Wilcos. The fate of Minneapolis quartet The Plastic Constellations is still very much in flux. After issuing the stellar We Got the Movement EP in 1999, which copped everyone from Fugazi to Sonic Youth in a gruff morass of youthful ingenuity, the group followed with an equally impressive debut full-length, Let's War, securing their status as promising post-punk debutantes. Then came a four-year hiatus, as the group's members done and went got some college. That's right: The Plastic Constellations' prodigious early yield was entirely the work of suburban high-schoolers. In an age rife with quixotic minstrels-- the bohemian equivalent of varsity football stars-- and lead guitarists with three-CD vocabularies, The Plastic Constellations were refined beyond their years. What's more, Let's War and We Got the Movement contained the kind of unbridled enthusiasm that usually trumps technical prowess, lyrical substance, and songwriting inventiveness in teenagers' judgments of the next local emo band. Alas, if only the patrons of Hopkins, Minnesota's underground music scene knew how lucky they were. Mazatlan, the group's emergent comeback, is full of universal qualities, but perhaps most importantly, it transports the listener back to the cozy early days of music fandom, when finding a record you loved was an episodic event, and one or two songs could occupy an entire afternoon. The Plastic Constellations aren't merely a strong outfit for their respective niche, but a mature, well-coordinated group that show great talent and even greater potential. The songs on Mazatlan resemble something conceptualized in a budding musician's hotwired brain-- virtuosity and communication between musicians being, naturally, no object-- but which so rarely get penned for the intensive and fleeting nature of the young imagination. Remarkably, the record is impressively cohesive, despite a couple questionable instances of quasi-rapping (""Movement Momentum"", ""Vicious Devotion"") and a feeling of persistent breathlessness from the breakneck tempos. Mazatlan runs the gamut of post-punk influences, from elder heroes Sonic Youth and Fugazi to latter-day stars like Les Savy Fav and Slint. But what makes these songs truly intriguing is The Plastic Constellations' eager exploration of odd tunings and contrasting, often atonal guitar harmonies. ""Beats Like You Stole Something"" is a deftly multi-tracked example of the band's licks, opening with a twinkling riff redolent of Daydream Nation's broken music box melodies before burgeoning into a full-fledged post-punk Armada. ""Evil Groove"" amply lives up to its title, turning in some craggy unison figures and a fragile, arpeggiated bridge section that exemplifies the band's off-kilter approach to post-punk. Throughout the album, The Plastic Constellations find novel ways to reconcile seemingly incommensurable styles and motifs, and their unflagging technique is a constant boon. Whereas it took Les Savy Fav several years to tame their recalcitrant energy and release a coherent album, The Plastic Constellations have already got themselves in check. Even Mazatlan's most sophomoric tunes avoid monotony and are executed without a hitch. ""East Cleveland"" motors by in a curt 2\xBD minutes, barely taking a breather between abrupt section changes, and yet still manages to deliver an anthemic chorus and a soaring bridge. In fact, The Plastic Constellations make a valiant effort to resurrect that sadly neglected element of effective, sophisticated pop music, bearing a bucketful of robust enjoinders. As chic as the guitar work and complex song structures may be, though, Mazatlan's most immediately winning quality is its abundance of anthemic choruses. Even if the band weren't so technically proficient, their lapses would be highly forgivable; The Plastic Constellations are easy to rally around, and their lyrics often hammer home their preciously of-the-moment aesthetic. On opener ""We Came to Play"", a febrile first verse gives way to the chorus lyric, ""We wrote this/ And laced up our shoes/ We came to play/ It's what we do."" Such exuberance, while often obnoxious in less musically apposite contexts, suffuses Mazatlan, providing its relentless lifeblood. The lyrical onslaught is constant and unwavering, thanks to a tasteful array of rhythmic vocal harmonizing, often triple-tracked and never cloying. Lesser bands might spend a decade trying to get to this point, only to find themselves already washed up, but The Plastic Constellations make it look easy, and seem ready for more.","Rock music is all about transience.

The Unnecessary History of Doctor Rockit,Doctor Rockit,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb805e6ef95969322c15/1:1/w_160/755fd9bb.jpg,2004-06-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2564-the-unnecessary-history-of-doctor-rockit/,Accidental,"Taking his name from both a race horse that always fared poorly and a college friend's yelp of ""Rockits!"" whenever things fared well, Matthew Herbert enacted the persona of Doctor Rockit for, appropriately, his most quotidian and most personal compositions, the best of which are now collected on the self-deprecating The Unnecessary History of Doctor Rockit. On Herbert's Clear Records debut, 1996's Ready to Rockit EP, as well as 1997's The Music of Sound, the musique concrete artist adopted what he calls in retrospect his ""diary theme."" Herbert used everyday samples from Doctor Rockit's (the horse) Pyrrhic-only victory to Herbert's own childhood stomping grounds to hotels, restaurants and airplanes he encountered on his European tour with Cheap Records. The tracks combined Herbert's tendency towards jazz and the quieter, more electro sound that aligned him so well with Clear, whose artistic unwillingness to follow the trend back to club music in the late 1990s spelled their demise. At the time of Clear's dissolution, Herbert hooked up with vocalist Dani Siciliano and began recording sleeker and ultimately more successful material under Herbert's surname; Doctor Rockit and his ""anything goes"" schtick were sidelined until 2000's Indoor Fireworks. A veritable grab bag, the somewhat unrealized Indoor Fireworks is a remarkably honest self-portrait of Herbert. Straightforward audio-diary tracks like ""Metro"", ""Cafe de Flore"", and ""Cath's Machine"" share space with Herbert's political concerns on ""Hymnformation"", and even the pre-Herbert, Siciliano-voxed ""Summer Love"", the album's standout track (and one that is surprisingly not included on The Unnecessary History). Hindsight may be 20/20, but in a very real way, Indoor Fireworks signaled Doctor Rockit's increasingly poor health. Which is not to say that Herbert is incapable of personal expression outside of the alias; it just seems the Herbert project, his musico-personal relationship with Siciliano, and his increasingly political edge were the only things worth expressing. Especially after the acclaimed Around the House-- an audio crossroads for Herbert's loves and musical politics-- this comp's title seems right on the money. Which is perhaps why, with The Unnecessary History of Doctor Rockit, Matthew Herbert is killing off that moniker. The compilation rescues many deleted and hard-to-find tracks from Doctor Rockit's early Clear days, early vinyl-only releases on Herbert's own Life and Lifelike labels, a few tracks from Indoor Fireworks, and Doctor Rockit's most recent release, ""Veselka's Diner"". It's a testament to Herbert how well these tracks have aged. Opener ""Cameras and Rocks"" is from the 1996 Ready to Rockit double 10-inch, yet its minimal puddle-synth jungle-shuffle and outlandishly funny synthesizer melody have retained their potency, undoubtedly from the high degree of subtlety to which Herbert almost apologetically subjects his work. Also from Ready to Rockit is the slurpy jazz-finding-loops of ""Photos and Pebbles""-- the musical mold that birthed ""Cameras and Rocks""-- which invites comparisons to Jan Jelinek. While sometimes musically minimal, the Doctor Rockit project also at times predicted the Matthew Herbert Big Band-- the 1996 DR EP Swingtime is likely being referenced in the title to MHBB's 2003 release, Goodbye Swingtime. ""Cafe de Flore"" has found itself on more lounge-style compilation discs than possibly any other Herbert song. Its acoustic brushes-on-snare cocktail jazz-tinged house is buttered up by Herbert's tasteful ambient samples and catchy synth and accordion melodies. Occasionally, Herbert ditches the glitch and records his instruments in the nude. These tracks, such as the piano solo at the end of ""I Wish I Was"", are far less interesting than the equal parts jazz-meets-house that Herbert executes so seamlessly. Still, while Herbert is a gifted pianist, he does have a tendency for trite jazz phrases. The compilation fittingly closes with ""Granny Delicious"", which contains Herbert's first-ever ""field recording"" sample (the sound of an apple being eaten), yet part of me also wished Herbert closed The Unnecessary History with the leftfield accordion drinking song ""This Is The End"", however tongue-in-cheek it would have been. Beyond functioning as a disjointed but accurate retelling of Doctor Rockit's story and breadth of styles, The Unnecessary History also documents Herbert's apparently deep concern that his music of sound is, in fact, still music. From his lengthy sampling treatise to his recourse to jazz modes to his anxious use of live, man-played instruments, Herbert oddly strikes me as never seeming fully convinced of his music's worth. That tension is more apparent on Herbert's Doctor Rockit records than any other point in his career, which is perhaps one reason why The Unnecessary History is a compelling tale spun by one of the world's most meticulous and exciting artists.","Taking his name from both a race horse that always fared poorly and a college friend's yelp of ""Rockits ...

Asobi Seksu,Asobi Seksu,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a25e6ef95969320225/1:1/w_160/20cb25bd.jpg,2004-06-27 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/447-asobi-seksu/,Friendly Fire,"Yuki Chikudate is a hopeless romantic, damaged and done wrong by the weird arc of love. The feelings that remain vital are unpredictable free radicals; they come out in couplets of both Japanese and English, glomming onto the spiny keels and shimmering dream-pop textures that wash over Asobi Seksu's self-titled Friendly Fire debut. The usual suspects crackle through Seksu in big honking waves, but there are also little moments of light-- whether in the varied arrangements or Yuki's bilingual lead vocals-- that stipple the set with unique enough sunspots. The record's a promising start for the New York City group, which finds the beguiling, keyboard-playing Yuki joined by three white guys straight outta indie rock central casting. ""I'm Happy But You Don't Like Me"" rocks cutesy Puffy Amiyumi phrasing over hooting synths and James Hanna's thousand foot-high rhythm guitar. It's a breezy, slightly kitschy opener, but before long, Asobi Seksu are dwelling in suspended emotion and the cathartic salve of deafening electric guitar. ""Sooner""'s English-language harmony vocals murmur intimately in lovers' whisper-speak, periodically conceding to Hanna, who attempts to re-harness the power of Medicine to shear off the top of the universe. It's a dynamic familiar to denizens of shoegaze (not to mention Sonic Youth-- check Hanna's quite referential ""Let Them Wait""), but Asobi Seksu largely gets away with copping it, since the cred gatekeepers will admit that the tones are achingly cool, and at a nice counterpoint to Yuki's pattering keys and pristine vocal chirp. Seksu save their best for the middle. ""It's Too Late"" begins as an echoing, halting ballad, like background music for a slow-motion airport terminal goodbye. Yuki channels the breathy cynicism of Bettie Serveert's Carol Van Dijk (""Run away now, there's nothing to say"") and you feel the anger behind the sobs. Naturally, there's punctuation, via layers of piercing guitar wail. The racket subsides for a spell, but like the rawest emotions they come back, screaming and hissing through two-plus minutes of electronic and pedal-driven squelch. It's the album's truest point because it's evocative in its own skin. Asobi Seksu do need some work with the glue. Uniting their slickest chimes and peals are a few under-thought numbers ranging from the saw-it-coming department (the lilting to roaring closer ""Before We Fall""), to frustrating stuff that ends too soon (the grinding ""Asobi Masho"" is a randy, art-battered tease). That said, it's a quality debut, obviously indebted to its influences, but finding new and artful ways to swallow love with a guitar.","Yuki Chikudate is a hopeless romantic, damaged and done wrong by the weird arc of love.

Quiet City,Pan American,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb41abf31b7dc7155a4c/1:1/w_160/b3f59608.jpg,2004-06-27 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6133-quiet-city/,Kranky,"It's been more than three years since the last Labradford album with no word of a new release. No worries, though. I imagine this fanbase is a patient lot. To enjoy Labradford you have to be willing to sit still, listen deeply, enjoy the moment, and wait for subtle changes that wind up being quite meaningful when stacked one atop the other. Labradford's Mark Nelson, who records as Pan American, has kept busy with music since 2001's excellent fixed:content. His third solo album, The River Made No Sound, was released in 2002, and he now returns with a record whose title merits a nomination in the 2004 Truth in Advertising award: Quiet City. While the first three records moved progressively toward beats, loops, and laptop-forged glitches, Quiet City sounds very much like where we last left Labradford. Gone are the dub processes and dabbles in microscopic dance music. There is hardly a loop on the record, there's all sort of guitar, and Nelson has recruited players to assist on upright bass (Charles Kim), drums (Steven Hess) and horns (David Max Crawford). Where The River Made No Sound was often cold and brittle, Quiet City is like a warm breeze crawling in through an open window. An overall shift in sound toward more trad-instrument territory is evident, but a select few tracks on Quiet City are reminiscent of Pan American of old. The nine-minute ""Wing"" is a heavily electronic drone piece, with an unsteady wavering tone surrounded by glitches and static and the occasional presence of noisily recorded conga drums. ""Shining Book"" adds unintelligible whispers by Nelson to the moody ambient electronic stew. These less specific drift pieces blend easily with the more fleshed-out and layered tracks, but the most intense moments of Quiet City are direct in the manner of great film music. ""Het Volk"", for example, is like a prime cut from John Barry's Body Heat score, as a tense repeating keyboard pattern combines with Crawford's flugelhorn to suggest sweat, darkness, contemplation, and a hint of danger. ""Inside Elevation"", with its acoustic guitar and melodica floating above a buried rumble of bass drone, captures the veiled desert drama of Paris, Texas. The economical guitar work throughout the record is excellent, and ultimately is at the core of what makes Quiet City such an evocative record. Both ""Skylight"" and ""Lights on the Water"" are built around the kind of gorgeously reverberating guitar that Nelson long ago mastered, with the guitar/amp interface tweaked to noir perfection. ""Lights of Little Towns"" closes the album on an up note, with simple plucked acoustic guitar dueling with a processed electric and a bowed cymbal to produce a mood of muted optimism laced with dignity, something like a more orderly and precise dirge by the Tren Brothers. Thus ends a deceptively powerful album that sounds so good in the background that it's easy to overlook how well it's executed. With any luck, Labradford will return to the studio soon, but in the interim Quiet City is plenty to hold us over.","It's been more than three years since the last Labradford album with no word of a new release.

Scavengers EP,Food for Animals,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be94abf31b7dc715617c/1:1/w_160/7a6ee4b2.gif,2004-06-27 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3300-scavengers-ep/,Upper ClassMuckamuck Produce,"When does a piece of experimental music move beyond unlistenable noise, past the point of defiant curiosity, to the realm of unparalleled genius? Hard to quantify, even for the most mathematical at heart, but you know it when you hear it. Certain elements must be accounted for-- most importantly, an emotional ballast is essential to keep any twangy wigouts from veering into self-indulgent, alienating miasmic slop. In hip-hop-- a genre defined primarily by its rigid rhythmic orientation-- the channels of experimentation are actually a bit more open, though maybe somewhat more predictable. That is, fuck with rhythm and you're fucking with the foundation of hip-hop. But inject that aforementioned depth of emotion into a shattered and rebuilt rhythmic template, and you might arrive at something vital. Food for Animals step up to the plate and mostly obliterate the rhythmic conventions we've come to expect from hip-hop. This isn't skittering, hiccuped eski beat or minimalist schiz-hop pong hits; what remains after DJ/producer Ricky Rabbit goes Rick James all over his ProTools setup sounds like a field recording from a sheet metal factory getting flattened by a herd of bulldozers. In fact, it isn't until two minutes into this 20-minute sound test that any semblance of a beat settles for MC Vulture Voltaire to rap over. But once he rolls through Rabbit's swarm of killer beats with a brassy, heavyweight tone, the gravity is difficult to ignore. Don't be misled: You have to be in the mood for this sometimes withering assault. When Voltaire comes in over the twisted strings and stuttering drums of ""Brand New"", all semblance of dance floor contrivance and headphone filler are laid to waste. Rock Scavengers while flipping through Vice in the waiting room of your local body piercing shop with Jim Beam and bad powder on hand as your only anesthetic. After several early tunes are burnt up with Rabbit's short jagged percussion stabs and Voltaire's soulful, low-in-the-mix rage, the final 12 minutes show the blood-quickening power this duo is capable of. The whole album is a rant against Bush's stolen presidency, but ""Cut and Paste"" and the title track are especially sweltering with Voltaire's pointed lyrical barbs. His voice, bristling with clipped urgency, is clear, aggressive and angry, yet possessed with the self-aware humor of the most articulate political MCs. It's the anchor that pulls the ear down through Rabbit's torrential beat smashing and the means by which Food for Animals manages to strike a teetering balance of chaos and focus that prods a second listen. By the time the instrumental ""TTFN"" closes the album, you've probably been suckered into the band's abrasive, unlikely funk. I can't imagine too many hip-hop heads cranking Scavengers this summer, but grizzled fans of dark art-hop like Kid 606 and Dälek will likely grit their teeth in a joyful agony as Food for Animals blasts into some well-muscled noise. Recommended only for those with a high tolerance for serial grime and a taste for the sharper, harder edge of hip-hop.","When does a piece of experimental music move beyond unlistenable noise, past the point of defiant curiosity,\n\ to the ...

A Ghost Is Born,Wilco,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa35c0084474cd0c116b/1:1/w_160/5b8bafaf.jpg,2004-06-21 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8680-a-ghost-is-born/,Nonesuch,"At the time of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot's non-traditional 2001 ""release,"" I was in the midst of a two-year exile away from the home city I share with the band. While the rock-crit throngs lined up to praise the album's experimentalism, screw-the-Record-Company-Man martyrdom and accidental 9/11 relevance, it merely seemed to me like a postcard photograph that perfectly sums up all the things you love about a city, a sonic map of Chicago's every contour. Putting YHF on the stereo was all it took to cue up a mental slideshow of the city's palette: ""Reservations"" the gray tones of a frozen-over Lake Michigan, ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" the humid orange of a Grant Park festival, and ""Radio Cure"" the brown shade of El-track alleys. It's very possible, then, that the underwhelming feeling projected by A Ghost Is Born is linked to my address being restored to a Chicago zip code, where I have the city's essence accessible right outside my courtyard gate. Early returns on the album veer wildly from rapturous proclamations that this record solidifies the band's genius to cred-snipers who see it as a crippling failure. To me, it sounds like neither extreme, but rather like a band in need of a break, a band that's been reading their press, a band straying too far from their strengths, and a band that's still too good to let any of these things completely obscure their talents. A lot of those assumptions are based on the simple fact that A Ghost Is Born is a wildly uneven album, fluctuating in both mood and quality over the course of its one hour runtime. Less cohesive than any other Wilco release, Ghost fulfills all the stereotypes of the album-after-the-breakthrough: So you've played the band reinvention card, what next? On some songs, the band take refuge in their past incarnations (""I'm a Wheel"", ""Hummingbird""), on some they dip their toe in the water of other bands' pools (""Spiders/Kidsmoke""), and on others they take the previous album's achievements to uncomfortable extremes (""Less Than You Think""). But more than anything, Jeff Tweedy confirms the fear I've held since I was exposed to most of this new material last year during Wilco's tour-closing show: He now revels in extended guitar solos. Five of Ghost's first six songs dissolve into noisy fretboard fingerings, and it's no coincidence that this first half of the album is where most of the weaknesses lie. As a Neil Young fan, I'm no anti-soloist, but for an artist as lyrically and vocally gifted as Tweedy to resort to expressing emotions through age-old bombast and pyrotechnics, something must be gumming up the songwriting works. Three of these shut-up-and-play guitar sections come in songs so sleepy and hazy (""At Least That's What You Said"", ""Muzzle of Bees"", ""Hell Is Chrome"") that they practically invite idle speculation about Tweedy's prehab pill regimen. Sluggish and flat, they're the opposite of the idea-packed YHF material, with the affected quirks that fill out the arrangements unable to dispel the overall grogginess. ""Spiders/Kidsmoke"", on the other hand, dabbles in a marathon Krautrock vamp, spoiling one of Wilco's best new songs with a cyclical arrangement that erases the tension and release of its live arrangement. Where ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"" spent its lengthy runtime constantly shapeshifting, ""Spiders/Kidsmoke"" seems to content to simply spins its wheels for upwards of 10 minutes. Only ""Hummingbird"" manages to cut through Side A's gloom, revisiting the Beatles-pop of Summerteeth, albeit without that album's hyperactive keyboards. Many of A Ghost Is Born's brighter spots seem to be spin-offs of Summerteeth""s classic rock obsession rather than blippy YHF explorations-- despite this being Wilco's first release since the departure of canon-worship keyboardist Jay Bennett. Remaining within the safe confines of their more traditional influences, the piano-strut of ""Theologians"" echoes the white-soul of The Band (Wilco's closest ancestral analogue), while the slapdash ""I'm a Wheel"" is an encore-ready reminder of the group's early, 'Mats-evoking days. There are only two songs on A Ghost Is Born that supercede Wilco's influences and arrangement struggles, moments when studio texture and songwriting merge smoothly to represent the album's grey mood in a way that's genuinely moving rather than disappointingly motionless. Whereas the ambient storm that drifts over the entire album can be distracting, on ""Wishful Thinking"" it creates just the right overcast backdrop, guiding Tweedy's softly cracking voice as he combs through feedback blankets looking for love's tunnel-end light. Grandiose yet mellow, ""Company in My Back"" makes the best use of Wilco's current keyboard-heavy lineup as piano and Casio verse-color exploding into dulcimer cacophony on the chorus. Nevertheless, A Ghost Is Born squanders its second-half capital in the final reel, whipping up an impenetrable, unnecessary 10-minute noise squall to conclude the thin-ice beauty of ""Less Than You Think"". In interviews, Tweedy has explained the segment as a aural replica of the migraines that propelled him towards pharmaceuticals, but even the deepest empathy won't prevent its unrewarding drone from propelling listeners towards the "">>"" button. Hit it, and you're treated to the forgettable ""Late Greats"", rock-by-numbers with lyrics that unfortunately seem to indicate Tweedy's complaisance with the obscurity = good, radio = bad logic of his loudest booster-critics. In the end, the ambitious misfires and pre-coffee drowsiness of A Ghost Is Born don't ruin the album entirely-- they only serve as distractions that make it much more difficult to excavate the band's strengths from the surrounding detritus. Certain islands of success continue to give me that feeling of purified Chicagoness, even as I spend my days commuting through the actual city. Should my daily premonition of the CTA's silver snake surging off its elevated track come true, I can't think of a more fitting score for my mass transit demise than ""Company in My Back"". But it pains me to see Wilco celebrate this album by getting right back on the tour bus, outfitted with a new guitar-army lineup, and spending yet more time away from the city from whence they derive their power. Won't you come home (and stay home), Jeff Tweedy?","At the time of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot's non-traditional 2001 ""release,"" I was in the midst of a two-year exile ...

Happiness in Magazines,Graham Coxon,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68e5e6ef95969320d86/1:1/w_160/e2d19448.jpg,2004-06-21 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1645-happiness-in-magazines/,Parlophone,"When Graham Coxon parted ways with Blur prior to the group's 2003 release, Think Tank, it was evident the lead axe-man had experienced quite enough of Blur's frivolous, occasionally groundbreaking genre-hopping and cause celebre sophistry. Happiness in Magazines emphatically dispels any remaining speculation, proving Coxon as stubbornly fond of American-style power-pop as his former band seemed to be before they cozied up to the commodious confines of international stardom. As it happens, Coxon's solo releases have proven him not only the most prolific member of Blur, but also the least adventurous. Fortunately, with Happiness in Magazines, his by-the-numbers approach to songcraft has finally yielded its most copious rewards. Exploring the vacated ghosts of stale forms, Coxon has breathed new life into some of rock's most bankable clichés. Throughout its 12 tracks, Happiness in Magazines shudders to deviate far from its core triptych of guitar, bass and drums. Only during the radio-ready ballad ""All Over Me"" is the textural stasis broken by the presence of strings and a sporadic synth arpeggio-- so it's a good thing that Coxon's dexterous, liberally multi-tracked guitar playing is diffuse and virtuosic enough to maintain interest. On the structurally staid blues riffing of ""Girl Done Gone"", his humid, fuzzed-out playing compensates for an uninspired vocal performance, while slyly contradicting the minimalist approach to blues-rock favored by bands like The White Stripes or The Black Keys. In fact, Happiness in Magazines is a record full of contradictions. Sidestepping the mainstream by dint of utter familiarity, Coxon has found a harmonious paradox. Of course, there are dry spots. ""Hopeless Friend"" shamelessly quotes The Who's ""A Quick One (While He's Away)"" verbatim, a technique favored in jazz, but an awkward fit in rock for the form's historical irreverence. Elsewhere, the bullhorn-belted vocals and irascible post-punk of ""People of the Earth"" recall The Fall, yet the song ultimately falls flat, feeling like a haggard anachronism. Still, in an era where revivalists are often pitifully short on ideas, frontloading records to the point of redundancy, Coxon has managed a seemingly obsolete feat: a blockbuster middle section. From the opening guitar peals of ""Girl Done Gone"" through the readily anthemic chorus of ""Freakin' Out"", Happiness in Magazines loses nary a step, turning in a handful of candidates for Rock Single of the Year. ""Bittersweet Bundle of Misery"", replete with blithe acoustic strumming, rudimentary vocal harmonizing, and two-step bassline, is one of the most charmingly ironic love songs to grace record this year-- even if it does bear a remarkable similarity to Blur's Coxon-penned ""Coffee and TV"". ""Freakin' Out"" spins an unduly filched riff and a paltry lyrical cadence into an indulgent nugget of pop bliss. But the pinnacle is clearly ""All Over Me"", the album's most visceral song and its best stab at constructing something wholly new from entirely recycled parts. As Picasso said, ""Bad artists copy. Good artists steal."" It's obvious that Graham Coxon follows no beat but that of his own drummer.

New Resolution EP,Azure Ray,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16f5e6ef959693201a7/1:1/w_160/ae5daef7.gif,2004-06-21 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/402-new-resolution-ep/,Saddle Creek,"Although it only contains three tracks-- two which are versions of the title song-- Azure Ray's New Resolution EP is as subtle as it is brittle, and as gracefully measured as anything the duo has released to date. Taken from last year's Hold on Love, ""New Resolution"" was that album's sultry stink-eye. It never explains why hearts are racing and records are skipping, but its insistent, glitchy tumble and husky, lingering vocals don't require logic for their simplistic beauty-- especially not with the song's sentiment wrapped in the shadows of keening strings and the splotchy bump of Eric Bachmann's production. Appropriately, the song's video, included on this disc, skirts the issue while skewering it peripherally. Here, we find Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor strolling in their slips on the cracked yellow pavement of a Nebraska high noon, holding hands. Suddenly, there rises an army of the mod. The slick-suited and rearview-mirrored roll their Vespas in formation toward the Azure Ray nexus. They circle; Fink and Taylor parry. The phalanx splits and reforms, yet it's clear who wears the pants in this dance, and Azure Ray end up leading the fancy gang back into town. This is what they do, these two. Their music is halting, like each breath expelled is at a premium. But it's also fiercely confident and cocksure: Arrangements tearing swatches from southern gothic, shadowy electronica and achy bedroom indie are all stitched perfectly. The second track, ""Drinks We Drank Last Night"", appears in gentle home-recorded form, and couldn't be further from the corrupted Dido/Lamb mashup of ""New Resolution"". But naturally, it's just as powerful. The harmonies coalesce like dandelion dust, fragile stems rooted in spidery electric guitar and cresting electronics. And if this isn't enough saleable content for those matching Prada with yard sale tutus, New Resolution concludes with a remix of its title track by Dntel mastermind and Postal Service principal Jimmy Tamborello. As it turns out, he's up to the task, tweaking and accelerating the track's mechanistic bottom end to elongate the linger in Fink and Taylor's phrasing. His synth-pop drop-ins conjure images of animated Norwegians crashing into real life hallways, like ad music for cars not yet invented.","Although it only contains three tracks-- two which are versions of the title song-- Azure Ray's New Resolution EP ...

Original Rudebwoy,Mighty Casey,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46769fc7814a47cd895/1:1/w_160/1985d6d2.jpg,2004-06-21 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5592-original-rudebwoy/,Lewis,"I was a little nervous at first. After two hours and 13 bottles of Stella Artois, I had placed myself into an awkward situation. On top of a table, my first thought was ""jump like Rod Strickland"" but eventually I created a comedic rap about Canadian politics. Although I managed to rhyme ""go Paul Martin"" with ""no hard coughing,"" the crowd was thoroughly disenchanted by my performance. This goes to show just how difficult it is to achieve simultaneous success as a humorist and a rapper-- on his debut, Original Rudebwoy, Mighty Casey succeeds in the former. Boston rappers have a strong history of being either painfully technical (Esoteric, Mr. Lif) or incredibly rudimentary (Guru), and Mighty Casey falls squarely into the second camp. He has an old-school style with a simple nature that lends itself well to party rap. His delivery sounds labored at times but in some instances, his hurried, measured lyrical displays seem charming. Lyrically, Casey makes up for his lack of technical ability with a hilarious personality. For instance, on ""White Girls"" (loosely based on the Grandmaster Flash classic ""White Lines"", and the theme song to the new Wayans Brothers movie White Chicks), he claims, ""Used to like Mariah 'til I learned she was mixed"", while ""Black Rapping School"" features a repetitive bridge that sarcastically intones, ""I sell crack!"" Although ""White Girls"" is the song that made Casey's rep on the BET Uncut circuit, the album standout comes with ""Liquorland Part 2"". The concept is a wordplay clinic in the tradition of GZA's ""Labels"", where Casey invokes the names of various alcohols and corporations in creative ways. Over the span of the song, he gets political (""I bought a 100 shots, took 59 to swallow/ Poured out 41 for Amadou Diallo""), details his favorite measurements (""I like girls thick like Guinness with big cans like Foster's"") and exhibits patriotism (""If I stop drinking then the terrorists win""). Coupled up with a beat whose playful piano loop comes courtesy of The Cure's ""The Lovecats"", this track offers Casey's most competent vocal performance, and is untouched elsewhere on Original Rudebwoy. The tone of the production-- a dependence on traditional boom-bap in the style of DJ Premier-- is consistent throughout the album. Standouts include the reggae horn dub-splash of ""Black Rapping School"", the chopped chimes and trumpet of ""Original Rudebwoy"" and the slo-mo vocal sample and chopstick piano of ""One Night Stand"". Although Casey would sound incredible over the more technical production of J-Zone or The Beatnuts, the beats he has now are solid enough for his purpose. To get a sense on the kind of artist Mighty Casey is, the press kit comes with a fact sheet detailing his cultivation of a pencil moustache and a Mighty Casey coloring page contest. Obviously, he doesn't take music too seriously. Still, the failings of his debut are apparent: The album is too short (there are only nine original songs), its choruses are often incredibly, brutally off-key, and Casey's awkward delivery is sometimes distracting. That said, if you're looking for a good time short of getting up on a table, maybe Mighty Casey is for you.","I was a little nervous at first.

The Emergency Response EP,Despistado,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb7eea9e61561daa725a/1:1/w_160/c259154e.jpg,2004-06-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2562-the-emergency-response-ep/,Jade Tree,"Their name may translate from Spanish as ""confused,"" but there's no uncertainty shown on this six-song EP from Saskatchewan-based four-piece Despistado. Through 20 minutes of pure post-punk glory, Emergency Response rants and throbs with an upbeat intensity that never grates or wanes-- which is a real surprise given the unevenness of their label's current roster. But it is truth: With Despistado, Jade Tree has tapped a young and frothy vein of soulful, ramshackle grit that bubbles up sharp and sweet. Despistado's hyperactive, unpredictable song structures might elicit eager Wire comparisons, which would be apt but a little farfetched considering the band's freshman status, and the fact that they're proudly Canadian. They've been around the block, though, honing their chops over more than two years of touring the Great White North before laying down these densely composed tracks. Which, as it so happens, has apparently been just long enough for the band to develop a keen, commanding personality, and to cultivate a sheepish, yearning sincerity that renders these songs instantly likeable. Nearly lost amidst the trebly crossfire of dueling guitars and splashy cymbal work, Dagan Harding's lyrics are poetic, suggestive, and intriguingly baffling. After a jumpy, tourettes-inflected opening, ""A Stirstick Prediction"" bounces through several fist-pumping anthemic ticks, while Harding sings, ""There's no otherwise inside this black and white/ Get your protractors out/ Round the right angles of your life."" When Harding and bassist Joel Passmore go toe-to-toe on vocals, shout-chanting above Passmore's agile, fluttering basslines, and Brennan Schwartz's snare and ride rain down in sheets, the result is too jubilant to sit still to. The irksomely titled ""Can I Please Have an Order of Girl with a Side of Confused"" and rhythmically focused ""Bubbles"" both rage with the kind of sincere anti-angst that only kids singing full-throat over lanky guitar and tribal beats can muster. On the two-toned skank of ""Lipstick"", Harding and Leif Thorseth's interlocked guitars jingle and jangle over dapper handclaps and jerky drums, while the damnably infectious chorus bores into the subconscious. I think I've listened into this song more than 20 times in three days and fuck if its hepcat luster hasn't dimmed. Indeed, even as Despistado guitar-check their post-punk influences, they race into their own identity with a shit-eating grin, arriving at a sound that's all force, no bullshit.","Their name may translate from Spanish as ""confused,"" but there's no uncertainty shown on this six-song EP from Saskatchewan-based ...

Creature Comforts,Black Dice,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d913d1975652138969/1:1/w_160/2b6927cf.jpg,2004-06-20 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/751-creature-comforts/,DFA,"When No New York was issued in 1978, it should have been fair warning to anyone within earshot that punk would not be confined to fashion statements or cathartic brattiness. Featuring four bands from Manhattan's lower East Side, the Brian Eno-assembled compilation highlighted an artistic spirit far removed from the ""pretty vacant"" methodology of punk's first wave; as it happened, the sprawling, confrontational noise put forth by DNA, The Contortions, Mars, and Teenage Jesus & The Jerks resembled nothing so much as similar output by UK second-wave outfits like John Lydon's Public Image Limited or Cleveland-based archetypical post-punks Pere Ubu. That is, their ""confrontation"" came not so much in the physical power of the music (though it could be abrasive, to say the least) but in the conviction and often awkward, raw execution of their brand of expression. No-wave was as much art-rock as it was punk, and despite its failure to break into the mainstream, its ideals were permanently stamped onto scores of musicians afterwards. Taking direct cues from the short movement, bands like Sonic Youth and Swans continued the often dark, grating sonic template of no-wave, and ventured even further into conceptual grounds normally associated with modern classical composition or performance art. In some ways, no-wave's successors were merely continuing a long standing New York tradition of eclecticism and the post-modern in rock that had been initiated in the 60s by The Velvet Underground and influenced by composers La Monte Young, Tony Conrad and Terry Riley. However, in the 80s, alongside a budding (and often antagonistic) American hardcore scene and wildly creative strands of post-punk all over the world, what stylistic benchmarks had been attributed to no-wave shattered into countless strands of noise, electronic music and the otherwise indescribable. Almost three decades after the fact, New York's art-punks seem to have come full circle-- though the landscape of the rock press has not. Liars have been butchered in most mainstream music rags for making ""unlistenable"" music on their latest album, which, to my ears, sounds more like a tribute to art-damaged post-punk and no-wave circa 1982 than any kind of radical change in direction. Likewise, Sightings and Black Dice draw from noise, experimental punk and perennial New York faves-from-Japan High Rise and Fushitsusha. Not surprisingly, they get fewer Spin props than more melodically stable NYC outfits like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or The Strokes (both of whom also happen to draw on the early 80s post-punk for inspiration, albeit ""new-"" rather than ""no-"" wave). However, Black Dice, like the best of the original wave of avant-rockers, have yet to lapse into redundant hero worship or watered-down stylistic approximations. Depending on how you feel about perpetual forward motion, the Brooklyn trio (formerly a quartet, now minus drummer Hisham Bharoocha) could be admirably ambitious or maddeningly flighty; thus far, they've established a pattern on their full-lengths of abandoning the previous album's sonic palette for something drastically different. Their earliest releases could veer from spiky, violent impressionism to what Pitchfork's Brendan Reid described as ""anti music"" in his review of 2001's Cold Hands. When the band moved to the ultra-hip DFA label for 2002's Beaches and Canyons, one might have expected them to dabble in electroclash-- which they sort-of did on the ""Cone Toaster"" 12-inch, only to immediately switch gears on the hazy, ambient Miles of Smiles EP earlier this year. Creature Comforts is Black Dice's fourth full-length, and second for DFA. Lo and behold, it doesn't sound like anything else they've released. This record is made from pedals, delay, computers, solemn guitar arpeggios, loops, robot jungle sounds and cosmic ambience. It's almost completely divorced from any strand of rock (or even punk), yet sits comfortably alongside fellow New York trippers Suicide and English provocateurs Throbbing Gristle. There are percussive moments, but no real beats; there are noisy moments, but it's hardly a ""noise"" record; much of it seems improvised, yet for the most part the album proceeds in a linear fashion, as if one long, strange story is unfolding. Black Dice, apparently unconcerned with establishing their noise-rock niche with peers Wolf Eyes or Lightning Bolt, are content to follow their muse as a matter of practice. The brief opener ""Cloud Pleaser"" begins with a simple, folkish guitar line (oddly reminiscent of Van Morrison's ""Brown Eyed Girl""), and adds electronic bongos, a dash of xylophone and light buzzing sounds hard-panned to the left and right. The subtly insistent pulse established by the small, electronic orchestra gives the piece a tropical edge even as the sounds suggest a piecemeal, post-apocalyptic Salvation Army setup. ""Treetops"" takes re-orchestrates that pulse with a ping-pong generator drum and distorted space bubbles. Throughout Creature Comforts, impressions of the jungle-- be they animal calls or tribal pound-- shape the soundscape. The end of ""Creature"" overflows with a wild, nocturnal frenzy using live percussion to accentuate the desperate, red-eyed cries of assorted robo-beasts jumping and flying about the mix. The 15-minute centerpiece ""Skeleton"" rises slowly, with a slightly warped guitar figure, looped over more jungle percussion and unidentifiable humming calls (a human voice?). Like much of the rest of Creature Comforts, ""Skeleton"" features a surprisingly small number of instrumental elements. Black Dice uses them in a way that not only takes advantage of their skill manipulating electronic sound, but also unifies the album's otherwise disparate segments. The piece glides through several sections of propulsive ambience, each morphing into the next, and when the hi-hat pitter-patter emerges from a collage of looped guitars, the effect is as if stepping out of the jungle into an oasis, even if only for a short moment. I probably shouldn't be surprised to hear such striking moments of clarity. Black Dice, living up to their track record of ever-diligent experimentation and the embrace of change, as well as a vibrant backdrop of New York pandemonium, have delivered one of this year's most interesting records and proved that you don't have to be noisy to make beautiful noise.","When No New York was issued in 1978, it should have been fair warning to anyone within earshot that punk ...

For Octavio Paz,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42d9d034d5c69bf2fd9/1:1/w_160/cf06d7c4.jpg,2004-06-20 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7201-for-octavio-paz/,Holy Mountain,"Six Organs of Admittance has always found peace in patience, even when that peace is meted out only after fingers have been jabbed in eyes or a bag of crazy pills emptied. With For Octavio Paz, single chair Organist Ben Chasny lingers on the path to redemption, but it's a quieter route this time out, and where it goes, there's neither electricity nor the need for human voices. The all-acoustic recording was originally released in late 2003 by Time-Lag as limited vinyl. Now released on CD, non-vinyl junkies are given the chance to hear Chasny emoting through his fingers. On Paz, he's discovered a handful of melodies in a rusty Hills Bros can, buried under the humus in a leafy green clearing. They still smell like coffee a little bit, but that aroma mixes with the smell of the woods, and carries them on humidity over the graves of caterpillars. After an introduction of sustaining notes and solemn bells, ""When You Finally Return"" establishes Paz's gentle, pastoral tone. The melody isn't direct; it hangs as smoke does in shafts of light. But with the aid of a few plucked overdubs and his own wordless vocal sighs (the only voice heard on the entire record), Chasny insistently and effectively molds both song and mood. The result sticks around like memories of summer evenings. ""Elk River"" is equally evocative, its sway somehow gorgeous and forlorn all at once. The cut's quiet pauses keep fooling you into thinking that the slide show is ending, but Chasny keeps coming back to tell another sad tale. ""They Fixed the Broken Windmill Today""-- its title alone an entire short story-- runs on a consistent whisper of nylon strings as deft, vaguely Eastern-tinged fills undulate over the low rumble like ribbons in a breeze. Though they vary from melancholy to warm memory in between notes, the emotions Chasny creates on For Octavio Paz are always stark and imagistic. The recording's first portion becomes a meditation in acts, with each track summoning some other piece of Chasny's skill as a player to speak without lines. But all of this is mere setup for the lengthy finale, a 28-minute one-man show of steel string poetics called ""The Acceptance of Absolute Negation"". It could be a soundtrack to a murder in the Badlands: Spiraling lead notes echo through a petrified forest as the deed is done, followed by a moment of solitary meditation. But mad from the heat and the smell of blood, the realization becomes sudden and painful, and there's nothing left to do but run. Notes tumble over one another, trying to put ground between them and the act. Things slow then to a pensive crawl. There's a pause, and then another section of contemplation. It's an incredible piece, ably and intently drawing on the album's spectrum of moods. This summer, ride the darker wave to a place of quiet light.","Six Organs of Admittance has always found peace in patience, even when that peace is meted out only after fingers ...

Fuckin A,The Thermals,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76713d19756521393ea/1:1/w_160/7add3923.jpg,2004-06-20 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7991-fuckin-a/,Sub Pop,"Every fit-throwing eight-year old left sobbing in front of a pet store window eventually hears the same defeatist speech: Puppies grow up into dogs, everything changes, eternal youth is bullshit, and cold, crappy maturity is the last unflappable truth. But it turns out that your mom was totally wrong: Portland's The Thermals have successfully flicked off all notions of inevitable evolution, eschewing presumed sophistication for dumb, youthful glee. 25 seconds into The Thermals' sophomore record, Fuckin A, shrieks of feedback fade into power chords, Hutch Henry begins lodging demands, and it becomes alarmingly clear that The Thermals' founding aesthetic-- grimy, lo-fi garage punk-- will endure eternally, a snarled, hyperactive, and unchanging homage to goofy basement tapes and kitchen acoustics. That Fuckin A was recorded by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla (who mastered the band's debut, 2001's More Parts Per Million) is strikingly apropos; The Thermals are not about reinvention, and Fuckin A is-- obviously-- not at all concerned with growing up, even on studio time. Mostly, Fuckin A is as stupidly (and gloriously) irreverent as its title, all adolescent three-chord slams and snotty, self-championing chants, a seamless extension of the urgency introduced on More Parts Per Million. But despite all their snark and self-repetition, The Thermals are still an immensely likable outfit; like a little brother demanding unconditional love, pulling down your pants and then begging for a dollar, The Thermals ingratiate themselves quickly and curiously, working against your most rational and justifiable complaints. It's not so much that the band sounds like kids (although sometimes, they sorta do), it's that they're brazenly and addictively self-confident, hopped up on spit and adrenaline, fueled by the rewards of their own dumb fun. Frontman Hutch Henry's nasal shouts are uncannily similar to Mountain Goat John Darnielle's, and while The Thermals' lyrics tend to skew a bit more simplistic (""It's our trip and/ And we're not listening.../ We won't flinch/ We don't give a shit""), Henry still wields Darnielle's brand of sharp, scrappy charm awfully well. That The Thermals are the direct descendents of twee-folk duo Hutch and Kathy can sometimes seem ridiculous, particularly given The Thermals' obvious proclivity for brash, anti-folk stomps, but the influence of their lineage becomes more evident the harder you listen-- tracks like ""God and Country"" admit The Thermals' appropriately desperate politics (""Pray for a new state/ Pray for assassination""), while ""Remember Today"" sees Henry adopt a Dylan-esque mix of sentimentality and weird humor (""Anything you can see/ You can probably feel/ Anyone far away/ You can probably charge at""). Fuckin A is a bit more political, a bit cleaner, and a bit less exuberant than its predecessor, but ultimately, the message is the same. That this is somehow more charming than irritating speaks directly to The Thermals' central prowess: beautiful indiscretion.","Every fit-throwing eight-year old left sobbing in front of a pet store window eventually hears the same defeatist speech: Puppies ...

Intimate Lightning,Neptune,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b971ea9e61561daa6fb9/1:1/w_160/daa828cd.gif,2004-06-20 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5901-intimate-lightning/,Mister,"If you were standing too close to them, you could have been severely injured. Neptune were crammed into the corner of Charlie's Kitchen in Cambridge, MA, ripping through a set of disgusting industrial post-punk, at once a tight, almost funky band and a piece of kinetic sculpture. Neptune aren't just another squad of noisy art-rockers-- they're a complete package, pulling up to venues in a psychedelic van painted with a giant merman (Neptune himself, one supposes), and emerging on stage (when the venue happens to have one) with unholy contraptions fashioned from scrap metal by guitarist/vocalist Jason Sidney Sanford. The drum sets are piles of oil cans, circular saw blades and assorted car parts, while the guitar and bass look more like medieval weaponry than traditional instruments. And that night in Charlie's Kitchen, after already being flattened by Tyondai Braxton's bracing solo set, Neptune bassist Mark William Pearson was swaying wildly back and forth, the jagged prongs that jutted from the neck of his scrap bass mere inches from flaying the intrepid souls standing at the front of the crowd. It was quite an introduction, and it nearly goes without saying that duplicating the intensity of a live performance like that on a record is a tough proposition at best. But on Intimate Lightning, the Boston band's third full-length, they almost manage it. The short review is that it sounds exactly like what you'd expect a band that plays their songs on scrap metal to sound like. The long review is a bit more complicated than that, but Neptune really do accurately approximate in their music the tragic and violent desolation of the auto graveyards from which they draw their raw materials. The fact that the guitar and bass are built from metal affects the timbre of the instruments, the bass sounding harsh, almost distorted, while the guitar rings with surprising clarity. Percussionists John Douglas Manson and Daniel Paul Boucher naturally sound like they're banging on archaic VCR casings, gutters and miter boxes, but they play their traps as though they were normal drum sets, with Boucher contributing occasional scrapings on a violinish contraption that's the most alien texture on the record. The cumulative effect of all this is a sound that's sort of familiar, but just off enough from a conventional arrangement to be disconcerting. The songs are tightly wound nailbombs of rapidly shifting meters, clanging rhythms, and mathtacular start/stop passages designed for maximum sensory damage. Sanford's vocals are secondary, it seems, to the grotesque clatter surrounding them-- he whispers and growls squarely in the middle of the mix, perfectly content to let the pummeling grooves overwhelm his Dadaist lyrics. As such, the songs have little overt melodic content, but pretty melodies and pop sensibility are clearly beside the point when you're working in the same destructive tradition as fellow New England weirdos Lightning Bolt and Zealous Fuel. It would be wrong to say that Neptune display a mastery of their craft, because in this context, the word ""dominance"" seems a lot more apropos than ""mastery."" Seriously, when the sick, militaristic groove of ""Automatic"" launches into its distorted reprise, there's no point in trying to resist; you just hunker down and let it roll over you like the sonic blitz it is. That night in Charlie's Kitchen, Neptune were more than dominant-- they were mesmerizing and seemingly omnipotent. Intimate Lightning can't compete with that, but it tries anyway, and it comes out brilliantly brutal for the effort.","If you were standing too close to them, you could have been severely injured.

Tapestry Mastery EP,Apes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0be5e6ef95969320011/1:1/w_160/a9df52c8.jpg,2004-06-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/219-tapestry-mastery-ep/,Birdman,"Rock concept albums are a dicey business. Rock operates on an intuitive, not intellectual, level-- it drives a shunt into your cerebral cortex, short-circuiting critical thinking, cogent analysis, and good judgment. Case in point: I am generally a rational person, and could tick off many a reason why dashing my body against a rock club's begrimed floor isn't a good idea. Yet, whenever some haircut gets on stage and starts just ripping it, my health concerns fly out the window and I'm transformed into something off a freak-show handbill: ""He writhes! He raves! He crawls on his belly like a snake!"" Rock creates a mental bypass via which its primitive, bodily allure goes screaming through the viscera, circumventing the anal little bean counters in the florescent-lit cubicles of the brain. Overblown concepts often, at best, distract, and at worst, annoy. The Apes know from concept records: The Tapestry Mastery EP is their fourth. They've devised a handy trick for avoiding the sense of missed-points and intellectual pretension that can plague concept albums: They make sure their conceit is completely fucking inscrutable, too loose and arcane to muck up an immediate and quite righteous Rock Experience with untoward contemplation. The result is felicitous: The concept remains too oblique to impinge on the exigencies of the music, yet provide it with a sort of endoskeleton, a subliminal structure that occurs to the listener not as a set of ordered facts, but as a lingering impression of internal unity. Tapestry Mastery revolves around the blind weaver Maximilla, who, in the introductory skit, is ordered by The Apes to ""focus your grotesquely developed sense of hearing on the following tales and capture them on your loom. You have twenty days and twenty nights. Get to it, fool."" So, wait, what tales? Are we to infer that Maximilla created the subsequent songs from tales we should assume were on the rest of the tape, or are the songs the tales that Maximilla must spin? And who the hell is she, anyway? If the concept is elucidated throughout the album, you'd never be able to tell through the layers of distortion slathered on the vocals. It seems as if it's more for The Apes' benefit than the listener's, but doesn't get in the way, and if it's an apparatus they require to write good songs, then I have no complaints. One has to admire The Apes for their consistency, having changed little over the course of their career. If there's been any perceptible evolution, it's a thickening, a movement toward the modern no-wave of bands like Lightning Bolt, The Locust, and Pink and Brown. The abrasiveness quotient is at an all-time high here, and overall, it's effective in the manner of the previously mentioned noise addicts, although this writer wouldn't have minded a bit more strategically positioned minimalism to cut through the prolonged blast of super-thick organs and augment the impact of the loud parts. While The Apes lack guitar, they've got this one organ sound that mimics a growling, overdriven axe with startling fidelity, and which, along with the deep waves of the low end, ballasts the mutant barrelhouse boogie. The title track surges in distinct movements beneath sweaty singing, with a pronounced loud/soft dynamic that's almost grunge. The frenetic ""Warp and Wolf"" opens with a brutal detonation that soon coheres into staticky, equalizer-flummoxing sheets of mangled organs arranged in punishing, psychedelic polyrhythms (think Oneida). This level of intensity is maintained throughout the rest of the EP: low elastic drones, busy atmospheres, a rich palette of sonic embellishments, oscillating frequencies and coagulated noise. At the end of ""Three Mages"", the skit-format of the intro makes a jarring reappearance, as Maximilla proclaims: ""And with this final stitch I have demonstrated my mastery over tapestries."" But has she? Ostensibly, a concept record fails if the concept isn't brought to closure and doesn't manifest clearly to the listener, which this one isn't and doesn't. But my ears are ringing. The little tufts of hair around them are a bit moist, starting to curl. There's a dull afterglow of adrenaline. Seems like success to me.","Rock concept albums are a dicey business.

Demo(n) Tracks,Vladislav Delay,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb79abf31b7dc7155acd/1:1/w_160/b7be78f5.jpg,2004-06-17 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2558-demon-tracks/,Huume,"""There are a million Kandinskys in the Mona Lisa, but no Mona Lisa in a single Kandinsky."" I forget who's responsible for this half-baked jingle, but the gist of it haunts me whenever I listen to such decidedly difficult albums as Vladislav Delay's Demo(n) Tracks, which the presently loved Finlander just released on his own label, Huume. Over the years, Delay has approached his work with a remarkable range of motives and nom de plumes-- from hazy deconstructive/reconstructive clicks-and-cuts dub as Vladislav Delay; to the absurdly slick but full-faced house as Luomo; to an almost perfect synthesis of these two extremes as Uusitalo and the basically channeled Sistol. Even in his least intelligible moments of experimentation, when the strict lines separating sound, rhythm and overall structure are blurred or disregarded, Delay generally manages the impression that there is at least some method to his madness, or some point to his conceit. There's an unspoken promise that, on any of his albums, Delay firstly has censored himself to a great extent, and secondly has carefully crafted all sounds, however random or disjointed they seem, to create one unified artistic statement in the end. And historically speaking, Delay consistently delivers in this respect, a simple fact that not only commands him high praise, but also an audience willing to work through his most demanding compositions. Particularly aimless albums like Entain or the Helsinki EP have always been (for me, at least) Delay's most difficult listens. From what I can gather, Delay intended some form-is-content/content-is-form aesthetic for these records that eschewed typical rhythmic and musical figures, and also the static textures and innocuous collages of sound that are ambient music. Initially, the purple haze and sharp bolts of silver noise that fill out Demo(n) Tracks will draw a few comparisons to Entain, but this is a far more abstruse release-- and in little time, frustratingly unrewarding. Unfortunately, there is no apparent internal logic at work within Demo(n) Tracks' 13 songs, and no discernible reason why the tracks are even split up as they are. There's no movement in ideas, no compelling expansions or collapses of sound, no set-ups or punchlines or Parthian shots. Some recourse to structure is a natural inclination even when improvising freely, but Delay seems to go out of his way to frustrate any remote chance of his passages being obedient to even their own scheme. Which may be the ""joke"" of Delay's album: At every turn, Demo(n) Tracks refuses even the slightest of human nature, in favor of a perfectly unstructured sound. ""You see, you were expecting the album to go somewhere-- but it never does! Hee-haw, avant-garde."" Apparently, Demo(n) Tracks may have been recorded while Delay was hunting ghosts in Berlin, but at most, he seems to have schlepped all the discarded sounds from his more successful projects (""Demonit"" is a Luomo goldmine) into a randomized play script, and hit the record button for an hour. The only time Delay seems to have something positive to do with Demo(n) Tracks is on the last track, ""Kainuu"": 50 minutes of lightning bolts finally amount to some sort of pulse, and Delay defers to beat and actual musical motion, even giving nylon-stringed alms to a temporary chord progression. There's not much expansion from this idea, but the relative excitement it provides this terribly languid album is appreciated.","""There are a million Kandinskys in the Mona Lisa, but no Mona Lisa in a single Kandinsky.""

Fire: The Arthur Brown Story,Arthur Brown,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4595e6ef9596932085a/1:1/w_160/d9caa9b4.jpg,2004-06-17 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1114-fire-the-arthur-brown-story/,Castle,"Exciting though it may be, the current trend towards reissuing and repackaging all-but-forgotten relics from music's past sometimes uncovers minor tragedies. Such is the case with pseudo-legendary psychedelic soul singer Arthur Brown, whose expansive output has been dubiously summarized on Fire: The Arthur Brown Story. Like many other singularly odd musicians, Brown encountered fleeting success, followed by an extended period of decline, neglect and experimentation. Many artists with similar career arcs have since received widespread acclaim as spurned innovators, but time has not been so kind to Brown. Much of Fire sounds painfully dated, and most of the more recent material included on the compilation is downright embarrassing. Though Brown's 1968 classic The Crazy World of Arthur Brown remains a sorely underappreciated bit of brilliantly twisted psychedelia, the bewildering selection of tracks here prevents Fire from successfully conveying the power of Brown's best work. Odds are, you've heard 1968's ""Fire"", a brilliant psych-soul epic that's made its way onto countless oldies radio stations and compilation CDs. ""Fire"", which was far and away Brown's most successful single (it shot to #2 on the U.S. charts), remains a fabulous song, equal parts profoundly creepy and unbelievably stupid. Musically, ""Fire"" perfectly frames Brown's wild, warbling vocals with an insistent bassline and prominent organ flourishes. ""Fanfare: Fire Poem"" covers similar ground, with Brown sing/speak/screaming a recounting of an insane acid trip over mutilated jazz noodling. ""Rest Cure"" explores a more subdued manifestation of Brown's early sound, with surprisingly skeletal strings backing more subtly delivered, Bowie-esque vocals. Unfortunately, not all of Brown's early material holds up so well. ""Give Him a Flower"" sounds straight off a Mr. Show sketch, with cookie cutter musical backing and dialogue so corny that Brown's real English accent starts to sound fake. And as Fire moves forward in time, things only get direr. Brown's penchant for the theatrical is part of what makes his early work so striking, but it occasionally runs amok on Fire, yielding some pretty awful results. ""The Gremlin (The Song Of)"", though excellent fodder for Halloween-themed mixes, features a synth arrangement that brings to mind Nintendo's second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, and lyrics that would make Current 93's David Tibet blush. Indeed, the musical extravagances of the 70s seem to have been seriously detrimental to Brown's work, resulting in cheesier arrangements and weaker songs. Of all the baffling inclusions on this 2xCD set, Brown's recent ballad ""Heartaches"" and an entirely pointless cover of ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"" take the cake. ""Heartaches"", with its cloying piano arrangement and Diane Warren-ish lyrics, immediately derails any emotion Brown's weathered and strange voice could possibly convey. Brown's 5\xBD-minute Dylan cover doesn't fare much better, coming off limp and lifeless in spite of a remarkably well-executed insect-like string arrangement. Though there's loads of questionable material on Fire, it's hard to know what songs apart from those on the classic Crazy World of Arthur Brown would be fit for inclusion here. After Brown reached his peak in 1968, the rest of his career consisted largely of well-intentioned but fruitless experiments, most of which now sounds dated and silly. But the enthusiasm and utter lack of shame with Arthur Brown approaches his music is part of what makes Fire an intriguing, and ultimately rather depressing listen. The Crazy World of Arthur Brown holds up much, much better as evidence that it is not the novelty of Brown's story or situation, but rather the uniqueness of his delivery and approach, that makes him such a compelling figure of 60s psych-rock.","Exciting though it may be, the current trend towards reissuing and repackaging all-but-forgotten relics\n\ from music's past sometimes ...

History EP,Controller.Controller,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70c13d197565213930e/1:1/w_160/219d1e83.gif,2004-06-17 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1768-history-ep/,Paper Bag,"A friend of mine once argued to me that the only two popular musical acts of the 20th century who will be remembered in 500 years are Bob Dylan and The Beatles. At the time, I was pretty sure this was bullshit, and today, I'm absolutely positive that it's bullshit. Maybe it's just the 40-reissues-a-week release schedule of the moment that has me confident that at least a healthy cross-section of the 20th century's musical output will be remembered in the 26th century, provided we're still around then, but I also think the current state of technology mandates that much of it will survive. We're approaching a point even now where the storage media for art are nearly invisible, and with that kind of capacity for information, there's no reason some kids in the very distant future shouldn't be able to start a band that some future critic will label a ""cross between Sonny Sharrock, Pere Ubu and Wyld Stallions."" Of course, it's hard to imagine how anything will sound original in the 26th century, given the fact that it's hard enough these days to escape the dense history of pop music short of growing up in Antarctica and doing all of your writing and recording in a corrugated shed on the Ross Ice Shelf. Toronto-based Controller.Controller, however, do manage to bear the weight of a good many influences in their sound, most of which can be pinned to the years 1977-1983. And if you're sick of hearing about new music that owes a debt to the post-punk era, hear me out for a couple of 'graphs, because Controller.Controller may fit conveniently in the dancepunk mold, but there's a whole lot more to them than just dance-minded rhythm. For one thing, they have Nirmala Basnayake, who spices her vocals with pinches of Debbie Harry and David Byrne while delivering some truly excellent melodies. She's backed in this endeavor by four gentlemen who know how to ride and manipulate a groove for maximum effect. Drummer Jeff Scheven is a human metronome, throwing down whip-crack pulse beats that always revolve around a four-on-the-floor center for his bandmates to dress up with all manner of rhythmic and melodic flourishes. Guitarists Colwyn Llewellyn-Thomas and Scott Kaija fence with laser-tones leads, distort for vicious stuttering breaks and mine that delicious Nile Rodgers pocket for the sake of the dancefloor, while bassist Ronnie Morris locks in with Scheven with clean, melodic lines. The opening title track states the band's intentions to move you in every way possible with copious hi-hat, scratchy, clean-toned guitar chords and Basnayake's Byrne-ish sing/speak admonitions, ""You need to make corrections/ You need to pay attention."" And that's just one of the nearly constant highlights as the band grooves through a half-hour of sharply honed post-disco, shuddering through the frenetic and dramatic chord changes and buildups of ""Silent Seven"", and slipping on the viscous rhythms of ""Disco Blackout"". Controller.Controller have pulled together a deftly funky debut, as full of thoughtful songcraft as pure kinetic energy. And that's really what separates History from the dance-rock pack-- it's not just something to sweat to, it's something to sing along to, and something to come back to.","A friend of mine once argued to me that the only two popular musical acts of the 20th century who ...

Obedience Cuts,Hair Police,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c15bc0084474cd0c3312/1:1/w_160/6e59c71a.gif,2004-06-17 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3983-obedience-cuts/,Freedom From,"There are probably numerous reasons-- bloody foreign policies, the jock's need for extremism, urban and suburban decay, small-town ennui-- but whatever's behind the ascension, cathartic post-hardcore noise has, in the past couple of years, careened a bit towards the mainstream. Surely these feedbacking subtexts and threadbare codes will bat nary an eye amid commercial radio pablum or earn even sub-sub-par digitalis at Billboard, but still, the crunk of wires and modulators slouches towards greater recognition: Wolf Eyes have become the most raucous act on the big-time Sub Pop roster, suburban teens sport spankin' new CBGB's tees at Lightning Bolt & Black Dice & Locust throwdowns, Carlos Giffoni's three-day No Fun festival was pleasantly packed with folks boogying along with To Live and Shave in L.A. like they were Outkast, and now Hair Police are taking their slash-and-burn to the Solar Stage at Lollapalooza. These are baby steps one and all, but allow ye olde timers a flashback to more than a decade of spectacularly unattended shows by Harry Pussy, Pengo, Blowhole, Shadow Ring, Borbetomagus, Climax Golden Twins, or Noggin and the attention bespeaks a full-on revolution. Hair Police formed in Lexington, KY 2001; Obedience Cuts, their first full-length since 2002's Blow Out Your Blood, features guitarist and vocalist Mike Connelly at the helm, Robert Beatty on electronics, and Trevor Tremaine pounding drums and tapes. For this particularly mesmerizing effort they say they're ""chronicling the relationship between inside/outside and signaling a call to arms for the GNARLY TIMES."" I'm not entirely sure about that platform, but there's certainly something bubbling within the album's violently ecstatic nine tracks. Obedience Cuts wrangles and wrestles with carcinogens and pops sonic blisters, festering a la Aaron Dilloway's solo Wolf Eyes' jaunts, soundtracks for the decomposition of vermin; throughout, the percussion's intense, the sounds ring and shatter. There are less Negative Approach scowls than the lupine Ann Arbor supergroup, but Connelly offers how own paranormal howls on the unforgiving monster mash ""Boneless"", and Spencer Yeh of Burning Star Core Death Beam on hellfire violin. Elsewhere, Connelly transforms himself into a possessed and baying hound, informed by the Jesus Lizard's back catalog, on the absolutely searing percussive spin-cycle ""Open Body"". Innards receive a lot of lip here, both in title and all-out musical evisceration. The facile Wolf Eyes comparison isn't to say this is a mere simulation. You could as easily namedrop a less groove-oriented Throbbing Gristle, Cock ESP, and extra especially, an organic rock 'n' roll take on Whitehouse. The overdriven opener, ""Let's See Who's Here and Who's Not"", is a spastic roll call built upon instrumental crescendo sandwiches and distorted howls and yelps. On a more mellow tip, ""The Empty Socket"" is a sweaty gong shower scene, complete with a dose of hacking and choking on what I imagine to be bloody meat stew. From the drowned (and somehow peaceful) rodent on the cover to the explosive product, Obedience Cuts solicits a well-paced ebb and flow. The album doesn't tire or lag; it ends up nicely clipped and even danceable (for the mad) at points. Released on CD by the Minneapolis' label Freedom From it's also available also on LP via Gods of Tundra in an edition of 500 copies with a silkscreened chipboard foldover cover. (Noise has always been so collectible.) For those with extra ducats, there are also upcoming releases on Hanson (including a DVD), Hospital Productions, and Liquid Death/Hello. But, to bring the initial comparison full circle and to come to a typical refrain with this sort of kudzu-vine growth pattern, Hair Police might not have as many releases as Wolf Eyes, but it's safe to say they're catching up, and Obedience Cuts is a more than adequate spot to start your vision quest.

Fishtown Briefcase EP,Trouble with Sweeney,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87cea9e61561daa5825/1:1/w_160/589bb78d.jpg,2004-06-16 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8260-fishtown-briefcase-ep/,Burnt Toast Vinyl,"Scanning the tracklist of The Trouble with Sweeney's new EP, Fishtown Briefcase, is particularly instructive: Three of the six songs have proper names in or as their titles, suggesting that they are about real people and actual relationships. Hell, the Philadelphia band is even named for its singer and songwriter, Joey ""Jojo"" Sweeney, who mixes autobiography and fiction against the group's 70s-inflected indie pop, resourceful-- and unabashed-- enough to digress into an E Street interlude or an AM-rock guitar coda. Fishtown Briefcase (the title refers to a 24-pack of beer with a handle) features songs as character sketches, exploring how people think and act as well as what they mean specifically to Sweeney. For example, the lead-off track, ""Evelyn Rochman"", recalls a Tadpole-style hook-up between a high school-age Sweeney and the title character, who is ""my dad's wife's friend/ And in our ages there's a difference of ten."" But ""as the Penguin Café Orchestra plays low,"" she regales him with tales of Richard Hell and introduces him to both The Modern Lovers and modern love. Regardless of whether Evelyn is real or invented, Sweeney lets her craft his own coming-of-age, both musical and otherwise, while nicely understating the bittersweet brevity of their relationship. Four songs into Fishtown Briefcase, ""(A Girl Called) Young Song"" finds Sweeney several years older and not nearly as hopeful, confronting another woman from his past. He sees Young Song, apparently an old friend of an old friend, ""dancing on the tabletop in the backroom at the Love Lounge."" But he can't join her fun, and ""I've got nothing important in my life tonight"" is the best he can come up with in the way of a pick-up line. Even on the songs that aren't named after people, he still focuses on character. On ""The City Let Me"", Sweeney considers a particular city's effect on his musical development and claims he ""got so sick of indie rock/ 'Cause it sounds so white and privileged/ And man, privilege is just another drag."" This from a man playing well-groomed, Pavement-descended indie rock himself. What keeps a statement like that from being damningly hypocritical is Sweeney's unreliability as a narrator: His songwriting approach ostensibly focuses on other people as a way to get outside himself, but actually, people like Young Song and Evelyn Rochman are merely a means for Sweeney to get back into himself. While he doesn't always seem to be aware of this, he makes it perfectly clear for the listener: These people are his mirror. As a result songs like ""The Amazing Malcolm Smith (And His Off-Roading Motorcycle)"" and the cover of Wings' ""Listen to What the Man Said""-- which are about celebrities as opposed to Sweeney's personal acquaintances-- don't reflect quite so much, and the lovely specificity of his lyrics dulls just a bit. ""The Amazing Malcolm Smith"" delves into the homoeroticism between the titular stuntman and his Steve McQueen with a few innuendos like, ""Don't you be afraid of bareback riding."" While Sweeney never plays the material for laffs, the song still sounds a bit lightweight sandwiched between ""The City Let Me"" and ""Young Song"". The final track, a don't-go-to-bed-angry ballad called ""I Hope Your Sleep Is Dreamless"", throws the previous five tracks into sharp relief, hinting that the people we're closest to are the ones we know the least. The lover, whether a man or woman, is never named, and the magnitude of their troubles is only implied, but the na-na-na's at the end don't sound like a real catharsis as much as like the unquenchable hope for one in the morning.","Scanning the tracklist of The Trouble with Sweeney's new EP, Fishtown Briefcase, is particularly\n\ instructive: Three of the ...

Live!: In Tune and On Time,DJ Shadow,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9caeb335119a49ec87f/1:1/w_160/0aefafbe.jpg,2004-06-16 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2376-live-in-tune-and-on-time/,Geffen,"The live DJ/producer performance is always a dicey proposition. More than once my attention has left the building during a marathon set that didn't stray from pure, well-oiled precision. I'm not an aspiring DJ or a sample-minded trainspotter, so the actual technique behind the music, though initially novel, doesn't keep me absorbed for long. What I look for from a DJ (and rarely receive) is a one-man show that builds tension and offers resolution, a dynamic process similar to that of a strong, inspired band. Moving asses on the dance floor and scoring points for proficiency are certainly admirable accomplishments, but by no means impossible, or even unusual; any serious musician should be able to do both. But to really inspire emotion, to resonate powerfully and universally, to make people connect and feel something-- those are the pinnacles of live performance. And when a single DJ-- the modern embodiment of composer, conductor, and soloist-- does it all before your eyes, the sense of perfect musical destiny is palpable. In the past, Shadow's club shows have been of a good-not-great caliber, since, no matter how talented the DJ, it's tough to really kick shit up onstage just standing at a turntable. So, taking that working DJ's bane to heart, Shadow enlisted Bay Area projection wizard Ben Stokes to step up the visual element of his 2002 world tour, and was apparently impressed enough with the result that he produced this DVD as a permanent document (packaged with an audio version on CD), which (mostly) captures the second evening of a two-night run at London's Brixton Academy. Even after Shadow ""demystifies"" his creative tools, pointing out his inventory (two Technics 1200s, two CDJs and a sampler/sequencer) in a monotone monologue intro, it's still nearly impossible to determine how he smoothly wrangles so many layers of sound. The show moves through five movements and an encore, each blending tracks from Shadow's entire catalog, creating something like a remixed symphony that ebbs and flows, rises and falls, with rigorous attention paid to dynamics. Shadow states in this release's liner notes that his prior live efforts ""only really got interesting when the songs were not only on time but in tune as well."" Here, along with the visual backdrops that accompany the songs on three large screens, the segues and arrangements that link them become a crucial part of the concert experience. With the exception of a brief lull midway through the set, Shadow emerges totally successful. He even encourages the crowd early on to consider the mostly downtempo performance as a ""late night movie."" The narrative imagery that appears during ""Building Steam with a Grain of Salt"" and graceful, street-level driving shots that accompany ""What Does Your Soul Look Like (Part 2)"", both from Endtroducing..., give an epic, storybook feel to these already dramatic numbers. When Shadow twists the Richard Ashcroft vocals on ""Lonely Soul"" into ""Lost & Found"", Stokes offers an abstract, swirling background that matches the songs' spiraling rhythms. During the profound ""You Can't Go Home Again"" encore, city scenes blend into windswept beaches, mirroring the song's moody, bittersweet grandeur. As the film cuts through multiple angles, we get the up-close DJ handcam as well an overhead, full array cam that reveals a massive tangle of music equipment that, from this distance, wouldn't appear out of place in a 747 cockpit. All the while, Shadow's own post-production makes use of split-screen panels and overlapping to offer the home viewer visual effects to which the head-nodding punters in London weren't privy. In ways, it's almost damaging for this set to be this stunning, as it could too greatly heighten expectations for Shadow's future shows. Then again, if he's capable of living up to it on upcoming tours, his may well go down as the greatest show in turntablism.","The live DJ/producer performance is always a dicey proposition.

Lost Notes from Forgotten Songs,Six Parts Seven,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a432ea9e61561daa4e52/1:1/w_160/22ca2e85.jpg,2004-06-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7206-lost-notes-from-forgotten-songs/,Suicide Squeeze,"Here's an intriguing idea: You're a mostly instrumental indie rock band that's been slaving under the radar for years, respected by a few critics and beloved by a small cadre of fans. Either out of boredom, commercial desperation, creative whimsy, or whatever, you invite several of your musical cohorts-- some very well known, others relatively obscure-- and ask them to remix and reinterpret some of your tracks and add their own distinctive words and voices. You then release it as part career retrospective, part self-tribute album, part remix album, part self-reinvention, part out-there musical experimentation. That's the concept behind The Six Parts Seven's new album, Lost Notes from Forgotten Songs, which features artists like Iron & Wine's Sam Beam, Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock, Centro-Matic's Will Johnson, and Pall Jenkins of The Black Heart Procession reworking and remaking songs mostly from The Six Parts Seven's album Things Shaped in Passing. On paper, it all sounds at the very least interesting, and for the most part, the album offers a bizarro-world refraction of the band's quiet, contemplative instrumental art-rock. Even more compelling than the idea, however, is how it plays out-- namely, the absence of a discernible formula or pattern from song to song. For instance, a track's effectiveness is not tied to its length. Sam Beam's sparkling ""Sleeping Diagonally"" is not quite 2\xBD minutes long, but that's all it takes for him to claim the song as his own. Conversely, Brian Straw's ""Now Like Photographs"" is epic in comparison, approximately five times longer, and his dark, desperate vocals make a perfect counterpart to the binary code banjos that fill the six-minute coda. A carefully crafted song like Isaac Brock's slow-to-still ""From California to Houston, on Lightspeed"" can work well against The Six Parts Seven's free-floating sound, but not always, as Pedro the Lion frontman Dave Bazan's ""A Blueprint of Something Never Finished"" flatly proves. On the other hand, some songs sound impromptu, as if their singers made them up on the spot. This approach lends tracks like Will Johnson's ""Song of Impossible Things"" a fragile urgency, but a few, like Pall Jenkins' ""Seems Like Most Everything Used to Be Something Else"", don't lead anywhere at all, finishing at about the same place they started. Katie Eastburn is the only singer who purposefully tries to break the subdued mood-- apropos of nothing, she literally screams her vocals on ""Cold Things Never Catch Fire"". Not that she has to maintain any specific atmosphere or approach, but her wailing vents no steam and communicates no emotion, striking instead as tackily self-indulgent. If The Six Parts Seven routinely emphasize the patient development of musical ideas and the interplay between instruments over traditionally structured songs, this album steers them into newer territory. Still, with the emphasis on the voices and not the sounds, on personalities but not on lyrics, Lost Notes from Forgotten Songs sounds more like a hodgepodge mixtape than a cohesive album.","Here's an intriguing idea: You're a mostly instrumental indie rock band that's been slaving under the radar ...

Slaves' Graves and Ballads,Dirty Projectors,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb60c0084474cd0c2840/1:1/w_160/9b1e4764.jpg,2004-06-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2535-slaves-graves-and-ballads/,Western Vinyl,"A popular theory among conspiracy theorists lately is that the Bush Administration's campaign in Iraq isn't a grab for oil or a grab for history, but rather an attempt at creating a so-called manageable chaos in the Middle East. It's hardly an unprecedented idea: By propping up a flimsy, illegitimate regime beholden to foreign interests, Iraq will mire in an insurrectionary climate, and our country will gain the justification it needs to continue its interference in the region. The paradox, of course, is that chaos, by definition, is highly unmanageable; inevitably, the contradiction doesn't always pan out, and ours is looking more and more like such a case. If manageable chaos is what Bush and his cabal were angling for, they'd have been wise to take a page from The Dirty Projectors, whose songs consistently threaten to implode under the weight of their own ambitions, yet always manage to hold it together. Slaves' Graves and Ballads effortlessly executes a seemingly incoherent, unilateral agenda: Sole-songwriter Dave Longstreth is autodidactic minstrel who occasionally seems to be winging it. Luckily, The Dirty Projectors trade in theatrical folk, not the theater of war; the stakes are relatively low, and these 14 songs derive much of their sophistication from a calculated lack of order. Slaves' Graves and Ballads is the harmonious wedding of two prior EPs released separately earlier this year. The albums are less complementary than they are starkly juxtaposed. The divergent A-side/B-side architecture provides a tidy stylistic contrast, as the ornate orchestration of the album's first half gives way to the demure acousticism of its back end. The record explores several naturally obscure reference points, resembling by turns Stars Like Fleas' shadowy epic Sun Lights Down the Fence, Devendra Banhart's indolent folk, and a Gilbert & Sullivan opera. Throughout the record's first seven tracks, Longstreth is accompanied by the ten-piece First Orchestral Society for the Preservation of the Orchestra, a chamber music collective assembled by Longstreth himself. Fortunately, the panoply of classic instruments-- a readily bastardizable commodity-- isn't used as a convenient way to feign sophistication, but instead as a formidable melodic foundation. From the mesmeric marimba ostinato that inaugurates ""Somberly, Kimberly"", Slaves' Graves manages to avoid the cloying bravura typically implicit in orchestral pop music. ""On the Beach"", an easy standout, makes sly intimations at a central melody, introducing several motifs that come in and out of focus throughout the ensuing six tracks. Generally, Longstreth is left to wander alone, leaving windswept salvos adrift over the orchestra's somber ruminations. His lyrics are unfailingly clever, turning pliable platitudes into weightier fodder. On the unassuming closer ""Since I Opened"" he intones, ""When I start to feel this way/ I can only wonder/ What is this weather I'm under?"" Elsewhere, he takes potshots at mundane scenes of modern degradation, sing/speaking, ""The souped-up Honda is stalled in traffic on the roadside, burping their subwoof like a council of bullfrogs."" Slaves' Graves is slathered in macabre imagery and dank timbres, but Longstreth's sultry drawl is dependably soothing and remarkably fluid. As dour and gray as the record may occasionally get, it's impossible to be sullen by music so boundlessly visceral. The ominous war drums behind ""Grandfather's Hanging"" do little to undercut the frail beauty of Longstreth's ambling vocals. Such unlikely triumph is par for course. After the dulcet string and clarinet swells of ""Hazard Lights (Reprise)"" the album abruptly segues into the spare strumming of ""A Labour More Restful"", initiating Slaves' subdued second half. Longstreth's dainty guitar playing, previously hidden, is born forth, assuming a lead melodic role for the rest of the record. ""Because Your Light Turns Green"" features some surprisingly dexterous licks, recalling erstwhile noodlers John Fahey and Vini Reilly. The scaled-back, nocturnal second set is a refreshing but appropriate contrast to the heady arrangements of the opening act. Confused, incohesive and utterly lonely, Slaves' Graves and Ballads finds solace in its sadness. If only the Bush Administration were so gentle.","A popular theory among conspiracy theorists lately is that the Bush Administration's campaign in Iraq isn't a grab ...

Your Voice Repeating,namelessnumberheadman,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b970c0084474cd0c25ef/1:1/w_160/e58861c0.gif,2004-06-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5900-your-voice-repeating/,Record Machine,"In concert, Namelessnumberheadman are a frightening jumble of keyboards and samplers; cords snake to and from a formidable onstage mixing board. With the exception of the often-singing drummer, the musicians are almost comically de-emphasized, moving between instruments in precise yet panicky little dashes. It all looks less like a science lab than like a low-budget set of one, complete with slightly overacting extras. Given this visual and the band's off-putting moniker (it's a reference to Steven Soderbergh's Schizopolis, if you must know, but then you mustn't), you might expect Namelessnumberheadman to play something profoundly anal-retentive, like microhouse. You certainly wouldn't be prepared for distinctly Western vocal harmonies of ""Going to Breathe Again"", the laid-back verses of ""Every Fiber"", or the Nick Drake strum that opens ""Mid-Continent"". For all the considerable studio trickery on display throughout NNHM's second album, its primary instrument is the acoustic guitar and its primary mood sweetly elegiac. Your Voice Repeating is by no means a folk album crusted over with itchy-scratchy production. It is, like Suzanne Vega's *99.9\xBA F (and not much else), a completely natural union of ""organic"" (guitar, porch) and ""mechanical"" (bedroom, headphones, ACID 4.0) approaches to songwriting-- each informing, mocking and correcting the other along the way. A perfect example of the resulting tension is an instrumental track titled, well, ""Tension Envelopes"". This is a trance title if there ever was one, and for a minute it seems as if things are heading in that direction, albeit with added twang. Over a sampled kick counting eighths, a six-beat-long guitar loop shimmers, shifting hypnotically against the beat. The song then builds to the shaggy-dog version of your classic dancefloor crescendo (beats, riffs, keys pile up like an unattended * Tetris game)-- only to resolve, three minutes in, into a languid concerto of mewling slide guitars. Another stunner, ""Going to Breathe Again"", opens with a tinny breakbeat, tosses up one exquisitely sculpted guitar verse reminiscent of The Shins in both sound and quality, and ends on a surprise compromise between the two. Following this level of sophistication, it's hard to go back to, say, The Postal Service, or any other band that dresses up verse/chorus/verse structures in IDM drag and calls its job done. NNHM's songs have a tendency to melt around our ears. ""Woke Up to Find"" is a Moebius strip of a ballad living inside its own ambient intro: A simple main melody is clearly forthcoming-- almost present-- but never quite pulls itself into focus. Elsewhere, a perfect-pop verse disappears suddenly in a swirl of elements, swallowed up by the very organs and chimes that made it pleasant to begin with. The real wonder is that there's not a jarring turn on the album: All transitions seem to heed their own dreamlogic. Mutations are often subtle and gradual. My uneducated guess about Namelessnumberheadman's production methods is that they sample tidbits of their songs in real time, proceed to digitally twist them into abstraction, then un-twist back. What results is a weirdly humanistic, highly accessible approach to experimental electronics. Your Voice Repeating is an album shot through with digital pulses, yet there's not a single moment where you don't feel the hand on the button. Namelessnumberheadman succeed in creating a technocratic pasture where machines are given souls but don't turn on their masters. The album's title, and a short song that contains it, spell out the band's manifesto better than I could: Your voice, even put through the rude mechanics of repetition, is still your voice.","In concert, Namelessnumberheadman are a frightening jumble of keyboards and samplers; cords snake to and\n\ from a formidable onstage ...

Last Exit,Junior Boys,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3a5e6ef95969322b75/1:1/w_160/4af4fc66.jpg,2004-06-15 05:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4340-last-exit/,Kin,"These days I tend not to ""root"" for many musicians, to pledge loyalty to an artist I loved when we both were young, or circle album release dates or try to anticipate when a record will leak. More often than not, I instead brace myself for disappointment-- even from those whose work I most cherish. It's a pessimistic and potentially sad approach, but one that unfortunately seems to cushion blows more often than result in pleasant surprises. With the debut full-length from Junior Boys, I let my guard down. After two EPs of glacial, silken electro-pop (2003's Birthday and this year's High Come Down), I just flat-out wanted more. Thankfully, I got it. Last Exit may be my anti-A Grand Don't Come for Free-- a little album I waited for with open arms rather than gritted teeth-- but its heights eclipse virtually all other music I've heard this year. The (to date) quiet rise of the Junior Boys is well-documented in the virtual world of the blogosphere, which for the most part has gone totally bonkers for the Ontario trio. Over the past year, the rapturous praise has been so constant that listing off the band's generous number of touchstones has practically become sport. Tellingly, though, for every time someone says Junior Boys sound like Timbaland goes for New Pop, an amorous two-step trying to coax indie-pop onto the dancefloor, or David Sylvian rummaging through Martin Fry's wardrobe and Basic Channel's outtakes, that person is only telling a part of the tale. More often than not, Junior Boys capture the mood and feel of many of these artists rather than ape their sounds. In fact, each of this record's 10 deceptively simple and very approachable tracks carry the distinct fingerprints of lead songwriter and singer Jeremy Greenspan, who manages to fold elements of nearly a quarter-century of forward-looking pop into a distinct sound without sounding either conceptual or trading on contradictions or the smoke-and-mirrors of attention-grabbing eclecticism. Four of the album's tracks-- ""Birthday"", ""Last Exit"", ""High Come Down"", and ""Under the Sun""-- were first released on last year's EPs and sit nicely alongside the new songs. Thankfully, Junior Boys are neither shying away from what they do best because of the success of those singles, nor failing in an attempt to reach those same heights. Among the new songs, ""Teach Me How to Fight"" is anthemic Sophistipop, a shrinking violet rallying cry; the nocturnal orchestral maneuvers of ""Three Words"" delicately flicker beneath ""Neon Lights""; and ""Bellona"" flutters and clicks as Greenspan laments long days and lost opportunities. So, yes, despite the high dance IQ and its luxuriously monochromatic sensuality, the record does seem very... indie. On ""Teach Me"", Greenspan is requesting to ""show me what it's like to give back pain,"" as his paper-thin voice projects honesty, vulnerability and the puppy-dog loyalty of sentimental, pale-skinned boys. So thankfully that's the fey, Anglocentric early 80s sense of the phrase ""indie,"" then, albeit dressed up with graceful, hopeful romanticism rather than self-deprecating fatalism. At times, that sense of hope seems buried under throbbing beats or kept at arm's length by cold, pristine sonics, but dip your toes beneath that sleek surface and you'll find an album of great warmth, beauty and even soul.","These days I tend not to ""root"" for many musicians, to pledge loyalty to an artist I loved when we ...

Long Gone Before Daylight,The Cardigans,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a523ea9e61561daa507b/1:1/w_160/28355dfd.jpg,2004-06-15 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1305-long-gone-before-daylight/,Koch,"Being faced with the unattainability of Nina Persson's smoldering good looks is enough to send an adolescent into a stomach-wrenching depression of unrequited love, dejection and self-loathing. A descent into an abyss of Leonard Cohen, The Smiths and penning terrible poetry is the only refuge against the taunting pop-perfection embodied in this cute Swedish chanteuse. You'd sweep your cumbersome, floppy fringe to one side in disbelief if someone told you what a tortured existence the one-time queen of bubbly European indie-pop really leads. And a listen to The Cardigans' latest record in all its po-faced bitterness will have you scratching your head in confusion at the seeming paradox of the polished direction the rest of the band have taken contrasted with Persson's world-weary laments. Peter Svensson and Magnus Sveningsson formed The Cardigans back in 1993, enlisting untrained vocalist Nina Persson after playing hardcore for years-- inspired by a joint passion for heavy-metal music. Long Gone Before Daylight shows that classic rock runs in their blood, despite an inauguration of kitschy indie releases including 1995's acclaimed Life. The follow-ups-- 1996's First Band on the Moon and 1998's Gran Turismo-- showed attitude and poise respectively, but this new album is less experimental musically. The ""woah-oh-oh-oh""'s and solid opening riff of ""A Good Horse"" recall 80s soft-rock a la Jon Bon Jovi as Persson's voice cracks, layering the hyperbole thus: ""These are the promises I can keep/ To live like I must/ And ride with the dust in my face/ In Grace."" Equally anthemic and overstated is the gratuitous reverb and echoes that saturate the epitomic pop of ""You're the Storm"". Perhaps the 2003 A-Camp project with Sparklehorse frontman Mark Linkous was supposed to be a kind of misery summer-camp for Persson to vent her unlucky-in-love frustrations. Despite those murkier exercises, this release sees The Cardigans trawling through lost-love, damaging relationships and substance abuse. With these downbeat themes, it's hardly surprising that several tracks bear a New Country-esque twang as on the opener ""Communication"". The trebly guitar riffing and thin strings combine with soaring harmonies to position the track closer to Nashville than Jonkoping, Sweden. In ""Please Sister"", when Persson wails, ""Oh, sweet mama, please just send me a man,"" is that a Tennessee drawl stretching ""man"" through several syllables? It has long been the business of the most mainstream pop to enlist several maxims to connect with an audience where more ""serious"" artists might induce more original musings. The Cardigans have a respectable history of insightful songwriting which excuses the clichéd concerns here as perhaps pop-revision or at least a knowing tribute. ""For What It's Worth"" and ""Couldn't Care Less"" are rife with hooks and juxtapositions straight out of Stock, Aitken & Waterman's hit factory, while retaining a bitter, mature edge that separates the Swedish five-piece from less substantial popsters. Persson's singing departs from her contained and clear intonation to hint at cute and rough in turn, while never testing her range or ability. The production also takes few risks, keeping the instrumentation tight and compressing and polishing the mix almost oppressively. Where the personality of the immensely talented band used to vibrate with energy, here they too often languish complacently in a radio-friendly sibilance. That this is the least idiosyncratic sound they have achieved is at odds with some of the darker musing in Persson's lyrics. The record's best track, ""And Then You Kissed Me"", treads the by-now-familiar bittersweet relationship ponderings that constitute the bulk of this record's concerns. However, amidst sharp observations and clever wordplay, there are darker implications to lines like, ""Blue blue, black and blue/ Red blood sticks like glue/ True love is cruel love."" ""Feathers and Down"" seems to entail alcoholism whereas ""the little holes in your veins"" (""Communication"") could be interpreted to allude to stronger poisons. The Cardigans are an entirely different band from their initiation, and perhaps this is the way it should be. Desire to explore new territories gives greater satisfaction and a constant attempt to defy expectations usually wrings some new invention from an aging band. Lucky U.S. purchasers get hold the bonus tracks ""Hold Me"" and ""If There Is a Chance"", as well as the limited edition DVD of the videos for ""For What It's Worth"" and ""You're the Storm"". The European and more notably Japanese audiences do not collect these goodies. As these are audiences already well and truly won over this could be seen cynically as a subtle bribe, but one glance at the lovely Nina and you'll forgive the backhander. Seemingly unwilling to sever its pretty head-- infected with melancholy as it is-- the body of the band twitches unfettered with their slickest and most formulaic pop constructions to date. It's unfortunate that honing and polishing a certain pop style to perfection has squeezed some of the life from the group. There's nothing so catchy as 1996's hit single ""Lovefool"" here, nor is there anything as pretty and wry as Life's opener, ""Carnival""-- just a collection of solid, personal pop songs, no more.","Being faced with the unattainability of Nina Persson's smoldering good looks is enough to send an adolescent\n\ into ...

Oh, mademoiselle, I am sure you have never heard anything like them-- they are one of a kind. Let me bring you some baguettes and I will tell you all about them. Ah, yes, I brought some olive paste for you, too. Can you hear that? I had Richard put it in the jukebox for us, yes? Oh, ma'moiselle, I spent many years playing the accordion until the terrible accident, and when I first heard them and was healed! What's that? Oh, the accident... ma'moiselle, I don't much like to discuss it, but I can see by the light in your eyes that you simply must know. Very well, I am unable to resist such beauty. It was on my 18th birthday and I had just won the Accordion Medal of Harmony for the provence. It was my moment of triumph, my moment to spit in the faces of the infidels that laughed at me when I sat on my doorstep and played my accordion instead of playing ball. That night, I took in a beautiful feast held at the finest restaurant in the provence. All of my old friends and many new ones were there and shared in my happiness. There was drink and song and it was an incredible night! I met a beautiful girl there, and in my flush I kissed her! Yes, it was brash, some might say impertinent, but when one is drunk on life and wine, one rarely thinks of these things, yes? I kissed her again and again, our ardour growing, until she led me to her loft and I made beautiful love to her! Ah, such wistful eyes she had. Suddenly, what seemed like moments after I drifted to sleep in her arms, I heard a thunderclap crack and felt the most intense pain in my key-hand that made me grow feint. A man, a man that I later learned was my sweetheart's elder brother, was holding a silver urn in his hands and driving it down on my fingers. Oh, the pain! I've grown faint now just telling you of it! The doctor cared for my hand as if it were his own, but I shall never play the accordion again. All was lost for me until I first heard them. Everything I heard before was as a single forgotten note before them. Their music made me accept the loss of my own music, my sorrow is their sorrow. I hear the drums being brushed, the warm piano, and the love of music can return in my soul without the pain of never baing able to make it again. What do you think of his voice? Oh yes, it's like molasses, maple syrup, thick fog, a rich sauce, so many good things. Their music has sorrow and dignity, together like so few others. Yes, listen. Though they remain great, this particular record is a soundtrack for a film! Could you guess that? No! Why? Yes, you're right, few soundtracks these days are so delicate, so nuanced and stylish. Yes, the whole thing is merely them. Is that a small thing? I don't think so. Coffee is small, yes, but complex, bold and big, yes both small and big. I know you understand. So many of the cafes have changed. They play that insignificant pop music and forget where they come from! Children crying about their problems! Disgusting, I say! Listen-- this song was the first song I ever heard. It was also on their second record. It's called ""Tiny Tears."" Ah, such feeling. Sincerity is so rare nowadays. Would you like me to get you some wine, yes? You've noticed that there's few words? I know, 'tis a shame that Stuart Staples-- that is his name, the singer-- isn't much on this record. I miss him. If I were able, I would kiss his hands and face for saving my life, saving the life of a poor accordion player.","You've heard of them, yes?

Runaway Found,The Veils,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a99bb1335d7bf1699502/1:1/w_160/9c007b63.jpg,2004-06-15 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8532-runaway-found/,Rough Trade,"The Verve, Suede, and subsequent solo satellites Richard Ashcroft and Bernard Butler gave their output weight by emphasizing moody sweep as much as musicianship. Image was never just a finely-cut Fred Perry with empty sleeves and body, but a three-dimensional muse that advised on sound and intent. This embedded difference made their albums memorable; it put pose and genre fulfillment second to songs and singularity. Runaway Found, the full-length debut from England's The Veils, derives its greatest depths from a similar well. It benefits from the even-handed lushness of co-producer Butler, and perhaps a bit of mentorship between he and head Veil Finn Andrews. But it also understands the role of pace in crafting resonance and has a gleaming diamond of the traditional model in the wail and stance of young Andrews. It's no fair: Mother England keeps birthing charismatic frontmen while America offers failed crops of bald and vengeful shoutmongers. Runaway Found is quite a classy thing. Check the evocative, selenium-toned cover art, or even its Rough Trade imprint if that's your game. Electric guitars are rabid or echoing, depending on the moment; acoustics simmer like quiet Urban Hymns. That album's influence is apparent in the keening strings of ""Wild Son"", too, but it's Butler behind the board, so the instrumental layering of his solo work is a touchstone. Runaway Found illuminates, with equal patience, the hovering dust particles in the spacious ""Talk Down the Girl"" and the hopeful guitar bends of the upbeat ""Guiding Light"". However, as dynamic as its backgrounds get, the album never defocuses from Andrews' willowy whoops and whine-- he wrote the songs, after all. For much the same reason, he can also be overdramatic, like a bruised ego poet haunting the university café. (Thom Yorke is an apparition floating in the soupy reverb and non-sequiturs of ""Vicious Traditions"".) ""Lavinia"" might have fared similarly, but instead it's one of the album's strongest points, filling five-plus roiling-sea minutes with weepy descending strings, insistent piano, and an incredible performance from Andrews that surveys the heartache and expressive power of every vocalist since Britpop's zenith. Like Elbow's Cast of Thousands, Runaway Found shifts ably between warmth and spiny soul-searching. There's grace between its acrid smoke and strobe light flashes (""More Heat Than Light"") and subtle, slightly sad builds (""Leavers Dance""). ""If only you could stay and not leave me behind,"" Andrews whines on ""Tide That Left and Never Came Back"", but the song finds a balance between pain and resigned fate, tempering Andrews' sorrow and its ragged guitar breaks with happier rhythm guitar doodle and sunny supporting harmonies. It's another Butler-helmed production and seems touched with his ability to find maturity in simple textures or the folds of a shirt. Of course, there's depth to The Veils' songs. But there's no question that Runaway Found is a better album for its attention to layering and pace. Brit-rock at mid-decade needs to take stock. Its past giants are still confidently (and rightly) influential, and more-recent comers have found inroads to bling across the pond. But in the margins there are baubles of the just-okay. They're groups that glow with talent but give off shadows shaped liked question marks. Despite its maturity, melodic strength, and direct connection to what came before, Runaway Found can't fully distance itself from the suspicion that it might just be ""eh"" in the long run. But The Veils prove England's version of just-okay is still better than America's gang of post-grunge blowhards, tuning their Paul Reed Smiths in astro wedgie recovery therapy.","The Verve, Suede, and subsequent solo satellites Richard Ashcroft and Bernard Butler gave their output\n\ weight by emphasizing moody ...

Strange Liberation,Dave Douglas,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb64abf31b7dc7155a9c/1:1/w_160/379387f0.jpg,2004-06-15 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2538-strange-liberation/,Bluebird,"The concept album is one of the only remaining things keeping jazz labels afloat. Who'd have thought in the mid-80s, when John Zorn's discography was defined by discrete projects, genre collisions and tributes to lesser-known past jazzmen, that this would become the model for all ""major"" jazz labels by the end of the 90s: If a record doesn't have a concept-- be it ""the calypso album"" or ""remember Eric Dolphy?"" or ""let's cover Björk!""-- it can't be marketed, the critics have no hook to discuss, and there's nothing to move it to the top of the pile. The towering back catalogs of jazz overwhelm all new releases, so for the newer guys, just playing great music doesn't seem like an ""occasion"" anymore. Dave Douglas and Bill Frisell-- respectively, the leader and guest star on Strange Liberations-- thrive in this environment. Their records receive steady distribution and attention from the press, and each features a new group or project: Frisell going from folk and Americana to a highly original world music melting pot (last year's The Intercontinentals), while Douglas splits his time between diverse working bands, chaotic evocations of social protest, and idiosyncratic but thoughtful homages to his heroes. The quintet featured here debuted on The Infinite, which was pegged as a Miles Davis tribute for its late-60s quintet sound and Uri Caine's use of a Fender Rhodes keyboard. But with Strange Liberation, as the band begins to sound lived in and Douglas writes a set of beautifully melodic compositions, we get a record that needs no tagline (Frisell's appearance notwithstanding). The opposite of last year's eclectic, electric, sometimes hectic Freak In, Strange Liberation blends Douglas' ideas smoothly into a set of music that's simply one of the best written, paced and performed works in his catalog. The flow is so strong that the best way to enjoy the record is end-to-end. Douglas leads some songs in a strident tone, his trumpet plaintively echoing Booker Little in songs that evoke the urgency of social justice; but next to those tracks lope easier, angular songs like ""Skeeter-ism"". James Genus straps on an electric bass for the funk-fusion ""Catalyst"", but that's preceded by the pining muted trumpet on ""The Jones"", and drummer Clarence Penn-- as responsible as anyone for the album's buoyant pace-- goes from propulsive rhythms to Paris springtime clouds of cymbals. Douglas fronts the quintet next to reedsman Chris Potter and Caine, who again sticks to Fender Rhodes. While not as typecast as, say, the harpsichord, that keyboard usually evokes a specific era of 70s fusion, either gritty funk or light-as-a-feather ringing spaces. Caine taps those memories but ditches them at will, as he maneuvers the instrument into every mood he's given-- which must have been harder than he makes it sound. And then there's Frisell, who's moved so far from straight jazz on his own records-- his trio sets even include a designated bluegrass section-- that it's easy to forget how often he comes back to it, in his recent duets with Dale Bruning or his annual gigs with the Paul Motian Trio. Douglas wrote several of these tunes for his guest, like ""The Frisell Dream"", which nods to its namesake's broad cow-poke writing style, as he amicably pokes elbows with the rhythm section; the frontloaded ballads showcase his melancholy lyricism, but Douglas also throws him into surf-rock on one track and wide-open space on another. He opens ""Mountains from the Train"" with gently exhaled tones and delay pedal loops broken by wood-thudding harmonics-- still among the most beautiful sounds ever wrung from an electric guitar. A lot of ideas simmer under the easy give-and-take on this record, but Strange Liberation takes all the fractured references and subprojects of the players' careers and buries them under the skin, as they sit down for a straight blowing session. And they shouldn't need an occasion for that.","The concept album is one of the only remaining things keeping jazz labels afloat. Who'd have thought in\n ...

The Green CD,Non Phixion,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c425c0084474cd0c3614/1:1/w_160/10683a93.jpg,2004-06-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5832-the-green-cd/,Uncle Howie,"One of a seemingly endless number of upcoming Non Phixion-related releases on the Uncle Howie label, The Green CD is an odd-and-ends anthology of material recorded over the course of the collective's career. Formatted like a mixtape, the album combines the work of three very different MCs and rarely strays from the generic, angry, independent thug topics (sex, drugs, murder) that Non Phixion mastered elsewhere. The content is less than polished-- the majority of the tracks are freestyles, unfinished songs and radio drops. The muddy, unprofessional sound quality of the album's on-air recordings complements the dark and aggressive nature of the group. One of the unfortunate drawbacks to recorded freestyles is their occasional lack of replay value-- a problem to which Non Phixion is not immune. Those songs exist almost completely for punchlines and solid sequences, so by this token, Non Phixion typically impress (""Drugged out, 'cause hash rules everything around me""; ""If I disappear, the masons took me""). That isn't to say there aren't several studio tracks here to whet the appetites of Uncle Howie fanatics ahead of the release of solo albums from each member of Non Phixion. There are roughly 10 studio songs here, depending on your definition, and the most successful songs are newly recorded (""We All Bleed"", ""Caught Between Worlds""). The rest, however, are rendered uninteresting by either a lack of conceptuality or by mundane production. So, your enjoyment of this album effectively hinges on your interest in the art of battle rap. The album's standout comes with ""Caught Between Worlds"", a focused meditation on the white ghetto experience and the gritty adolescence of our antiheroes. Domingo's production sounds like the nouveau RZA-tempered sped-up soul we've come to expect from the Rocafella camp, but is ultimately a new, effective fit for Non Phixion. The verses are emotional, chock-full of word pictures: Ill Bill claims his ""mind is like the script from an Italian gore flick,"" Goretex recounts his matriarchal appreciation (""It started back in apartment buildings, poverty stricken/ Mom was sick but I still felt her love from the kitchen"") and Sabac Red reminisces on early problems with drugs (""I got high and did the running man"") and education (""A badass in math class, I had to change teachers""). As a rarities collection, The Green fails. It's missing their best-known non-album tracks (""Thug Tuning"", ""I Shot Reagan"", ""5 Boroughs""), it's relatively short, there are no real topics explored, and the beats are uninteresting-- especially when compared to the group's more thoughtful work. In short, The Green CD is clearly a collection for Non Phixion completists. On the plus side, the limited edition DVD is beautifully assembled, the lines are relatively consistent, and the tone of the album is both shadowy and a good representation of where they've been coming from over the course of their career. On the whole, however, it's just a teaser for upcoming albums from Sabac, Goretex, Necro and Mr. Hyde.","One of a seemingly endless number of upcoming Non Phixion-related releases on the Uncle Howie label, The Green CD is ...

Automato,Automato,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a1ea9e61561daa484b/1:1/w_160/2809f8d8.jpg,2004-06-14 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/446-automato/,EMI,"On a sticker large enough to obscure approximately 25% of the cover art, copies of Automato's self-titled debut proclaim ""Produced by DFA!"" in 48 pt font. Not to diminish the growing sales value of the DFA brand name, but the publicity angle seems a clumsy effort to avoid scaring off the hiphop-shy, as cynical as hyping their use of live instrumentation so that their audience doesn't have to rescind their ""rap is nothing but samples and talking"" arguments. Still, the idea of the men behind The Rapture's curtain tuning their antennas to supervising beats of a different nature tingles some curiosity, if not without a hefty side-dish of skepticism. Indeed, there are lessons to be learned from Automato's debut, the foremost being that the golden touch of Mssrs. Murphy and Goldsworthy can't save a band from their own indie-rap dullness, horrible cybernetic-produce bandname, and absolutely atrocious MC. Given the consistent failing of history-fetishizing underground hip-hop to remember the genre's dance music ancestry, one might think that the DFA have the perfect resume to inject a little discoball back into this hangdog scene. But the duo seems mostly content to leave Automato's music sopping in echo, doing little to disguise the fact that-- surprise!-- real genuine instruments are not, in and of themselves, a virtue. Nevertheless, had the instruments been the only thing making noise in Automato, the album would be a sporadically interesting, if Iowa-flat affair. ""Capes Billowing"" sounds a bit like M83 mashed up with ""Airbag"", while the jammed-out coda to ""Hope"" resembles a minor-league ""Yeah"" (via LCD Soundsystem, of course, not Lil Jon). For the most part, the band's background vamp is intricate, featuring layers of keyboard minuets, staccato guitar, and multi-textured drums, but devoid of fun in favor of atmospherics. Despite announcing ""if it ain't soul music, then it ain't my music,"" Automato are distinctly lacking in that elusive thump. Gagging at the lyric excerpt in the last sentence? Well, that's only a taste of what MC Jesse Levine has in store for you fronting this sextet. Since my keyboard's quotation mark key can only handle so much derisive use, here's a quick sampling of some other choice tidbits, in quiz form: Q: Which of the following was not penned by Levine, but rather by my 12-year-old nephew? A) ""If you see a chair sit in it/ If you see a bear don't hit it.""
B) ""My Casio never told me there'd be times like these.""
C) You don't appreciate people 'til they die/ Then you wonder why you never smiled when they're alive.""
D) MTV generation/ Can't focus my attention."" It's a trick question; I don't have a 12-year-old nephew. All are Levine originals, and what's worse, they're all hooks, meaning these lines don't slip by once or twice, but are repeated and recited like Hail Marys. To Levine's credit, he does have an ear for crafting a catchy rap melody, although it's hard to judge whether that's a good thing when faced with the indie hip-hop cliché-bingo chorus of ""Cool Boots"": ""All I ever wanted was truth, peace, harmony and anti-gravitational boots."" The weird piano chording beneath the chorus of ""Cool Boots"" help make the song especially unshakeable, and hippie Trekkie lyrics aside, the song is revealing of how the Automato formula is not without its potential. So it's almost more disappointing that the DFA couldn't blow that spark into a bonfire, taking the same cattle prod to the mopey ass of indie hip-hop that they've recently used on shoegazing frown-rock. On the evidence provided by Automato's debut, Jay-Z won't be ringing up Goldworthy & Murphy anytime soon, and no hip-hop fan who doesn't know the liner notes of Echoes will or should bother with the band's music.","On a sticker large enough to obscure approximately 25% of the cover art, copies of Automato's self-titled\n\ debut ...

The Secret Chiefs influence us all, either directly or indirectly, through their representatives on earth, who are parts of the all and of the Great Movement of Things.""
       --David Cherubim, The Golden Dawn and the Secret Chiefs Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
       --Hassan-i-Sabbah Legend has it that 11th Century Persian sheikh Hassan-i-Sabbah inspired fanatic, even suicidal, devotion from his legions. His method of initiation was to kidnap and drug his foes' fiercest soldiers, then bring them to his fully functioning Garden of Earthly Delights, which was complete with exotic delicacies, fountains of wine, and good-to-go virgins. When his captives came to, dazed and suggestible in their psychedelic stupors, they were told they had died and entered heaven. Sabbah had only to promise that each of his subjects would return to Paradise if fortunate enough to martyr himself in his service. For a century, Sabbah's Hashishim-- ""Hash Eaters,"" from which we derive the word assassin-- were the most feared killers in the known world. It seems that Sabbah and Trey Spruance have something in common. Spruance, Secret Chiefs 3's chief composer and a former guitarist for Mr. Bungle, is a visionary madman capable of instilling both fear and respect in his listeners. Secret Chiefs 3 have existed in various incarnations over the course of the past eight years, and have served as the funnel for Spruance's remarkably far-flung studies of the hermetic mysteries and musical traditions of unknown and underappreciated subgenres. Album titles like Grand Constitution and Bylaws and Book M hint at the music's vaguely metaphysical bent. Over three years in the making, Book of Horizons is Secret Chiefs' most expansive and coherent statement, an alchemical fusion of Morricone-esque cinematic grandeur, midnight surf guitar, traditional Middle Eastern rhythms and time signatures, demonic death metal, and electronic deviance that yields a work of undeniable force. The album seems to develop a more acute, galloping schizophrenia as it progresses. The opening quartet of tunes-- each attributed to a different sub-group of Chiefs-- moves from solemn to wanton: ""The End Times"", with plaintive bowed saw and string section, moves to the black-market Bollywood funk of ""The 4"" by Ishraqiyun, which, after a brief, eerie dub interlude, bleeds into to the brutal screamfest ""Exterminating Angel"" by the Holy Vehm. Though the variance is great between the songs, each stays within the format of its genre. That respect to structure unravels quickly and intoxicatingly in the album's midsection. As the cast of players rotates, so do the names of the ensembles-- a narrative touch that lends Book of Horizons an epic feel. Common threads like copious strings and exotic percussion provided by William Winant (Thurston Moore's go-to skins man), Shazad Ismaily (Brian Eno, Elysian Fields), and Phil Franklin (Sunburned Hand of the Man) maintain some semblance of order. By the time ""The Owl in Daylight"" appears-- sweeping from creepy electro grind to soothing acoustic guitar and chimes-- and the hallucinatory beachfront kasbah groove of ""On the Wings of Haoma"" by The Electromagnetic Azoth takes flight, unpredictability has taken the reins. Potentially the album's pivot point, UR's ""Book T: Exodus"" is a remake of the Exodus movie theme, incorporating immense string and horn ensembles created purely through meticulous overdubs. It's a gorgeously orchestrated moment that wouldn't be out of place in the closing credits of a 1970s Godzilla flick. As the album nears its close, two of the final pieces move through so many styles that trying to peg them all would be impossible. The titles speak for themselves: ""DJ Revisionist (The Spin Masta, Kultur Killa, with da Mad Crypto-Colonial Skillz)"" and ""Anthropomorphosis: Boxleitner"" are exercises in new wave Middle Eastern electro freak lullaby majesty. This is the kind of music that really must be heard to be understood, bound by a surreal logic both ridiculous and unforced; a true accomplishment, indeed. Whether or not Spruance and his Secret Chiefs 3 are the intermediaries between heaven and earth is, um, hard to say, but with Book of Horizons it seems they're certainly communing with a power beyond the merely human. Virtuosity, paired with a fearless love of divergent styles and the humor and talent to skillfully, unmercifully mash them up, pushes this album into rarified heights. Bungle's major label connections and early association with John Zorn have given them a mainstream exposure that Secret Chiefs 3 will probably never receive. But Spruance's mongoloid baby is a golden child, effortlessly balancing aplomb, apocalypse and apoplexy to create a truly daring, mystifying journey.","""The Secret Chiefs are the invisible conductors of the initiation of the world, and the secret regulators of all human ...

Elk-Lake Serenade,Hayden,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c08313d197565213ba5e/1:1/w_160/c146958b.jpg,2004-06-14 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3776-elk-lake-serenade/,Badman,"Toronto's Hayden Desser is a potent singer/songwriter. His demure baritone can be the perfect accomplice for a gray day or it can block out the sun, stanching a cheerful mood. 1996's Everything I Long For and 1998's The Closer I Get are volatile collections of snarling lo-fi folk-rock, often overwhelming sad or bitter, while 2001's Skyscraper National Park saw a subdued, significantly matured Hayden, one who seemed more comfortable in his own skin but was no less emotionally ponderous. His fourth LP, Elk-Lake Serenade is his most low-key release yet: Here, Hayden seems to have recoiled still further into introversion, and as a result, has mollified some of the sentimental TNT displayed on recent songs such as Skyscraper's ""Dynamite Walls"". Elk-Lake relies mainly on acoustic guitar and trembling vocals. Periodic string and harmonica swells, a few instances of electric guitar, and the infrequent appearance of drums punctuate the sparse arrangements, but much of the record is vast and open, yet wrapped in solitude. Working with such a minimal palette, Hayden's arrangements seem less sophisticated and less effective here than they have on his previous releases. The towering, string-heavy ""Wide Eyes"" is a misleading opener. Short and stylistically different than much of the rest of the album, it features Hayden in top vocal form, gently wrapping his words around a meandering piano melody. It serves as a nice preamble for the more representative ""Home by Saturday"". Here, Hayden presents hushed, slightly slurred vocals over a simplistic arrangement of acoustic guitar, plodding drums and twangy pedal steel. From this point, much of Elk-Lake acquiesces as Hayden delves into saturnine, sawdust-covered folk songs that are almost too quiet. Either you'll be enthralled by his underplayed persona or drift aimlessly and inattentively away from his soporific compositions. ""This Summer"" and ""Robbed Blind"" are pleasant lullabies, but suffer from the opaqueness of Hayden's voice. With a clearer, more gripping vocal (something Hayden proves himself capable of achieving on ""Woody""), those tracks would be captivating instead of frustratingly retiring. What made Skyscraper National Park so affecting was the way its lo-fi boundaries often felt cleverly feigned to allow Hayden's laments to spill over into sincere emotional outpouring. Elk-Lake Serenade offers little of that suspense, and as such, it's too easy to tune out. Elk-Lake is a benign, restful listen, showing a once-unwieldy, always-vibrant creative mind having found a peaceful medium. While it's easy to appreciate the man's development, this blunted songwriting is somewhat less resonant-- and seems somehow less Hayden.","Toronto's Hayden Desser is a potent singer/songwriter.

Immortal Memory,Lisa GerrardPatrick Cassidy,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf0c5e6ef95969323341/1:1/w_160/fb5df86f.gif,2004-06-14 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3427-immortal-memory/,4AD,"Odd to think that the murky echo-chamber goth of the first Dead Can Dance album was a first step on a path leading to Lisa Gerrard's current level of refinement and mainstream acclaim. But then, it's been a steady trajectory. As Gerrard and Brendan Perry became more accomplished over time and more deeply immersed themselves in the possibilities of ancient music, they left behind any semblance of ""rock."" Eventually, film soundtracks seemed a logical next step. Gerrard has scored some good ones since the duo split in 1998 (The Insider comes immediately to mind), in addition to continuing with her solo and collaborative work. Immortal Memory finds Gerrard working with Irish composer Patrick Cassidy to craft an epic, sweeping cycle of songs that's completely over the top-- usually in the best possible way. Most of the music comes from a mid-size section of sampled strings (impressive in their fidelity) backing Gerrard's voice. The arrangements are obviously suggestive of a film score, but the pieces are complete in themselves, with the kind of development not allowed by a series of cues. It's a religious album, certainly, with themes as old as civilization. Pieces like ""Maranatha (Come Lord)"" and ""Abwoon (Our Father)"" bear a resemblance to monastic chants and have the ambience of a medieval church. Lyrics, when present, are often drawn from poems and early texts. Those songs not executed with patented 4AD wordlessness are sung in ancient Gaelic or Aramaic, reinforcing Gerrard's aesthetic connection to the idea of a collective unconscious, where memories and symbolic understanding are handed down through generations. Of course, the power of Immortal Memory ultimately comes from Gerrard's voice, and here, she is like five great singers rolled into one, shaping her tone and elocution to fit seamlessly with the mood and style of each individual piece. Apparently, her control and authority are only increasing with age; her voice goes wherever it's needed. On both ""Abwoon (Our Father)"" and ""I Asked for Love"", she drops an octave and sounds a hundred years old, hitting deep notes with a command suggestive of Diamanda Galas' virtuosity. ""Elegy"" is the other end of the tonal spectrum, as Gerrard voices the swooning, more modern and almost sentimental ballad with her clarion alto. Sometimes it's almost hard to believe how well-suited her instrument is for this kind of music. She was born into it. Because ethereal vocal music from ancient sources has been a fad a few different times over the last 15 years, Immortal Memory can at first listen feel a tad familiar. Those who recoil at the very thought of Enya, for example, might find this album rough going. Upon closer inspection, though, Immortal Memory reveals itself to be among the best of its kind. These two composers have a dangerously intuitive grasp of the relationship between sound and emotion. If, like me, you have a weakness for crushing gothic sadness with a symphonic bent, it's as if Gerrard and Cassidy have The Bomb and we're dependent on their benevolence. Immortal Memory is a slow, gradually unfolding album at the apex of melodrama, constantly one mislaid note from being ""too depressing"" to pull out in any but the most desperate moments. Fortunately, it never quite crosses that line; befitting any art derived from the sacred, rays of light find their way into dark corners.",,7.8,
To the 5 Boroughs,Beastie Boys,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24413d1975652138822/1:1/w_160/40fb95a1.gif,2004-06-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/608-to-the-5-boroughs/,Capitol,"On walks around Manhattan, even on sun-scorched days, mysterious precipitation falls on your head. Whether this comes from urinating birds, air conditioning condensation, observation deck spitting, or suicide jumpers breaking down into their constituent beads of bloody moisture over the long 145-story leaps from skyscrapers, I've yet to determine. The Times Square subway station has been under construction for at least four years. The majority of Village eateries I frequent do not accept credit cards. The city tobacconists all spell the first letters of ""Smoke Shop"" with two pipes, making the storefront signs look more like ""Jmoke Jhop."" Garbage is laid out on the sidewalks, as real estate shortages allow for no alleys. The Mormon Temple across from the Lincoln Center has fantastic free peanut butter cookies, if you sit through one of their thinly veiled brainwashing video tours. None of these elements of New York, which I find more indicative of the town, are mentioned on the Beastie Boys' To the 5 Boroughs. Instead, Adrock, MCA and Mike D offer obvious demographic and transit information on their ""Open Letter to NYC"". ""Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latin/ Black, White, New York/ You make it happen,"" they croon together on the chorus to the centerpiece of their sixth album. ""Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten/ From the Battery to the top of Manhattan,"" they read like a free hotel map. What, nothing rhymed with Inwood? The song makes fantastic use of a Dead Boys sample (who were from Cleveland), but fumbles the execution with their Up With People chants. Lyrically, the Beastie Boys fail to make a convincing justification for their hometown pride beyond slogans that could fit on a t-shirt. The answering machine message of Paul's Boutique conveyed more giddy pride in the nuances and uniqueness of the metropolis. In a trademark (or typical, or tired, depending on your perspective) deep pop culture reference, Adrock mentions Gnip Gnop, a 1970s Parker Brothers game that was like a cross of Pong and Hungry Hungry Hippos. ""Jmoke Jhop"" would have rhymed perfectly. In their attempt to point out the details of their city, the Beastie Boys offer little more than the view from the top of a sawn-off double-decker tour bus. At this point in time, no measure of analysis regarding cadence, meter or goofy references will sway the pros and cons of the Beastie Boys' lyrics. They do what they do, and even my mother knows their M.O. What To the 5 Boroughs offers, contrary to naysayers who mock aging bands, are three voices showing intriguing texture from wear and experience. MCA sounds like the Harry Nilsson of hip-hop after a lost weekend. Adrock, especially, shows greater range in style. From his leisured easy-speaking on ""Crawlspace"" to the Eminem-like syllable play on ""Hey Fuck You"", he puffs his chest with laid-back economy and moves away from the stereotypical nasal whine of their younger days. Where the true influence of New York exerts itself on To the 5 Boroughs is in the stark rhythms, which filter the cold continental-sampling breaks of rap pioneers like Jimmy Spicer and The Treacherous Three through Apple processors. The streamlined foundations both pay tribute to the crews that influenced the Beastie Boys to put down their Bad Brains and Reagan Youth aspirations and lays a hard digital direction for the Bush Youth to follow. Unlike all previous Beastie Boys albums (with the possible exception of Licensed to Ill), To The 5 Boroughs sounds homogenous and singular in purpose-- dark, steel, and dirty like that incomplete Times Square station. Ill Communication and Hello Nasty reveled in genre-dipping, from hardcore and salsa to dub and disco. Their decision to settle into a focused hip-hop direction here seems like a sage move. The album succeeds in its seeming spontaneity. ""Seeming"" in that they possibly spent years making it. But whatever length of gestation, the album's easy air speaks to veteran, nothing-to-lose attitude of both the city and the group. Still, my interaction with music goes well beyond simple, academic analysis of sound. Nostalgia, emotional context, the continued story and history behind the artist, the packaging, and everything else matters in my love and fascination with music. This is why writing for Pitchfork, which prides itself on discovering unknown underground artists, means so little to me anymore. Listening to music as some form of continued, insular experiment with recording driven by faceless, MP3-based rock bands bores me. I was immediately prepared to love To the 5 Boroughs from my history with the band-- from listening to Ill while playing Atari with Andy Eberhardt, to mowing neighborhood lawns with Gregg Bernstein and Paul's Boutique in a walkman, to holding my portable CD player off the front cushion of my Buick Century to keep Check Your Head from skipping as I passed over the speed bumps in the Marist parking lot every day after my Junior year, to shooting bottle rockets from poster tubes at passing trucks on 400 off the roof of the AMC multiplex I worked at when Ill Communication came out. It is not mentally possibly for me to switch on apathy towards the group. When all is said and done, I have spun To the 5 Boroughs at least 30 times while working on some of the most rewarding and enjoyable creative work of my life in the past couple weeks, while visiting a city I love, and seeing people I missed. The album has become intrinsically linked to these experiences-- from my movie premiere this week to the surreal tour of the Manhattan Mormon Temple last week. The little number at the top of this piece reflects little of personal relation to the record. It's an arbitrary guide to how I would expect people to gauge the intent of this review. I will listen to this album for years to come. You might. Or not. It depends on your own complex web of past interaction with the Beastie Boys, linked memories to the music, or preconceived notion of how hip or not it is to listen to them in 2004. Though I would fail to quantify the comparative ""quality"" of such albums, as I said before, I love Carl & The Passions as much as Pet Sounds. Divorcing the lives and backstory from the recorded product of a musical artist equates to making movies without characters. The sixth Beastie Boys album holds much more intrigue than some young dudes with bedhead thinking they're going to evolve rock and roll. I've ended up listening to it more than any other release this year. This process has become unexciting and routine, which is why I bid the world of music writing farewell. Explaining why I love a record in the confines of its production, lyrics and instrumental ""tightness"" without detailing the first time I heard the band's song drifting from bowling alley in Poland or whatever confounds me. More power to those who discover new music from this site. I've figured out where I stand at this point, as have the readers. Like the Beastie Boys, I could continue to crank out divisive pieces of writing here until I go gray. I have more interesting stories to tell.","On walks around Manhattan, even on sun-scorched days, mysterious precipitation falls on your head. Whether this comes from urinating birds ...

God Bless Our Pad,Wonderful,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa96ea9e61561daa5bfc/1:1/w_160/8cca94af.jpg,2004-06-13 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8776-god-bless-our-pad/,Mannheim,"While Seattle's ill-named dance outfit United State of Electronica are gaining national attention for their fantastic live shows and fun self-titled release, the men of the group-- Jason Holstrom, Johnny Rock, Noah Weaver, and Peter Sali-- also perform as Wonderful, and their debut, God Bless Our Pad, offers lush dream-pop in the vein of The Flaming Lips, Cocteau Twins, and perhaps a more piano- and synth-centric Elephant 6. The album is for the most part uncompelling, but Wonderful's best moments here are in fact quite good, boasting the band members' abilities to write equally compelling dance and rock songs. To Wonderful's credit, their songs are bristling with ideas. Perhaps from their U.S.E. tenure, the band seems to feel some sort of heightened responsibility to build and collapse these ideas with sub-radar subtlety and even some seriously high-contrast changes of face. Here's the thing, though: While, to an extent, U.S.E. can martial its sugary melodic fixations with the discipline of a big obnoxious dance beat, Wonderful both succeeds and fails precisely because its bright buxom sound is not kept in check. Piano replaces guitar almost entirely here, drummer Johnny Rock is pushed way back into the mix, vocalists take turns at falsetto, and on many songs, there's hardly any discernible low-end. Couple these issues with predictable vocal harmonies (some vocoded) and sinfully dominant synth flourishes, and some of these songs are cheesy trainwrecks just begging to be picked up by Lifetime channel dramas. The harp-laden synth waltz schmaltz of ""Ana Paradisimo"", The vocoded Flaming Lips-gone-awry travesty ""Romance & Freedom"", and the Xiu Xiu-does-weddings slobber of ""Hope Must Break You"" all fall victim to their own cliches and Wonderful's desperate attempts to emote. Other tracks, like ""Pagoda"" and ""Baby Boy Blue"", pleasantly flirt with the late Elliott Smith's bouncier catalog. But meanwhile, ""Golden Rays"" might be a little too Beach Boys for even the Beach Boys, and unless strict attention is paid, ""My How You Come Alive!"" can sound exactly like the theme song to Three's Company. All of which is a shame, since Wonderful absolutely nail a few songs here. These few seem to share their success from simple recourse to lazy melody and contrasting, high-energy rhythmic figures. Opener ""Adrianne"" is about par for God Bless Our Pad in this respect: Vocal melodies and saxophone harmonies soar atop a rhythm section banging out a tempo proceeding four times as fast, while with each movement the piano waxes nostalgic for the song's earlier moments. ""Call Me Sunshine"" is the album's best: Drums and bells start upbeat and stay there, providing firm ground for the song's cumulus mantra, ""Call me sunshine/ Be my sunshine,"" and some intermittent hot-rodding on the bass to break from otherwise languor. The sheer performance energy on ""Adrianne"" and ""Call Me Sunshine"" could easily keep Wonderful as relevant as U.S.E.-- if they find a way to further capitalize on this energy, and depart from their willed submission to the tired sounds and musical cliche that riddle God Bless Our Pad.","While Seattle's ill-named dance outfit United State of Electronica are gaining national attention for their fantastic live shows and ...

Of This Blood...,Detachment Kit,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b975c0084474cd0c25fb/1:1/w_160/e8e7753e.jpg,2004-06-13 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2296-of-this-blood/,Frenchkiss,"A lot of bands get accused of sounding like other, more prestigious bands, but it's pretty rare for one of those bands to actively seek proximity to the group which they're being relentlessly compared. When Chicago's Detachment Kit first got rolling, they sounded, to put it lightly, a lot like Les Savy Fav, and almost every review (my own included) of their fine debut, They Raging. Quiet Army, dropped the comparison in its first third. As if to drive home the point, the album was released by Self Starter Foundation, which was also home to Les Savy Fav at the time. And now, three years later, the Kit have hooked up with Les Savy Fav's own Frenchkiss Records for the follow-up. This is almost too convenient for a critic looking for a quick angle (pay no attention to that man behind the curtain with the pitchfork)-- the review is practically written in advance by the circumstances. Or so it would seem. The only problem is that the Les Savy Fav comparison doesn't really stick anymore. Instead, Detachment Kit have got all grown up on us, and kicked out a record whose spectrum ranges much wider than their debut. There's not a single track now that feels derivative of their once and present labelmates, and the band leavens its rhythms with dashes of hazy nighthawk balladeering. And though their broader approach yields less consistent results than previously, the highs this time around are much higher, and the album more listenable as a whole. The band's range is probably best exemplified by the best one-two punch on the album. The propulsive, spastic ""Ted the Electric"", a fuzzy explosion of distorted vocals and trebly bass guitar that rockets by the less than two minutes plays a fine foil to ""Ricochet"", a simple, slow song adorned by Charlie Davis' clean-toned guitar melodies and melancholy verses. Vocalist Ian Menard is at his most controlled and incisive on the first verse, singing, ""This city's a landslide/ It pushes you over,"" with casual grace. ""Pill Cake"" is another early highlight, with its bouncy rhythms, loosely harmonized vocals and loopy, rollercoaster melody. ""Music for Strobelights"" puts a nice spin on beat-driven post-punk in its first verse, laying out hushed vocals over a solid backbeat which is then harassed by counterrhythmic drum fills before the song finally slides into its weightless chorus. The accordion and cello of ""Ice Queen"" heighten the dread of the minor-key arrangement, helping to elevate the song to one of the band's finest. Diversification is not without its pitfalls, however, and a few songs suffer. ""Chronology"" is aimless and even a bit obnoxious for its first half, only finding its center of gravity when a guest vocalist referred to in the liners as the Thin Man picks up the verse, and ""The Race"" grinds a little too hard at nothing. Luckily, missteps like these are refreshingly few and far between. One thing I should mention is that Of This Blood... is a fine discovery in my ongoing quest for superlative liner notes, as it features a corking board game on the inside of the fold, in which a roll is determined by setting your CD player to random and hitting the skip button. Ultimately, it's distinctive touches like these that will help to define Detachment Kit on their own terms, as they've now taken their first broad step away from being defined on Les Savy Fav's. Of This Blood... brings the band into their own, and realizes much of their old potential.","A lot of bands get accused of sounding like other, more prestigious bands, but it's pretty rare for one ...

Syklubb fra Hælvete / All Men Are Pigs,Fe-Mail,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be92c0084474cd0c2ee6/1:1/w_160/fe7192cf.gif,2004-06-13 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11745-syklubb-fra-hlvete-all-men-are-pigs/,TV5,"Fe-Mail are Maja Ratkje and Hild Sofie Tafjord, both formerly of the Norwegian experimental electro-acoustic quartet Spunk. You might also know Ratkje from her exceptional 2002 solo album Voice, on which she demonstrated how the bizarre fury of a woman scorned could produce as intimidating, recklessly creative storm as any force in nature. Only, she didn't actually seem scorned; her solo work, and that with Fe-Mail, can be abrasive, but in general seems more the work of someone who takes more than a little pride in fucking with people. The duo's music, represented on 2003's Syklubb fra Hælvete and the new All Men Are Pigs, can seem an exercise in pushing buttons-- and not necessarily just the electronic kind. Apparently, Fe-Mail want to see just how far they can lead me into a semi-chaotic world, daring me to lean in closer so they can pounce with industrial loops and howling electronic screams. Surprising, then, to discover that their brand of noise (Merzbow is a better point of reference than any of their peers at Rune Grammofon) is so fetching. Living up to the questionable pun of their moniker, Fe-Mail delight in using images of female sexuality and glamour to contrast the iron-fisted free terror of their music. They pose as calendar models on their album covers-- or use Rik Rawling's lurid cartoons fusing softcore porn with heavy artillery-- and seem only too happy to exploit their rather attractive competitive advantage. I get the feeling they're trying to tell me something, too, be it an ironic statement about improvised noise music, or just a kiss-off to all the hipster chauvinists of the world. Regardless of the concept, Syklubb and All Men deliver on purely musical fronts in spades, so you don't need to feel very guilty for having a nagging urge to stare at the CD jackets. Syklubb was originally released in an edition of 500 on pink vinyl in Norway last year. The Important Records CD reissue contains two tracks not on the original, ""Virus Attachment 1"" and ""Virus Attachment 2"". These pieces foreshadow the near-violent thrust of All Men, and are in considerable contrast with much of Syklubb. The former begins with a brief exposition of birdsong, but soon initiates a loop of cut-up, high-pitched vocals and distorted percussion. The sound is not unlike recent outings by New York's Black Dice, using metallic, muscular sounds to construct highly detailed noisescapes. ""Jacob's Toy"" is much less confrontational: Atmospheric ambience, provided by who knows what analog synthesizer or manipulated field recording, sets up a mildly disorientating vocal section that alternates spoken word with wildly altered screams and laughs. Fe-Mail use the human voice as source material rather than a lead instrument, though it invariably lends acoustic warmth to their music. Since much of Fe-Mail's music is improvised, it's not surprising to hear it run through several seemingly unrelated textures within a piece. ""Water Music"" is the calmest track on Syklubb, but even with layers of natural ambience and water effects, the sine tones and suffocating vocal loop (not to mention spooky, discordant piano) lends it a disturbing quality. Likewise, ""Modogin"" begins as relatively low-key exercise in electro-acoustic minimalism, using what sounds like sandpaper and a plaintive, wordless vocal melody to orchestrate a damaged aria. However, the uneasy peace is broken with a gurgling generator in the left speaker, and a jagged, ferocious roar in the right. And ""jagged"" seems like the right word for Fe-Mail; a topographical diagram of their music would return severe spikes in mood, texture and volume. All Men Are Pigs was recorded with photographer and noise musician Lasse Marhaug, and serves as a pretty good ""fuck you"" to anyone expecting shyer music. If Syklubb had been a study in varying shades of noise, this one is outright terror. Grating, overdriven fuzz swirls through pieces that mix bits of sampled metal guitar and radio static into a single, continuous strip of blades. Rarely, as on ""Here's That Rainy Day, Sid Hendrix' Last Grunt"", the storm subsides into smaller pockets, though most of All Men seems designed to push listeners accustomed to ""lighter"" structures to their breaking points. Of course, this is what makes All Men such a captivating listen. Rather than milk the fury until it no longer has any impact, Fe-Mail know just when to say ""when,"" and how to frame chaos in the barest skeleton so as to suggest that what is happening isn't strictly chaotic, but a spiky, ill-tempered tone poem. The surreal, nightmarish collages at the outset of ""Charmed"" seem to logically prepare me for the paranoid apocalypse of its conclusion; the future-jungle calls of ""Fresh from the Flesh, On a Bed of Roses"" sound like perfect foils for its percussive gearshift loop and maniacal guitar. During a time when many noise and electronic musicians are downsizing to laptops and minimal improvisation, it's refreshing to hear an outfit that has little-to-no appreciation for respectable expectations.",,7.7,
Walking with the Beggar Boys,Elf Power,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc45eb335119a49ecc17/1:1/w_160/19a4e552.jpg,2004-06-13 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2747-walking-with-the-beggar-boys/,Orange Twin,"""Take me,"" Andrew Rieger growls, T.Rex-style, on the title track of Elf Power's sixth album, Walking with the Beggar Boys, before launching into a garish, grating, noisy, psychedelic guitar solo that's completely out of sync with the song's trippily organic pop. It's a mercifully short sojourn-- only a few measures-- and the only thing that keeps it from completely derailing the song is Reiger's pleasant call-and-response with special guest Vic Chesnutt. That outlandish break in the song, however, is symptomatic of Elf Power's new dilemma: whether to move forward with a brighter, more streamlined sound that incorporates 70s-style rock, or to hang on to the Elephant 6 lo-fi of previous albums like A Dream in Sound and When the Red King Comes. The band's decision: to attempt to split the difference, a resolution that begets a cluttered, sometimes unfocused result. Like their Elephant 6 siblings Olivia Tremor Control, Elf Power have always played with sounds: Their songs sometimes veer into cacophonous digressions or whimsically switch genres like bored children. This off-the-cuff approach lent albums like A Dream in Sound an appropriately dreamlike quality, and was intrinsic to the group's shaggy-haired pop, which seemed to thrive on such capriciousness. However, in updating their approach, Elf Power can't make the sonics match up to the songs, and as such, all these elements can do is intrude and interrupt. The folksy verses of ""Drawing Flies"" don't quite jibe with the metal chorus of fuzzed-over uh-huh's and oh-oh's, and ""The Cracks"", with its murky programmed drums and deathly tone, mires the album's middle with its drudgy dirge. It doesn't help that Walking with the Beggar Boys isn't the band's best collection of tunes. The most striking melody here, on ""Evil Eye"", is snatched from Richard Thompson's ""Wall of Death"", and few others are very memorable. An ambitious songwriter, Rieger still flirts with high-minded tedium, often dragging out hazy metaphors or vague motifs over several verses, if not through entire songs. ""The Stranger"" hinges on a lucid-dream account of meeting ""a stranger who stopped me in the street/ He told me love was in his head and then he ceased to be/ Yeah, when I looked the other way he'd split himself in two."" Unless you're a paid psychoanalyst, listening to other people describe their dreams, as the saying goes, is wearisome. Walking with the Beggar Boys sounds askew, a puzzle whose pieces don't fit properly.

Critical Beatdown,Ultramagnetic MC's,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a901ea9e61561daa5964/1:1/w_160/948961e9.jpg,2004-06-10 05:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8383-critical-beatdown/,Next PlateauNext Plateau,"Flava and Chuck. Ghostface and Raekwon. Andre and Big Boi. Eazy and Dre. Eminem and Dre. The history of hip-hop is full of odd couples-- most often, the raving, paranoid madman and his wiser, more stern companion. Hell, even The Sugarhill Gang had Master Gee. Hot-buttered a pop da pop dibbie dibble, my ass. The Ultramagnetic MC's, however, were the first all-lunatic rap group, one that would straitjacket the way from Digital Underground to Company Flow. If they offered anything truly innovative, it wasn't so much in their brilliantly swift, stilted flow or crushing rhythmic density as it was in the establishment of this unique dynamic. To claim that Critical Beatdown is the greatest hip-hop album of 1988 would take a lot of courage-- after all, it was the zenith of hip-hop's Golden Age, boasting classics from nearly every influential late-1980s rap group. And even if Ultramagnetic's Kool Keith and Ced Gee didn't possess the intricate rhythms of Rakim and Chuck D, or paint vivid ghettoscapes as well as KRS-One or Slick Rick, Critical Beatdown is still probably the hardest, fastest, craziest hip-hop album of that year. Critical Beatdown's surging psychosis is primarily due to its producers. Ced Gee was one of the most respected, radical maestros of the era, devoting some of his energies to Boogie Down Productions' untouchable Criminal Minded. DJ Moe Love was more interested in using the turntable's sounds than its samples', helping transform DJing into turntablism. Never mind the chilling hisses and heckles or the charred slabs of swollen funk; Beatdown has as much screaming as the average punk or metal album. Those screams, of course, are ingrained in the very fabric of the beat, concealed and crippled amidst the relentlessly fuzzing bass. And like most great rap albums, many of them come from the patron saint of yelps, James Brown, and flurry and flux with such abstraction and chaos that they make the beats feel deceptively fast-paced. Though many of these samples were standard-issue in the 1980s, they're arranged into patterns like split-second greatest-hits discs. ""Ease Back"" never sounds particularly innovative, but the bruising conflict between The Meters' ""Look-Ka Py Py"" and the JBs' ""The Grunt"" justified the existence of sampling in an era in which to some it was still oddly despised. On ""Ego Trippin'"", the beat is a mosaic of hacks and howls that sound as if they could suddenly disappear under the monstrous beat. On ""Funky [Remix]"", the stratifications of snares and basses bring out some gentle, foreign incantations rhythmically chirped by buried female voices. On the record's best track, ""Ain't It Good to You"", the frantic, proto-drum-n-bass beat breaks into inebriated static and a core that sounds like every sample on the album searing into one another. Kool Keith and Ced Gee's lyrics often seem as if they're not really about anything at all: The opening track asks the listener to do the one thing it's impossible to do to music-- ""Watch me now""-- and things don't get much more clear after that. For instance, Keith's first verse begins, ""Uno dos not quarto/ Spanish girls, they call me Pancho/ When on the mic, innovating this patterning,"" and ends, ""I'm in a movie scene/ Ears turn, and needles lean/ To cut scratches."" On ""Ease Back"", he ""relates it verbal/ Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbil/ I bought a Saab, a 1990 Turbo."" Keith could have wished for any future model, but he went for the Saab: Now that's lyrical ingenuity. (In a recent Mojo interview, Keith reported that the MC's ""read a lot of Popular Mechanics""-- so perhaps that explains his predilection for sensible motoring.) But despite Keith's reputation, Ced Gee is the source of the album's most insane, digitalk-quantum gibberish, spouting lines such as, ""A certified rhyme that I use, confuse, clock the time to a point/ A metaphysical radius,"" or, ""Using frequencies and data, I am approximate."" Ced's rhymes are so ""approximate,"" in fact, that they should be studied in seminars alongside general relativity. And despite his philosop-hop, he can still sound as tough as NWA, claiming, ""I will melt anyone who even tries to feel an emotion."" That anti-sentiment sentiment sounds odd until we find out Ced is a robot: ""I'm like a merchandise, a customized item/ Computer rapper for ducks who wanna bite them."" In a year that's already seen too many needless hip-hop reissues (from Nas to Non Phixion), Critical Beatdown's six bonus tracks-- including many of the group's early singles-- are probably not worth seeking out unless you're a bit more ultramagnetic than the casual fan. Those tracks are sparser and slower, and they feature group raps, an unhealthy amount of beatboxing and kind-hearted disco synths. The original 12-inch of ""Chorus Line""-- with its punctured vocals and melodramatic reverb-- still has the faint residue of hyper-lunacy, even though Tim Dog is on the mic. The classic ""Travelling at the Speed of Thought [Hip House Club Mix]"" is a frilled techno fiesta, and is the most mainstream thing Kool Keith has ever done. (And even then, it has a clarinet solo.) For the initiated, though, the reissue sounds slightly crisper than the original, and the extras are nice additions to a flawless album-- one that stands tall today as one of Golden Age's most ageless.","Flava and Chuck.

Five Pillars of Soul,John Wilkes Booze,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3eeb335119a49ec9c1/1:1/w_160/7be6cd63.jpg,2004-06-10 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4344-five-pillars-of-soul/,Kill Rock Stars,"No black men in black shades. No vibrato divas spreading syrup between the sheets. No luscious string sections, pitch-perfect harmonies, or funky drummer backbeat. Defined as much by what they aren't as what they are, John Wilkes Booze want you to understand that although modern soul is choked by formula, the real stuff is far more dangerous, intangible and important. Pieced together from five first-take EPs released in 2002, Five Pillars of Soul canonizes five seemingly disparate icons-- Melvin Van Peebles, Patti Hearst, Albert Ayler, Marc Bolan, and Yoko Ono-- who addled the status-quo with their singular vision and fuck-the-bullshit tenacity. ""They have become a shining example for finding soul in ourselves by inspiring up to go beyond the limited mind, beyond fear and anger, to the core of what is true,"" reads the introduction to the liner notes. You never figured six jittery acolytes from the Hoosier state could get so archly metaphysical, but that's one of the unlikely, ingenious aspects of this album. Five Pillars forces a reconsideration of soul-- in music, in spirit, in art-- as a strong-willed DIY ethos and singularity of purpose. In the skewed rock-as-art world of John Wilkes Booze, grandfather soul is not unlike his agitated, aggressive nephew, punk, ignoring convention and plowing headfirst into self-expression. Skeptical? I don't blame you. But check out the 12 pages of liner notes-- these guys are serious. Because the chaotic musical thread doesn't overtly tie it all together neatly, they give a detailed, articulate dissertation on the mark the five left on America's cultural fabric. The more you read the more the concept gels. But listening to the album I'm still shaking my head: The sound doesn't necessarily speak directly to the thesis. All five pillars were revolutionary in some sense, and musically, it almost makes sense. But ultimately, John Wilkes Booze are a full-bore garage band caricature, which is good and bad. There's sweat and lust and ingenuity here, but it's nearly dwarfed by the concept itself. Still, I can't help but dig it. Rock and roll rarely educates, and JWB's devotion to history occasionally surfaces in some clever ways. Seth Mahern's falsetto is itself a lesson, a helium-sucking Ray Davies cartoon, and it leads the band into unlikely hip-thrust territory despite its completely asexual ring. He squeaks out the requisite grunts and groans on the nearly-funky opener ""Sweetback's Gonna Make It"", while the gurgling organ that drives ""See Through Sound"" is all jagged vanilla Sly. These two odes to van Peebles come closest to straight-up soul, but also lean towards The Nation of Ulysses' rhythmic noise barrage. Bolan is hardly the top of anyone's list of soul pioneers, but the psychedelic meandering on the vaguely medieval ""Butcher's Tale"", the piano-driven chant of ""Academy Flight Song"", and country blues of ""Marc Bolan Makes Me Want to Fuck"" adds interesting, unpredictable shades. Ayler makes a brief appearance on ""They Don't Like Me in this Town"", his sampled snippet leading into Eric Weddle's skronk sax before ripping into the chorus that sums up the album's overall theme: ""They don't like me in this town/ 'Cause I've got that outside sound."" The band's sense of humor shows up in the congruity of the title ""Meanwhile, At the Hideout"" and the song's content. It's an acoustic guitar and tambourine sing-along of the Symbionese Liberation Army motto (""Death to the fascist insects/ That prey on the lives of the people""), and recalls both Patti Hearst's schizoid radicalism and John and Yoko's ""Happy Christmas (War is Over)"". No surprise the band was originally named John Wilkes Booze Explosion-- the pattern for this kind of post-rock black music tribute was first drawn by Jon Spencer ten years back. That doesn't lessen the album's impact, though: Not many records inspire such profound analysis. Five Pillars seems simultaneously random and pointed, visceral and intellectual, absurd and sensible. Like School House Rock reborn through blood, guts and sweat.","No black men in black shades. No vibrato divas spreading syrup between the sheets.

From the Double Gone Chapel,Two Lone Swordsmen,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8579d034d5c69bf3a0b/1:1/w_160/f01a7be5.jpg,2004-06-10 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8227-from-the-double-gone-chapel/,Warp,"Some people are never satisfied. One by one, just about every established laptop artist has abused their popularity by breaking out into spontaneous song or rediscovering half a talent for, like, glockenspiel, and assuming we're interested. What is this epidemic of narcissistic self-reference afflicting today's electro-auteur? Is it a kind of masturbatory ego deconstruction? Or simply an instinctive yearning for recognition as a ""proper"" musician and a reaction to the genre's perennial dismissal? Whatever the answer, the results have ranged from challenging (Venetian Snares' operatic explorations) to confounding (overachiever Squarepusher's live bass and drumming showcase Music Is Rotted One Note) to downright weird (Bogdan Raczynski's creepy crooning on My Love I Love). Despite the experimentation and progression of their Warp, Planet Mu, Skam, and Schematic peers, Andrew Weatherall and Keith Tenniswood had, to date, oozed a self-satisfied maturity and spurned the temptation to completely revamp their sound with each successive release. That attitude engendered a seamless continuity of production; their tight, elaborate beats held together beautiful melodies ranging from staccato funk to underwater drone, cemented by techno sensibilities cultivated from years of industry experience. But with From the Double Gone Chapel, Two Lone Swordsmen, among the most resilient and dependable purveyors of quality cerebral electro going, have attempted their own bewildering departure. ""Stack-Up""'s freaky funk opens the album with a murky, ambivalent swell of synths that begets an instant unfamiliarity. Negotiating your expectations through this live-sounding hybrid makes for one disorienting experience. It's truly unsettling hearing the usually dominant drum machines strangled and dwarfed by a threatening mix of feedback and gothic vocalizing reminiscent of The Sisters of Mercy and Mick Harvey's darker efforts. On ""Faux"", Weatherall sings, ""She's like a tornadom"" in a flat, deep, bit-crushed voice that would sound at home on a Einstürzende Neubauten track-- and he keeps this up for pretty much the entire album. Once the initial alarm subsides, the structures and rhythms reveal a certain cordiality. The live drums, phased bass, and sparse guitar phrasing on the excellent ""Damp"" have no discernible heritage anywhere in the TLS catalog, yet there's something in the beat syncopation and smooth, serene strings that's intrinsically Weatherall/Tenniswood. Since Weatherall's famed emergence as producer of Primal Scream's Screamadelica, he's had a hand in most areas of production, including a prolific DJ career and frequent remixing and board work for New Order, Saint Etienne, Beth Orton, and others. So now he wants to sing. Which is unfortunate, because Weatherall's not a particularly gifted vocalist, and some may find TLS's proven abstract approach preferable to his consistently bleak poetry: ""The alarm in his head/ Moving into the red/ And it sounded like punches and knives."" The glutinous acid on ""Sick When We Kiss"" is deviant and suggestive enough without the seedy utterances; this preoccupation with loss, anger and bitterness sounds like nothing so much as Weatherall and Tenniswood jumping at the chance to address their repression directly. A cover of Gun Club's ""Sex Beat"" hints at the duo's influences and ties the album's ideology together. On much of From the Double Gone Chapel, punk, goth, and electronics exist in effective cohabitation, but some tracks are polarized strongly toward one genre or another. The harmonized duet on ""Taste of Our Flames"" eschews any semblance to prior TLS material, while ""The Valves"" is a stripped down, claustrophobic affair that might've happily graced 2000's astounding Stay Down. Still, generally speaking, you'd have to go back as far as 1994 (to Weatherall's Sabres of Paradise LP The Haunted Dancehall) to find this new spawn's paternal gene pool. Two Lone Swordsmen's new direction takes getting used to, and From the Double Gone Chapel isn't an easy first listen for longtime fans. The contrasting styles don't always sit comfortably, but individual tracks sparkle with creativity and the newfound dark side is a surprisingly pleasant fit. Raw and impulsive, From the Double Gone Chapel's tattered edges do it justice. Two Lone Swordsmen have successfully jerked their whole operation around, and they just about pull it off. Having sat so long at the top of their game, Weatherall and Tenniswood can't be blamed for wanting to shake things up a bit-- and judging by this record, they're more than capable.","Some people are never satisfied.

Funny Farm,Pipi Skid,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a177ea9e61561daa47ec/1:1/w_160/b24250de.jpg,2004-06-10 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6541-funny-farm/,Peanuts & Corn,"The Peanuts & Corn collective is best known for the quirky humor and traditional production that made Pip Skid's Friends4Ever and Hip Hop Wieners' All Beef, No Chicken underground favorites. A sophomore effort and the return of the label's vanguard, Pipi Skid's Funny Farm is a slightly darker affair than might've been expected from a traditionally comical group of artists. First off, Pipi Skid's style of rap is incredibly idiosyncratic. To make a simple comparison, he comes off like The Streets if Mike Skinner was Canadian, grounded in hip-hop traditions (mid-90s sound, emphasis on scratching, references to old-school favorites), and actually focused on his flow. Pipi raps with a gravelly voice, but it doesn't impede his accessibility like it might for Buck 65 or Aesop Rock. And if some rap purists may not take to it, Pipi's decidedly pedestrian subject matter (working at an old folks' home, dependence on alcohol, germ phobia, pawning off his shit for quick cash) is a big part of his charm. ""Pip Skizzy"" best exemplifies the styles of both Pipi Skid and producer Mcenroe. The backdrop hits with wavering Spanish guitar and repeating jazz hi-hats, while Pipi justifies murder (""You smell like McDonald's and Wal-Mart/ By killing you, I'm acting globally, doing a small part""), forced impotency (""While you listen to 'Rapture', I'ma rupture your nuts/ Blondie's singing and I'm swinging and you can't have no children""), and presidential assassination (""And now everybody scream/ As I mow down Bush and his security team""). The song sets the album's tone perfectly. Produced entirely by Mcenroe, Funny Farm is oriented around strings and dusty drum funk. From the looped sequence of tribal drums, orchestral horns, and flutes on the title track to the whimsical bounce, slow-release horn flourish, and gorgeous violin of ""Super Dope Producers"" to the glitchy double-time drums and wind chimes of ""Magnifique"", there's ample evidence of Mcenroe's traditional yet incredibly technical style. As is the case with most Peanuts & Corn work, the production stands out over the lyrics without unbalancing the album too much. In the end, though, the record does present something of a conflict: There are good ideas, excellent beats, and solid rapping all over this album, and Pipi Skid plays a highly likeable everyman character. But Pipi's better at utilizing humor based on his life experiences and the underground hip-hop landscape than tackling Funny Farm's more downtrodden topics. I'd have preferred longer songs, too, as some of the shorter pieces, had they been expounded upon, might have improved the album as a whole. Still, Funny Farm upholds P&C;'s claim to relevance in today's independent hip-hop scene.","The Peanuts & Corn collective is best known for the quirky humor and traditional production that made Pip Skid's Friends4Ever ...

Vehicles & Animals,Athlete,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19f5e6ef9596932021c/1:1/w_160/6fb46cd3.jpg,2004-06-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/444-vehicles-animals/,Astralwerks,"There's this whole cadre of bands over in the UK walking through the world at 45 degrees, rubbing sleep from their groggy eyes, and bagging birds at a staggering rate. They're plug-in comers to the Brit-Pop oracle, though they claim no allegiance to the genre, and have as much Blur in their britches as they do crusty Levellers. Operators like The Mountaineers, The Beta Band, we're talking about here; Super Furry Animals, too, those wacko Welshmen who nimbly sidestep failure while spending too much money. And now Athlete comes walking down the same meandering trail with Vehicles & Animals, a full-length cobbled in part from past singles and EPs. As evidenced by this debut, Athlete enjoy removing the connective tissue in a song, so that Joel Pott's drowsy, accented Malkmus impersonation can flap untethered over slippery guitar hooks and assorted electronic splooge. ""One Million""'s rhythms shift suddenly from loping organic percussion into a programmed static bump; ""Beautiful"" flits between clicky, pocket-size verses and big soaring choruses, and treats the whole lot with a recording of Wish You Were Here played backwards. Of course, America has its own crazy diamonds, and Athlete's heard them, too. Their heads bob to the established tenets of the American indie electronica movement, as well as Soft Bulletin psychedelia. ""You Got the Style"" happily references softly doting rock chorusing, the slickness of 80s English pop, and that country's fickle climate, while ""Salvador"" is an inviting opening singalong of chiming guitars and natty scarves blowing fancily in a gentle breeze. The latter is also the closest approximation of what no one's been waiting for, but most everyone will secretly love-- a Super Furries-style cover of Avril Lavigne's ""Complicated"". ""Everybody wants to be part of the rock scene,"" Pott declares in ""Westside"", and there he is, defending Vehicles' more blatant appropriations. But perhaps he drifts into daydream then, and peers into his neighbor's ear: ""You raise the tempo in the disco/ As you make this place your own."" It's the sort of line that gets paunchy Bridget Jones types and the moon-faced men that love them very excited, because it invites everyone to the arty party. In fact, most of the album does, remaining fashionably idiosyncratic even as it keeps the accessibility altimeter level on the horizon; for all its pristinely damaged production and implications of music fan snobbery, ""Shake Those Windows"" is close to the pink-palmed mainstream pop of Stereophonics. Maybe the band knew we'd be growing tired with them by mid-album, and looking for a reason to hate, since the midpoint title track really yanks the space hippie heartstrings. ""There are moments of escape for every one of us/ And the beauty in the times that we create,"" Pott whispers over xylophone tinkles, and relates the album's title as a child's artistic escape from loneliness, and perhaps abuse. Simplistic and blatant, but full of meaning over the modified lullaby arrangement, the track accesses the warm/fuzzy humanism of Wayne Coyne. The feelings conveyed are certainly real, but the organi-tronic flower power flow on display here is hardly unique to Athlete. It's actually preached by most of the band's UK USB hippie peer group (all of whom must count Coyne an earthly saint). It's all about finding the friendly turtles at the end of the druggy rainbow, yet, since no one's in a hurry to get there, the songs loop along with space between the beats and guitarists who still seem to be learning their craft. ""Give it up/ Lift your hands/ Everybody,"" Athlete urges at the end of Vehicles & Animals, and there's a good chance we will, at least until the next batch of happy pills fall from the fluffy clouds.

You start out as a caterpillar, of course, a furry little thing with a tent-like exoskeleton and too many legs, but before long, you're wrapped in your chrysalis, slowly morphing into something entirely different, more mature, and frequently beautiful. What I really think gives butterflies the edge over other species is that period of metamorphic hibernation-- during their most awkward phase, they're insulated from the world at large, and they still emerge with a new maturity. On the other extreme, when we're in our most awkward phase, adolescence, we're thrust into the hostile social grist mills we refer to as schools, and emerging with a new-found maturity on the other end is no sure bet. Some people emerge as adults, others just very large caterpillars. People really have nothing to compare to that chrysalis state, though certainly try hard to find it; Thoreau on Walden Pond, transcendental meditation, or even a teenager in that awkward phase hiding out in her room with the radio up to drown out thoughts and inquisitive parents seem to reach for it. To heighten the effect, that teenager might want to slip in Cast from the Platform, the sophomore effort from Lansing, MI's Auburn Lull, which is about as close as you can come, musically, to being wrapped in heavy gauze and closed in from the ugly detail revealed by harsh direct light. There is no awkwardness in the world the band creates on Cast from the Platform, only abiding grace and enveloping beauty. Even when they cast their tunnel of light drones and oceanic washes of guitar and synth texture across fractured rhythms, as they do on ""Season of False Starts"", the flow of sound is too natural to be hobbled. ""Direction & Destination"", meanwhile, has all the weightless illumination of the Verve's debut EP or Bark Psychosis' ""I Know"", Sean Heenan's rounded, seafoam (and suspiciously British-sounding) vocals drifting over Jason Weisinger's spacious drums through a cavern of water-formed reverb. This is the kind of album that will no doubt garner more than a few reviews that try to pin a shoegazer label to it, and just as many that try to call it ""space-rock"" or something similar, and that's a shame, because it's entirely too ascendant to deserve the first term, and too terrestrial and warm to warrant the second. ""Trenches"" may have guitars that could soundtrack a supernova, but that shuffling march beat keeps it firmly on the ground, while piano and dusty vocals render it human and evocative. The music's principle paradox is its expansiveness in spite of the intimacy of the recording-- it's the kind of thing that seems perfect for a rainy day alone inside with cats and books, but also makes me want to get out the maps and start planning routes to scenic places. Ultimately, it's your choice when you listen to it; my role really only extends to imploring you to give it a go in the first place. Auburn Lull's musical cocoon is a wholly inviting one, melodic and gorgeously textured, uniform in sound, but with enough rhythmic and tonal variety to explode any accusations of monochromaticism. Cast from the Platform is an album you can immerse yourself in as deeply as you like, so step inside. You won't regret it.","I'm not an entomologist or anything, but I think I have proof that butterflies live great lives. You start ...

Debut Live / Post Live / Homogenic Live / Vespertine Live,Björk,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c65e6ef959693204c8/1:1/w_160/ddfea9d7.jpg,2004-06-09 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11675-debut-live-post-live-homogenic-live-vespertine-live/,One Little Indian,"There's a fine line between providing a wealth of material for your fans and exploiting their loyalty and devotion. Where that line is drawn is essentially the decision of each individual listener and consumer, but in recent years, a sizeable number of people have no doubt determined that Björk has crossed it. The much-beloved chanteuse seems to release a new box set, compilation, DVD or multi-part single every other month-- and although none of these new products carry malicious intent or are lazily conceived, the eccentricity of some of her releases (particularly the perverse object-fetish box set Family Tree) still seems to have cost her a tiny bit of goodwill. Ironically, then, a quartet of previously released records-- some of which contain material that has also already appeared on DVD-- is worth the attention of Björk's non-devotees. Originally released last year as a four-disc box (one that included a five-track DVD and a 32-page booklet), Björk's Live series collects the best available recordings from each support tour for her four studio albums. In some cases, those ""best available"" recordings are either frequently bootlegged or have appeared on DVD, most notably Björk's Unplugged session and her Post-era Shepherd's Bush Empire set. The individual releases allow Björk's more fervent fans who held out rather than re-purchase those recordings to collect the albums they don't already own while presenting the less-devoted with the opportunity to pick and choose from among the selections without committing to purchasing an entire box. (Let's face it, most hardcore Björk fans were going to buy the live box regardless of what it contained.) The titles are perhaps misleading-- each disc isn't a replication of an album in a live setting; they're simply named to correspond with each tour. For Björk, it's an appropriate approach because each phase of her solo career has had a distinct personality, look, and sound. Most of Debut Live is constructed from the aforementioned Unplugged-- the holdout is the much-circulated and elegant harpsichord version of ""Venus as a Boy"", from a 1995 appearance on Later with Jools Holland. (The only absent Unplugged track is ""Atlantic"".) The set is mostly a muted affair in which the newly solo Björk seems hesitant to be the focus. Instead, a multicultural band that includes a pre-fame Talvin Singh on tabla, longtime Björk collaborator Guy Sigsworth, and the underrated Leila Arab take center stage. The band's patient approach and blend of Eastern folk and jazz suits the holding out for hope of ""One Day"" and a harp-boosted ""Like Someone in Love"", although slowed versions of ""Big Time Sensuality"" and ""Human Behavior"" drag and seem a bit clenched and stiff. That's a particular disappointment because Björk and her players do manage to loosen the muso, stool-sitting setting on playful, sprightly versions of ""Crying"" and ""Violently Happy"". In part because of the restrictions of this setting, Debut Live strays furthest from the studio arrangement, but also contains the weakest selection of songs among the four discs. Post Live suffers from almost the exact opposite problem: The tracklist and Björk's confidence each improve but this is the least revelatory of these sets (and therefore arguably the least necessary). The majority of the album (nine of 13 tracks) is culled from the 1997 Shepherd's Bush Empire performance, and is filled out by another pair of tracks from the 1995 Jools Holland appearance (an unfortunately tired rendition of ""Hyper-Ballad"" and a slightly countrified ""Possibly Maybe""), a brisk run-through of ""I Miss You"" from TFI Friday and a playful version of ""It's Oh So Quiet"", on which Björk's shape-shifting voice threatens to spill into self-parody. The limited sound and power of the TV appearances are dry to begin with, but really stand out alongside the rest of the material from her kinetic Post tour sets. Blending styles and infusing most of her work with the clang and buzz of German electronic pop, the Shepherd's Bush performances are vital. Even some of the seemingly demure tracks punch above the weight: ""Headphones"" crackles, yawns and stirs to open the disc, ""The Modern Things"" mixes the Eastern percussion of the Unplugged set with the buzz of machines, and ""One Day"" has more clang than it does chops. Once again, however, the disc peaks when the beats are increased-- whether that be on a stirring ""Enjoy"", the jungle love of ""Big Time Sensuality"" or feisty, eye-opening readings of ""Isobel"" and ""I Go Humble"". Despite the success of the Shepherd's Bush Empire show, eclecticism and energy need not always be keys to great live performances. The strings and beats of Homogenic Live and the odd cast of characters (Matmos, a harpist, an orchestra, and an Inuit choir) of Vespertine Live seem static on paper but are captivating on record. Mirror images of one another, tracks from the musically warm yet sometimes lyrically coarse Homogenic and Vespertine-- with its cozy sonics and emotional vulnerability-- make up the bulk of their live namesakes. Recorded with Mark Bell and the Icelandic String Octet, Homogenic Live sees Björk drop the safety net of a traditional pop/rock show. That setting and the sparse arrangements could have left her potentially vulnerable, but she fills any empty space with the full force of her voice-- and does so without the occasional overselling heard on Post Live. The big-reward/small-package approach also greatly improves the sound of Björk's TV performances-- three tracks from a 1997 Jools Holland performance run laps around the ones from two years earlier. In the end, the renditions seem more assured and well-conceived on the later two albums. But alas, a third version of ""Anchor Song"" was perhaps an unnecessary touch. As a recording, Vespertine Live is engaging, but as an argument for the rehabilitation of the studio album's reputation, it's downright compelling. With the exception of another awkward solo performance of ""I've Seen It All"" and a pair of sensual Homogenic tracks (""All Is Full of Love"" and ""Unravel""), the record is entirely made up of Vespertine-era songs, yet hardly suffers from bulging with what is widely considered Björk's weakest effort. Live, Vespertine's glitch-pop nuances are magnified, the choir is less cloying, and the music box melodies are more embraceable. Having to sell the songs to an audience and force them to connect removes the cocoon from arrangements that otherwise tend to sound too private and slight. As a result, songs like ""Aurora"" and ""Unison"" are now captivating rather than forgettable, while ""Hidden Place"" and ""It's in Our Hands"" can stand toe to toe with some of Björk's better work. Indeed, while Homogenic Live may contain the best tracks and the most thrilling performances, Vespertine Live is the one disc in this series that could supplant its namesake in your listening rotation.",,6.7,
Natural Dreamers,Natural Dreamers,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96f9d034d5c69bf520f/1:1/w_160/a1c99054.jpg,2004-06-09 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5899-natural-dreamers/,Frenetic,"By musical evolutionary standards, the band rehearsal is a prehistoric notion. Long ago, pop music opened its doors to the world of technological convenience. Now, accoutrements such as synthesizers, drum machines, and ProTools-style manipulators are standard fare for garage studios, and writing music is an increasingly solitary affair. While these devices have in many ways enriched the artform, their advantages have often come at the expense of the synergistic effect of live musicianship. Most regrettable is the loss of the exhilarating energy that can result when a group of people simultaneously know exactly what the fuck they're doing. Natural Dreamers know what they're doing, and they relish it. The band seeks to revive the floundering state of, well, the band-- that is, ""band"" as in the instinctual communion of musicians through an ineffable language and, most of all, lots of hard, noisy work. Natural Dreamers sounds like the product of many strenuous nights; one can almost see guitarists Chris Cohen and John Dieterich eyeing each other cautiously as they toil to nail each well-spaced kick, or Jay Pellicci sweating to keep the ship afloat. Miraculously, as if by kismet, the disparate pieces fall in to place, and Natural Dreamers is the sundry result of equal parts fate and painstaking craftsmanship. Natural Dreamers eschew immediate categorization, but it's helpful to consider that all three members have served time in Deerhoof. Cohen and Dieterich are relentlessly jagged and instantly recognizable. There's still no give to their boxy style of guitar playing. In fact, Natural Dreamers consciously give groove a stiff arm, faring without a bassist or, often enough, time signatures. At its worst, this formula yields instrumental math-rock that never learned its multiplication tables. At best, the band distills the pellucid nectar of melody and offers a refreshing take on pop music, at once retrospective and prescient. ""Singer"" tries on several different outfits before finding one that fits. The band steps gingerly into these different guises, considering each new move with Kasparov-like deliberation. When they finally decide where they're headed, their declaration of purpose is brazen and not a little shocking: The timid guitars abruptly meld into a fragmented three-note loop, while Pellicci loosely keeps time, battering his cymbals irreverently and filling leftover space with frenetic snare rolls. From there, the track picks up the record's steadiest rhythmic vamp, a thick shuffle accompanied by a wistful glockenspiel melody. It's a clear standout and a suitable mission statement for a band whose sound isn't easy to pin down. Elsewhere, ""The Big Switch"" approximates a free-jazz Lightning Bolt, while ""The Golden Pond"" and ""Fourth Man"" utilize silence and some analog electronics to an interesting stylistic effect. If Natural Dreamers is at times unbearably chaotic, it isn't because the record is too strident; paradoxically, it's because some of the songs aren't abrasive enough. There's tons of melody here, often crystalline and strikingly beautiful, only much of it is transmogrified by the band's flighty, abstract style of composition. As such, tracks hint at a transcendent melody, only to not quite grasp it. But in the end, this penchant for obfuscation is as much of a boon as it is a bane. As they posited with Deerhoof, Cohen, Dieterich and Pellicci seem to believe that the visceral heart of pop music lies not in the way instrumental elements coagulate, but rather in each sound's naked isolation. Much like abstract painters of the 20th century, who used paint as subject matter, they deconstruct and decontextualize traditional form, and as such, Natural Dreamers is a demanding but ultimately enlightening album.","By musical evolutionary standards, the band rehearsal is a prehistoric notion.

Sharkey's Machine,Sharkey,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32cc0084474cd0c01f4/1:1/w_160/b99960ef.jpg,2004-06-09 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6958-sharkeys-machine/,Babygrande,"""Instrumentalist"" is one the most heralded yet scrutinized positions in the independent hip-hop arena. An artist with an existing portfolio can lose respect and prominence with the slightest shift in creative direction, while the new kids on the block are often held to high standards when compared to those who preceded them. In the case of ex-hardcore techno DJ Sharkey, his first foray into hip-hop fails not due to superficial comparative issues but because of his own mistakes, and lack of talent and consistency. Hell, I'm not even sure the term ""instrumental"" really applies to this album, considering Sharkey only relies on his solo backdrops four times over the course of the album. This is an insecure approach, but it's for good reason: Sharkey has not grasped the concept of the change-up. Listening to roughly the same thing for four minutes at a time is not appealing, so as a long-form instrumental producer it's important to learn how to make beats with movements. Sharkey has some interesting sounds across the span of the album, but some of his sample work is far too poorly processed (sometimes it sounds as if he hasn't learned to equalize samples to create a distinctive sound for himself) and the artists he puts on top of his beats do not flatter him. Among the guests is a slew of well-known artists, but don't let the big names fool you: They might be the only people more uninterested in this project than Sharkey himself. The highest profile collaboration is ""Fuzz"" with Cannibal Ox, and although the distorted synth is an interesting effect, Vast Aire settles for a pair of freestyles that reference Jason X, mechanical thongs (and bongs) and rhinestone baseball bats, while Vordul raps a combined 18 bars that offer nothing new other than the term ""rap ninjas."" It doesn't get any better. When Cherrywine (formerly of Digable Planets) spins an embarrassingly lame illicit conversation on ""Phone Sex"" (""We rock and roll, we like The Strokes"") and The Pharcyde (well, the members that aren't Fatlip or Slim Kid Tre) guest on the vanilla, acid-jazz coffee shop muzak of ""Snobird"". At the end of the day, the only person who seems to know the mic is on is Jean Grae, whose tightly delivered vision of a New York apocalypse on ""Summer in the City (Lovin' It)"" is the album's obvious highlight. Believe me, the unknowns are exceedingly worse. Zooks from the Spark and Billy Moon ape the Uncle Kracker rap-country formula (and actually don't even do it justice) on ""Little Cabin Song"". Zooks, who seems to be a Sharkey protégé of sorts, shits all over the place like a stray dog. It isn't just his painfully suburban multi-syllabic style but his lyrics as well. One chorus goes, ""I used to skate around the neighborhood/ But now I just jerk off on the internet/ RESPECT!"", with a female refrain of, ""No, man, no way, he don't wanna skate."" It's interesting that Sharkey's first hip-hop album so closely mirrors Rjd2's recently released sophomore full-length. Both records tackle a diverse array of genres and, to certain degrees, they both disappoint. That said, when Sharkey mirrors Rjd2, the reflection is straight from a funhouse; Sharkey's Machine is a terrifyingly unlikable elongation of Ronnie James' new formula. The most talented artists practically phone-in their verses, the production itself is ultimately unprofessional and boring, the developing artists are completely amateur and the whole exercise comes off practically unlistenable.","""Instrumentalist"" is one the most heralded yet scrutinized positions in the independent hip-hop arena.

So Serious,The Like Young,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdceea9e61561daa77a8/1:1/w_160/bc6542f3.jpg,2004-06-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4966-so-serious/,Parasol,"Here are some facts: The Like Young have only two members. One is female. The other is male. The man, Joe Ziemba, plays guitar and writes most of the songs. The woman, Amanda Ziemba, plays drums and sometimes sings. Sharing a distinctive surname, they could either be siblings or spouses. In fact, they're the latter. They've shared a bill with The Von Bondies. On paper, The Like Young resemble another popular, co-ed, two-member band of siblings/spouses with connections to Jason Stollsteimer's Motor City group, but the similarities end there. While most of today's two-member bands, like The Black Keys and Mr. Airplane Man, seem to gravitate toward blues-based rock and, like sonneteers, find freedom in the limitations of their line-ups, the Ziembas never sound like just two people: they play tight power-pop as if they had an extra person or two. In fact, they sound closer to The Spinanes than to The White Stripes, and closer still to twice-their-size groups like Weezer or Fountains of Wayne. Tighter and more dynamic than last year's Art Contest, The Like Young's second album, So Serious, is dense with sound and noise, and not just because Joe overlays some songs with spacey keyboards and thumping bass. In part thanks to former Coctail Barry Phipps' snappy production, Joe's guitar makes a really loud noise, and Amanda's drums crack like whips while she does double and triple duty as her husband's backup singer and verbal sparring partner. None of which is to suggest that The Like Young aren't, in their own way, as elemental as any of the blues twos. Clocking in at a mere 24 minutes, So Serious is all a-jumble with catchy guitars, hooky choruses, tight drumming, and backup vocals that never run out of new ways to sing ooh and aah. However, The Like Young move from one idea to the next so quickly and frenetically that the catchiest parts are short-lived and rarely repeated more than once. ""Sabine & Me"" concludes with a propulsive start/stop jam that abruptly ends as soon as it reaches its momentum; the song's over in less than a minute and a half. Nothing on the album sounds half-baked or underdeveloped, but there's more going on in the songs' brevity than a simple leave-'em-wanting-more aesthetic. It takes several listens to grasp the guiding logic on So Serious, not just in how the songs progress but also in how the lyrics describe situations in language that sounds coded and private. ""Big ape, why don't you sue them?"" Joe sings on ""Routines"". ""Big ape, I'm giving up and laughing."" On ""Sharp or Messy"", he observes, ""When my baby head was soft, thoughts like this were never thought,"" without clarifying what he's thinking. The opacity of these lyrics is telling. In the end, So Serious reveals itself generally and implicitly: These songs form a dialogue between a couple who share not just a household but a band. The specifics, however, are between Joe and Amanda. Fortunately, they create and sustain a flurry of restless, catchy pop energy that keeps listeners from feeling either incidental or voyeuristic and that gives them something to sing along with.","Here are some facts: The Like Young have only two members.

The Slow Wonder,A.C. Newman,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96e5e6ef9596932296d/1:1/w_160/bf8f3af0.jpg,2004-06-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5898-the-slow-wonder/,Matador,"Although the Calgary Flames lost by a single goal in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals-- squandering their chance to become the first Canadian team to take home the trophy since 1993-- the vanquished hockey players' country-folk have no reason to hang their collective heads. Among their luminaries, the Canucks can count a bilingual prime minister who speaks in full sentences, filmmaker Guy Maddin, and Vancouver's preeminent redheaded songwriter, Carl Newman, who has just released, by a stride, the best power-pop album of 2004. Newman worked through his more angular pop leanings in the mid-1990s with Sub Pop indie rockers Zumpano and is now the primary songwriter in The New Pornographers. To place The Slow Wonder's aesthetics in terms that The New Pornographers fans will understand, these 11 tracks blend Mass Romantic's clipped frenetics, Electric Version's spacious tenderness, and the agile twists and turns of Zumpano, effortlessly humbling all three. On The Slow Wonder, the hooks crack apart and multiply, accruing additional catchiness the way the pumped muscles of a spinach-stuffed Popeye give birth to crops of testosterone-filled goose bumps. At one point in ""Drink to Me Babe Then"", a languid group of whistlers double themselves harmoniously before a quavering electromagnetic guitar blazes overhead; elsewhere, a fading melodian shoots rubber bands at the stars. Taken as a single document, The Slow Wonder fits together for a taut 34 minutes without lags or rough spots; viewed as collection of singles, all but a couple tracks would justifiably fill the A-side of a seven-inch. From the catchy drum-fill intro of ""Miracle Drug"" to ""35 in the Shade""'s soaring exit guitar, there's not a misfire to be found. Time and time again, Newman showcases a quaint nostalgia and a layered sense of production that often feels similar to the inventive beauty that made The Shins' Chutes Too Narrow such a whopper of a sophomore release. Like the exquisite chamber pop that Richard Davies and Eric Matthews showcased as Cardinal, these songs have a comfortable Kinks-like feel while still sporting their own unique, keenly crafted hooks. Throughout the album, Newman keeps the palette varied, cramming enough pop muscularity into his two- and three-minute blasts to infuse this genre with the life it possessed in its 70s heyday. ""On the Table"" makes use of flourishing ragtime piano, a regal trumpet emerges from the fragile tambourine and deep percussion of ""The Cloud Prayer"", and ""The Town Halo""'s sinewy cello propels like a metallic fuzz bass with zero distortion. On ""Miracle Drug"", rat-a-tat surf drums gain momentum when interlaced with brazen rock guitar licks and a quirky storyline: ""He was tied to the bed with a miracle drug in one hand/ In the other, a great lost novel that, I understand, was returned with a stamp/ That said 'thank you for your interest, young man.'"" Instead of Neko Case's swooping country intonations and general high-end foil, Newman harmonizes here with Sarah Wheeler, who adds exultant punctuation to the track's ""So why all the history now?"" refrain. Not mere ear candy, The Slow Wonder's playful, often surrealistic libretto riffs on guilt and innocence, victorious defeat, secret agents, boring rich kids, small-town saviors and the onset of revelations. Newman's concerns rest more with relational discourse and struggles than bubblegum and flowers-- fitting for an artist whose press photos show him asleep with a copy of Foucault's Power/Knowledge. Amid the hard/soft tidal wave of ""The Battle for Straight Time"", Newman chirps in staccato, ""O come sweet life, wash clean my hands/ The revolution has been left to chance/ This dawns on me every morning at about three."" Sounding a lot like a track by The New Pornographers, ""On the Table"" looks at justice as ""the deal between the thieves and exits."" When ""Come Crash"", a seemingly pure and dark love ballad enters the picture, it's more a sleepy love story written by J.G. Ballard than the wimpy sentiments of feckless and freckled romantic: ""That's luck, she led, we should be dead/ We eyed the wreck. Good god, we said/ She plants one kiss, for the road, on my chest/ Sirens came after we left."" In the Guided by Voices-inflected ""35 in the Shade""-- perhaps the album's most metaphorically charged track-- Newman plays with Cleopatra and magicians in order to win an argument, all the while trying not to miss his ride home from a bar. Although not much longer than an episode of Small Wonder, Newman has created a timeless document. These are soulful sing-alongs with grit, pop nuggets that hold up to hours of repeat play in humid bumper-to-bumper traffic, and ultimately, the sound of a great songwriter hitting his stride.

Dieu Deuil,Tanakh,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7269d034d5c69bf3708/1:1/w_160/f1c3b1fb.jpg,2004-06-08 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7927-dieu-deuil/,Alien8,"Over the past year, it's become fashionable to add the twitter and jasmine of 1970s folk to the tastemaker's stew. Sure, that sound has always been around, kept alive in both the thriving cult of Nick Drake and by the dudes who get into Tim Buckley because the hottest girl they ever knew loved his kid's voice. But if the folk trend started in earnest late last year with the homey, kitchen-sink ramble of the Fiery Furnaces' Gallowsbird's Bark, then it broke wide open in 2004 with the enthusiastic reaction to Devendra Banhart's Rejoicing in the Hand. Tanakh's Jesse Poe has been flirting with folk for some time; his 2001 debut, Villa Claustrophobia, is a rootsy, often incredibly multi-ethnic sonic bouillabaisse. But with Dieu Deuil, Poe's harnessing of organic folk and psych textures feels even more effortless-- and just a little bit genius. Working with a new slew of collaborators-- including violinist Dan Calhoune and bassist/backing vocalist Michele Poulos-- Poe has fashioned a warmhearted meditation steeped in historically American rhythms. However, the record also has streaks of Villa's afield folk enclaves. ""The Lord Is in This Place... How Dreadful Is This Place"" is a Middle East drone tinged with traditional percussion, snatches of vocal chatter, and a wavering violin lead. ""Images"" is an introspective, possibly improvisational piece that percolates with faraway found sounds, brassy cymbal, and an accordion that flits down a dark passageway like a rambunctious child thief. While these stylistic wanderings are charming-- and stippled with a pleasant warmth-- Dieu Deuil's primary thrust is a slowly setting, vaguely psychedelic Americana sun of robust acoustic guitar and keening violin. Poe's smoky baritone drifts through the whispering branches of ""November Tree"", which suggests everything from Pink Floyd to acoustic dream-pop. ""And sometimes you find a little peace of mind/ In your tinfoil stars and your bottle of wine,"" Poe intones, ""And sometimes I still need her."" Poulos' echoing harmonies ease the song's darker suggestions (""Now I know/ All of us will have to go""), as does its hangover percussive brushing and hopeful bridge. Tanakh seems to be admitting a bittersweet mood, but hoping to get out of it with some love, drugs and affection. That intent seeps through the six sighing minutes of ""Instrumental"", which finds a quiet inlet of babbling electronics, thoughtful electric guitar soloing, and tear-streaked violin. The track is exactly the type of modernist folk interpretation that's been buzzing in informed circles since the emergence of Sufjan Stevens. Although Poe's vocals occasionally seem like an afterthought, he scores big with ""Lady Eucharist"". On that track, his plucked acoustic guitar follows the loping path of a trap kit, and his shifting intonations make his brittle cerebral folk that much more engaging. Tanakh's Dieu Deuil, the boppy mysticism of Vetiver, and the healing qualities of that band's Banhart all point to something in the comet's tail. Maybe it's a purposeful move away from the ghettoizing qualities of alt-country. (""We like having acoustic instrumentation over for beers,"" people seem to be saying. ""Just don't invite Ryan Adams."") But the recent embrace of intelligent, sadness-tinged introspection could also have something to do with the sudden passing of Elliott Smith, in whom those qualities simmered like battered, fermented fruit. Whatever the larger forces at work, Jesse Poe has sketched another quiet heaven with Dieu Deuil, a record that sounds like a parchment ink of folk's roots but also basks in sun-dappled 21st Century modernism.","Over the past year, it's become fashionable to add the twitter and jasmine of 1970s folk to the tastemaker ...

Salt,Arto Lindsay,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1fea9e61561daa7641/1:1/w_160/4510a655.jpg,2004-06-08 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4805-salt/,Righteous Babe,"""You're only as good as your last album."" There are only a few artists for whom I'd waive this rule of thumb. Luckily, they've never really tested me. I was less keen on Nocturama than most of the rest of Nick Cave's catalog, and Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's latest threw me a little-- but there was enough virtue in each record to keep me enthralled by their respective franchises. Bowie repeatedly disappoints me nowadays, but I have reconciled this by imagining two distinct Bowies, one on either side of the 80s. Salt, however, has me reassessing everything Arto Lindsay's ever released, the extent to which I ever really loved him, and whether I need to forgive him, too. Lindsay's always been irreverent of the mainstream, unscrupulously dipping in and out of pop. The public has held his work in fittingly whimsical regard, as a given release might briefly capture the zeitgeist, only for the next to follow less relevant tangents. Lindsay flirts with avant-rock and pop, never fully subscribing to a genre, though an enduring affair with bossa nova colors most of his work. Reminiscent of a youthful Leonard Cohen about to lose himself entirely in listless day-dreaming, Lindsay has always let his soft, elusive vocals glisten like a layer of honey over their contained melodies. Salt, much in step with Lindsay's more recent mode, recalls neither his ""fake jazz"" combo The Lounge Lizards, nor his dance/noise project Ambitious Lovers-- and it's a long, long way from the no-wave DNA project that he began with back in 1978. Instead, it carries forth the Brazilian electronic theme instilled during Lindsay's mid-90s experiments with such artists as Vinicius Cantauria. ""Twins"" typifies this approach, pairing loose world and trip-hop flavored beats with glitchy electronics and recalling that era's The Subtle Body LP. What disappoints here, compared to, say, 2002's Invoke, is a conspicuous distance between Lindsay's sexually charged and insightful lyrics and their rightful musical home. You get the feeling that the vocal tracks could be indiscriminately swapped between songs and you'd never notice. On ""Kamo (Dark Stripe)"", Arto's Mick Hucknall-esque croon drifts meaninglessly on the technically proficient yet bland and subdued backing. Too many songs go by unnoticed, polished to such a blinding sheen that their surfaces reflect little discernable color or character. The album isn't without its pleasant moments, though. ""Into Shade"" is subtle and delicate, melting into gorgeous strings and perfectly restrained guitar phrasing. Here, Lindsay's voice interacts fully with the instrumentation rather than floating somewhere nearby in ponderous detachment. ""Personagem"" is a rich bossa nova excursion dotted with clever melodic interludes and an infectious, recurring guitar riff. The album rotates around ""Jardim da Alma"" (or ""Garden of the Soul""), a cluttered but accomplished amalgamation of Lindsay's transcontinental influences. Salt does some disservice to Lindsay's progression without entirely disgracing it. There's ample prettiness here to ensure second and third listens, but this will be no one's favorite Arto Lindsay album. As the music flickers with poise and confidence, the vocals fail to emote the seductive implications of Lindsay's words. Maybe it's this lack of cohesion that ""De Lama Lamina"" descends into squawky discordance to protest. Although Salt is mixed, frustrating, and hardly reflects the twenty-odd years Lindsay spent getting here, it's a peccadillo amidst an otherwise admirable legacy. Guess I'll be back for more after all.","""You're only as good as your last album."" There are only a few artists for whom I'd waive ...

Meeting in empty parking lots late at night by secretive arrangements, the warring clans circle each other warily, threateningly snapping their fingers. Suddenly, the hippies unleash a deafening volley of drum circle concussion, with accompaniment from that scruffy dude that plays one of those handless harmonicas. Unfazed, the hipsters form a tight formation and frantically mimeograph an acerbic zine, filled with fanged mockery of trust-fund hemp activists. Living in the war zone between these two vicious gangs is no easy job, akin to the complicated reconcilement acrobatics of a Log Cabin Republican. But somehow Gomez have pulled it off over the course of their four-album career, blending a distinctly granola throwback sound with indie's willingness to sonically experiment. The British group has yet to hit the jackpot on American shores but it seems the time for their mongrel sound may have finally come: The second day of this year's Lollapalooza features the likes of The Flaming Lips and The String Cheese Incident (and, appropriately, Gomez themselves). 'Tis a shame, then, that Gomez's trajectory toward the weird-- as traced from 1998's Bring It On to 2002's In Our Gun by an increasing employment of electronic bells and whistles-- takes a severe backslide on Split the Difference. Always one of the most American-sounding British bands, this latest album finds Gomez retreating to trad territory, filling out its 13 tracks with a healthy spoonful of sunshine daydream Ribfest ditties. Save a few tantalizing moments of sonic trickery, Split the Difference would sound safe at home amidst your local cryogenic classic rock station, a fact tipped off by a centerpiece entitled ""Sweet Virginia"". Surprisingly, that song isn't a Stones pastiche. Instead, it's a sunburn-woozy track fleetingly enveloped by a haze of strings. With ""Sweet Virginia"" and the unstable-balance-dial theatrics of ""We Don't Know Where We're Going"", Gomez hide their most dense, rewarding material in the core of the album, surrounding the tracks with accomplished but straightforward rock. Most of the blame for that rote sound can be placed on the nicotine-meets-Vedder vocals of Ben Ottewell, who surrounds many of his growling performances in ""Where Ya Going?"" and ""Me, You and Everybody"" with tired distorted-bass riffing. Bandmate Ian Ball is a less compelling vocalist, but most of his songs (""These 3 Sins"", ""Nothing Is Wrong"") succeed as anthemic and catchy yet simple arena rock. So Split the Difference is an opportunity missed, with Gomez settling into a safe, well-worn ocean colour scene at a time when an adventurous indie/jamband hybrid might've clicked with Lollapaloozers. In the kind of irony us hack reviewers love, Split the Difference does anything but, as the band merely courts and comforts the Phish mourners rather than mediating a college campus version of the Camp David Accords.","On university campuses across America, a decades-long battle has been waged between the two major archetypes of collegiate music fan ...

Baby Monkey,Voodoo Child,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9755e6ef95969321410/1:1/w_160/a16484cb.jpg,2004-06-07 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8496-baby-monkey/,V2,"Whether anyone realizes it or not, there are great battles of psychological extremes at work within these seemingly straightforward Pitchfork diatribes. As doggedly opinionated and viciously direct as we'd like to appear, a pen-wielding soldier is never fully in control of the personal bias and at-large influence that can taint his otherwise pure, Zen-like focus. The trick, say the masters, is to acknowledge your humanity (really!) and use it to your advantage. Trust your first impression. Don't believe the hype. And never forget that the music is why we're all here. So, perhaps as a direct challenge to my consistent-- but never unchecked-- enthusiasm, Schreiber's assigned me to the latest from Moby, who's recording under the guise of Voodoo Child, which the Vegan One most prominently assumed back in '96 for his ambient The End of Everything. Now fresh from a smash world tour in support of 2002's 18, and still criticized in some circles for his lucrative stroll down Madison Avenue to coincide with 1999's soulful Play, here Moby seeks to reconnect to the dance floor and, as he says, the ""underground."" Baby Monkey's liner notes also relate Moby's rekindled love for ""hard, sexy, straightforward dance music,"" borne of a quintessential late-night episode at a Glasgow warehouse party. To the writer seeking a levelheaded approach, the conflicts are many: Given his widely publicized, somewhat nutty beliefs, Moby is an incredibly easy target. Some of his past efforts have been pretty solid. Some of his past efforts have been total fluff. A pseudonym means very little when an artist is credited with writing and producing the songs. It's hard to be ""underground"" when you're an international superstar. No review, positive or negative, will alter the selling power of this album. And so on. Sun-tzu says, ""Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy: This is the art of retaining composure."" Certainly nobody's enemy, Baby Monkey is still, in a word, hubbub. In the face of disorder and the opportunity to ground the enemy into bits, the writer must retain composure. As such: Baby Monkey is a clinic in what's bad about bad dance music. There's no life breathing through these 12 flaccid tracks, each of which would've seemed regressive even in Moby's early-90s heyday-- today, each is a total anachronism. The production is shockingly gauzy and weak, and the result is an easily dismissed, second-rate throwaway that only the most devout Moby zealot could appreciate. The bluesy funk of Play is largely absent, surfacing intermittently in the vocal samples of ""Gotta Be Loose in Your Mind"" and ""Unh Yeah""'s gospel organ and piano tinkling. And Moby's earliest work showed more complex rhythmic structures and clever sampling; the driving intensity of 10-year-old tracks like ""Besame"" and ""Go"" are replaced by a petulant skiffle and metallic sterility that would sound best pumping from a dentist office P.A. The album's marginally shifting rhythms fluctuate a few BPM here and there, dipping into light techno (""Minors""), light house (""Last"") and a light breakbeat (""Gone""), but there's never enough guts for the dance floor, nor enough smarts for the headphones. Where Moby should be shining behind the keys, ""Light Is in Your Eyes"" sticks out only for its soft, worn-out ""We Are All Made of Stars"" synth melody, and the obviously titled ""Synthesisers"" [sic] barely keeps its head above the same waters he tread with 1993's also obviously titled Ambient. With so much great dance music being made today, it's a shame this will get more press than most by virtue of Moby's name alone-- which is supposed to be concealed by the Voodoo Child alter ego in the first place. But dance music accepts no revivalism-- especially when your update isn't as good as your original. So although it means stuff like Baby Monkey is hardly necessary, it is at least to Moby's credit that he's much better at moving into the future than at looking to the past.","Whether anyone realizes it or not, there are great battles of psychological extremes at work within these seemingly straightforward Pitchfork ...

Brother Is to Son,Br. Danielson,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45813d1975652138cba/1:1/w_160/9d216e42.jpg,2004-06-07 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1113-brother-is-to-son/,Secretly Canadian,"It seems unlikely that the awkward mythology of Daniel Smith-- the righteous, scripture-spouting founder of the Danielson Famile; the New Jersey graduate student who transformed his thesis into a theology-heavy debut record; the dude in the tree suit surrounded by wide-eyed kids dressed like doctors and nurses-- could ever be matched by his music. Except that Daniel Smith, recording here as Br. Danielson, is the proud owner of one of the most confounding and unapologetic human yelps ever committed to tape. Each note is a shambling, raucous mix of high-pitched squeak and frantic chant. And the best part is that Smith isn't quixotically crumpling to the ground, holding his nose and speaking-in-tongues, or perpetuating a new brand of cheeky faux-gospel-- he's actually singing, and it is actually insane. Labelmate (and here, guest banjoist) Sufjan Stevens regularly performs live while wearing homemade angel wings, as his backing band forms a perfect line, horizontally spread on either side of him, sporting matching outfits (jeans, sneakers, loose white t-shirts, wings), all freshly scrubbed and calm. Br. Danielson embodies what it might sound like were Stevens' entire troupe to simultaneously go completely fucking bonkers-- reeling, horrifying, and surprisingly outlandish, yet still retaining an impressively pristine, Langley Schools-ish impishness: Danielson may seem crazy, but he is not without a certain childlike grace. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there's also something vaguely menacing about Br. Danielson, although it has less to do with frenzied morality and everything to do with general sonic precariousness. Swallow your fears of indoctrination and face this record as is: The religious undertones of Brother Is to Son, Smith's first record without the Danielson Famile, are mostly incidental. The hyper-aware will pluck out repeated references to righteousness, the devil, God, crosses, and purity-- though there are certainly no more of those here than on most country or metal records. In fact, any anxiety produced by Brother Is to Son's broadcast can be tied to Danielson as performer, not Danielson as prophet. Ultimately, it's Br. Danielson's sharp barks and frantic strumming that will test your patience, and not necessarily his moral/religious agenda: Shockingly, Smith's music actually manages to wholly supercede his reputation, burying avant-Christian doctrines in a flurry of banjo and drums. Overall, Brother Is to Son is pulled a little too tight, and subsequently feels perpetually on the edge of collapse, as if Danielson's good intentions are just seconds away from bursting into a million flaming bits. The awkward push of his cartoonish squawks counters the gentle pull of his parables, a tension perfectly reflected in his choice of instrumentation: acoustic guitar backed by big, thunderous rock drumming. The resulting sound is both compelling and off-putting, and Brother Is to Son occasionally suffers from the repetition of its primary trick. Still, there's something hopelessly intriguing about Smith's particular brand of neo-folk, and his bizarre frenzy can be addictive-- Brother Is to Son has moments of perverse brilliance (opener ""Things Against Stuff"", which wonders, ""Which side are you on? Who loves stuff? Who votes for things?"") followed by bits of oddly palatable folk-psych (""Cookin' Mid-County"", which admits, ""This music/ It is killing us!""). With America more politically polarized than ever, and extremists on all sides becoming toothier by the second, it would be awfully easy to dismiss Br. Danielson as a novelty act, or as some kind of screeching religious missionary, sent to wash clean indie rock's many sins. Brother Is to Son is weird, but it's neither incomprehensible nor didactic. Consider yourself saved.","It seems unlikely that the awkward mythology of Daniel Smith-- the righteous, scripture-spouting founder of the Danielson Famile; the New ...

Libra,Philippe Besombes,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4575e6ef95969320856/1:1/w_160/41562204.gif,2004-06-07 05:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1112-libra/,TapiocaTapioca,"Although Philippe Besombes was a member of two influential French groups in the late 1970s, Pôle and Hydravion, any esteem he now enjoys is overwhelmingly due to his prominent inclusion on Nurse with Wound's notorious ""influences list,"" which famously graced the liner notes of their 1979 debut. Unsurprisingly, NWW's Stephen Stapleton (master of the griseous, warlock-from-the-North image) simply had to reward Besombes for a biography any promising young eccentric would covet. A toiling candidate for a doctorate in chemistry at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Besombes got through his student years with a steady intake of French pop, free jazz, free love, and free hallucinogenic substances. Eventually growing bored with traditional instrumentation, Besombes turned to the lavish lifestyle and opulent environs of a true early electronic pioneer: breaking into neighboring physics labs and ""borrowing"" their equipment. During any interims, he intrepidly traveled to the mideast, brushed up on his tabla and sitar skills, studied briefly under Stockhausen and Xenakis, and finally released the Libra soundtrack, his finest work, at the ripe age of 24. Besombes' music may have anticipated everything from The Bomb Squad's mélange of shattered shrills to Luke Vibert's anarchic slapstick-hop, but no one should be more grateful that Besombes turned from chemistry to electronics than his old lab partner. If Libra is any indication, Besombes was the Jerry Lewis-in-cardiac-arrest of the lab, leaving lighted Bunsen burners in his pocket and sporadically diving into shelves of glassware. The deceivingly titled ""Jaune"" is a rabid merry-go-round horse in Toontown, unleashing volatile potions of carbonated poisons and barbarized tape-loops before sizzling down in the sound of exploding construction sites and psychedelic exhilaration. On ""PJF 261"", cut-up dialogues are doled out over gurgling, choking sound effects and cathedral diva sirens, like some epochal brawl between the blasphemous and beatific. Although this iconoclastic, convoluted genre is the most efficient at merging the popular and avant-garde music of Besombes's training, Libra (perhaps because it's a soundtrack) ventures through almost every experimental genre of the early 1970s, from spliced tape works and minimalism to loose folk-rock and dub. This bizarre, endlessly fascinating juxtaposition is all the more mysterious since the film itself has seemingly fallen off the edge of the earth. Nevertheless, if the poster is to be believed, the movie apparently concerned the madcap meandering of a translucent cowboy who happens to be as big as the moon. Whether or not the poster's synopsis is accurate, this is undeniably the music a moon-sized cowboy would listen to: ""Raggacountry"", for example, is Delta sitar being windswept over echoing percussion. ""Boogimmick"" is a self-parodic blues-rock solo haunted by probing satellites and pulsating, parched craters. ""Rugby"" takes a similar guitar riff and throbs it over free jazz drumrolls and orgiastic, weeping babies. Imagine cramming a hack Ronnie Van Zant clone and a pedophilic clown into a mother's womb, and you're halfway there. The more ambient pieces are just as worthwhile, despite that their random dispersal throughout the album makes for a dizzyingly uneven listen. The droning bells and plangent crashes of ""Theme Grave"" start off as an erudite, flickering tonal exploration and end in a dignified funeral procession. On the comparatively lengthy ""Avécandista"", a screeching child's voice is taunted on every side by seemingly arbitrary organ conflagrations and Morse code squalor. Unfortunately, the four songs not written by Besombes are vastly inferior to the other material on the album, bristling with dull Bacharach-folk and lethargic brass choruses, somehow both lazy and fatiguing simultaneously. Not even the sparsely sprinkled prog-distortion is enough to lift them out of their doldrums. To make up for these embarrassments, Israel's MIO Records has filled out the album to 76 minutes with four bonus tracks, one of which is a brooding, 20-minute prepared piano piece. The purpose of any prepared piano is to display the physicality (and percussion) of the instrument, to extract the piano from that ambiguous, incorporeal domain of sound we traditionally associate with music and kick it around a bit. Besombes' version succeeds remarkably, letting razors shred the strings and frame, toppling marbles down the soundboard, and variously knocking, battering and scraping the piano's sides and interior. At one point, even the rusty hinge of a piano bench is lent to the instrument's tottering rhythm. The remaining bonus tracks are instructive, if only because they point towards the synthesis of the popular and experimental that Besombes' music personifies. Despite Besombes' current obscurity, if you need only one song to represent the stunning collision of genres that resulted in what you and I call modern music, you could do far worse than ""La Ville"", Libra's masterpiece and a tune that even today smacks of audacity and ingenuity with its manic jazz drumming, spy-soundtrack bass, Latin percussion and backwards tapes of conniving seagulls and destruction derbies. ""La Ville"" feels like one of those moments that irreversibly set the pop music of the last quarter-century on a course for trip-hop and noise-rock, veneration and confrontation, culture-clashes and mind-melts. And, as if that wasn't enough, it's in fucking French.","Although Philippe Besombes was a member of two influential French groups in the late 1970s, P\xF4le and\n\ Hydravion ...

Louden Up Now,!!!,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a708c0084474cd0c0ad6/1:1/w_160/7fa61100.jpg,2004-06-07 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1764-louden-up-now/,Touch and Go,"For club-friendly artists to become or remain relevant on the strength of a single great 12-inch is not unusual, but when the New York-based funk/rock octet !!! kept a prominent finger in the disco-punk pie with merely one song, last year's ""Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story)"", it seemed an impressive feat. Two years earlier, the band had cut a self-titled full-length that went mostly unnoticed. But by 2001, !!! had latched onto an updated no-wave aesthetic that countless other bands would soon mindlessly mishandle. The featured 10-minute dancepunk epic-- stuffed with more hooks and movements than entire full-length albums-- not only reclaimed the band's reputation, but promised new life to the genre itself. The band's trajectory was the genre's trajectory, and with ""Me and Giuliani"", !!! and disco-punk began to stray away from safe post-punk skronk, and gradually draw nearer to more adventurous disco sleek. On Louden Up Now, !!! have progressed toward a slicker, more disco-oriented sound. The band generally forgo the sloppy horn lines and heavy punk riff backbone of their debut, opting instead for slow, trance-like builds. At the heart of the album is a suffocating, dark electro-acoustic disco smog that recalls Black Devil's 1979 Disco Club EP, as well as Larry Levan, Walter Gibbons, and Arthur Russell's more pessimistic contributions to the disco underground. All of which is to say that the production on Louden Up Now is particularly commendable. Over the course of songs such as the first single ""Pardon My Freedom"", ""Shit Scheisse Merde (Part 1)"", and album highlight ""Hello? Is This Thing On?"", the !!! rhythm section boasts not only an adroit shape-shifting timbre, but enough subtlety for close listening. Louden Up Now isn't all dancefloor thrills, however: !!! smartly dodge pigeonholes and one-trick-pony accusations with some less punchy moves, such as the psychedelic grind of ""Dear Can"" and the bright but blunted moonbounce of ""Theme from Space Island"". On ""Shit Scheisse Merde (Part 2)"", the band even curiously infringe on the drum sampling and sparse rhythmic figures of their sister group Out Hud. So the production is great, the songbook is varied, and the band is tighter and more ambitious than ever-- the only problem with Louden Up Now is the unfortunate paucity of ideas within the songs themselves. It's as if the equivalent of all of the musical energy of ""Me and Giuliani"" has been spread over the album's nine other tracks. While Louden Up Now's electronic embellishments are finely mutated, the album sorely misses the huge, nearly anthemic guitar hooks that, to my mind, make !!! so exciting. Also sadly absent from anything other than ""Me and Giuliani"" are the distinct chapter-like movements of !!!'s longer numbers. On both ""Shit Scheisse Merde (Part 2)"" and ""Dear Can"", !!! get caught in a groove and seem hesitant to explore other potential variations or moods. !!! always flirted with the possibility that they'd fail to fully deliver on the promise of ""Me and Giuliani""-- unfortunately, just as a single 12-inch can make a reputation, that track can also serve as a potentially unforgiving benchmark. Louden Up Now contains plenty of good ideas-- as well as two tracks (""Pardon My Freedom"" and ""Hello? Is This Thing On?"") that could soundtrack summer dance parties and net !!! a larger audience. But even when one considers that most listeners are no longer apt to be wowed simply by the concept of dance music with guitars-- and that most of !!!'s audience has come to accept Nic Offer's generally asinine lyrics as an inherent part of the group's unique dynamic-- Louden Up Now is simply not the indie-dance juggernaut many hoped it would be.","For club-friendly artists to become or remain relevant on the strength of a single great 12-inch is not unusual, but ...

Slon,Chicago Underground Trio,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70bb1335d7bf1698f7e/1:1/w_160/1482404e.jpg,2004-06-07 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1767-slon/,Thrill Jockey,"The Chicago Underground Trio's third album, Slon, was conceived (although not recorded) during their 2003 ""No War"" tour of Europe, a trip that coincided with the early days of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The first piece is called ""Protest"" and the album is dedicated ""To all the people who have lost their lives at the hands of U.S. imperialism."" So it's a political record, obviously, and an anti-war statement-- and it may also be the Trio's apology to the world for what they and many others feel is a corrupt and malicious U.S. administration. Slon is also entirely instrumental, which happens to be my favorite kind of political music. As a result, ""Protest"" works on several levels. Chad Taylor's forceful drumming is the driving surge and Noel Kupersmith hammers out a bassline that sounds like a variation on the theme to Mission: Impossible while Rob Mazurek charges forward on cornet, ironically referencing the martial roots of his instrument while mixing anger into his tone. It's a powerful piece of music given an extra intriguing wrinkle by the subtle processed sounds that cycle through its final third. The continued incorporation of electronics into the Chicago Underground Trio's music (both Mazurek and Kupersmith are credited with ""computer"") is one the best things they have going for themselves. The squishy German glitches that underpin ""Slon"" sound great with a horn floating above them, not unlike Jan Jelinek's collaboration with Computer Soup. ""Palermo"" continues in Tron land, folding field recordings into a hypnotic rhythm loop and setting them against a swooning keyboard line. And ""Kite"" begins as a completely abstract piece-- with creepy drones that sound pulled from the circuit board of an early Raymond Scott experiment-- before the band adds various improvised horn squeaks, rimshot taps and e-bow groans. So while ""Kite"" has a whiff of classic 1950s avant-garde, the Trio add sweetener, upping the accessibility. Yet, when the Trio are so inclined, they can sound downright traditional, as on ""Sevens"", where Mazurek invokes Freddie Hubbard and Taylor manhandles his cymbals like mid-60s Tony Williams. The trad instruments also dominate on the funky ""Shoe Lace""-- which has hints of hard bop-- and the wistful midtempo closer ""Pear"", which finds Mazurek with a mute and Taylor dutifully tapping out the ""ch-ch-ch"" on the ride. While like-minded bands such as Tortoise and Isotope 217 can seem stymied by the endless possibilities of the studio, the Chicago Underground Trio seem to always eventually return to jazz structure and rhythm. So although the Trio operate within a smaller sphere than many of their contemporaries, they remain open to possibility and produce inspired combinations of seemingly different sounds-- and the economical and engaging Slon is evidence that they're on to something.","The Chicago Underground Trio's third album, Slon, was conceived (although not recorded) during their 2003 ""No War"" tour of ...

All the Fame of Lofty Deeds,Jon Langford,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca05e6ef95969322eae/1:1/w_160/be696c52.jpg,2004-06-06 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4681-all-the-fame-of-lofty-deeds/,Bloodshot,"As a visual artist, Jon Langford, who founded the influential and still active punk group the Mekons, works in a decidedly folk art milieu. In addition to running a website (www.yarddog.com) to sell his and others' pieces, he has illustrated almost all of his recent albums with his own folk-inspired work, in which Dia de los Muertos skeletons predominate. The cover of his latest, All the Fame of Lofty Deeds, shows a grinning skull in a Grand Ol' Opry suit, its fleshy hands holding a guitar, flanked by two blindfolded sidemen. Scribbled like graffiti, a thought balloon expresses his cryptic thought: ""I quit!"" But Langford is entirely too well-connected to be the kind of American outsider this type of artwork implies: He is, after all, signed to Bloodshot Records, and has collaborated with scores of artists in a variety of projects, among them the Pine Valley Cosmonauts, which recorded three volumes of anti-death-penalty songs featuring Steve Earle, Neko Case, Kurt Wagner, and Rhett Miller, among others. As a solo artist, he has worked with Alejandro Escovedo, Kelly Hogan, The Sadies, and Jon Rauhouse. His music falls squarely in an American country music tradition, and he has released full-album tributes to both Johnny Cash and Bob Wills. Ultimately, Langford knows he's no outsider. He uses folk art tropes the same way hipsters wear Ramones t-shirts-- as something to aspire to, a totem for something more real and meaningful than the here and now. Envisioned as a concept album about a rags-to-riches-to-obscurity country music journeyman (a reading trumpeted more loudly by the press release than by the album itself), All the Fame of Lofty Deeds paints a cantankerously bleak picture of the present moment, lamenting the sad state of country music and American politics. He culls these 11 songs from disparate sources: In addition to the Procol Harum and Bob Wills covers (""Homberg"" and the lovely sign-off ""Trouble in Mind"", respectively), the album includes two tracks backed by the Pine Valley Cosmonauts and another by Hillbilly Lovechild. He also throws in a ""fast version"" of ""Nashville Radio"" and a new take on ""Going Over the Cliff"". Through these and other songs Langford suggests that freedom and justice reign only in the margins of society, where artists can clearly view the corruption of the center. ""The Country Is Young"" compares America to a spoiled infant: ""Just crawled to its feet/ Takes a step and collapses."" It's a thin metaphor to draw out over a full song, but Langford realizes its comic potential: ""You gotta wipe its fat ass and buy it some toys/ Not too big on the sharing."" But All the Fame of Lofty Deeds isn't a wholly political album; about half the songs speak to Langford's contentious relationship with country music. The title track laments the hollowness of celebrity, while ""Nashville Radio"", the only song here that directly deals with the concept-album narrative, plays even better as a music veterans' indictment of a rootless system that insists its roots are strong and deep. ""Going Over the Cliff"" shows the stakes in the business are recklessly high: ""Success on someone else's terms don't mean a fuckin' thing/ I'm going over the cliff."" It's all or-- more likely-- nothing. To ignore the concept album pretensions of All the Fame of Lofty Deeds is easy enough, especially since Langford ostensibly did not write the songs to fit the concept, but devised the concept to fit the songs. In its hardscrabble arrangement the album does manage to capture the art-for-art's-sake spontaneity attributed to true folk art. In this regard, Langford's outrage over the state of country music and the world cannot overcome his genuine excitement in absorbing his beloved influences, jotting down some great lyrics and some hummable melodies, corralling a herd of talented musicians, and making music that is intelligent, angry, and most surprisingly, fun. Lofty deeds, indeed.","As a visual artist, Jon Langford, who founded the influential and still active punk group the Mekons, works in a ...

Faded Seaside Glamour,Delays,by: Stephen M.

His voice may not possess much discernible grit or soul, and it may not be unique-- he's taking cues from Jeff Buckley and the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraser-- but it is still unusual and powerful, perfect for the Delays' dreamy pop. For better or for worse, the vocals are the most singularly compelling element on the band's debut, Faded Seaside Glamour. Hailing from Southampton, the Delays were first incarnated as Corky, an outfit, the band readily confesses, that played run-of-the-mill acoustic Britpop. They regrouped as the Delays and purposefully distanced themselves from their former scene, eventually gaining more-than-modest success in England-- a top 20 album and tours with Tim Burgess and The Sleepy Jackson. To their credit, the Delays try never to rely on Gilbert's pipes to justify themselves. They work to bolster their ephemeral sound with studied songcraft and an array of touchstones ranging from 60s pop to 120 Minutes alternative. The muted piano on ""Bedroom Scene"" recalls War-era U2, the melody and chorus of ""Long Time Coming"" late-period Waterboys. Greg's brother Aaron Gilbert programs the sampled steel drums on ""Wanderlust"" to serve the same purpose as the elaborate guitar feedback on My Bloody Valentine's Loveless. The Delays' commitment to playing as a cohesive unit is admirable, if not altogether advisable: Despite some strong ideas and a few memorable songs, Faded Seaside Glamour remains notable mostly for the vocals: the album's ups and downs follow Gilbert's voice almost exactly, best when he's hitting high notes, mundane when he's not. Displaying a restraint that is perhaps not the best tactic here, he doesn't go all Mariah on every song, but the album's best songs-- ""Wanderlust"" and ""Nearer Than Heaven""-- shamelessly push his vocals to the forefront while the band provide inventive, unobtrusive accompaniment. As Faded Seaside Glamour progresses, however, he tones down his performance considerably, which drains songs like ""No Ending"" and ""Bedroom Scene"" of their dreamy drama. Nothing quite clicks as well as those first two songs, when the careening vocals excuse the gushy lyrics. Lyrics, obviously, aren't the band's forte, and Gilbert's falsetto usually obscures what he's expressing with it, which proves advantageous. The songs typically center around blotchy sentiment (""The air is thin and hard to breathe/ The sweetness that you lost to me/ Despite the noose around our kiss/ I try to tell myself this is/ No ending"") or Hallmark philosophizing (""How can you grow old/ You were not trying?"") that ultimately breaks the mood of the music. Curiously, one of the Delays' best tracks doesn't even appear on the album: ""Zero Zero One"", a B-side to ""Hey Girl"", features no lyrics at all, just Gilbert oooh-ing and ahhh-ing around the upper registers while the band-- especially Aaron Gilbert and bassist Colin Fox-- break out the canned strings and the slow-dancing rhythm section. It's three minutes of atmosphere in search of a soundtrack, but it focuses so closely on the band's strengths that it gets them farther from their original Britpop and nearer to heaven than anything on Faded Seaside Glamour.","Yes, Greg Gilbert has an impressive voice: Earthbound, it has a grainy, adenoidal whine that suggests a less abrasive Billy ...

He would sit on his porch in California and play flute to accompany the songs wafting through in the trees of his backyard. Dolphy found that if he listened closely, he could detect the patterns in the chorus of bird chirps, and he was inspired by the way these melodies included notes that landed in between the ridged pitch delineations of his flute. In his later years, composer John Cage did not own a record player or a radio. He found the idea of pre-recorded music to be unbearably dull, and he indulged his listening needs by tuning into the traffic noise beneath his New York apartment. Sirens, voices, tire squeals and engines-- though man-made, the sounds were assembled with the indeterminism of nature, a quality Cage sought to emulate by consulting the I Ching when structuring his own compositions. What we learn from Dolphy and Cage is that to make music, you first have to listen. For a series they called Met Life, Chicago label Locust Music asked six artists to listen, record, listen again, respond, and then compose. Here's how it worked: The artists were directed to make a field recording ranging from 10 to 20 minutes and then record a ""response"" (this could be interpreted any number of ways) to said field recording. The six lovingly packaged CDs of the series collect the results of these experiments. The first volume of the series, reviewed earlier for Pitchfork by Andy Beta, was Keith Fullerton Whitman's fine Dartmouth Street Underpass. Au: Recycling
The Hague provides the roadways, brass band parades, favorite pubs, and civilian chatter that Au capture over the course of their 16-minute active field recording-- ""active"" because the duo of Jan Borchers and Paul Klaui are riding microphone-equipped bicycles throughout the city to mine its sounds. Much more than the other releases in the Met Life series, Au's recording, ""Cycling"", is a remarkably cinematic one: On one hand, they can't control the sounds that occur in the city, but on the other they can and do film them discriminately to make sure at least one sound is more prominent than the rest-- as proof, it sounds like they even brake for a few moments to give the brass fanfares their due. Other times, we only hear a pleasant spray of spinning spokes, and from this we may assume Au are going out of their way to present dynamically different environments in The Hague. The field recording benefits from their smart sculpts. Their subsequent remix, ""Recycling"", does not alter the time or continuity of the original. Instead, Au opt for complementary ambient stylings via Borchers' gentle guitar line and Klaui's electronics, which are alternately pleasant to correspond with the loud moments on ""Cycling"" that speak for themselves, and brooding to accompany less momentous passages that are so quiet it's kind of creepy. Reynols: Rampotanza Grodo Rempelente
The field recording here is no great shakes. To bring the sound of the street to life you need a certain amount of fidelity, and this walk among construction workers in Buenos Aires sounds vague and distant. It was recorded in 1994, perhaps on substandard equipment. The best that can be said of it is that there seems to be a lot going on back there somewhere, and listening to the field recording while walking around your own city can be profoundly disorienting. The response track compensates to a degree. It begins with creaks and groans, as the piercing jackhammer sounds and voices calling out to be heard above the traffic seem are tucked into place amid surges of feedback. And the last half finds the street noise joining the three men of Reynols in a strange jam that could be the soundtrack to a circus nightmare. Some machine clanking occasionally stands in for percussion, and the voices of the workers are shaped to fit with Reynols' warped vision. But most of the sound is Reynols going it alone, performing a surreal march back through the same torn-up streets. Erdem Helvacioglu: A Walk Through the Bazaar
An open marketplace in Istanbul is Erdem Helvacioglu's chosen setting. Helvacioglu captures the overlapping voices and middle-distance commotion beautifully. The clear and detailed audio snapshot, which features vendors hawking their wares, families humming together as they stroll past, and music bleeding in from a nearby boombox, is as richly revealing as a well-framed photograph. The opening section of the response track finds Helvacioglu crafting his own soundscape by mixing beautiful drones with well-placed samples from the bazaar. Eventually, some beats join in and the track grows upbeat and hectic, but Helvacioglu is careful to preserve the dreamy mood established by the introduction. The effect of hearing voices that became so familiar in the opening track blending with the music is striking, like the musical realization of a recovered memory. Chris Delaurenti: The Night I Met Maria C_____
It's a shame that this disc is such a one-trick pony: Seattle's Chris Delaurenti first records 16 minutes at the Wallingford Transfer Station, a waste factory, and then for his response piece, pieces together the most salient parts of a night out drinking-- getting ""wasted"". That Delaurenti makes the pun is bad enough; that he actualizes it to this extent is almost completely asinine. The content of both recordings makes for some of the series' most boring stuff, though content here was always secondary to Delaurenti's silly joke. That said, the bit where Delaurenti records himself urinating is, to a degree, touching. Matmos: Rat Relocation Program
When a street rat crashed the Matmos pad, made noise late at night, and nibbled away at their food and threads, the duo of Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt were faced with potential hypocrisy-- they couldn't kill the rodent because, in fact, they were keeping another as a pet. As a compromise, they decided to catch it in a cage and record its protests: angry metallic rattling, pained wails, and the long and terrifying silence that spans their irregularity. It's a torturous listen. The relationship between vast silence and the rat's shrill rant becomes the centerpoint for Matmos' response piece, ""Rat Relocation"". The duo keeps the field recording completely intact, and instead, with breakneck cut-ups and drills of noise, they attempt to heighten the degree to which the rat shatters the listener's peace. Tense swells and foreboding slurps are the initial enhancements, before the response of Schmidt's bass solo begins to viciously compete with the rat's squeals. The match-up is somewhat absurd, but the changing tides of this farcical battle seem to redeem what could have seemed a truly heartless response piece had it not existed at all.","Genius multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy loved to jam with birds.

Onanie Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols / Pop Tatari / Chocolate Synthesizer,Boredoms,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34ec0084474cd0c0242/1:1/w_160/5acb12bd.jpg,2004-06-06 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11677-onanie-bomb-meets-the-sex-pistols-pop-tatari-chocolate-synthesizer/,WEAWEA,"On occasion, when asked, I've been known to tell people Boredoms are the best rock band ever. Despite opposing my sworn allegiances to Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic, the Osaka collective is one of the few to flirt with me at all points in its existence. After their turn-of-the-century string of cosmic trance punk efforts, I had even less trouble convincing people these guys (and a gal) were great. However, their earliest releases still have yet to attract hordes; some fans think they're the real bore-attraction, but they're often derailed as chaotic goof-fests. As I see it, you need this Boredoms to really appreciate today's ""Vooredoms,"" to hear all the shit that went down before they found the sun. Better still, most of it fucking rocks. Isn't that a nice bonus? Boredoms actually began as a Yamatsuka Eye bedroom-recording project, represented on the long gone Anal by Anal EP, which was later appended to the band's first full-length release outside of Japan, Onanie Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols (a variation on their Japanese debut, Osorezan No Stooges Kyo, or The Stooges' Craze in Osorezan). Eye had earned an infamous reputation in the mid-80s as part of an extreme noise/no-wave band called The Hanatarash, an outfit that fused performance art, post-hardcore antipathy and self-destruction into one violent, messy bolt of shock and awe. Hanatarash recordings could veer anywhere from pure noise to primitive synth squealing to frantic DJ cutups using Rush samples, and were not only a direct forecast of Boredoms, but of 90s ""Japanoise"" in general. After recording the ""anal trilogy"" on his own (consisting of ""Anal Eater"", ""God from Anal"" and ""Born to Anal"", appended to the end of Onanie Bomb), Eye formed his ""rock"" band Boredoms, with Hanatarash member Taketani on drums, guitarist Mara Tabata (later of Zeni Geva), and bassist Hosoi. Toyohito Yoshikawa soon replaced Taketani, and when Tabata quit, Eye asked his friend Seiichi Yamamoto to join. The two had briefly played in another band together, along with future Boredoms bassist Hira, though Yamamoto didn't initially think Eye would be a very compatible musical partner. Perhaps he was concerned about Eye's history of destroying pets and demolishing clubs during his Hanatarash days. Fittingly, this incarnation of the band recorded its first LP in a self-described ""messy studio,"" preparing the grotesque, sprawling punk emissions of their early days. 1988's Onanie Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols (""onanie"" being Japanese slang for ""female masturbation"") was the overseas version of Boredoms' first album, featuring all of Osorezan No Stooges Kyo and Anal by Anal. Released on WEA in Japan and Reprise in the U.S., Onanie Bomb began the trend of Boredoms albums qualifying as the one of the strangest ever released on a major label. Much like Germany's Faust in the early 70s, Boredoms were thrust into an alternative rock spotlight despite playing ""music"" that, even by the band's appraisal (other members complained that Eye's final mix of their first record bore little resemblance to what they'd originally recorded), was hard to take. American experimentalists Sonic Youth and John Zorn were quick to champion the band, and former Bongwater/Butthole Surfers bassist Kramer would release 1989's Soul Discharge on his Shimmy Disc imprint. But well-known fans by no means make Onanie Bomb more palatable: Exhibits include Eye's anal trilogy, with percussion supplied by a drumming instruction cassette, under which Eye screams, shrieks and squirts to his heart's content. ""Born to Anal"" features angular guitar work from former member Tabata, and comes out like a badly recorded DNA demo fronted by someone who's being tattooed on the forehead. Elsewhere, on ""Boredoms, Vs, SDI"", the group drops their patented sludgy, post-Stooges take on acid-rock while Eye growls and screams to beat the band. Musically, Boredoms weren't then far from early Melvins, though their flare for grossing listeners out was without peer-- hang on for the last, semi-digestible minute of ""Young Assouls"" at your peril. At that point, they might have been best summed up by their own titles, ""No Core Punk"" and ""Feedbackfuck"", though ""Lick'n Cock Boatpeople"" arguably gives the best idea of what Onanie Bomb is about. Later in 1988, Yoshimi P-We replaced Yoshikawa (who stayed on as co-vocalist) on drums, and would first appear on 1989's Soul Discharge-- and it's too bad that record wasn't included in this wave of reissues, because it's otherwise easiest available only as a single track containing its ten songs on Shimmy Disc's Soul Discharge/Early Boredoms release. It's certainly a better introduction to the first stage of Boredoms than Onanie Bomb, with better recording quality and a more palatable ratio of sort-of-songs-to-pure-scatological-mayhem. But don't worry, they weren't through. If the debut's exposure seemed disproportionately wide, 1993's Pop Tatari was a veritable ""hit."" It garnered them enough publicity to land a spot on 1994's Lollapalooza festival-- on the main stage, no less! However, while their music had become a shade less disgusting since Onanie Bomb, it was hardly fit for the grunge generation. Pop Tatari reveled in cock-rock moves and punk bravado. Boredoms had settled into a bizarre routine of short-attention span hardcore, acidic funk and cartoonish, performance art-rap. Yamamoto breaks out his wah-wah on the last track while Yoshimi and Yoshikawa get brutal; they rip Led Zeppelin's riffs and Can's song titles with ""Which DooYoo Like?""; they seem incapable of playing the most basic hardcore riff on ""Hey Bore Hey"", yet all but invent Melt-Banana in the process. Pop Tatari also makes the argument that Boredoms were one of the pre-eminent users (or abusers) of the studio as instrument. Their mixes are all over the places, with seemingly random spikes in volume or shifts in texture, yet rather than come out muddy, Pop Tatari seems almost psychedelic in its surreal squelching of disparate musical references, baroque in its thousands of blunt details. ""Bo Go"" is as much Captain Beefheart as it is the Red Hot Chili Peppers; ""Bore Now Bore"" stomps on Devo while employing Merzbow-esque reverb and Yellow Magic Orchestra synthesizer. The epic ""Cory & the Mandara Suicide Pyramid Action or Gas Satori"" takes all comers with hazy dub reggae, and eventually blasts off into Godzilla explosions via huge, bottom-heavy drums and scream-verse that should have made 90s rap-rock obsolete before it started. A classic. It's not as though Boredoms had to further prove their insanity by this point, but to any doubters, 1994's hard-as-fuck Chocolate Synthesizer served notice that something was seriously wrong in Osaka. Cock-rock was replaced by scraping feedback and distorted tribal jaunts; gone were the strange rap attempts, replaced by abrasive no-wave textures and chanted monster vocals with trumpets singing battle cries. In a way, it was a precursor to the primal propulsion of their later records like Super Ae, but Boredoms were hardly interested in maintaining any kind of trance groove here. Chocolate Synthesizer was the final kiss-off to their illustrious past, and they would never again be this unhinged, annoying or gloriously violent. ""Acid Police"" is a noisy anthem of super proportions. Beginning with Eye and Yoshikawa's immediately recognizable ""ac-id po-lee-say!!"" call-and-response vocal, and bringing in Yamamoto's medieval punk riff, the song is a call to arms for all the wild young freaks of the world, an invitation to riot in the streets and destroy anything in sight, all in the name of the fucking acid police. And the pound: Yoshimi's orchestra of drums could topple all of downtown Tokyo. They calm down for a spell on the near-ambient ""Synthesizer Guidebook on Fire"", but burn their bridges again on ""Action Synthesizer Hero"", using sandpaper white noise as a torture device. ""Shock City"", on the other hand, tears apart any notions of a unified Bore-front in the name of fractured noise-rock and a reckless take on traditional Japanese folk music-- the grating feedback and electronic percussion are but cherries on top. But nothing lasts. Perhaps wanting to atone for their noise crimes, Boredoms crafted a different path in the latter half of the 90s, using krautrock and tropical ambience as blueprints for a calmer fury. Yet, their early records haven't lost the slightest edge for this change. This trio of reissues serves only to magnify the hold Boredoms have over modern noise-rock, represented in bands like Wolf Eyes, Black Dice, Lightning Bolt and Sightings. Better still, most of it fucking rocks. And isn't that a nice bonus?","

Sonic Nurse,Sonic Youth,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c3ea9e61561daa4fb0/1:1/w_160/5a90d99c.jpg,2004-06-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7348-sonic-nurse/,Geffen,"How? It's a question elicited by any great album, but one that accompanied Sonic Youth's 2002 return to glory, Murray Street, in particular, and will likely arise in response to any remotely decent effort from the group herein. It might have dawned on some fans only after hearing Murray Street that Sonic Youth's mean age was then roughly 45, and that the group arguably hadn't produced a record of such caliber since they were in their late 20s. And while age is certainly unavoidable, as sensitive fifty-something poets constantly remind us, it shouldn't come as any great surprise that the band still pack some alternately-tuned potency in their aging physiognomies: There are manifold examples of musicians in most every genre, besides younglings rock and hip-hop, who have continued playing, if not composing, masterfully, well into their 70s. Like the best jazz musicians, Sonic Youth have turned their love for experimental rock into a habit; perhaps more so than any other band, they've transcended the temporality of quality output in rock music. While bands like the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead continue to take the stage in a larkish clamber, Sonic Youth are still alive in the studio, where the process of making music is somewhat more draining than regurgitating old hits every once in a well-publicized while. With centenarianism becoming more of an improbable reality and less of a tall tale, it's no longer inconceivable that rock composers might thrive into their latter days, especially now that the relatively young genre has been given time to produce a few elder masters. In short, Sonic Youth aren't an exception; they're a pioneer example of a nascent rule. That said, while Sonic Nurse isn't quite as strong as its predecessor, it's equally as imbued with instrumental dexterity and impressively coherent ideas. Unlike Murray Street, the album isn't so much an expansion of form as a return to it: Here, Sonic Youth harken back to the noisome atmospherics of their late-80s work, only handing it a more crystalline production treatment that smacks of more recent releases like A Thousand Leaves. Whether the implications of the line are intentional or not is difficult to say, but when, on ""Paper Cup Exit"", Lee Ranaldo sings, ""It's later than it seems,"" the band seem to be keenly aware of their age and relevance. That self-awareness, both of an appreciably long canon and the four lives it has traversed, makes Sonic Nurse all the more remarkable. Throughout their career, Sonic Youth have indulged in as much avant-garde experimentation as they have ground out formal studio albums. If anything, the lesson taught by mishaps such as the infamous NYC Ghosts & Flowers is that Sonic Youth are best at being themselves. Fortunately, that ""self"" is an enormously vibrant and sophisticated entity, capable of evoking a broad range of moods and tones, and continually learning from its mistakes. As atrocious as NYC Ghosts & Flowers was, they never repeated its missteps, and for that it can be conveniently forgotten. Conversely, when the group hits their stride, they know to run with it, as they do here, swimmingly riding the ample momentum generated by Murray Street. ""Pattern Recognition"" opens, touching down on a well-trodden playing field of heady, arpeggiated riffage. After a brief, almost proggy intro, the song descends into a perilous odd-time build redolent of ""Candle"", as Kim Gordon brays ""you're the one"" in wontedly Daydream fashion, forgoing the bloodless beat poetry whining that often made her presence an annoyance in recent years. 16 years later, her pipes are still as seductively smoke-tinged as they were on ""Kissability"", and the opener marks the first of several pleasant appearances by Gordon on Nurse. ""Unmade Bed"", the record's only sub-four-minute endeavor, recalls the nocturnal second half of Murray Street, casting beacons of beautifully melodic guitar as it builds to a gloriously intertwined climax. As with many of the band's best songs, it takes a few listens for the riffs to sink in, but once they have, they're indelible. Dynamically, however, not every track on Sonic Nurse is as striking as the band have proved themselves capable. Murray Street's ""Rain on Tin"" was a euphoric rollercoaster ride that seemed to capsulize to the band's entire career. ""Stones"", perhaps this album's closest parallel to that song, erupts with an insurgent guitar melody after a rocky climb, and features more than its fair share of strong riffs. Yet, while doubtless a strong number, the track isn't nearly as dramatic as career highlights like ""Washing Machine"" and ""Expressway to Yr Skull"". Additionally, ""Mariah Carey and the Arthur Doyle Handcream"" is a more traditional Kim Gordon screed that extends about two minutes too long in its monotonous din to be as effective as Murray Street's similar ""Plastic Sun"". However, while those tracks do belabor the flow of the record slightly, their impotency is more accurately attributable to Sonic Nurse's questionable sequencing. While many of these songs exemplify the band in top form, they're sometimes inhibited by the record's somewhat scatterbrained narrative arch. ""Peace Attack"", in particular, suffers from mishandling. Played in isolation, the track is clever and wistful, but in its role as closing song, it feels awkwardly contrived and anticlimactic. Meanwhile, ""Pattern Recognition"", another one of the band's finest recent tracks, seems too bold an opening statement for this deeply cogitative collection. And unlike Murray Street, which was anchored by the towering middle track, ""Karen Revisited"", this issue lacks a similar axis to corral the disparate tones and give them direction. Of course, considering these minor bones of contention, Sonic Nurse is hardly what one might call a disappointment. ""The Dripping Dream"" adheres to the familiar tension/release/jam formula typified by ""Rain on Tin"", but manages to keep fresh with a reliably brilliant guitar apex before receding into a hazy wash that recalls the deliquescent waning minutes of ""The Sprawl"". ""I Love Golden Blue"" features a formless, protracted intro that points to the band's one-time relationship with seminal avant-garde composer/no-wave icon Glenn Branca. And ""Peace Attack"", despite its placement, is quietly poignant in contrast with erstwhile monoliths such as ""Trilogy"" and ""The Diamond Sea"". Even the staunchest pundits should find something to like on Sonic Nurse, while steadfast devotees are well accounted for by the record's sheer canonical breadth. Though its ultimate placement in the band's legacy is a debate waiting to happen, Sonic Nurse is certainly on a plane with some of Sonic Youth's better work. Indeed, it is later than it seems. And for a band to live up to that proclamation on its 19th album is awesome.","How? It's a question elicited by any great album, but one that accompanied Sonic Youth's 2002 return to ...

Laced with Romance,The Ponys,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a173ea9e61561daa47e1/1:1/w_160/926bd799.jpg,2004-06-03 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6538-laced-with-romance/,In the Red,"The Ponys must have daydreamt through fifth-grade English class, humming their parents' favorite Stones songs and constructing earthquaking riffs in their heads; they certainly never learned how to pluralize nouns ending in ""y."" Fortunately, the members of this Chicago quartet are putting the skills they picked up during their rock 'n' roll fantasies to good use these days. Laced with Romance, the group's debut long-player, jubilantly embraces cozily familiar riffs, stylized torrents of fuzzed-out guitars, and giddy, high-tension basslines. What sets Laced with Romance apart from the abundance of garage-rock albums released over the past few years is its ample possession of groove, by turns big and heavy or loose and sloppy. The record's 12 tracks display a deep understanding of basic rhythm, something direly lacking among the current crop of throwback acts. Ponys drummer Nathan Jerde reliably hammers every backbeat, but the propulsive silence of his ghost notes is what truly drives these songs. Likewise, Melissa Elias' high-register, Adderall-driven basslines provide a sturdy yet pliant foundation upon which Laced with Romance can traipse. Earnestly enthusiastic and studiously honed, The Ponys are a true anachronism: Rather than shoddily updating a proven style under the artistic aegis of supposed newness, they reiterate classic mod-rock with uncanny accuracy. ""Little Friends"" is as soulful a song as you're bound to hear from a group of white musicians, while ""Fall Inn"" spins a classic pop riff with invigorating sincerity. Jered Gummere's vacillating, slyly affected vocals add a slightly punkish edge to the music, which-- despite an unwieldy, live-radio sound-- often leans toward unadulterated pop in Ian Adams' flippant organ melodies. The not-so-subtly self-effacing opener ""Let's Kill Ourselves"" accomplishes the tricky feat of sounding evasively and ultimately unidentifiably redolent. Eventually, one grows weary of trying to place exactly ""where that damn riff comes from,"" and accepts the song at its immensely pleasurable face value. The Ponys have also mastered the formula for writing indelible songs that aren't cloying or overtly filched. Despite its unabashedly derivative sound, Laced with Romance is authentic enough in its fossilized antiquity to suffice even the most hardened purist. Moreover, it's ridiculously fun, and a heady reminder of why this brand of straightforward rock never grows old. Sure, for every traumatic high school poet, art school flunky, and lifelong coffeeshop musician, there's a crummy rock band bastardizing the form. Still, those slipshod groups are what simultaneously help rock achieve importance: If people care enough about something to spend their whole lives being bad at it, there must be something great inspiring all that myopic futility. Laced with Romance will surely contribute to more dross than valuable works like itself; but in doing so, it only affirms rock music's significance. And despite your feelings about the genre and its unending supply of offal, when a record is as galvanizing as this, who really gives a shit about grammar?","The Ponys must have daydreamt through fifth-grade English class, humming their parents' favorite Stones songs and constructing earthquaking riffs in ...

New England,Jason Anderson,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19d9d034d5c69bf29d1/1:1/w_160/9d33d6ad.jpg,2004-06-03 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/442-new-england/,K,"When she was only knee-high to a grasshopper, my girlfriend would tell her parents that each year's Christmas was ""the best ever."" That's not surprising: When your age is still a single digit, the present generally eclipses any strong sense of past or future. But when kids grow up, develop deeper frames of reference, and start smashing grasshoppers on the way home from school, such naive of-the-moment idealism seems more cloying and creepy than aw-shucks cute. Jason Anderson's reference to a girl, a moment, or something else as ""the best Christmas ever"" on New England's final track is therefore the sweetie-pie, slacker wisdom epiphany that broke the camel's back. What's more, in true K Records fashion, once that sentimental sentiment moseys from Anderson's quivering lips, a besotted Muppet choir chimes in to let us know that ""everything whispers 'I love you.'"" That mesh of the misshapen grandiosity of high-school poetry and the stubborn details of an insulated journal is, unfortunately, signature Anderson. Known best as the pop/rock mind behind Wolf Colonel, Anderson played drums for Yume Bitsu, toured with The Microphones, and sat-in with Little Wings. Here, he teams with Phil Elvrum, who produces and adds bass, guitar, drums, and lends vocals to ""Thanksgiving"" and the semi-upbeat ""You Fall"", and in each case, the duo tosses around in-crowd references to various forms of sinking, sagging, or going down. Anderson is less metaphorically dense than Elvrum. Instead, he's given to prolonged first-person flights and the blatantly diaristic. The minimalist verbiage of the melancholic, earthy New England shares a link with the confessional per-zines of the early-to-mid 90s, offering a blend of the embarrassing, the off-handedly endearing, and occasionally, the wise. Anderson also receives contributions from other K regulars such as Mirah, The Blow's Khaela Maricich, and Yume Bitsu's Adam Forkner. Mirah's breathy contribution to the piano-based ""A Book Laid on Its Binding"" fleshes out the track's soporific lilt, which approximates Conor Oberst caught in the headlights of an off-Broadway musical dream sequence. (For a similar but more successful example of this dewy vibe, check out Eric Trip's decade-old Love Tara.) Even when he has company, Anderson still sounds lonesome-- like an everyman archiving fears and hopes and relishing simple moments. Elsewhere, Anderson stumbles. The nine-minute, codeine-inspired monologue ""Pen Pals"" is patience-testing. It features 20-plus sentence fragments touching on familial distance, collegiate emptiness, last kisses, various forms of departure (death, drives to the airport), time, and the letdown of in-person meetings. I'll admit Anderson manages some decent one-liners, but even if you handed Leonard Cohen this entropic pace and stale phrasing and asked him to bring down the house, the results would still be a good night's sleep. In the end, despite the forced poetry, it's the lack of memorable melodies that sinks Anderson's project. Lesson to be learned: Just 'cause you say it slow and moody, develop a plotline, mention Elliott Smith, and have a girl with amazing smelling hair doesn't mean your songs work.","When she was only knee-high to a grasshopper, my girlfriend would tell her parents that each year's Christmas was ...

Past and Present Futurists,Eltro,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc57abf31b7dc7155cd0/1:1/w_160/33587b28.jpg,2004-06-03 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2763-past-and-present-futurists/,Absolutely Kosher,"From the article People Like Us: The Quirkyalones by Sasha Cagen: We are the puzzle pieces who seldom fit with other puzzle pieces. We inhabit singledom as our natural resting state. We are, by force of our personalities and inner strength, rebels. It would be better to be untethered and open to possibility, living for the exhilaration of meeting someone new, of not knowing what the night will bring. We seek momentous meetings. In 1999, with her definitive Quirkyalone manifesto, Cagen fleshed out a latent character type that's quintessentially millennial and unarguably valid. Mass media grabbed the term and launched a Lifestyle Section carnival of pop psychology that very quickly established an unlikely solidarity among thousands of deliberate, socially skeptical free agents around the world. The QAs, we've been informed, are here. I'm betting Eltro is the soundtrack to all their long solitary walks and microwave dinners for one. Somewhat identified with the heady Psychedelphia scene that's hit stride over the last few years, Eltro keep the beats fuzzy, the digital effects swarming, and the lyrics mostly unintelligible. But where groups like Asteroid #4 and the Three 4 Tens wig out with acid-test guitar and throwback harmonized vocals, Eltro rely heavily on ambient percussion and textured repetition to steer their midnight drive. Like Cagen's Quirkyalones, Eltro is ""untethered and open to possibility,"" working from a vast and mysterious palette of modern synthesized styles. Past and Present Futurists, their third LP on Berkeley's Absolutely Kosher label, arrives at some enthralling twists of crispy, catchy minimalism and offers glimpses of unbridled creativity. Due to a diffuse stylistic focus and somewhat flimsy lo-fi production, however, the album arrives at only a precious few of those truly ""momentous meetings"" that drive the Quirkyalone solo mission. That said, Futurists stages enough intriguing encounters to make the album an eccentric, somnambulant thrill-- not unlike nodding off at a strip club. The droning trip-pop of ""Love Is on the Right"" rustles over sleep-deprived vocal harmonies from husband/wife songwriting team Diana Prescott and Jorge Sandrini. Their blissed-out vocals also lift the guitar-driven ""Lady of the Highway"" to inebriated heights, as they sing of some surreal road trip where ""I was asleep at the wheel/ Lost on the highway/ The radio does as it should/ Ghostly transmissions are taking me further away."" The song builds to a low-wattage crescendo, Rick Henderson's subdued, reverential organ paired with Sandrini's guitar cranked up to about six. It's a beautiful slice of dream-pop, concise and moving, and sounds unlike anything else on the album. The other high point comes with the absolutely inexplicable ""Fram"", a jagged gouge of electro dance-punk cat scratch that also stands stylistically alone as the only ass-mover on an album of barely conscious beats. Whether Prescott's singing of a new oil filter on her Funkmobile or a replacement tube for her bass amp is hard to say, as she sing/speaks, ""I need adapters for both sides/ I need a small reel for the outside/ I need Fram."" Riiight. But the lyrics here are purely ornamental, gabbling utterances reminiscent of !!! minus the testosterone. ""Fram"" hypnotizes with a bobbing bassline, stringy guitar, industrial percussion samples, and creaking horn slices that, despite their solitary, individual drive, manage to find each other in an undeniable groove. It's an improbable commingling that works wonderfully, and it just might be enough to give hope to the perennially single.","From the article People Like Us: The Quirkyalones by Sasha Cagen:

The Third Unheard: Connecticut Hip Hop 1979-1983,Various Artists,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f1b1335d7bf1699176/1:1/w_160/980298ee.jpg,2004-06-03 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2003-the-third-unheard-connecticut-hip-hop-1979-1983/,Stones Throw,"Stones Throw's recent old school hip-hop compilation, The Third Unheard, opens with Tony Pearson performing as Mr. Magic. The backbeat for what was, in fact, New England's first hip-hop track, ""Rappin' with Mr. Magic"", sounds remarkably like the break from Chic's ""Good Times"", famously sampled by New York City's Sugarhill Gang for 1979's ""Rapper's Delight"". Magic's beat is not ""Good Times""-- it's actually a live band re-recording of Vaughn Mason's ""Bounce, Rock, Skate...""-- but his track's similarity to ""Rapper's Delight"", which is generally considered the first successful hip-hop single ever, seems a boldly confrontational move. Lyrically, the parallels are even more apparent. Mr. Magic, who built the Southern Connecticut hip-hop scene on his own after hearing Kurtis Blow's ""Christmas Rappin'"", spends nine minutes defending the rap abilities of the Constitution State, concluding with an ode to loyalty: a roll call of Connecticut towns. Magic's point is that the Connecticut scene could step to anything coming out of NYC, and while that may not have been completely true, CT did produce a worthwhile crop. New York, of course, never really got on the commuter rail to check out Mr. Magic, or Pookey Blow, or The Outlaw Four, or Willie Brown & Woodie. In fact, the City itself was close enough that if aspiring Connecticut rappers really wanted to be a part of the New York scene, it wasn't such a hassle to move there-- much of Southern Connecticut commuted to work in New York anyway. It's reasonable to assume, then, that Mr. Magic's scene was extremely committed to itself, yet still reaped the benefits of New York's close proximity-- it was an insular scene, but not devoid of influences. Which, along with the downright fantastic tracks recovered here, is what makes this compilation is so fascinating. With The Third Unheard, Stones Throw's Egon and Peanut Butter Wolf perform two great services to hip-hop. First, they successfully reconstruct an extremely talented and fiercely loyal musical scene that was clearly part of the early New York old school, even if the Big Apple didn't actively assume so. Secondly, the tracks on The Third Unheard are gloriously littered with quotes from early old school New York singles, which in itself implies that even early on, hip-hop was extremely conscious of genre. So that's the historical stuff; obviously, though, the tracks here are fun as hell. Mr. Magic's introduction is followed by two tracks from Magic's 12-year-old nephew Pookey Blow: one of them, ""Get Up (And Go to School)"" samples the heavy auxiliary percussion and sparse guitar hits of Herman Kelly's ""Dance to the Drummer's Beat"", adding some cartoon-dreary synth and kazoo solos, all while Pookey laments being in school, falling asleep in English class, and wasting time when he could be rapping. In the end, though, Pookey agrees with the title's directive: ""You gotta go to school and learn all you can, if you wanna be the president of""-- I think (and hope)-- ""Japan."" Mr. Magic takes the kazoo shtick one step further on house-party song ""2001 Kazoos"", for which he recruits the Positive Choice band to back his own rap and even more persistent synths, whistles, and kazoo choruses. The Outlaw Four's ""Million Dollar Legs"" boasts one of the comp's catchier choruses (""Just dance to the rhythm of The Outlaw Four!"") and perhaps its thickest groove, not to mention plenty of individual gems (""How you doin' pretty mama? It ain't no thing/ If you wear your panty hose with the static cling""). The song finds its counterpart in the equally catchy ""Shake Your Booty"" by the 3 Chillie MCs, whose open desire for wealth and recognition marks a shift in tone from the rest of the disc: ""We've paid our debt, we did our time/ Now we're here to make money off our rhyme."" Clearly, The Third Unheard's most bizarre track is Willie Brown & Woodie's ""Ventriloquist Rap"", where, in fact, Willie and his puppet Woodie trade verses over Earth, Wind & Fire's ""Best of My Love"", anticipating the schizophrenia Madlib feigns with Quasimoto on Madvillain's ""America's Most Blunted"". If nothing else, The Third Unheard is an extremely refreshing return to the carefree spirit and high-level energy of hip-hop's formative stages. Unburdened by tradition during this early era, Mr. Magic and the Southern Connecticut scene dove headlong into excitement, blissfully unconcerned with the potential influence or importance of their recordings-- let alone whether their art might one day evolve into pop music's most visible form.","Stones Throw's recent old school hip-hop compilation, The Third Unheard, opens with Tony Pearson performing as Mr. Magic.

Ignored upon their release (presumably due to that awful bandname), the best of Disco Inferno's early 1990s work has been increasingly championed over the years and seems set to deservedly make the paperback edition of rock's history books. A deft mix of creative sampling, tender, sinewy melodies, and caustic, intelligent lyrics, Disco Inferno were one of the era's most restlessly creative bands, but drowned in the slipstream of Britpop-fueled nostalgia. At a time when Beatles worship and consensus-forming was usurping UK rock's post-Acid House surge of creativity, Disco Inferno understood that technology needn't be the enemy of guitar-rock and that songcraft and progression aren't oppositional forces. After a few promising but unrewarding years as Joy Division clones, Disco Inferno hit upon a seemingly simple but ultimately world-opening idea: wiring their instruments through samplers. Instead of merely engaging in pop-will-eat-itself po-mo by regurgitating elements of records, film dialogue, or other media, DI engaged with the whole of the world, using their setup to trigger sounds that ranged from running water, the wind, and whistling birds to stomping boots, car crashes, and angry voices. The idea is so simple it almost seems quaint, and had they left it at that, it could have been even gauche or potentially gimmicky. Fortunately, DI frontman Ian Crause's poignant and striking lyrical sensibilities and gift for melody matched the band's unlimited sonic possibilities. The approach was folded into DI leader Ian Crause's songs of pre-millennial tension and the results perfectly exemplified the fractious uncertainty and naïve promise of the post-Cold War world. Crause explored the gaps between history, technology and humanity in much the same way he did between art and reality, sifting through the rubble of a century of cruelty and warfare and being confronted by equal parts hope and anguish, beauty and cruelty. The peak of DI's powers came with their series of EPs released between 1992-94-- Summer's Last Sound, A Rock to Cling To, The Last Dance, Second Language, and It's a Kid's World-- but D.I. Go Pop is nearly as urgent and key. The most challenging and least ""pop"" full-length in the band's catalog, D.I. Go Pop retains the arpeggios and fractured melodicism of their then-recent singles, and adds increasing layers of disorienting samples and paranoia. Like its misleading title, D.I. Go Pop is an album of contradictions: Prescient, uneasy ballads like ""Even the Sea Sides Against Us"" and ""A Whole Wide World Ahead"" recoil from the potential cruelty of human nature but are tethered by an aching off-kilter beauty. On much of the album, Crause's bitterness and aggression seems trapped in a swirl of larger sounds, his voice and fears struggling to be heard or comprehended above the dins of abstract noise and the weight of the world around him. If Technicolour offers a far more accessible set of songs, it also makes for a less rewarding listen. Where Crause swam against the tide in D.I. Go Pop, deeply blurring his track's barest elements with his samples, the seams are much more evident on Technicolour. The title track's wall of sound approach and the punch and backbeat of ""Things Move Fast"" even seem to carry some echoes of (gulp) Oasis. Elsewhere, the jangle of ""I'm Still in Love"" shifts from windswept loneliness to the chaos of warfare, and DI even toy with elements of spybeat and disco (""Sleight of Hand"") and whimsy (the single, ""It's a Kid's World"", which seems to re-imagine ""Lust for Life"" as a medley of children's television show themes). Technicolour isn't a groundbreaking record like its predecessor-- and in the band's linear history, was a disappointing step-- but it's still a charming blend of hooks and impressionistic sounds. And until someone gets around to reissuing those EPs, it's a fine second step into Disco Inferno's singular world.",,9.3,
Mantra of Love,Acid Mothers Temple,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff25e6ef9596931fe44/1:1/w_160/ab33c1a6.gif,2004-06-02 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23-mantra-of-love/,Alien8,"Acid Mothers are strong folk. You'd think they'd tire quickly, all tucked away on their island, strewn about on tree roots while baking their lungs and throats to a knotty green tinge. But instead of waltzing through life like hippies, they manage to not only tour and put out records every year, but also to fill those albums with 30-minute jams and assorted freakouts. And while evil jam bands would fill that space with guitar work taken from the Classic Rock Manual of Clichés, Makoto Kawabata and company assault listeners with frighteningly dense walls of white noise, psychedelic swirl effects and, yes, even guitar solos-- albeit ones that are more Merzbow or Keiji Haino than Gary Rossington. Truly, AMT's endurance and threshold for cosmic lashings are both worthy of admiration. But how much AMT can you take in one sitting? If there's anything this band has taught us-- via records such as 2002's Electric Heavyland and the ferocious Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso U.F.O-- it's that they're not afraid to reach for the upper regions of consciousness. On Mantra of Love, they offer two titles over the course of one hour, never faltering along the way, and it's as if we listeners are just brief visitors passing through a never-ending, spontaneous group trip. For all I know, Kawabata has hundreds of hours of this stuff on his hard drive-- at any single moment, this record's sheer volume of sound is a clamor to behold. However, if you aren't dialed into that the particular space AMT inhabits (for me, it's the mystical fire-baptism standby), you might not hear their glorious noise for all the, well, glorious noise. ""La Le Lo"" begins as a lengthy psychedelic ballad sung by Cotton Casino (who doubles on ""beer & cigarettes""), who is accompanied by her own ghostly backing vocals. The band is playing a mantra as Casino waxes earth-mother stylings to the moon. The serenity is broken by a patented AMT rave led by Kawabata's electric sitar (!) solo. Ace rhythm section Tsuyama Atsushi (""monster bass"") and Koizumi Hajime hold things together, as does the generally decent recording quality (not a given for these guys), but the real money is in effects-- lots and lots effects. Much like France's Richard Pinhas or AMT's countrymen in Les Rallizes Denudes and High Rise, the band understands the collaborative power of solo + overdriven Moog sirens and screams. And, also like those artists, Acid Mothers can go on all night if need be. About 25 minutes into this piece, any hell that hadn't already broken loose gets its due, and the band speeds to a fiery climax before winding down into glimmering astro-ambience. The second track, ""L'Ambition dans le Miroir"", also begins as a minor ballad featuring Casino's haunting solo vocal. The Mothers set her up with a faux-blues drag and a thick buffer of synth-rays; when Casino actually enters, she fights for airtime with an array of falling stars and cosmic dust. However, this time there is no overwhelming solo to power the comedown. Casino intermittently coos in the background while droning horns keep the auxiliary pixie haze from evaporating. As they showed on In C and La Novia, AMT are more than adept at creating calmer storms-- listeners just have to catch them in the right light. Mantra of Love doesn't necessarily capture the most inspired moments in their canon but as usual with this band's records, it's rarely at a loss for moments of horror or grandeur.","Acid Mothers are strong folk.

Trampin',Patti Smith,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a478c0084474cd0c04c8/1:1/w_160/e0845ac9.jpg,2004-06-02 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7276-trampin/,Columbia,"Patti Smith kicks off her ninth album, Trampin', with what sounds like a call to arms: ""Come on, girl/ Come on, boy/ Be a jubilee."" That word, ""jubilee,"" hangs heavy with meaning. Commonly connoting a commemorative celebration, this Biblical term also refers to a period of emancipation for Hebrew slaves. It was adopted by the abolition movement in the 1800s and by the civil rights movement a century later. And it says a lot more about the album and Smith's intentions than the title Trampin' does: Mixing the personal and the political, she examines her own and the country's past while inciting activism in the present-- a jubilee as both remembrance and protest. If any musician can expose the lies of the age and urge her listeners to action, it's Smith: She started as a visual and dramatic artist in the late 1960s, when activism was swelling at college campuses across the country; in the early 1970s, when the previous decade's revolutionaries went underground, she put her poetry to Lenny Kaye's guitar and created a highly idiosyncratic form of punk that bore surprising longevity. Her early albums still sound fiery and fidgety, resisting the genre gentrification that has desanguinated her contemporaries, but on Trampin', she is so preoccupied with the past that she fails to adequately capture the present. As for the past, Trampin' finds particular inspiration in the civil rights movement: The album's title comes from a spiritual made famous by Marian Anderson, which Smith lovingly covers at album's end. The nine-minute ""Gandhi"" re-creates a childhood illness as the mahatma's defining experience and namechecks Martin Luther King Jr., but ends with a more timely imperative: ""Awake from your slumber/ And get 'em with the numbers."" Trampin' is Smith at her most deferential: She looks to figures like Gandhi, King, Anderson, and even Bob Dylan on ""Stride of the Mind"" for spiritual guidance. While this approach may be valid and even occasionally compelling, for the most part it robs the album of most of its urgency and dulls its outrage. In a sense, Smith hides behind these historical leaders, letting their names and legacies stand in place of her own anger and reasoning. In comparison to these tracks, the 12-minute epic ""Radio Baghdad"" sounds much braver and riskier, trading concision for dramatic vitality. Less an anti-war poem than a noisy self-exorcism by an American ashamed of her country's actions, the song expounds on Baghdad's history, culture and ruin, and conjures the kind of righteous fire missing from ""Gandhi"". Smith yelps ""shock and awe shock and awe"" with such mighty defiance and disdain that the words sound hardly human-- it's the fiercest moment on the album. However, Smith, intending each line to be a targeted missile, occasionally lapses into bumper-sticker lyrics like, ""We invented the zero/ But we mean nothing to you,"" and, ""Robbing the cradle of civilization,"" whose catchy cleverness threatens to undermine the song's message. It's perhaps a testament to her explosive performance that the song ends with a genuine and meaningful catharsis, which Smith manages to sustain through the short, elegant title track that follows. Given the complications of the album's political messages, it should be no surprise that the most heartfelt and memorable songs on Trampin' are Smith's personal commemorations, like ""Mother Rose"" and ""Trespasses"", which are shorter and more traditionally structured. Smith's late husband, former MC5 guitarist Fred ""Sonic"" Smith, still haunts her music, as it has on every album since 1996's Gone Again, but here, that sadness is leavened by the reassuring presence of her children, both of whom play on the album. In fact, Smith wrote ""Cartwheels"" for her daughter Jesse Paris Smith, who accompanies her mother on piano for the title track. These people feel more immediate and more connected to Smith than any of the historical figures she tries to summon, so the gravity of her personal life ultimately outweighs the confusion of American political life. They offer the reassurance of security and certainty, of questions with clear-cut answers, something she finds in the era of civil rights but not so much in our present-day predicaments. What keeps Trampin' from being a failure of imagination is her dogged insistence on searching for something solid and sure to bring to the discussion; what she finds may not offer many solutions, but it does gravely illustrate the burden of giving a shit in the first place.","Patti Smith kicks off her ninth album, Trampin', with what sounds like a call to arms: ""Come on, girl/ Come ...

With Christopher Sandes featuring Pickles and Price,Andre Ethier,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf25e6ef95969322f62/1:1/w_160/89edd6b1.jpg,2004-06-02 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2906-with-christopher-sandes-featuring-pickles-and-price/,Sonic Unyon,"Toronto's Deadly Snakes play scrappy, guitar-heavy garage-rock that belies a brash and collective love of shaky Delta blues, big American soul, and sweaty Detroit R&B.; So it hardly seems a surprise that the Snakes' scruffy vocalist, Andre Ethier, has released a solo debut (with the help of pianist Christopher Sandes and rhythm section Pickles and Price) that applies the exact same preoccupations to mid-1970s piano-folk? The resulting record is more restrained, focused, and narrative than anything in The Deadly Snakes' explosive discography-- but, happily, it's not much quieter. All of the tracks are first-takes, peppered with tiny mistakes and glib, spontaneous gurgles. Subsequently, the record is pleasantly disjointed-- a creaky and fragmented smattering of story-songs. Ethier's vocal gymnastics are often compared to Bob Dylan's, and while their respective pipes may overlap in tone and syntax, it's the pair's shared affinity for bleak-but-soulful growls that ultimately seals the analogy. Ethier's deep, whiskey-soaked caterwauls (""I've slept beneath rocks and trees/ Out in the clover with the honeybees/ Won't you let me put my suitcase down?"") are hollow and heartfelt, riddled with emotion but delivered with damp, blank-faced apathy. Backed by Christopher Sandes' expert, diddling piano lines, Ethier's acoustic guitar and ukulele, and Pickles and Price's upright bass and drums, Ethier's vocals somehow become the stubborn centerpiece of nearly every track: mesmerizing, weird and totally raucous. But despite all the Dylan overlap, Ethier's debut is still more an unapologetic homage to Randy Newman than a ""New Dylan"" potshot: Sandes' piano noodling, when wed with Ethier's guttural rumbles, points directly to mid-70s Randy, matching piano balladry with misfit storytelling. Ethier perfectly embodies the overeducated-outlaw archetype (see: Hunter S. Thompson), entertaining and irritating women (""I've been a fool and philistine for you/ Please don't make me sleep out in the cold""), eschewing the law, and forging on and on. His songs are populated by a revolving cast of erstwhile, parcel-toting vagrants (see: Crazy May, Dirty Dave) who may or may not be wearing shoes-- sinners who lob rocks at giant wasp's nests and crush insects with their boot heels while dice fly high, cash is rolled tight, and no one ever seems to know or remember where they're supposed to be sleeping that night. It's all rough road stories and rollicking piano fills-- everyone uses a jacket as a pillow and curls up to snooze with one eye open, twitching themselves asleep to sound of gently brushed drums and Ethier's throaty whispers. There are far worse ways to crash.","Toronto's Deadly Snakes play scrappy, guitar-heavy garage-rock that belies a brash and collective love of shaky Delta blues, big ...

A Piece of Sunshine,Tahiti 80,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87bc0084474cd0c0e35/1:1/w_160/1c7d56c9.jpg,2004-05-31 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8259-a-piece-of-sunshine/,Minty Fresh,"Just like that daintily wrapped, pseudo-gourmet brie stocked on the Safeway shelf near the Kraft Singles and shredded cheddar, Tahiti 80's creamy, dreamy delicacies are manufactured for easy export. Xavier Boyer and his gang of merry Parisians embody that quintessentially Gallic combination of élan and ennui, vigor and boredom-- those seemingly antithetical traits the French can so easily capture with the slightest Gauloises-punctuated gesture or well-placed Camus quotation. With A Piece of Sunshine, Tahiti 80 masterfully temper their continental contradictions with tender melodrama and songs sung in surprisingly facile English, turning out a sophisticated, trans-Atlantic paean in the universal language of pop. Their third outing on Chicago's Francophilic imprint Minty Fresh finds Tahiti 80 at their most succinct and confident. Here, they've trimmed the psychedelic pomp from last year's Wallpaper for the Soul to reveal a radiant core of impeccable songwriting and elevated arrangements. Even in its gel-capped accessibility, the album remains complex and absorbing, a gorgeous, multifaceted jewel of acid-washed guitars, glittery horn flourishes, and frayed electronic texture. While Tahiti 80 are certainly beholden to the great bubblegum symphony conductors like Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, their streamlined packaging and electronic frills also resemble FM radio champs like The Cardigans and The Beautiful South. The whistled melody that bisects ""Listen""'s jangled guitar and sweeping Mellotron matches the sober theme of Boyer's lyrics: ""It's easy to think you are special/ Simple to find out after all/ You're just like anybody else/ That's all."" The brooding ""Aftermath"" hints at anxious foreboding, its minor-key pedal steel and glitchy, space-rock effects hinting at some looming depression the song's gilded chorus keeps at bay, while the folk-funk of ""Don't Misunderstand"" segues from gentle acoustic strumming into a lush electronic crunch, a duality that's presented effortlessly and effectively. In a culture where all art is high art-- from Herbie the Love Bug and Jerry Lewis to Manu Chao and Daft Punk-- where Serge Gainsbourg's biggest multi-platinum hit was straightfacedly titled (translated from the idiomatic, idiosyncratic French) ""I Love You... Me Neither"", turning seemingly standard radio-friendly histrionics into pop perfection comes rather easily. To wit: Sunshine's peak moment, the inexplicably titled ""Antonelli."" At precisely three minutes, five seconds of undeniable glory, the song rises halfway through this underlong album and stands out like a monument. ""Antonelli"" features Tahiti 80's brilliantly precise blending of diffuse pop elements: grandiose horn parts, grinding electronic bass, sonorous drums, echoing guitar, all wrapped up in shimmering, airtight production. It's a soaring, fully realized instrumental pop anthem that wouldn't be out of place standing next to Stereolab at their most ambitious or The Flaming Lips at their most sober. When the album finally closes with ""In My Arms"", a bittersweet acoustic ballad, we're ready for a comedown. Even at a mere 25 minutes long (barely qualifying it as an EP in some circles) A Piece of Sunshine manages to pack in a stunning amount of music. Tahiti 80 cuts off more than just a piece; they lay out the whole damn sunshiney pie on the table and dole out more than enough to share.","Just like that daintily wrapped, pseudo-gourmet brie stocked on the Safeway shelf near the Kraft Singles\n\ and shredded cheddar ...

Glass Floor,Maritime,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c465c0084474cd0c36a2/1:1/w_160/9aea1152.jpg,2004-05-31 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5590-glass-floor/,DeSoto,"We may mock what we are to be, but it's far easier and much more fun to mock what we once were. That said, I take no shame in branding Maritime dainty, callow guitar pop for snuggly teenagers; that's the context in which I enjoyed lead singer Davey von Bohlen's work with The Promise Ring, even the lamentable Very Emergency. But if there's one thing I've learned from reviewing music, it's to take nothing for granted. In that respect, Maritime, the collaboration between von Bohlen, former Dismemberment Plan bassist Eric Axelson, and Promise Ring timekeeper Dan Didier is as legit a candidate as any for my approbation. In fact, I really wanted to like it, despite the bounty of reasons to suspect dreck. Perhaps, I thought, von Bohlen, in cahoots with the virtuosic Axelson, might have regained the edge he'd lost during his latter period with The Promise Ring, or finally stylized his affinity for bland power pop. If only. Unfortunately, Maritime doesn't vindicate my wishful thinking. If there's any difference between this album and von Bohlen's lackluster recent output, it's that this collection somehow manages to be even more tepid. However, the album does make a tempting come-on in its opening two tracks. ""The Window Is the Door"" reshapes Chris Carrabba's acousticized love balladry into something more genuine and infinitely less vomit-inducing, probably for von Bohlen's reluctance (or inability) to belt his mundane verses with an ardor disproportionate to their profundity. ""Sleep Around"" is a sleek exercise in nouveau piano pop, handling a potentially disastrous array of strings and horns with unexpected finesse. Featuring some of Glass Floor's strongest melodies and a fluid lyrical narrative, the song suffers only from von Bohlen's unashamedly lacking vocal cords. By now, it's no secret: The man can't sing. Often enough in the past, von Bohlen's songwriting has outshone his prominent vocal ineptitude; it's when he attempts to make his tunelessness endearing that his songs become unbearable, and unfortunately, this is the case with most of Glass Floor. There was a time, back in The Promise Ring's heyday, when great tracks like ""Is This Thing On?"" and ""Why Did We Ever Meet?"" were the standard, not mere anomalies. However, since 1999, von Bohlen has fixated on feeble contemporary pop, resulting in a string of effete, unduly flaccid albums whose occasionally winsome melodies have been asphyxiated by flat production and unenergetic performance. Here, tracks like the soporific lullaby ""A Night Like This"" are the norm, and as such, the album is an arduous slog. Pining love songs are notoriously difficult to execute, but one way to generate at least some intrigue is to avoid writing songs that actually sound like they're about pining love. A contrast between form and content can be helpful when dealing with particularly trite subject matter, and that doesn't apply exclusively to feckless lyricists like von Bohlen. But perhaps the real disappointment of Glass Floor is that it tarnishes Eric Axelson's previously flawless reputation. After playing a starring role in The Dismemberment Plan, where his dexterous playing and effortless meter manipulation often buoyed the band's corybantic compositions, here, he's sadly mollified. Only on the closing track ""Human Beings"" is one of his lines even remotely distinguishable from von Bohlen's rhythmically staid guitar parts, and unsurprisingly, it makes for one of the record's few interesting moments. Most albums are at least somewhat frontloaded, but when a record sports only two truly strong numbers, it's hard even to describe it as such. ""The Window Is the Door"" and ""Sleep Around"" are by far this album's highlights, not because they're exceedingly better than the rest of the material, but because Maritime's style of lukewarm guitar pop is so tedious by comparison. By song three, Glass Floor has already waned past its endurable limit, with nearly a dozen indolent tracks to go, and von Bohlen's cloying strains make it difficult even to use the disc as innocuous background music. There are far more appetizing things to stick in one's discman than Glass Floor, and I don't mean strictly CDs.","We may mock what we are to be, but it's far easier and much more fun to mock what ...

The Taste of TG: A Beginner's Guide to the Music of Throbbing Gristle / Mutant TG,Throbbing Gristle,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a79b9d034d5c69bf3833/1:1/w_160/85d05fb7.jpg,2004-05-31 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11849-the-taste-of-tg-a-beginners-guide-to-the-music-of-throbbing-gristle-mutant-tg/,Mute,"""The four members of Throbbing Gristle wanted to investigate to what extent you could mutate and collage sound, present complex non entertaining noises to a popular culture situation and convince and convert.""
--Genesis P-Orridge, from Thee Industrial Records Story One of the most intelligently transgressive agitprop noise troupes ever to decimate homemade synthesizers and mundane rock 'n' roll tropes, Throbbing Gristle's distinct factory-fuck sounds are as abrasively fresh today as when the quartet initiated its mission in 1975. Discontent with ho-hum frameworks and facile reactionary accouterments, Throbbing Gristle set out to subvert standard musical performance, and in the process, lived up to their infamous parliamentary epithet of ""wreckers of civilization."" In the booklet accompanying the 2002 reissue of the band's 1976-1980 live opus TG24, a 24xCD box set reissuing 1979's 24 Hours (originally available on cassette only), Genesis P-Orridge states that where punk sought ""to change the nature of rock 'n' roll,"" he and his cohorts were all about mutating and re-inscribing the very nature of music itself. Whether or not they succeeded is the stuff of music-geek webboards, but either way, Throbbing Gristle possess one of rock history's more intriguing back stories. In 1969, P-Orridge and then partner Cosey Fanni Tutti formed the confrontational performance crew Coum Transmissions, inspired by the similar, earlier troupes Fluxus and Happenings. Graphic designer Peter Christopherson saw the duo's Couming of Age exhibition at South London's Oval House Theatre in 1974 and asked if he could document the event with some photos. A kindred spirit, he was quickly nicknamed ""Sleazy"" by his Coum compatriots and joined the group the following year for their Couming of Youth performance in Amsterdam. The final TG catalyst was Waveforms mastermind Chris Carter, a techie who built his own synthesizers and keyboards. He attended one of the band's jam sessions, and then signed on. Prostitution, a Coum exhibition at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in October 1976, officially brought them into the general consciousness. This Coum retrospective consisted of nude photos of Fanni Tutti and objects from Coum performances (used tampons and the like). These materials, coupled with a set by L.S.D. (later Generation X) and Throbbing Gristle's first official (and very bloody) set, caused outrage in Parliament and amongst the general populous. A full-fledged musical juggernaut, Throbbing Gristle went on to start its own label, Industrial Records, in 1977. Using the slogan, ""Industrial Music for Industrial People,"" they released recordings by themselves, William S. Burroughs, Cabaret Voltaire, Clock DVA, The Leather Nun, and others. Reveling in Burroughs' work (especially his cut-ups with Brion Gysin), as well as pornography, Aleister Crowley, and the Marquis de Sade, the band itself was suitably named after the Hull slang term for an erection. After their final appearance in 1981-- part of a two-date California tour-- they notified fans and friends of their breakup via postcards that read, ""The Mission Is Terminated."" After the dissolution, the central cast of characters-- Chris Carter, Genesis P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, and Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson-- tried to make good on their numerous manifestos and claims, spawning Psychic TV, Chris & Cosey (aka Carter Tutti), and Coil, and partaking in careers in art, writing, and video/sound production. The bifurcations are endless. It's important to see Throbbing Gristle as a supreme non-band, a group of individuals who thought fashion the enemy: Whereas Marilyn Manson gave himself digitized breasts for the cover of Mechanical Animals, P-Orridge had a pair (to match his girlfriend's) implanted for real; pop divas play with the idea of sexuality, whereas Fanni Tutti was a bona fide porn model and actress, partaking in 1975's Teenage Sin and 1970's 22-minute reel, Sexangle, among others. As relevant (and forward thinking) as ever, Throbbing Gristle have now released two new collections of material. The stronger of the two, The Taste of TG: A Beginner's Guide to the Music of Throbbing Gristle, offers 14 tracks culled from the band's four proper albums, two live tracks, and ""Exotic Functions"" from Journey Through a Body, the group's last studio recording from March 1981. Packaged with a disturbing, tongue-lashing cover image by Sleazy, there happily isn't much overlap with 1984's Greatest Hits-- only the absolutely essential ""Hamburger Lady"", ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", and ""United"" are repeated-- and while neither replaces the original full-lengths, these Cliff's Notes are as good a launching point as any. The Taste of TG opens with the ascension of hazy washes on 1977's ""Industrial Introduction"" and shifts imperceptibly to the poltergeist bells, trilling synth, and discotheque percussion of ""Distant Dreams - Part 2"" from 1981's Mission of Dead Souls, and later includes the solid tribal rocker ""Something Came Over Me"", which, along with The Dickies' ""If Stuart Could Talk"" and The Buzzcocks' ""Orgasm Addict"", ranks among the catchiest punk-ass songs about jerking off ever committed to tape. As P-Orridge enthuses: ""Something came over me/ Was it white and sticky?/ I don't know what it was/ My daddy didn't like it/ But I do it anyway/ Well, I rather liked it."" ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", from 1979's essential 20 Jazz Funk Greats, retains its compulsory techno danceability with chronic electro percussion, spare synth, and Cosey Fanni Tutti's breathy, ""I'm hot on the heels of love/ Waiting for help from above."" Other tracks are less rhythm-oriented. You can hear Wolf Eyes in the humid, monkey-cage kabuki of ""Exotic Functions"" and the tortured insect monsoon of ""Cabaret Voltaire"", the latter of which is represented here by a 1978 live rendition captured at Wakefield's Industrial Training College. The submerged, incomprehensible grunge frolic of ""Zyklon B. Zombie"" still disturbs: Over distorted electronics, a warped, somehow bubbly vocal intones: ""I'm just a little Jewish girl/ Ain't got no clothes on/ And if I had a steel hammer/ I'd smash your teeth in/ And as I walk her to the gas chamber/ I'm out there laughing."" Elsewhere, the agonizing bare-bones scream-core of ""We Hate You (Little Girls)"" serves as an utterly tweaked foil. Mutant TG, which contains eight remixes-- some by members of the band itself, and some by visionary electronic artists such as Carl Craig and Two Lone Swordsmen-- is a less powerful representation of Throbbing Gristle's work, due to some ponderousness and one too many cooks. Though a few of its pieces are interesting, Throbbing Gristle's originals are far trashier, ambient, intuitive, and less easily categorized. The edges seemed more porous and dense on the original versions, suggesting a sexier, far creepier dancefloor. Here, the French/U.S. collaborative duo Motor offer a nicely disemboweled ""Persuasion"", while Carl Craig wisely keeps intrusions to a minimum on his revamps of ""Hot on the Heels of Love"" and ""Still Walking"". Otherwise, Hedonastik turns ""What a Day"" into PBS-styled world techno, Two Lone Swordsman shift ""United""'s spooky Crowley to maudlin Trent Reznor, and Basement Jaxx's Simon Ratcliffe turns a deaf ear to ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", plowing subtleties with overloaded dancefloor trope, sonic breakdowns and an embarrassingly ""explosive"" finale. Proving they know how to best plug their own gaps with intricacies, Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti ably rework ""Hamburger Lady"". Their update maintains the original's spooky locust feel, but slows things down ever more and splices in additional dub etchings. The duo also create a ""United"" and ""Hot on the Heels of Love"" hybrid titled ""Hotheelsunited"". The new percussion, insistent pulse swells, precipitate line-breaks, rich gradations, and overall shadowing allow ""Hotheelsunited"" to end Mutant TG on an official bang. Even so, it goes without saying that this is a fans-only release. On these two collections, Throbbing Gristle not only sound current, but are current. In fact, they're still active today. Although their one-off reunion show planned for a couple of weeks ago was unfortunately cancelled, they do plan to rattle through their last-ever concert at self-curated event in April 2005. The unexpected delay has certainly bummed-out a bunch of longtime diehards, but at least newer fans now have close to a year to unpack the quartet's vast output before deciding if they'll partake in the last hurrah. That was advance warning, so arm yourself.","

Tokyo + 1,Thomas Brinkmann,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a455b1335d7bf1698921/1:1/w_160/2247c600.jpg,2004-05-31 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1110-tokyo-1/,Max Ernst,"For a time, one of Thomas Brinkmann's musical preoccupations was hand-carving crude loops into old vinyl, so we know how much he likes repetition. When he swims down to explore the depths of funk as Soul Center, he is often content to stand back and admire his perfect eight-bar rhythmic construction for minutes at a time. And why not? The dude is good at it. As a philosophically minded German with a bedrock faith in Detroit techno, Brinkmann sees the sequencer as a holy thing, and he has an unusual knack for distilling humanity from endlessly repeating blips and beeps. Tokyo + 1 is an audio travel diary of sorts, compiled from sounds Brinkmann recorded in Tokyo (with one track, the ""+1"", consisting of material recorded in the Greek city Ikaria). True to Brinkmann's nature, this is no drifting album of field recordings. Interludes of captured sound are there, but Brinkmann generally organizes his sources into tight coils of driving rhythm. On the surface of ""109 Competition"", for instance, chaos reigns, as clipped syllables and metallic clanks appear and vanish with no discernable pattern. But then, underneath, a steady pulse of noises have assembled themselves into something resembling house. The shuffle of ""Mit Sugar"" is more difficult to source. One moment it sounds like something a drum corps might march to, but then insertions of up-stroke synths morph the track into upbeat dub until unpredictable ""slips"" of the beat pull the listener out of a trance. Throughout Tokyo + 1, Brinkmann playfully varies the dance styles with which he organizes his sounds. ""3 St. 2 Shinjuku"" is hard techno, with relentlessly repetitive synth stabs, but the snippets of voice Brinkmann uses as a lead are soft and warm, providing balance and contrast. The harsh and unforgiving bang of ""Lovesong"", which explores the filthy corner where industrial meets techno, provides no such padding. Even when not shaping his files into danceable grooves, Brinkmann still lets the rhythm dictate. ""Decoupe"" consists mostly of chopped and processed bits of dialog, mostly in French, but a deeply buried synth drone and clicky beat ratchet up the tension. It feels like it could explode into violence at any moment, as the static grows noisier and more fucked up with each loop. ""Mamas"" is cruder in construction, as a series of voices and machine noises rush past like a film clip on the wrong speed fluttering uncontrollably. The closing ""Ikaria"" doubles up and loops fragments of speech, bringing to mind the early tape work of Steve Reich. Tokyo + 1 is not an easy listen but it packs a surprising amount of power considering how familiar this approach has become. Field recordings, loops, crashing dishes transformed into a drum kit-- we've heard it all before. But creative hands, whether bent over an old slab of vinyl with a pocketknife or guiding an optical mouse across a tabletop, have a way of making old things new.","For a time, one of Thomas Brinkmann's musical preoccupations was hand-carving crude loops into old vinyl, so we know ...

Uh Huh Her,PJ Harvey,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c070abf31b7dc715646c/1:1/w_160/ef72379c.jpg,2004-05-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3759-uh-huh-her/,Island,"Even though Buffy the Vampire Slayer had worn itself out by the time it ended, only a year later, it's startling how quickly the premise-- that a young girl can fight and defend herself just as well as a man-- has vanished from the airwaves. Just the next year, two of the biggest television events were the biopics of Elizabeth Smart and Jessica Lynch, two young, helpless girls who exist only to be rescued. We got a flashback to what we were missing when the Buffy spin-off Angel ended its own run. In one scene, a red-faced demon stalks up to a skinny, defenseless-looking brunette and taunts, ""Take your best shot, little girl""; the brunette, unimpressed, reels around and throws a fist right through the chauvinist demon's face, killing him instantly. PJ Harvey's fans are waiting for her to do much the same thing. Every time a new album's announced, part of her audience hopes she'll step up again as the loudest, boldest female guitar hero. It's not that Harvey sounds tame these days: Her confidence on stage and her edgy glamour have kept pace with her voice, which she has developed into one of the most powerful and seductive in rock. But the blaring guitars of Dry and unusual meter of Rid of Me were a quicker fix, and without them, Harvey's studio work grew cloistered and difficult. Since 1995's To Bring You My Love, each of her albums has turned off some chunk of her fanbase. The subtle character studies and trip-hop backdrops of Is This Desire? struck some as cold or dissonant, and her John Parish collaboration, Dance Hall at Louse Point, is (wrongly) dismissed as erratic and avant-weak, even as it showcases her most striking vocals-- at turns chilled and self-absorbed, shriekingly gruesome, or tortured by rapture. And Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea won Britain's Mercury Music Prize, but even some diehards called it slick and easy; and post 9/11, Stories actually sounds creepy, whether for the references to helicopters over New York, the song ""Kamikaze"", or that duet with Thom Yorke, which is hairlessly erotic like newts 69'ing. Now, four years later, Uh Huh Her-- with its guttural title, punk-ugly cover and its advertised guitar-focus-- is billed as a ""return to form."" But even if guitars dominate Uh Huh Her, the album ignores all expectations. Harvey plays everything but drums, and you can recognize her rough and earthy tone on the electric, played like she's molding clay. But even the buzzing distortion is focused and spare, mounted the way a collector hangs a precious Japanese sword. It actually resembles Radiohead's Hail to the Thief, a guitar album that also succeeded because of its mood-- not because the mood saves the songs, but because the terse, simple writing makes the album so intimate. The scenes of sexual tension and crisis here resemble those of Is This Desire?, but this time they don't require names or places. ""The Pocket Knife"" resembles a folk murder ballad, with a simple, perfect guitar part and lyrics like, ""Please don't make my wedding dress/ I'm too young to marry yet/ Can you see my pocket knife?/ You can't make me be a wife."" Harvey murmurs ""The Desperate Kingdom of Love"" over a gentle acoustic, and the delicate imagery enhances a straight-up love ballad; and if the final song, ""The Darker Days of Me and Him"", promises recovery after a bad break-up (""I'll pick up the pieces/ I'll carry on somehow"") the tone stays grim, and Harvey's not patting herself on the back for knowing better. Yet as careful as the atmosphere sounds, Harvey's ready to tear it apart at any time. ""Cat on a Wall"" actually sounds murky and misplaced, but ""The Letter"", the album's first single, builds in sharp bursts and terse riffs under the shrewd sexual imagery: ""Take the cap/ Off your pen/ Wet the envelope/ Lick and lick it."" And the two-minute tantrum of ""Who the Fuck?"" devolves into the caveman-talk promised by the album title-- for example, the bridge: ""Who/ Who/ Who/ Who/ Fuck/ Fuck/ Fuck/ You."" Britain's Guardian newspaper cites this as proof that Harvey's a ""certified lunatic,"" probably because they don't get the concept of ""catharsis."" By the time you hear the accordion-and-guitar interlude, or the full minute of seagull calls, it's clear that Harvey isn't making a ""rock"" record per se. And maybe to preserve the mood, Harvey doesn't give us her most striking material. Outside of a few tracks like ""The Letter"", ""Pocket Knife"" or ""The Desperate Kingdom of Love"", the album is stronger than the sum of its interludes. But if you take it as a whole, Uh Huh Her is deeply engrossing: Harvey has never explored the minimal-verging-on-primitive side of her music so thoroughly, or captured so exactly the sound of a mood swing. And once again, unlike many of her peers and fellow 90s veterans, she refuses to categorize herself. Her recorded work shows her not as a diva singer, or a rock goddess-- no matter how much her fans, or the world, want that-- but as an artist, who will seize the world or retreat from it completely if it serves her ends. Harvey has never recorded a weak record, or even a transitional album; nothing set the audience up for this disc, and we may wait another four years until she's satisfied with the next one. And that one probably won't sound like Dry, either.","Even though Buffy the Vampire Slayer had worn itself out by the time it ended, only a year later, it ...

Customs,Joel RL PhelpsThe Downer Trio,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0545e6ef9596931ff08/1:1/w_160/463ee192.gif,2004-05-26 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6264-customs/,Moneyshot,"Joel RL Phelps writes songs about regular people suffering through the direst situations: wrong-intentioned wars, social upheaval, crippling poverty, not to mention the everyday trials of romantic fallout and family illness. But rather than inspiring Springsteen-ian story songs, these predicaments add a darkly existential drama and gravity to Customs, Phelps' fourth full-length with drummer William Herzog and bassist Robert Mercer as The Downer Trio. Thematically, the songs on Customs are all linked by Phelps' quest for salvation through portraying his characters' plights: Everyone wants to be saved. The album begins with the steel drum-inflected ""From Up Here"", one of several songs that address the sacrifices of war and the friction between honor and horror: ""When the night is over and I'm in the light,"" Phelps sings, ""remember me to no one says I wouldn't fight."" ""Kelly Grand Forks"", perhaps the most hopeful track on the album, depicts romantic disappointment with a steely eye, and ""Mother I'm Waiting"" hovers bedside while a parent dies: ""Mother, I am waiting for you to be whole/ You don't know who I am/ But you know who I am."" If Phelps' lyrics are occasionally cryptic or so humorless as to make the songs feel airtight, he compensates with the generous scope of his mission: The redemption he seeks is rarely solely personal, and is sometimes large enough to encompass a family or a community. In the Seattle-set ""Lie for the Day"", for example, he assails the hollow promise of dot-com prosperity, which enriched the region's coffers but not its soul: ""All of us staring down the Green River"" ask to be kept ""safe from the darkness below."" What enervates this quest and saves it from being merely academic is the music. Like Phelps' previous full-length, 1999's Blackbird, Customs has a grinding sound that pulls from his grunge roots in Silkworm as well as from a particular brand of roots rock, which, on songs like ""Be First!"" and ""Kelly Grand Forks"", recalls the Midwestern muddiness of Uncle Tupelo. Like a blaring live show, the album is simultaneously intimate and off-putting, as it constantly demands and disrupts listeners' attention. Occasionally, however, it's a little bit too sludgy and overwrought, and the Trio indulge some ideas that probably worked well live but don't translate to the stereo. Most egregiously, ""Shame"" culminates in more than two minutes of false endings, which grow increasingly tedious with each chord. But the most powerful instrument on Customs is Phelps' voice, which seems to hold deep reserves of emotions. When he strains for high notes, his voice blares almost unmusically, revealing a vulnerability behind the thick guitar sound. On songs like ""Be First!"" and the third verse of ""Kelly Grand Forks"", his voice seems to detach from the music and rumble on its own. Fortunately, Herzog and Mercer don't even flinch at these vocal crescendos, but remain steady and imperturbable throughout Customs, like two friends helping a drunk stumble home. There's something intriguingly self-critical in Phelps' vocals: His straining signals his frustrations not only with the futility of the dismal dilemmas he describes, but also with the limits of music to convey such emotional extremes. He constantly searches but never discovers a thematic push-and-pull between the words and the notes, which turns the album's stark weaknesses into compelling strengths. It is through such sins that he comes closest to redemption-- but, thankfully, never close enough.","Joel RL Phelps writes songs about regular people suffering through the direst situations: wrong-intentioned wars, social upheaval, crippling poverty, not ...

Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou,Les Georges Leningrad,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc95e6ef9596932312c/1:1/w_160/b130ff48.jpg,2004-05-26 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4962-deux-hot-dogs-moutarde-chou/,Coco CognacCoco Cognac,"What Les Georges Leningrad lack in originality, they make up in atmosphere. The old world mustiness that permeates this record brushes your ears like armpit hair. The monomaniacal beats and shrieking vocals may sound familiar to fans of no wave and post-punk, but this Montreal band coats them with a distinguished patina; the fog rolls in as a man croons a French ballad, and the scratchy vinyl that colors the first track stays in your mind through the end. It's as noisy as any example of the genre, but instead of shrill, it's stubbornly ugly. This album has kicked around from reissue to reissue for a couple of years, and as Alien8 Recordings puts out the latest copy, Les Georges Leningrad may have already outgrown it. The other bands that revived the monomaniacal beats and shrieking vocals of no wave-- Liars, for example-- have moved on since 2002 to more individual statements, or at least to digging up other graves. And while the lo-fi recording helps the ambience, Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou is like listening into a party through two tin cans and some string; by contrast, the costumes and cabaret acts you see in their concert photos make them look sensational, like a Cirque de Soleil with no underwear. At this point, the two frontwomen may be the least impressive part of the band. If you strain to listen, you can appreciate all the gnarls and extremes in their vocals. But the lyrics, when they aren't actually swallowed in the noise, are pro forma-- who needs another jibe at women who wear Gucci and Chanel?-- and even this much noise needs personality. Why hint at sex when you could wallow in decadence? And why let off some shrieks when you could be totally excruciating? But Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou boasts several strong tracks, from the clomping beat of ""Lollipop Lady"" and the pogo-friendly ""Didi Extra"", to the herniated melody of ""Georges V"", which showcases their strained, bird-throated vocals. And while they mostly stick to fast dance tracks, the band grinds itself together like sausage on the slow-burner ""Cocktail Vampire"". They expand their noise palette with farfisas and farting reeds, and the album's best solo-- on ""Georges V""-- is just the sound of someone spinning a radio dial; but all of that's carried by persistent rhythms and a guitarist who crunches out riffs as if he's slapping someone detestable. As much as the band tries to annoy and antagonize, the seedy interludes set it apart from a crowd. Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou will satisfy, and maybe even impress, anyone who likes this kind of music. But it'll be interesting to see if they go any farther on their next album; by now, they might know how to capture the personality that this disc barely reveals.","What Les Georges Leningrad lack in originality, they make up in atmosphere.

Made to Love Magic,Nick Drake,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba105e6ef95969322af8/1:1/w_160/8a86a3fb.jpg,2004-05-26 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2445-made-to-love-magic/,Island,"The backside of Nick Drake's headstone, wedged deep into the earth of Tanworth-in-Arden's parish church graveyard, reads: ""Now we rise and we are everywhere."" The words were penned by Drake in 1974; 30 years later, they seem jarringly prophetic. Like nearly all prematurely buried cult figures, Nick Drake is reinvented each time he is rediscovered. In 2000, the sheepish, astral musings of ""Pink Moon"" became synonymous with backing a Cabrio convertible out of a house party, sparking an unlikely boost in record sales and propelling Pink Moon towards platinum status nearly 26 years after Drake's death. But with each well-intentioned revival of interest, Nick Drake slips further and further out of reach, hopelessly martyred and codified, superceded and consumed by his own tragic context. Nick Drake has become: the 26-year-old prophet, the diffident enigma, the tortured precursor to Kurt Cobain, the fallen hero, the folksinger-as-folksymbol, the self-sacrificing patron saint of lonely, disaffected teenagers-- the One who died for our sins. Even now, being indoctrinated into the cult of Drake is stupidly easy. Line the unbearably poetic circumstances of Drake's death (swallowing a fatal handful of anti-depressants, either deliberately or by accident) against the soft melancholy of his tiny canon, and witness a very specific kind of bedroom deity being birthed: Drake's three proper studio records form a bulletproof triumvirate, synergizing to create an impossibly satisfying (and telling) arc, riddled with prescient pull-quotes and expectedly dynamic emotions. Given the irrefutable magnificence of what he left behind, it's always seemed perfectly logical to assume that every single thing Nick Drake ever did should be worth piles of attention. And really, who wants to know if it's not? Thus, it's only appropriate to approach each new Drake compilation with a bit of honest trepidation, and to be anxious about the sullying of an otherwise pristine recording career. Nick Drake wrote, recorded, and released three records between 1968 and his mysterious death in 1974, but the subsequent permutation of capitalistic yearning and superfan desperation saw Drake's discography significantly (and mercilessly) puffed up by a handful of dubious posthumous releases. Some of these efforts have been worthwhile (the excellent Time of No Reply, which rounded out the first reissue of the Fruit Tree box, and Heaven Is a Wildflower, both released in 1986), some renegade (the widely distributed Tanworth-in-Arden Home Recordings and Second Grace) and some completely superfluous (1994's sloppy Way to Blue, which unapologetically regurgitates, unchanged, ten of Heaven Is a Wildflower's fourteen tracks). In 1994, Drake's pioneering producer, Joe Boyd, promised Mojo: ""Everything releasable has been released."" Compiled by engineer John Wood and former roommate Robert Kirby, Made to Love Magic is a footnote, a hiccup, a voyeuristic peepshow. It is not a revelation. Completists will revel in the resuscitation of rare/unheard tracks, including two Cambridge-era dorm demos (""Mayfair"", ""River Man""), outtakes from the Five Leaves Left sessions (""Joey"", ""Clothes of Sand""), remastered stereo versions of the mono mixes that appeared on Time of No Reply (""Rider on the Wheel"", ""Black-Eyed Dog"", ""Hanging on a Star""), two tracks with strings re-orchestrated and re-recorded by Kirby (""I Was Made to Love Magic"", ""Time of No Reply""), an early rendition of ""Three Hours"" (with Drake backed by an anonymous flautist and percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah, later of Can and Traffic), and even causal fans will be anxious to hear the recently discovered Drake original, ""Tow the Line."" Recorded just four months before Drake's death, ""Tow the Line"" has been loudly touted as the last song Drake ever committed to tape, and his pale, listless vocals do little to detract from the artist-on-the-edge theatrics so implicit in that tag-- the song would fit neatly on Pink Moon, its frail lyrics and stark strums easily maintaining the fatalistic mood of Drake's final record. ""Tow the Line"" may be Made to Love Magic's big selling point, but it's hardly the only attraction: Robert Kirby's sprawling new string arrangement on the title track, while conceptually awkward (and vaguely disingenuous), proves a marked improvement over the maudlin squealings available on previous versions. Still, Kirby can do little to stop ""I Was Made to Love Magic"" from sounding like a ridiculous, fawning homage to Walt Disney, all maudlin, unconvincing swoons and gooey swells, with Drake goofily crooning the song's title. Despite the best intentions of its creators, Made to Love Magic feels disjointed and weird, and even the most mundane of improvements somehow still seem contrived-- the new, stereo mix of ""Black Eyed Dog"" shatters the stark precariousness of the original, wherein Drake, barely singing, howled blankly: ""I'm growing old/ And I don't wanna know/ I'm growing old/ And I wanna go home."" Bolstered by a thick and ominous slathering of tape hiss, the bootleg version of ""Black Eyed Dog"" violently suggested, however inadvertently, that Drake might not make it all the way through the song-- and that tension only ever added to its morose appeal. In some ways, Made to Love Magic nobly attempts to strip Drake of his signifiers, and to cut him loose from his cross. But broadcasting Drake's comparably mediocre drippings won't alter his deification, at least not significantly. All it really does is muddy up the water a bit.","The backside of Nick Drake's headstone, wedged deep into the earth of Tanworth-in-Arden's parish church graveyard, reads: ""Now ...

William of Orange EP,The Caribbean,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5279d034d5c69bf3227/1:1/w_160/6a3fc148.jpg,2004-05-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1309-william-of-orange-ep/,Hometapes,"It's not terribly often that a band's website is good enough to make me want to recommend it along with their music, but The Caribbean's remarkably professional online domain is such a resoundingly brilliant sendup of a bland, mission statement-touting corporate website (replete with two generic employees mugging in the header and loads of meaningless business nothingspeak) that I initially thought I had the wrong URL. Given that I spend all week breathing a Fortune 500 company's recirculated air and cynically deconstructing the grammar and vocabulary of memos explaining to me why giving me less money is good for the company, I found this all quite hilarious. This kind of satire only works if you do it to the hilt, honing the vocabulary and patterning the entire site after the same concept, and to their credit, The Caribbean haven't missed a single detail. And fortunately, The Caribbean are just as detail-oriented in their music. They've even brought some of their website into their packaging for this, their second EP, styling the recording credits after a W2 form. The sense of space between the airtight drums and the colder, more open sound of the remaining instruments is immense, and it frames their occasionally obtuse lyrics in a weird, urban texture that nicely echoes the slideshow of outdoor urban photographs by cover artist Sara Padgett included on the disc. Of course, you could always argue that couplets like, ""The only way the teletype gets out is by the bounty of my merciful soul/ I'm the one who has the code,"" make a lot more sense than the average corporate memo. Actually, Michael Kentoff's lyrics have grown significantly more focused since his stint in the mid-90s with D.C.'s Townies, and he delivers a couple of great narratives on William of Orange, the best being ""The Druggist's"", a tale of summer job ennui. Kentoff's Gibbardish tenor is doubled by a piano as he lays out a scenario in which he obtains his driver's license, and a job to go with it. The way he describes a 16-year-old's real (if petty) concerns is fantastically inventive, despite its very simplicity: ""Delivering prescriptions posed a special problem with the manual transmission/ The druggist's car, a Rabbit, smelled like oil and coffee/ Had no radio or tape deck/ Begged my mom to let me drive our Chevy wagon."" The opening title track sets the mood nicely with Tony Dennison, late of Smart Went Crazy, laying down a busy yet relaxed drum part which the band coats in carefully placed electronic textures and rich, room-temperature acoustic guitars. Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service are apt comparison points, especially now that Kentoff has developed his knack for evocative imagery and inexact rhyme. The Caribbean do much to move themselves to the forefront of pop fit for late-night headphone sessions in wood-paneled dens on William of Orange, and if they can stretch this consistency over their next album, we have much to look forward to.","It's not terribly often that a band's website is good enough to make me want to recommend it ...

Sick of Waiting Tables / Still Sick... Urine Trouble / The Known Unsoldier: Sick of Waging War / Sickly Business,Sage Francis,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be15c0084474cd0c2e16/1:1/w_160/6bf34511.jpg,2004-05-25 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11742-sick-of-waiting-tables-still-sick-urine-trouble-the-known-unsoldier-sick-of-waging-war-sickly-business/,Strange Famous,"Sage Francis is a victim of circumstance. Though he initially rode high on internet buzz as one of the harbingers of the new face of hip-hop, his emotional Anticon debut led to a severe backlash among the independent rap massive. Soon enough, Francis' breed of confessional emcee would become as defunct as the Hip Hop Infinity website that fostered his development, and the notion that to be white was no longer to be right in underground hip-hop would face him with a serious obstacle. Fortunately, by that point, Francis had built up a strong following on the strength of the Sick Of CD series he'd been promoting as tour-only compilations of live, rare and spoken word tracks. The earliest volumes still contain some of his most accessible and highly regarded work, and have recently become more widely available through online outlets. His first salvo, Sick of Waiting Tables, hit hardest. This collection contains most of Sage's work from 1997-2000 and also houses his best overall songs. ""Rewrite"" is both his best-known track, boasting deeply personal and emotional lyrics that never overstep into the domain of pretension, while ""I Apologize"", featuring Anticon cohort Sole, seems in retrospect to have been the anthem for the bearded white emcee explosion. The mixtape format tends to limit an artist's impact, but Sage's mix of impressive freestyles, tongue-in-cheek battles, and an interpretation of Devo's ""Whip It"" make for his best and most enjoyable work outside of Non Prophets' 2003 debut, Hope. Still Sick... Urine Trouble draws its material entirely from 2000, and comes close to capturing the strength of the first disc. The songs boast a much more conceptual slant than Waiting Tables, with Sage personifying a newborn baby (""The Time of My Life""), stalking Natalie Portman (""Her Shlag""), traveling through time (""Majority Rule""), being patronized by armchair quarterbacks (the hilarious ""Eye of the Tiger""), and attempting to fake his own death (""Andy Kaufman""). Yet, while most of these songs are incredible, the supporting freestyles and other oddities aren't nearly strong enough to compete with the previous collection, or to pad the nine actual songs the disc contains. The downward trend continued ever so slightly with 2002's The Known Unsoldier: Sick of Waging War, despite its comparative lack of filler tracks. The standouts stick out more than ever, with ""Narcissist"" ticking and humming its way into the spot of best Non-Prophets song ever, ""Makeshift Patriot"" taking aim at the political mechanisms behind the 9/11 aftermath, and ""I'm Gonna Getcha"" dubbing and skanking the many ways that society's commercial structure can harm you (""B-b-bad to the bone, like the Coca-Cola you sip/ I'll get you, baby, giving you only soda to drink""). Still, some weak cuts (""Embarrassed"", ""Inner Conflict"") and lame extras (""Mermaids Are Seasluts"") bog the record's continuity and conviction. However, Sickly Business, this year's pileup of odds and ends, marks the first real disappointment in the series. I understand that one motive behind these kinds of releases is to offer exposure to unknown artists, but Jared Paul's ""Jesus in a Bowl of Germs"" is painful, overlong, pretentious and, if meant to be funny (or not), a complete failure. On the positive side, the Danger Mouse-produced ""Garden Gnomes"" is a biting critique of the generic bedroom emcee and his fair-weather listener (""Fuck a fickle fanbase, stuck a middle finger in their damn face""); DJ Signify's ""Cup of Regrets"" is Sage at his esoteric best; and ""Doomage"", featuring Slug, Brother Ali and MF Doom on the beat, is an instant classic. But regrettably, the standouts are less plentiful here than on previous editions, and without the typically strong rarities to back them up, the record tanks. Issuing these kinds of mixes ranks among the quickest ways to gain a dedicated core of fans. Sure, some of the guests appearances seem unfortunate additions, the revolving selection of producers gives way to varying degrees of success, and spotty sound quality tends to dominate the proceedings. But even while the decline in cohesiveness on these discs might suggest otherwise, Francis' progress over the past four years has been stunning, and newcomers looking for insight into his growth and development would be hard-pressed to locate a better indication. Still, Hope, his 2003 collaboration with Joe Beats under the Non Prophets guise, remains his finest and most accessible work to date, and stands as the best introduction to his catalog.","

""To me,"" he says, ""contemporary rock music no longer sounds young-- or, at least, not in that kind of joyous, uninhibited way."" He goes on to inveigh the dearth of songs about Iraq, child prostitution, and heroin addiction, adding, ""If bands see the need to use electric drills instead of guitars in order to give vent to their rage, well, bring it on."" One must at least give credit to the 47-year-old Hornby for admitting he's ""yet another nostalgic old codger"" reiterating a tired argument, but while the man's obviously missing out on bands like Liars and Xiu Xiu, the disturbing thing about his piece is that, in some ways, it's quite accurate. What Hornby fails to see is that this is nothing new. Rock 'n' roll has always hovered on the brink of collapse, threatening to implode under the completely unrealistic expectation that it should encapsulate everything that makes us feel good about being alive. Genres, like rock critics, grow old, and when that happens, the only thing to do is sit around and wait for young (or young-minded) guns to stumble upon a reincarnation. Hornby is also wrong for indicting age as the sole reason for this process. As proven by new records from Sonic Youth and Mission of Burma, all one needs to continue producing compelling rock music is a strong sense of adventure. That said, you won't catch ex-Pixie Joey Santiago using an electric drill anywhere on Smitten, the new album by his band The Martinis, and while I'm sure Hornby wasn't being entirely literal when he made that request, its presence wouldn't hurt here, given the utter void of noteworthy ideas and substantive songs. Smitten is at best a vague relic of Joey Santiago's febrile axe-wielding with the Pixies, and at worst, feeble schmaltz that will appeal only to fans who romanticize the notion of the bar band. The Martinis perform rudimentary rock songs that could have just as easily been recorded in 1994 and sounded dull for their time, making this record a safe pick for those who covet the blandly familiar. But just as Hornby can claim amnesty in old fartdom, so too can I shield myself as a young stalwart, antsy for something bold and daring, and The Martinis fail to deliver. It's obvious the band ache to rock, but in all Smitten's studio polish, the beats sound canned and the guitars dolefully generic. Maybe the record's problem is that it's too good; the playing is so controlled, every chorus so rigidly preordained and executed without error, that the music shakes off any potential unpredictability. Part of the charm of the Pixies was their irreverence for sounding ""tight"" or expert in any way. Perhaps their slack compositions were poignant merely as a product of the indolent era in which they were conceived, but Smitten seems a product of nothing much. Santiago makes no apparent effort to play up his Pixies roots, but the connection is often unavoidable. ""You Are the One"" is a dead ringer for ""Velouria"", both in its hushed verses and its propulsive chorus, which features ascending 4/4 changes over a snare drum knocking out steady quarter notes. And if Linda Mallari's robust vocals offer a stark contrast to the pipes we're used to hearing accompany Santiago's distinctive guitar work, they ultimately do little to resurrect the staid songwriting. Aside from the blunt-edged rockers, Smitten features an equally repellant set of languid piano pop. After the sultry tango of ""Wishful Thinking"", ""Walls of Silence"" inaugurates a series of yearning, somewhat downtempo tracks, culminating in the obligatory closing ballad, ""Into the Meadow"". Where the album previously scraped by on the bounce and brevity of tracks like ""Flyer"" and ""Out Upon the Road"", here the landscape turns particularly arid. If the hardest thing to do in sports is to hit a baseball, the toughest task in music is similarly fundamental: writing a good rock song. Listening to the Pixies, I'm inevitably reminded of how bafflingly difficult it is to make straight-up rock sound interesting. True, it's all been done before, but never mind that; derivative bands like The Strokes and The Ponys still bag great songs whose lack of originality can be forgiven for their joyful catchiness and studied perfection. The Martinis simply fail to stimulate the excitement and unchained energy that good rock bands must, and as such, Smitten feels tepid and not a little inessential.","In a recent column in the New York Times, the ever-winsome British novelist-cum-cultural-luminary Nick Hornby writes of his affliction with ...

Steady Rocking,Romanowski,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fbc0084474cd0c018b/1:1/w_160/8701071b.jpg,2004-05-25 05:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6912-steady-rocking/,Future Primitive Sound,"There's a weird draw for me when a producer arranges samples to sound like a live band. I listen for seams, trying to determine where and how the pieces were stitched together, which simultaneously keeps me hovering over the surface of the music while taking occasional dips inside. You can get to know something intimately when you're trying to figure out how it's done. Anyone who's looked through a club calendar in San Francisco in the last ten years has seen Romanowski's name. He's a Johnny-on-the-spot DJ and producer who's spun everywhere in town (I saw him perform at the 45 Session where DJ Shadow first collaborated with Cut Chemist) and he moves easily between styles and formats. On Steady Rocking, Romanowski indulges his love of rocksteady, the late-60s Jamaican form in which the 1/3 ska beat is slowed by half, thus creating a bridge to reggae proper. Romanowski credits himself with writing and producing, but it's hard to say what exactly is happening on this unusual record. On the one hand, it sounds really old, with tinny production choices and a certain air around the instruments that modern studios seem incapable of replicating. You can hear an echo from ancient wood-paneled walls soaked in thick clouds of skunk. If this is mere sonic emulation, Romanowski is a total genius, but I think it something else is happening. Several tracks feature guest musicians on guitar, saxophone and flute, yet much of the record sounds sampled, like scratch guitar and drum fills were chopped apart and reassembled bit by bit. It's possible that he's lifted chunks of songs from obscure rocksteady records, but I doubt it. The various pieces fit too tightly together to have been stitched from long sections. Wherever these sounds originated, they've been arranged into something new. And then, oddly, the record sounds new. Many of the drums obviously come from programmed machines, with beats that stiffen to the digital clock and reflect a hint of Romanowski's hip-hop roots. And then the dub touches, when they appear (J Boogie, Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto, and Gadget all offer dub remixes, though the techniques crop up elsewhere), have a sophistication that stretches beyond Tubby's four-track. ""Flat Picker"" is nothing more than a base of hip-hop beats with Jan Whitefield's impossibly supple guitar drawing curlicues in the vast open space, and it sounds like a more successful version of what Stefan Betke was trying to get at on the instrumental tracks of the last Pole record. ""Why?"" adds newly recorded sax and flute lines that sound ancient and perfect, an early 70s version of breezy island party music, and adds assorted vocal samples that sound recent. J Boogie's dub of ""Romjack Steady"" shows how dense and orchestral this music can get, as it ups the tempo and adds enough reverb to the horns to make the track sound huge. The rhythms throughout are simultaneously relaxed and forceful. Steady Rocking is contemporary production and collage methods meeting rocksteady somewhere in the exact middle, making for a seriously fresh-sounding record.","There's a weird draw for me when a producer arranges samples to sound like a live band.

"The Captain Is Dead, Let the Drum Corpse Dance",Minus Story,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c460eb335119a49ed929/1:1/w_160/6baf2c0d.jpg,2004-05-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5587-the-captain-is-dead-let-the-drum-corpse-dance/,Jagjaguwar,"Minus Story's The Captain Is Dead, Let the Drum Corpse Dance should be recorded in the mildewed, extra-wide historical scrolls next to similarly noteworthy weird/long titles, like Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven, or the positively novelistic Lifted, or, The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground. But the Lawrence, KS combo shares something musically with Bright Eyes and the similarly long-winded And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, in that their approach to pop meanders through some noisy, hilly, crazy wac funky terrain before finally divining its restless bliss. Though they seem locked in constant struggle with the sonic desire for more, more, and still more, Minus Story are quite adept at keeping loping melody and lyrical wonderment-- with the world, romance, whatever-- front and center. Vocalist Jordan Geiger seems particularly capable in this area; he's of the Modest Mouse school, where singing in a fractured falsetto is taught alongside the crafting of cryptnotic simplistic couplets. ""Heaven's a whore made of solid gold/ Her heart is a hole/ She'll never be full,"" he whinnies in ""Gravity Pulls"". Then, as the song's shuffling, echoing drums and rustic acoustic guitar are joined by a xylophone and even more guitars, Geiger switches up the pronouns to refer to his own empty heart, and harmonized vocals and maxed levels begin rising and falling with the subsequently buoyant instrumental crests. Opener ""Won't Be Fooled Again"" shares this penchant for racket-building. Beginning with a synthesized thumb piano, its title phrase becomes a harshly whispered mantra over roughly 3 million backwards-looped acoustic guitars. Trumpets join the fray, too, before a Grandaddy-esque rhythm section arrives drunk and horny. It's all quite dramatic, with an epic sway capable of turning the Neutral Milk Hotel into a chain of sprawling resorts. Given its voracious appetite for building hoary walls of psychedelic noise to the gods of skinny jeans Valhalla, this Captain's occasional threats to let go of the wheel aren't too surprising. With its treated piano, ghostly music boxes, and squirting keyboard choral section, ""Open Your Eyes"" constantly threatens to wander off course, to find some loopy hippie girl who likes suspended orchestral movements and Eskimo kisses to settle down and fart with. But it never does, and the rudder stays true. ""Eyes"" joins the eight-minute-plus ""You're My Air"" as one of the album's most powerfully melodic moments. ""Air"" also spends about half its duration hiding a prettily baroque melody in a cavernous staircase storage facility-- confused drums climb up and down the mothballed steps in search of focus, causing headaches and irritation for the feet. But the clatter eventually subsides, the screwy tangents dovetail beautifully, and the swelling recedes for four final minutes of warm and surging bliss. After all its lengthy detours, Minus Story really are making pop. They seem to truly believe in a world of slow-motion confetti, where we'll all heed Geiger's desire to breath with him, inhale the amniotic fluid of ""You Were on My Side"", and float together into church organ abyss. Like most abysses, the depths will have their share of spiny dead ends, and floating, bloated corpses, but any fear should have died with the Captain, so let the awkward indie tripping begin.","Minus Story's The Captain Is Dead, Let the Drum Corpse Dance should be recorded in the mildewed, extra-wide historical ...

The Difference Between Me and You Is That I'm Not on Fire,Mclusky,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c405c0084474cd0c35d6/1:1/w_160/56463ed8.jpg,2004-05-25 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5186-the-difference-between-me-and-you-is-that-im-not-on-fire/,Too Pure,"2002's Mclusky Do Dallas was the kind of record that makes musicians never want to make music again. Mclusky were louder, ruder and tighter, and they took more drugs. I imagine there are bands out there who've been trying for nearly two years to build themselves back up after Mclusky Do Dallas tarnished their egos by calling them names and wiping its muddy feet on their sofas. ""To Hell with Good Intentions"" stung (""My band is better than your band/ We've got more songs than a song convention""), but ""Collagen Rock"" was just plain uncalled for (""It's easy to say now their trainers seemed fine/ And their hair was a fucking delight/ But one of those bands got paid, I heard/ One of those bands got fake tits""). Yet while Andy Falkous' acidic repartees were enough to take the confidence out of any group trying to make a name for themselves, scores of fans found perverse pleasure in the record's bloody tussle. In light of that album's success, Mclusky's third long-player, The Difference Between Me and You Is That I'm not on Fire, is difficult to talk about without alluding to Do Dallas' monster-truck riffage and spaz-out lyrical missives. The Difference Between Me and You takes a rougher-hewn approach to expanding upon Do Dallas' different extremes, yet seems to share more attributes with Mclusky's 2000 debut, My Pain and Sadness Is More Painful Than Yours. Aside from each having titles involving terse personal comparisons, both records are malformed and underdeveloped, despite being similarly heavy on ideas. Andy Falkous' lyrics haven't regressed in their wittiness or caustic sarcasm, but his delivery is seldom as balls-out as on Do Dallas' ""Lightsaber Cocksucking Blues"" or their pants-soiling 2003 single, ""There Ain't No Fool in Ferguson"". Here, Mclusky appear to have recoiled from the hilarious absurdity of Do Dallas, and the move yields mixed results. Interestingly, though, the record does find the band succeeding in some as-yet-unexplored territory. ""She Will Only Bring You Happiness"", a serious contender for their best track to date, is unlike any of their previous material: more tender, more tuneful, and more conventionally pop-minded. Following a brittle, strummed guitar, Falkous delivers an anthemic, self-reproaching vocal in markedly subdued form: ""Note to self/ Be erect by half-past-ten/ Be strong/ Be proud/ Be able/ Be charmed,"" he sings, and for once, his voice-- possessing each of those qualities in droves-- is accompanied not by the reverberating gristle that's colored nearly all previous performances, but by a soaring, wistful guitar melody and a remarkably casual, downtempo rhythm. After exhausting a few verses, Falkous drops out, allowing the placid guitar line to shine, before chiming in again with the lyric, ""Our old singer is a sex criminal."" He's soon buttressed by a triple-tracked echo to form a cascading harmony that, despite the lyric's poetic oddness, is this album's sterling moment. Unfortunately, ""She Will Only Bring You Happiness"" isn't a single, and there a dozen other tracks to account for, none of which live up to that song's pop splendor, and few of which even come close. One that does, albeit in sufficiently contrasting form, is the dubiously titled ""KKKitchens, What Were You Thinking?"" Following ""She Will Only Bring You Happiness"", the track dispels any potential sea change in Mclusky's sound that may have been hinted at by the previous number. Clocking in on the short side of two minutes, the song perhaps most closely reflects the bulk of Do Dallas' material, only tighter and more extreme in both volume and tempo. ""Your Children Are Waiting for You to Die"" follows, attempting to reconcile the stylistic polar opposites of the preceding two tracks, and for the most part, works-- until an abrupt stop that stifles any momentum the band had built. The ensuing handful of tracks is a slog. In trying to accentuate the extremes of Do Dallas, Mclusky have found themselves with some throwaways on their hands. ""Slay!"", in particular, is an ill fit: Opening with a brooding vamp, the song quickly fades to black, thanks to a clumsily handled volume knob, before re-emerging with an expected jolt. In a live setting, the move might seem a pleasant surprise, but within the compressed dynamics of a studio album, it feels painfully stilted. ""Support Systems"" features more shock-and-awe dynamics, but grows dirgeful in its slow-building eight minutes. Throughout the record's entire sluggish second half, ""You Should Be Ashamed, Seamus"" stands out as the only truly solid track. Plodding, but anthemic, the song best affects the many promising ideas presented here, and retains intrigue on the strength of its central riff. Also, unlike many of the numbers here, its ending doesn't seem forced or clipped, as at 3:45, the song performs a limpid tempo change that it rides to a grinding unison halt. The Difference Between Me and You Is That I'm Not on Fire is like a delicious soup you eagerly bring to your lips, only to jerk away because it's too damn hot. It's impudent of Mclusky to serve their delectable concoctions like this; if only they showed more restraint, and dropped an ice cube in the scalding mix, the result would be more palatable. Nevertheless, trying something new and coming up slightly short beats safely regurgitating proven ideas, and even if they didn't nail what they were aiming for on this outing, well, they're probably still better than your band.","2002's Mclusky Do Dallas was the kind of record that makes musicians never want to make music again.

Have I really been so brutally chafed by this itchy, hand-me-down Clear Channel turtleneck that I can't cuddle up under Girlsareshort's velvet-blanket tweetronica? Something must've happened on the way to my thirties, because only a couple years and several all-nighters ago, Earlynorthamerican could've rubbed me just the right way. This is early-morning comedown music, quirky lullabeats buzzing along through blue skies and warm hugs, but I haven't grinned bleary-eyed into the sunrise in a really long time. Maybe the drugs were good for me after all. It's a lesson in the transitive property of music, only in reverse. I like The Polyphonic Spree, and I like Underworld, but I don't think I'd like Tim DeLaughter and a giddy nine-piece choir chirping along to ""Dark and Long"". Which is essentially what we get with the unflinchingly gleeful, Xanny-bar rattle of ""Battle Team"" and the childlike choral exhortations of ""Sunshine"", which (seemingly) earnestly inquires, ""Why do you wanna stay home all day/ Rather be inside than go out and play/ Come on, hang with me/ What's it gonna be?"" If Girlsareshort's Alex P and Daniel Z are sincere, if they're not dipping a toe in the chilly waters of irony, if I'm totally misreading this hopscotch hip-hop, then I'm playing Earlynorthamerican for my two-year-old nephew because this is some bangin' shit for toddlers. Of course, there's a market for this music beyond the Gymboree set. Even in its sterilized drum programming and cool, high-register hum, Earlynorthamerican is far cozier and much less daunting than labelmates The Russian Futurist's soaring, baroque pop, even if the two do share common G5 production values. And any IDM fan will recognize the flawless-- even innovative-- technique here, though most DJs wouldn't let Girlsareshort's immaculate geometry near their crates. But perhaps most alluring is the band's rosy-glassed twee reminiscing, evoked through cotton candy melodies, sunny analog synths, and the aforementioned falsetto (or possibly prepubescent) vocals. In fact, there's a pungent whiff of winking 80s nostalgia in the glistening churn of ""Pinacolada"". And yes, that is a sample of Rupert Holmes' campy ode to rediscovered love, ""Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"". If you have half a brain, or are still wearing Vuarnet and rocking Squeeze's Argybargy in your beat-up walkman, get on board. There's simply no edge to this music, which can be good if you're floating in a sensory deprivation tank. In the real world, though, it smacks of frivolity. There is at least some gentle contrast, as evidenced by the b-boy vocal sample and Hendrixian guitar snippet of ""The Natural"", or the dramatic electro bliss of ""Mississaga Theme"". These songs, the album's strongest, are something like musical igloos, hand-built icy shells that manage to retain a fair amount of lingering warmth within. Man. I just re-read that last sentence. God help me if I've become another shriveled, misanthropic music-loathing critic. I'm just calling 'em like I feel 'em.","For god's sake, can I really be so cynical?

Get It Twisted,Apsci,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a199c0084474cd0bfe43/1:1/w_160/21fb3084.gif,2004-05-24 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/439-get-it-twisted/,Bomb Hip-Hop,"Despite my initial fears of this record's potential for high-browed self-indulgence, it's tough not to admire any project that stands tall under the label of ""experimental hip-hop."" Expanding the borders of the most malleable of genres has got to be a good thing. By now, forward-thinking listeners have at least a smattering of options that offer a rewarding, if challenging, listening experience, thanks to the work of dizzy-headed beat freaks like Dälek, Glen Galloway, and the Anticon alchemists. Those artists not only defy presupposition, but have turned out some true class from the fickle, irresistible bitch that is hip-hop. Traveling similar spaceways is Apsci (""applied science"" foreshortened), the product of funk-punk-turned-b-boy Raphael La Motta, his wife/Aussie chanteuse Dana Diaz-Tutaan, and Def Jux workhorse DJ Big Wiz. Pairing La Motta's glitchy production and Wiz's turntable textures looks great on paper, a prospect even more enticing when Big Apple luminaries like TV on the Radio vocalist Tunde Adebimpe, Martín Perna of Antibalas, and hip-hop intellectual Mike Ladd appear on Twisted's tracklist. Add the assertion that the album is a physically unplaceable, cyberspacial collaboration, assembled from transcontinental airplane laptop sessions and portable studios in eight different countries, and Apsci's pastiche swells with creative possibilities. Unfortunately, even as the album dips into intriguing conceptual territory, the execution is pretty underwhelming, and the overall sensation is of a jumbo Roman Candle of creativity that fizzles out before it's even fully lit. La Motta's work with short-lived Thrill Jockey groove-grungers Vitapup precedes his style-mashing smarm with Apsci. There's a relieving sense of humor that thankfully underlines his straight-ahead, ""Hollywood Freaks""-style whiteboy raps and sparse, sterile broken beats. Without that hipster smirk, La Motta's lyrics would be too vapid to call quirky and his production too flagrant to call experimental. Diaz-Tutaan's silky, versatile voice seems underused; she comes from an operatic background but here we get little more than warbled Baduizms. If La Motta's own delivery was stronger she'd perhaps shine brighter in his presence, but together the couple sound more like they're pillow-talking than performing. The album's first half makes Apsci's strongest statement, though a throwaway appearance by 3 Feet High and Rising host Don Newkirk only emphasizes where the album fails to go, as does the De La-inspired role call on ""It's Apsci"". ""Tirade Highway"" and ""Never Give Up"" bring tentative electrofunk bump, the first riding Atari synthlines and subliminal effects over Diaz-Tutaan's showtune vocals; the second comping over a routine horn sample and phase-shifted beat, letting Diaz-Tuttan's voice do the heavy lifting. Adebimpe's heavenly croon adds atmosphere to ""Runaway"" and illuminates the New York indie influence on the album, his minor-key harmonies hinting at TV's moody ruminations. However, Perna's flute is only an afterthought in the sudsy ""Rob the Bank"", with its brittle rhythms and Wiz's subtle scratching barely discernable, and ""Synth 3PO"" is a true low point, again falling back on the Beck blueprint of plastic sequined soul, without the surreal heart and giddy bluster. But like I said, you have to respect any serious attempt at excavating the proverbial pigeonhole. We analytical Po-Mo's like the ambiguous shades that fall just after sunset but before the heavy dark of night, the time when fireworks can be most vivid and startling.","Despite my initial fears of this record's potential for high-browed self-indulgence, it's tough not to\n\ admire any ...

Snake Bird Blue,Terror at the Opera,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87a9d034d5c69bf3a5a/1:1/w_160/af3d79cd.gif,2004-05-24 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8258-snake-bird-blue/,No Sides,"The artwork accompanying Terror at the Opera's Snake Bird Blue depicts Faith Gazic and Gretchen Gonzales as porcelain'd socialites, alike in seafoam and hosiery, happily lost in a cavernous, crumbling greystone palace. They're ladies who lunch removed from their element and shuttered mysteriously inside the abandoned building. The visual carries over to the music: We imagine the two at first woozy from gin, fear and Percocets, rightfully concerned about their surroundings. But then, in exploring the ghostly ballrooms, winding turrets and reverberant marble hallways, they find a fabulous and varied array of accordions, toy pianos, electric guitars and Moogs; and together, they begin to experiment, drawing on wavering folk melodies and snatches of memory from fairy tales and faraway childhood. And Snake Blue Bird begins. Gazic's accordion and brassy vocal flutter guides this Opera, but Gonzales' spidery, economic guitar work is equally essential to its peculiarly spun web. Touches of synth atmosphere, tinny percussion (in chintzy electronic and quiet tambourine varieties) and toy piano also diversify the mix, shading the duo's vocal sketches, tricks on the mind, and persistent air of human frailty. ""I had snakes and moths in my tummy,"" Gazic and Gonzales sing in the aptly named ""Snakes and Moths"". ""And blue jays eat butterflies."" Another voice mumbles as they harmonize, like a chattering poltergeist being suffocated by a throw pillow. It's the only accompaniment to the vocal, but a perfect one, as it makes the song at once unsettling and pretty, like all the best fairy tales. An accordion takes the rhythm for ""Lovely Day"" as Gonzales' guitar chops out a tiny jangle, while ""Aminor"" is a damaged shanty, and ""Daystar""'s vague gypsy sway keeps Gazic's bizarre couplets tidily afloat. It's fascinating music, like attending a recital of child bands performing tentative Velvet Underground and Flaming Lips covers, and it also suggests those halcyon days of lo-fi, when cassette-makers amused themselves creating pop from the flimsiest of elements. But that self-amusement can frustrate, too, as a track like ""Johnny Appleseed"" wavers and drifts to no real resolution. Thankfully, Gazic and Gonzales keep most of Snake Bird Blue on the twisting track, never resorting to masturbatory experimentalism. Or, they say what they mean and mean what they say. The Gonzales-penned ""Let's Pretend"" references her work with Slumber Party, while the creaky attic electronics of ""Build Your House"" and ""Sailor Says Goodbye""'s dreamy toy piano reflection are slight, but highly effective shifts in the album's ruling sonic paradigm. The dead mannequins loved the show, clapping their clip-on limbs against neutered trunks. Bats shuddered on their crown molding perch, loosing plaster dust from the ballroom ceiling. Their high-back chairs encircled by instruments and glass shards, the women stared at the pale, tender patches of skin remaining where their high society jewelry had once gleamed coldly. The finery had been flung down the palace's decrepit elevator shaft, rendered needless in this curiouser and curiouser wonderland of strange, pretty music.","The artwork accompanying Terror at the Opera's Snake Bird Blue depicts Faith Gazic and Gretchen Gonzales as porcelain'd ...

Having at last reached the final stage of Castelvania III, I was informed that my allotted daily hour of game time had long since passed, and that I would have to turn off the system. Ignoring my squealed threats of violence, my parents yanked the power cord before I could even write down the access code for the last level. As anyone who's ever played Castlevania III would surely understand, I snapped. Limbs flailing wildly, I charged for my dad, hoping to inflict some kind of bodily harm to at least partially rectify the massive injustice that had been committed. Needless to say, Nintendo meant a lot to me as a kid. So when I heard about this, the debut album from California five-piece The Advantage, I just about shit a pixilated brick. The Advantage play heavy, dynamic covers of Nintendo classics-- something like the bastard lovechild of Don Caballero and Mario Mario. Driven largely by the always-impressive drumming of Hella guitarist Spencer Seim, The Advantage go far beyond simple nostalgia, exploring and often enhancing the brilliance of their source material. The music for the Nintendo Entertainment system was created under tremendously limiting circumstances-- during the time that most of the songs covered here were written, composers had only three individual voices to work with at any given time, each consisting of little more than a modified sine wave. That being the case, melody was almost invariably given precedence over rhythm and texture. In this way, the songs covered here offer a perfect balance to the sprawling, rhythmically intense post-rock played by Hella and their contemporaries-- the simplicity and melodic strength of the source material focuses the players, and the players flesh out the source material beyond its original technological limitations. Of course, certain songs fare better than others. The theme song from Bubble Bobble, hands-down my all-time favorite ""gamepak,"" is equal parts bouncy and chunky, anchored by two bass guitar tracks and Seim's insistent drumming. The breezy jazz underpinnings of ""Super Mario Bros. 2 Overworld Theme"" serve as another highlight, perfectly articulated by dual clean electric guitars. Two downbeat songs from Castlevania III provide a welcome change of pace, and finally prove my theory that Radiohead's The Bends is just a thinly disguised cover of the game's soundtrack. In fact, my only real gripes with the song selection here are that The Advantage inexplicably omitted their excellent version of the ""Moon Theme"" from Duck Tales, a criminally underrated NES fave with a wonderfully catchy score. Unsurprisingly, the intensely repetitive nature of the songs on The Advantage prevents the album from rising entirely above its novelty, but the band never apologizes for the whimsical nature of their content, and the resulting geeked-out enthusiasm makes this a great album for headbangers and button-mashers alike.","Let me open this review by confessing that, when I was ten, Nintendo almost made me kill my parents.

Achilles Heel,Pedro the Lion,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0249d034d5c69bf2646/1:1/w_160/a8f0c6f5.jpg,2004-05-23 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6216-achilles-heel/,Jade Tree,"Man, I hate when an album doesn't match up to the review I had planned for it. Months ago, I'd artfully conceived a righteous corrective of all the bum raps David Bazan has received over the years, both from this esteemed institution and others. Valiantly, I'd position myself between the mournful singer/songwriter and the sharp arrows of our vicious kind, praising him as one of the finest modern practitioners of the lost concept album arts, while simultaneously mocking the IndieWorld reflex to immediately disparage anyone who dares discuss something so bourgeois as religion. Oh, the gleeful self-satisfaction that would be had! Then I heard the album. No glee. For starters, Achilles Heel finds Bazan taking a respite from the song cycles that have graced his last two fine efforts, Winners Never Quit and Control. And while the Lion certainly has a right to an intermission from his musical Decalogue, losing the narrative push sucks the heart out of these songs, leaving a mope-rock shell that's less than filling. Only the murder-tale of ""Discretion"" harks back to his previous style-- a short-story remnant of Bazan's minstrel talent, its bright light is obstructed by heavy-handed stand-alone songs about unhappiness in a socialist utopia, state infidelity, and bands dying in tour vans. And then, there's the Jesus. While Sufjan Stevens has done wonders for hypnotizing indie folk into singing along with Sunday School lesson plans, Bazan continues to be the face on the scene dartboard for people's transposed aggression against the likes of Jerry Falwell. With hands pressed firmly over ears at the mere mention of the J or G words, most of these non-conformist conformists miss the context of Pedro's deity name-dropping, which is often as critical of organized religion (and better informed) as any of the Lion-haters claim to be. To his credit, Bazan never sounds like the kind of Christian robotically following clerical orders, but like a man looking for something, anything in which to find solace from an oppressively bleak world. Unfortunately, Achilles Heel does little to explain those subtleties behind its Daniel-in-the-Lion's-Den cover art. While Bazan nastily skewers the kind of bible-beater he's not in ""Foregone Conclusions"" (""You were too busy steering the conversation toward the Lord/ To hear the voice of the spirit begging you to shut the fuh-uck up""), he turns in an unbelievably limp defense of faith just one track later. ""The Fleecing"" appears to be a form of response to his hipster detractors, but crumples under vague answers and a flimsy sheep metaphor, ultimately coming off as preachy as people blindly expect Bazan to be. Whether it's the lack of plot, insight, or collaborators, Achilles Heel also finds Bazan's music stuck in a room with no exits, with one loping distortion-pedal crawler after another. Save ""Discretion"", gone are the thunderstorm drums that underscored the pathos of Control, sunk in the mix are the keyboard counter-melodies that have brightened past efforts, and what's left is Bazan wailing the rules to Rock Paper Scissors in ""Arizona"". ""Keep Swinging"" half-successfully attempts an evolution of his approach with its cutely awkward bass groove and jarring harmonies, but it's mired in formless fuzz and distortion. The surprising falsetto of the green-with-envy ""Bands with Managers"" and the deceptively peppy ""Transcontinental"" could make the A-team of the Pedro catalog, but it's telling that the latter track's ""1, 2, 3, 4"" drumstick-clack intro could lead into any track on the album. With Achilles Heel so topographically uniform, it's tempting to declare the well dry for Bazan's sound, particularly considering how closely he veers to self-parody within this album's boundaries. But after a quick refresher with his last two albums to remember why I wanted to defend his work in the first place, I'm willing to give David the benefit of the doubt, labeling Achilles a stumble rather than a death knell. With concept albums coming back into style like neon clothing, it shouldn't be hard for Pedro the Lion to revert to reminding us in ten thematically related songs or less how ugly mankind can be. Then maybe I can use that review I've got stored up for him.","Man, I hate when an album doesn't match up to the review I had planned for it. Months ago ...

Devin Dazzle and The Neon Fever,Felix Da Housecat,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7813d197565213b54b/1:1/w_160/bb419b76.jpg,2004-05-23 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3030-devin-dazzle-and-the-neon-fever/,Emperor Norton,"When the first 12-inch recordings appeared in 1975, few could have predicted the coming shift in pop music. ""Disco,"" of course, was right around the corner, but in the mid-70s, astute dance music historians only recognized that term as part of a DJing process that involved extending records' best parts at clubs. Disco wasn't just that pounding four-on-the-floor beat, but an overt strategy of retreat from pop structure and obligation to the importance of the hook. Even if party people had to wait for the chorus, they got their rocks off from the first downbeat, as DJs were no longer at the mercy of ""songs."" So, while this meant an almost endless supply of breaks, it effectively severed ties to pop altogether. Starting in the late 70s, dance music gradually became something apart from chart pop-- a music judged almost exclusively by its club value. This is not to say there has been no crossover from dance to pop, or vice versa. Even before disco, DJs were playing a mixture of funk, soul and Euro pop hits, and that inclusive practice never totally vanished. However, 12-inches and remixes ensured that whatever pop crossover infiltrated clubs could be manipulated to most perfectly suit the rather practical dancefloor aims. In the early 80s, when Detroit DJ Juan Atkins was getting his Kraftwerk thing on with Cybotron, and with Derek May and Kevin Saunderson practically inventing techno, dance's relationship with radio pop would seem to have been irrevocably broken-- or, at least crafted into an alternate pop wherein ""hits"" hardly depended on widespread cultural appeal. Chicago's Felix da Housecat (Felix Stallings, Jr.) has fashioned a career out of straddling the line between dance and pure pop-- one that should be clearly, obviously drawn after 30 years of gradual segregation. Yet, in the 21st century, his music is an interesting example of how little things change. After having made his bones as a 14-year-old co-producer on ""Phantasy Girl"" with house pioneer DJ Pierre in 1987, releasing a string of house hits in the early 90s, forming his own label Radikal Fear and producing several acclaimed albums and mixes (not least of which were those under his Thee Maddkat Courtship and Aphrohead aliases), Felix had little trouble finding an audience in the pop remix market. Furthermore, despite a stated disdain for electroclash, he's often credited with jumpstarting the genre in the late 90s with his own synth-driven, robocentric tracks. Small surprise, then, to see mixed reaction to Devin Dazzle and the Neon Fever, which, like his last record (2001's Kittenz and Thee Glitz), revels in a refusal to settle into one particular kind of jam. Where his fellow DJs and house diehards might demand lengthy, driving tracks best suited for directing traffic on the floor, Felix has given them a concept pop record with great beats but three-minute tunes, as well as a cast of non-diva vocalists, and melodies that might actually sound better on the radio than pounding from club speakers. Devin Dazzle details the nightlife of its title character, fascinated by the neon lights but tending to associate with the wrong crowd, and runs through so many micro-strains of electro-pop it could be a guidebook on the genre. In fact, Felix may have crafted his magazine too carefully; mainstream radio probably isn't quite ready for total immersion the cynical nostalgia of synth-pop. Devin Dazzle might disappoint fans expecting more deadpan suave from Kittenz star Miss Kittin, but Felix does round up several suitable replacements. LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy does his best Bowie-cum-Sylvian take on the choruses of the hard-disco platter ""What She Wants"", while Tyrone ""Visionary"" Palmer lends his absolutely spot-on disaffected 80s tenor to the similarly on-the-mark synth-pop of ""Ready 2 Wear"", ""Devin Dazzle"" and ""Neon Human"". The last tune is a particularly exceptional example of fusing house and electronic pop, sounding like Miami Vice transported to The Warehouse, Jan Hammer jamming on Prince's keyboards and Herbie Hancock's sampler. However, the girls rule the day here. Felix has put an all-female group known as The Neon Fever to work on a series of cutting, sleek tracks that make up the bulk of the album. The single ""Rocket Ride"" uses a double-time beat and fuzzed-out Dragnet riff to power their crass plea, ""Spaced out kid, won't you take me on a rocket ride?/ Don't say no 'cause I won't be denied/ You're my boy and I'm your girl/ Take me out of this messed up world."" This request, sounding desperate at the outset of long nights hopping from flash to flash, is amplified when the requestor deems herself a ""technological soulmate"" while sounding just as sincere as a coked-out nighthawk should. ""Everyone Is Someone in L.A."" is admirable in its fusion of metal guitar and note-perfect 80s techno-pop, but downright depressing in its similarly perfectly desensitized observations of days spent shopping on Rodeo Drive and getting thrown out of the Viper Room. Yet, like all good pop songwriters, Felix manages to make potentially hazardous clichés shine like Benzes with his ace arrangements and efficient hooks. In its stubborn refusal to attempt to appeal to too many people at once, Devin Dazzle succeeds where many straight pop albums fail. This album may come straight out of a culture obsessed with white-label pressings and European electronic dance music, but there's an unmistakable pop sheen that arguably predates electro altogether; Felix da Housecat appears to have approached this record in the same manner as other pop craftsmen like Stephen Merritt or Elvis Costello might: as a tireless effort to mine sub-styles and hooks that populate his detail-oriented visions of the perfect song. While that might translate into a record that fails to sit totally comfortably in either the pop or dance section of the CD shop, it's hardly lacking in compositional substance or high-toned flash.","When the first 12-inch recordings appeared in 1975, few could have predicted the coming shift in pop music.\n\ ""Disco ...

Music from the Film Hell House,Matt & Bubba Kadane,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc345e6ef95969322dbe/1:1/w_160/215a742d.jpg,2004-05-23 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4578-music-from-the-film-hell-house/,Plexifilm,"Not only do film scores lead double lives, but they must serve opposing purposes in each. Most obviously, the music must compliment the story, tone, and theme of its film so subtly and so organically that it can not be separated in viewers' minds from the images. At the same time, a truly noteworthy score should be strong enough to play on its own as something more than background music. Exceedingly rare is the film score that can live both lives equally well-- a few by Bernard Hermann comes to mind-- but most hem to one extreme or another, as is the case with Matt and Bubba Kadane's score for Amarillo native George Ratliff's 2001 documentary Hell House, which follows the congregation of the Dallas-area Cedar Hill Trinity Church as they stage their annual Halloween Hell House. Instead of a typical haunted house, this Hell House scares visitors with everyday terrors through elaborate skits about the evils of homosexuality, raves, birth control, abortion, the occult, internet dating, and anything but the most extreme fundamentalism. As an independent piece of music, the Kadane Brothers' score works fairly well. Produced by Steve Albini, it's spare and ponderous, its dueling guitars on ""Hell"" and ""Alex"" recalling their work with Bedhead and The New Year. It's also surprisingly resourceful: A banjo plucks out the precarious melody of ""Demons"", a trumpet plays a strange rag on the outro ""Wrestling"", and ""Sex Before Marriage"" ends with a toy piano, which could be a punchline. It is a little too atmospheric and a little too aimless, structured by the rhythms of the scenes and not by the needs of the tunes, but at a length of around 18 minutes, it never overstays its welcome. However, as a soundtrack to the film, the Kadanes' curious score sounds heavy-handed and manipulative. Ratliff tries (with varying degrees of success) to be objective and give the Hell House cast and organizers enough rope to hang themselves: His camera captures the implicit racism of consigning all your minority players to roles as drug dealers, the unintentional anti-Semitism of a six-sided ""Satanic"" pentagram star, the competitive excitement of the Trinity Christian School students auditioning for roles as suicide and incest victims as if trying out for the school play. The absurdity of the enterprise is painfully obvious, as is the faith of its participants, and Ratliff admirably refrains from reinforcing either. However, with its ominous tone, the Kadanes' soundtrack not only misses but occasionally even undercuts this objectivity. The most egregious example is ""Speaking in Tongues"", which plays in the background as several of the Cedar Hill congregants describe speaking in tongues during church services. The Kadanes score the scene with droning guitars that sound eerie and portentous. It is, perhaps unintentionally, villain music, signaling the approach of something evil and foreboding. Glossolalia is certainly an intriguing phenomenon, and while the documentary wisely does not try to debate its validity, Ratliff seems genuinely curious and open-minded about the practice. The Kadanes' music, though, sounds too decisive and almost condemning as it excuses viewers from taking the subject matter seriously. Overall, the tone of the Kadanes' score feels worlds away from that of the movie: It sounds too judgmental for a film that, despite its muddled structure, at least tries to give its subjects the benefit of the doubt, even as it hints at the delusions of its participants. Ultimately, Hell House, like so many documentaries, needs no soundtrack and in fact suffers from one.","Not only do film scores lead double lives, but they must serve opposing purposes in each.

Of Snowdonia,Daedelus,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a877b1335d7bf16992ba/1:1/w_160/4ffe1550.jpg,2004-05-23 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2131-of-snowdonia/,Plug Research,"With the exception of that hideous Adventure Time album from last year, Daedelus' output since his debut Invention has been smart, consistent, and fittingly, inventive. The L.A. producer is a master of kitsch, mining vinyl for discarded melodies and cross-appropriating them in his quaint but forward-thinking compositions. Daedelus seems to have unusually high regard for his source material, and his samples correspondingly maintain their historical sediment despite his anachronistic dust-off. What results is essentially genreless compositions that are home to a wide range of sounds, musical interests and influences that, while consisting of pieces that might be individually unengaging, together make for challenging and rewarding listening. Of Snowdonia, like Invention, is extremely dense. Daedelus has chosen samples of a substantially more unified ilk here, and to dizzying effect, he often hurdles through them seven or eight at a time. In addition, Daedelus intrudes upon his samples more: guitar, standard IDM color and drum effects, and even his own voice peek into the mix, hoping to bridge the distance between the sampled fragments and the new audience. The fast-paced ""Snowed In"" is Of Snowdonia's de facto standout track. The song is stuffed from beginning to end with typically and atypically Daedelian samples: the opening bouts of heavily reverbed percussion and bell sounds recall Pierre Henry 1960s output, while piano and guitar lines form a common thread that weaves through more familiar clarinet and string tones. Daedelus then gets somewhat campy on ""A Sneaking Suspicion"", feted with its impenetrably film noir vibe and soap opera saxophone loop. The song turns glitchy and melancholic upon entrance of a grand guitar line, but regains its mystery when the saxophone loop comes back to complete a somewhat forced ring structure. After ""Aim True"", Daedelus' sung ode to needlepoint aphorisms, and The Price Is Right game-show dreamscape of ""Taking Wing"", the album's most upbeat song, ""Something Bells"", makes good use of a fuzzed-out amateur chorus line. The loop surfaces intermittently until getting its just due midway: ""Now's the time to sing and shout/ Something bells can ring about."" A guitar loop, bell melody, and this chorus share the spotlight democratically. Closer ""Hiraethus"" focuses on acoustic piano loop, with which Daedelus vocally harmonizes. It's the album's shortest song, but easily its prettiest. Yet, while Daedelus succeeds on much of On Snowdonia, some of its tracks suffer from one of two problems. Sometimes these tracks are too reliant on their archaic samples: ""Shinkansen"", for example, fails to transcend its kitsch, despite being propelled by an energetic drum loop. Other times, as on ""Pocket Watch Pulse"", Daedelus overcompensates for his anachronisms, miring a track in by-the-book IDM cliches. Still, these are forgivable misgivings for an artist this consistently compelling, and while not up to his best work on Invention, Of Snowdonia nevertheless suggests that Daedelus still has much to offer his genre.","With the exception of that hideous Adventure Time album from last year, Daedelus' output since his debut Invention has been ...

Studio One Dub,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e7b1335d7bf1699163/1:1/w_160/d1482fee.jpg,2004-05-23 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1993-studio-one-dub/,Soul Jazz,"The timing of the Soul Jazz label's most recent overviews of the massive Studio One catalog have been eerily prescient. Of course, the decision to box their earlier discs into one set came just in time for Christmas, but their ska sampler from earlier this year was the imprint's most politically charged release yet, crammed with joyous, rebellious music to meet election year head-on. Now, with Sir Coxsone Dodd's passing a few weeks back, Soul Jazz's newest collection, Studio One Dub, cannot help but to serve as loving tribute to this giant of a man who not only defined popular music for the isle of Jamaica, but for the world over, his innovations laying the foundations for hip-hop, dance and post-rock. As the liner notes attest, dub is the music of the studio engineers and the sound-system rulers, producers who expand their recorded music sans-musicians by endlessly recycling rhythms and melodies, toying with timing and time itself, and making ceaseless mutations using studio technology. ""Dub plates"" originally alluded to the reference discs and soft acetates that studios would cut by day for exclusive airings by select Jamaican sound systems at night. As the engineers started dropping the vocals in and out of the mix, adding effects to the remaining tracks of drum and bass, a new genre of music was formed. Though never the eccentric genius caricature that Lee ""Scratch"" Perry was, nor the solid master craftsman that King Tubby was, Dodd's dubs drew on such a fertile ground of classic Jamaican rhythms that he rarely missed. As such, it's difficult to find fault with the versions presented here. Culling 17 selections from literally thousands of discs made by Dodd and engineer Sylvan Morris between 1966 and 1972 is a thankless task, and will always remain a slight sampling of the music created during that era, but as many of these cuts are ridiculously rare (only appearing in small batches on a temporal medium, usually with silk-screened sleeves), their preservation in plastic is crucial to understanding the depths of these songs and the skills of the technicians involved. Even the instantly recognizable beats of Horace Andy's ""Skylarking"", ""Mr. Jollyman"" and ""Mr. Bassie"" (renamed ""Sky Rhythm"", ""Taurus Dub No.2"", and ""Chase Them Version"" respectively) are tweaked in such a way as to remain unpredictable, reconfigured with new angles and instrumental combinations. ""Creator Version"" strips Dawn Penn's succulent coos off of ""No No No"", revealing the sinewy bass and pumping elasticity underneath, while cutting Delroy Wilson's vocal is reduced to a humming trace wrapped around the hand drums of ""Running Dub"". Dodd's distorted meltdown of Jackie Mittoo's organ notes for his version of ""In Cold Blood"" is noisy enough to make even Pan Sonic fans smile, and perhaps take a moment to realize the true heights of this man's unfathomable talent and unbeknownst, unassuming touch behind the boards. Surrounded by all of the prime players of Studio One, and echoing of some of his most crucial hits from Burning Spear, Johnny Osbourne and John Holt, this burning set celebrates Dodd's extraordinary life by mashing time and space until it's joyfully suspended. What better tribute could there be?","The timing of the Soul Jazz label's most recent overviews of the massive Studio One catalog have been eerily ...

"Value Series, Vol. 1: Fool's Gold",Summer Hymns,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a95e6ef95969320b66/1:1/w_160/b0769a5f.jpg,2004-05-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7566-value-series-vol-1-fools-gold/,Misra,"There are bands who make music with distinctly seasonal undercurrents, and then there's Summer Hymns. The Athens, GA-based sextet make no effort to mask their climatic intentions: The warm months are their loyal muse, and until now, the band have seemed content to meander the verdant ruralities of the South, producing immersive, atmospheric pop that's humid and hazy like Athens in thickest summer. While never groundbreaking, musical sojourns like those upon which Summer Hymns embark aren't easy to execute, and bear copious rewards when done well. 2000's Voice Brother and Sister and its successor, A Celebratory Arm Gesture, painted glorious, imagistic portraits of a Pan-South in eternal bloom, a fantastical vision that was in some ways better than the real thing for their kindly manipulation of the mind's eye. 2003's Clemency marked a change of direction, ruefully striking towards homogeneous country-rock territory yet managing to avoid cliché with a barrelful of strong melodies. Value Series, Vol. 1: Fool's Gold is a cursory collection of cast-offs from the Clemency sessions, and while still uniquely Summer Hymns, it's obvious why these tracks didn't make the final cut. In fact, if not for the serene beauty and unspoilt homeyness of Zachary Gresham's vocals, many of these tracks would fall completely flat, lacking the instrumental variety that fleshed out the band's erstwhile work. The downtrodden Rhodes piano on opener ""Fear the Law"" feels uncharacteristically cagey for a band traditionally so inviting. ""Capsized"" is more familiar, but not as captivating and well-formed as simplistically impressionistic numbers like ""New Underdressment"". All told, the album displays a band caught in flux between a reliable, formulaic approach to songwriting, and an obvious desire to branch out-- a perilous stage for any group. Fool's Gold's saving grace is Summer Hymns' knack for serving up comfort tunes-- easily palatable, if prosaic, songs with familiar melodies and unobtrusive orchestration. ""It's Just Not Right"", a rudimentary waltz with a cascading piano melody, and ""Pharmon"", a sly, downhome pop track, seem to prove Summer Hymns, even at their worst, incapable of writing a bad song. ""Crazy Baby"" comes close, but even that track is more of an aside than a song in its 1:17 runtime. Interestingly, the album's two strongest numbers are covers, an exercise for which Summer Hymns hadn't previously shown a penchant. George Harrison's ""Behind That Locked Door"" is an ideal song for the group to interpret, and their version is warmly rife with gilt pedal steel and Gresham's understated yet moving vocals. Meanwhile, a rendition of Johnny Watson's ""It Takes Two"" is slightly more upbeat, shirking the kind of cheekiness that less tactful bands might employ. Of course, summer is still the best season, and by evoking the unmolested pulchritude of nature at its finest, Summer Hymns win instant sustainability by dint of their production aesthetic alone. Fool's Gold is appreciable if only for offering a reminder of how thoroughly enjoyable Summer Hymns' previous work is, and how essential songs like ""Mr. Brewer (Cackle, Cackle)"" and ""Something's Going On"" are to the inauguration of any successful Memorial Day Weekend in my seaside neighborhood. Unfortunately, spinning Voice Brother and Sister and relishing the greening cusp of summer is about all Fool's Gold compels me to do. Perhaps the forthcoming second volume will fare better in producing the vibrant portraits of summer to which the bandname alludes. If not, I may just have to settle for the real thing.

Halo,Current 93,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f99d034d5c69bf3695/1:1/w_160/8e3ef79a.jpg,2004-05-20 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1751-halo/,Durtro,"Live albums often bank on facile nostalgia: ""Man, I remember when they played 'Truckin'' as the seventh encore."" In the case of folks who live in the middle of nowhere, the nuggets of stadium-sized atmospherics offer a vicarious pleasure: ""Man, now I know what 'Truckin'' would sound like as a seventh encore."" Completists pay top dollar for these watery simulations, which generally only amount to lackluster archival material to occasionally inspire the indulgent juvenilia of sounding out banal rocker interactions with an invisible crowd. While in writing, Current 93's Halo could be nonchalantly tagged as just such an offering, David Tibet's most recent live album transcends the bedraggled genre, coming off like its own heroic monster. Nobody would deny that David Tibet's a busy guy. Between his Durtro label, Ghost Story Press, and numerous recording projects and collaborations, it's a wonder the English renaissance man's able to release any new material by his own meat-and-potatoes act. Though Current 93 is scheduled to play a string of shows in Toronto this June with Six Organs of Admittance, the crew's stateside gigs are extremely rare. In fact, even some of C93's most ardent followers have only caught glimpses of their reclusive icon in grainy black and white photos or web glossies. In this sense, a Current 93 live album makes more sense than a similar project by the endlessly touring Dave Matthews. Another plus is that Tibet's songs exist nicely in larger spaces: the piano stretches its legs, the bass grumbles, the cello scurries underfoot, the violin mewls. Recorded pristinely at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on October 9th, 2003, during a shared-headlining gig with Cosey Fanni Tutti and Chris Carter (both ex-Throbbing Gristle), the set includes 16 tracks covering much of C93's recorded history from the early years to his most recent opus, Hypnagogue. The setlist moves comfortably between aesthetic eras in Tibet's oeuvre: ""The Death of the Corn"" from 1990's Horse makes an appearance, as do ""Whilst the Night Rejoices Profound and Still"" and ""The Signs in the Stars"" from 1998's Soft Black Stars, and 1994's ""All This World Makes Great Blood"" from Of Ruine or Some Blazing Starre. While not every track beguiles, the most interesting compositions receive an extra layer of flesh. The opener, ""Halo"", swivels on the same scratchy loop as 1995's lengthier ""Where the Long Shadows Fall"". Tibet gently intones his Theinmostlight trilogy's continual question (""Why can't we all just walk away?"") as strings, tunings and tentative swells gradually come to the fore. As the set continues, 1992's ""Mary Waits in Silence"" picks up hypnotic Gregorian background chants and the stutter-step of flanged soloing guitar; ""A Silence Song"", a perennial favorite also from Thunder Perfect Mind, is as dainty as ever but the melancholic instrumentation rises and falls with Tibet's voice more clearly than on the album (the pianos are especially stirring); ""So: This Empire Is Nothing"" sprouts a singing saw that takes flight as an extended breakdown buttressed by ecstatic applause. A slightly compacted ""Sleep Has His House"", prefaced with Tibet's whisper that ""this is in memory of my father,"" receives a less droning piano/cello/violin makeover. I ultimately prefer the original, lengthier version, but hearing the track receive the explosive pop treatment is an interesting sideswipe. The proceedings trail off with ""Locust"" from 1987's Imperium. It's the first time Tibet performs ""Locust"" live, and he opts to give it the royal apocalyptic treatment: deranged voices, walls of white noise, squeaks, howls, squawks, metal bass, industrial sprouts, choirs of devils, crazed strings, noise guitar, and subaltern gnarls drift around Tibet's anguished libretto: ""What joy we had/ In the locust summers/ What fires we lit/ In the locust years."" C93 has always been as much about the music as Tibet's larger-than-life personality and obsessions. In a live setting, he chews the scenery and spits it out in a handful of colors (mostly rippled with red); and this here, Tibet's masterstroke, is frantic Glassian New Music performed by hellhounds. Pulling a wonderful rabbit out of his hat, the set concludes with a child, Finn Sands, telling the audience that ""God Is Love"" and imploring them to ""watch and pray."" This placement immediately after the most intense of songs transforms the boy's sweet British voice into an ominous warning: Who knows what the Four Horsemen will look like, so watch your back and lock the doors. As should be expected, Halo doesn't possess the same dense narrative arc as Current 93's strongest studio efforts, and newcomers should search out the tried and true classics like Thunder Perfect Mind or All the Pretty Little Horses before jumping into this sort of collection. For seasoned veterans, though, it's a thrill to hear the band's often hermetic sounds bloom before an audience of adoring fans. I wish I could see all the faces and lighters, because even just listening to the acolytes whoop it up after the foreign lands of ""Fields of Rape"" is honest-to-god spine-shivering rock 'n' roll fun.","Live albums often bank on facile nostalgia: ""Man, I remember when they played 'Truckin'' as the seventh encore.""

Now Here Is Nowhere,The Secret Machines,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a396ea9e61561daa4cf7/1:1/w_160/da2bea80.gif,2004-05-20 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7057-now-here-is-nowhere/,Warner Bros.,"The first thing you notice is the rhythm section: large, lumbering drums and hydraulic bass flexes on the nine-minute ""First Wave Intact"", the lead-off track on The Secret Machines' awkwardly titled debut album, Now Here Is Nowhere. The rhythms are military-precise, locked-in and steady, but they're less heavy metal than Heavy Metal: The band sounds as though they're scoring an intergalactic space battle, or perhaps something more terrestrial, like the lurching onslaught of a thousand warbeasts. Or maybe it's just the march of the marketing behemoth behind Now Here Is Nowhere, which is one of the first major label albums to be released for commercial download before its official street date. In Phase 1 of the assault, the album was posted on the band's website and on select retailers like iTunes, along with a free five-song EP (containing the well-worth-it outtake, ""Cannon""). For Phase 2, Reprise released an early version of Now Here Is Nowhere in a ""babypack""-- a simple sheaf of cardboard with minimal graphics and a low price. And now, we've arrived at the final phase of the master plan-- the album's actual release, for which the label presumably hopes all those people who downloaded it or bought the tyke-size version will either spring for the ""real"" album or at least have told all their friends about it. It's too early to tell whether this three-pronged attack will actually succeed, but if it doesn't, it won't be the band's fault. Veterans of Dallas-area groups like UFOFU and Tripping Daisy, these three New Yorkers-by-way-of-Texas-- drummer Josh Garza and brothers Ben and Brandon Curtis-- build a classic rock front to launch a full-out musical assault. Garza's imperturbable drums stand strong against Brandon Curtis' guitar explosions and Ben Curtis' psych-rock keyboard scribbles. Early reviews of Now Here Is Nowhere have likened the band to 70s-era Pink Floyd, a comparison that is limited but not unwarranted. ""Pharaoh's Daughter"", for example, turns on an elegant Dark Side of the Moon chord change and a volley of ""Us and Them"" voices in the chorus. But The Secret Machines are no nostalgia act: ""Pharaoh's Daughter"" counters the Floyd references with a drumbeat practically quoted from Isaac Hayes' cover of Bacharach's ""Walk on By"". Plus, they deploy a strategy similar to that of The Flaming Lips and Grandaddy: Not only is Garza more Steve Drozd than John Bonham (which could be a compliment), but The Secret Machines create songs that are just as spacey and concept-heavy, if not quite as quirky, as those on Yoshimi and The Sophtware Slump. ""Leaves Are Gone"" lolls along on the delicate ebb and flow of Brandon Curtis' keyboard cascades, forming a quiet counter to more aggressive songs like ""Sad and Lonely"". ""Light's ON"" boasts a better new wave hook than just about anything else to come out of NYC this year, crackling with a palpable paranoia as Curtis decries the intrusiveness of a Big Brother-like observer: ""Somewhere there's a record of your whereabouts/ Everywhere you go you leave a trace.../ The light's ON/ We don't know just who our friends are."" But there are forces allied against these threats, people who thrive in the underground: ""The light's ON/ And we're waiting for the signal."" The nervous lyrics and jittery energy of ""Light's ON"" underscore the pervasiveness of the military imagery on the album, revealing a directed-- if not entirely legible-- political agenda. On ""Pharaoh's Daughter"", Curtis describes a brewing rebel movement in life-during-wartime language: ""We dressed in uniforms left over from the war/ A tourniquet, an iron vest/ Our emblem was a star."" A lone star, perhaps. Now Here Is Nowhere pulses with a sexual tension that matches the swagger of the Texas-size drums on songs like ""Nowhere Again"", when Curtis sings, ""There's a woman in the mirror in a fiery state/ As she motions to me I start turning away/ She's lifting her dress up/ Trying to keep up."" While this erotic energy threatens to undercut the political tensions on the album, it actually humanizes and intensifies them. The meaning behind all this political and sexual intrigue is a little vague. The ""Now"" and the ""Here"" of the album title apparently describe America during its war on terrorism, but beyond that, the album's most specific statement is that rock music, regardless of influences or labels, can still be a subversive agent in society. Although the sound is bombastic, the message is subtler and variable from one listener to another. Now Here Is Nowhere may sound like a full-on assault, but it's actually a covert spec-ops infiltration, as the name Secret Machines suggests; the band step loudly but carry a concealed weapon. Politically, this reticence could have been a cop-out, but aesthetically, it leaves the album open for interpretation, which means it should have a longer life than the current administration.","The first thing you notice is the rhythm section: large, lumbering drums and hydraulic bass flexes on the nine-minute ""First ...

"Stone, Steel and Bright Lights",Jay Farrar,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd575e6ef9596932303a/1:1/w_160/19c424d9.jpg,2004-05-20 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2999-stone-steel-and-bright-lights/,Transmit Sound,"What can I say about Uncle Jay that a boatload of omniscient critics haven't already said? His background is common knowledge amongst gossipy indiescenti-- most of us decided long ago to fall in with either the red-eyed, pill-popping Tweedy Nation or the temperate, button-down Family Farrar. Fans of the former Tupelans are vehemently passionate, after all, and stylistically, speaking it seems there's little common ground between the two camps. Farrar's life after the tentatively hiatused Son Volt has been inconsistent at best, uninspired at worst, but nevertheless his muse still hangs on. For some it's been tough watching an icon produce sub-standard material, but neither Farrar nor his devoted, corduroyed following give a shit about popular opinion. In the wake of the tepid response given his solo outings, including 2003's intermittently impressive Terroir Blues, Farrar hit the road for a national tour, taking psych-country balladeers Canyon as both his opener and backing band. Stone, Steel & Bright Lights is a collection of songs from that tour, recorded during several different shows over the course of September and October. Released on his own newly re-christened Transmit Sound label (formerly Act/Resist), the disc's 78-minute runtime offers a liberal dose of Farrar's word-drunk Americholia-- especially considering that, even with pistons firing, the music never hits terminal velocity. You can't fault Farrar for knowing what he does best after all these years. He certainly has a strong grasp of what his people want-- obliquely evocative lyrics, saccharine melodies-- as exemplified by his typically rote showing on the album's first third. New tune ""Doesn't Have to Be This Way"" opens, setting the Adult Contemporary mood before ever so slightly roughing it up with some astral slide guitar from Canyon's Joe Winkle. The other new original premiered on this tour, ""6 String Belief"", reveals that Farrar is perhaps more riled by his critics than they might believe: ""Killed by consolidation/ Killed by saturation/ The underground will correct/ With reaction rebellion."" From there, we're given vintage Farrar, boosted by the expansive wail and surge of Canyon's elegantly ringing guitars. Farrar's hearty, amber tenor is poignant and strong, and Canyon makes an excellent (if not fully fleshed-out) turn behind it. Though they give much-needed guts to mawkish Sebastopol tunes like ""Make It Alright"" and ""Vitamins"", the group shines brightest when they really dig in and stretch out. ""Cahokian"" shows Canyon hitting full stride halfway through their set, with Vin Novarra's tribal drums and Brandon Butler's lap steel shaking up the dynamics a bit. Later, Farrar allows another Terroir tune, ""Fool King's Crown"", to almost get its rocks off with some spacey keys and groaning guitar before abruptly winding it down. Not surprisingly, the album's most intriguing moments come with its covers. First appearing on Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn, ""Lucifer Sam"" was Syd Barrett at his most menacing, and here Canyon crunches into its twisted drama with an iron fist, doing justice to the original. To close the album, ""Lucifer Sam"" rolls right into Neil Young's anthemic ""Like a Hurricane"", which with its tender vocal delivery would be perfectly suited to Farrar were his instrumentation not so polished. As long as Farrar keeps the world in limbo over the status of Son Volt, it'll be tough to take his solo output as the final gospel. Albums like this, while often appealing to the hardcore Farrar fan (redundant, I know), don't add much to his overall cache.","What can I say about Uncle Jay that a boatload of omniscient critics haven't already said?

Zwei Photonen EP,Justus Köhncke,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc325e6ef95969322db7/1:1/w_160/02a3721a.jpg,2004-05-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4576-zwei-photonen-ep/,Kompakt,"Everything is better in the summer. I walked to the record store yesterday listening to Justus Köhncke, dreaming about Xcaret and Viet girls who refuse to wear their hair up. This is a time for opening up your cold, wet fists and letting the sun burn your palms like oversized smiles. It doesn't have to mean anything, walking next to the joggers and disc-footballers in the soccer field, our insides bursting, grinning in the knowledge that God's favorite season is here. The answer is clear: Step inside the record store and tell the first girl you meet that she's beautiful. Ask her to walk outside, come see how even the kids stuck in lessons on the tennis courts know what's going on, how you knew she was the one even before opening the broken front door. These things only make sense a few weeks a year, so now is the time. German fantasy disco perpetrator Köhncke has scored a near-perfect double-sided anthem for the finest season with his latest Kompakt 12-inch, Zwei Photonen. ""Timecode"" and ""The Answer Is Yes"" shimmer with the careless, shortsighted euphoria that dies out on cue come September. This is music that in the dog days of August, and the splendor of midsummer, seems telegraphed from some omniscient machine, transmitting electro-beats and Korg lines as if they were just another part of getting burnt and dancing until four. Furthermore, Köhncke has suddenly appeared to find his calling as a New Romantic soul man. Unlike last year's fine ""Homogen"" single, his textures on this record forgo the normally cool Kompakt template, opting for an unabashedly red (or pink) palette of sounds. 2002's Was Ist Musik had hinted that Köhncke could be a fine disco archivist, pulling grooves out of the Moroder handbook, and adding his own pseudo-smooth vox to accentuate the hooks. As it happened, his smooth, yet precisely enunciated singing style made me a bit uncomfortable-- prior to this 12-inch, my fave vocal performance on a Köhncke track was Erlend Øye's a cappella on ""2 After 909"" from his DJ Kicks mix. ""The Answer Is Yes"" changed my mind. The B-side of this release makes the case that Köhncke could seduce anyone, provided he's armed with this track's classic 80s synth-pop arrangement and infallible chorus, and psychedelic summer love. The tempo is ultra-slow and those drums hit hard, like Barry White gone robotic; the chord progression is born from Pet Sounds and ""Strawberry Fields"", giving ample room for Köhncke to let his breathy stylings run wild. He sings in German for the verses, leaving long spaces between his elongated phrases for the reverb to splash up against any bodies in range. At the chorus, he intones ""the answer is yes, yes, yes,"" as if it wasn't entirely obvious. The dancefloor gets hers on ""Timecode"", with another efficiently executed take on Moroder-powered electro-disco. However, keeping in the summery spirit, its strains are extroverted rather than micro; buoyant and flashy instead of hip and minimal. If you're doing a mix, don't lead off with it, but put it near the top because it can sustain whatever you have going; if you're playing Vice City, let it blare as you wreak havoc through the streets, cab surfing and racking up stars. Zwei Photonen (or the apt ""two photons"") inaugurates summer with a diamond glare and the wise purr of whomever you hear it with. Don't waste this stuff. You know it only comes along once a year.","Everything is better in the summer. I walked to the record store yesterday listening to Justus K\xF6hncke,\n\ dreaming ...

2014 EP,The Unicorns,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ff9d034d5c69bf3b9e/1:1/w_160/86555f61.jpg,2004-05-19 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8381-2014-ep/,Suicide Squeeze,"The Unicorns have got to get their shit together. If the 2014 EP is any indication, they need to cut their touring and attempt to write some worthwhile songs to complement those on last year's brilliant Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?. This disc's two new songs, ""2014"" and ""Emasculate the Masculine"", offer very little justification for their release, and the EP's two other tracks-- an outtake and a demo-- shamelessly try to fill out a disc already short on time and ideas. If there's any common ground between these two new songs, it's that both seem strikingly unfinished, and far less developed than the band's previous material. ""2014"" begins promisingly in a whirlwind of catchy lo-fi Casiotones and bedroom dancepunk beats, while hushed vocals keep in line with the group's familiar morbid tack, wondering if in a decade there will still be ""enough oxygen for me to breathe."" From here, however, The Unicorns attempt to replace the song's existing melody with haphazard textured builds and collapses that, in their hastily slapped together state, feel aimless, sloppy, and entirely amateurish. A potentially redemptive la-la-la chorus kicks in toward the track's end, but lasts only a few seconds before petering out with an abrupt, meandering finish. ""Emasculate the Masculine"" is much more straightforward, but perhaps to a fault. The song builds around bar-band guitar strums that display just enough quirk to recall-- for better or worse-- the similarly chicken-wirey outfit Cake. Rather than stuffing the track with great, fleeting hooks as in the past, The Unicorns have decided here to ride a single, simple melody, delivered in an unconvincing whisper. Eventually, guitars spin up a perfectly nostalgic Final Fantasy II melody that drives the track out, complete with cowbells, a hot synth riff, and a hidden but hooky grumble of noise that proves to be the song's poignant last breath. But again, the potential redemption of this closing segment fails to invite enthusiasm like the material on their debut, due to the awkward, slapdash nature of the rest of the track. Like ""2014"", Who Will Cut Our Hair outtake ""Evacuate the Vacuous"" opens with potential on a slow, sparse lilt and the disc's only real guitar hook, but again, the results are wanting, and why this song never made the full-length quickly becomes obvious. Here, The Unicorns hastily jump through several varying dynamics and approaches, but without any of their usual refinement, and even fewer interesting ideas. Even the lyrics-- consider ""Everything's okay in its own little way""-- seem trite and unconsidered. (Needless to say: After this run through stale B-sides and outtakes, the inclusion of a demo version of the disc's title track seems more than a little pointless.) What's frustrating about all of this, of course, is that The Unicorns, when in the right mindset, are capable of drumming up distinctively original and mindblowingly memorable indie pop bliss. But the lack of inspiration on display here may be a result of more than just an off day in the studio: Recently, rumors have circulated of infighting between members, and the live shows which they performed with such enthusiasm and unrelenting mania last fall have begun to feel somewhat stilted and tense. Earlier this month, the band posted a message to their website after a particularly disastrous show in Montreal, stating, ""If we don't take some considerable time off, I think we might all go crazy."" 12 months of rigorous touring can put an enormous strain on band relations-- particularly when its core members have been pals since their schooldays. While this is all pure speculation, overexertion and irritability would at least offer a plausible excuse for the lack of imagination and effort behind these songs. Otherwise, there just isn't one.","The Unicorns have got to get their shit together. If the 2014 EP is any indication, they need to cut ...

"Defixiones, Will and Testament / La Serpenta Canta",Diamanda Galás,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bed9abf31b7dc71561f6/1:1/w_160/7f8c787a.jpg,2004-05-19 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11750-defixiones-will-and-testament-la-serpenta-canta/,Mute,"In November of 2002, as part of a conference honoring the late novelist Kathy Acker, Diamanda Galás' multi-octave voice bellowed and howled through the midrange speaker's of NYU's Fales Library. Due to a previous engagement in Canada, the vocalist was unable to perform in the flesh, so she sent a multi-track recording in her stead. As preferable as it is to watch her unleash her intense Siren songs onstage, I enjoyed the disembodied presentation and the wraith-like shadow it cast upon the proceedings. As well as textual linkages, the two artists shared a mutual admiration. In a brief article on her performance at London's Royal Festival Hall, Acker called Galás the Maria Callas of her generation. In my mind, generations are broad and formless; so more specifically, Galás is a graveyard Callas (sans corpsepaint) who channels anonymous victims and sings their eulogies. In keeping with her baroque oeuvre and aesthetic, Defixiones, Will and Testament and La Serpenta Canta, Galás' first full-lengths since 1998's Malediction and Prayer, are densely wound, parabolic double albums. Released concurrently, each documents a very different approach, though both are by far creepy enough to make even the gothest shiver. Defixiones, Will and Testament is a meditation on the Armenian, Assyrian and Anatolian Greek genocides carried out by Turkey from 1914 to 1923, and the Turkish and American denial of the atrocities. According to a statement about the project at Galás' website, ""'Defixiones' refers to the warnings engraved in lead that were placed by relatives of the deceased on the graves of the dead in Greece and Asia Minor. These warnings cautioned against moving or desecrating the corpses under the threat of extreme harm. 'Will and Testament' refers to the last wishes of the dead who have been taken to their graves under unnatural circumstances."" Like 1990's Plague Mass-- a work for people with AIDS, inspired in part by the death of her brother, the playwright Philip Dimitri Galás, who succumbed to the disease in 1986-- once Galas affixes her sound to something concrete, the effects are often near sublime. As we chalk up important numbers of the dead (on calendars, and outlined out sidewalks) and commemorate days of mass murder, Defixiones issues a creepy formal purity, as Galás discusses ethnic cleansing: choirs rage, skies are torn, Galas speaks in tongues. In ""Orders from the Dead"", ""Our dead watch their daughters butchered, raped, and beaten in the still burning of those flames."" In light of the tortures at Abu Ghraib, notions of genocide and violence are currently in the forefront of many minds (and even USA Today). Certain lines like, ""A man without a God/ Cannot be burned alive/ He never was alive/ Not as a man, giavour/ But as a dog,"" coupled with recent imagery of Iraqis on leashes, expands Galás' anger to encompass more than her initial subject. Towards the song's end, she turns her phraseology towards the humanizing first person and achieves the voice of victimhood: ""I am the man unburied/ Who cannot sleep/ In forty pieces."" Elsewhere in the cycle, she incorporates and expands traditional compositional forms from Smyrna and Asia Minor and poems and by Armenian poet Siamanto, Syrian poet Adonis, Peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo, and Rumanian-Jewish poet Paul Celan. Throughout Defixiones' 99 minutes, Galás accrues packs of identities, all looking for remembrance. It's a chilling agglomeration: More about absence than a cult-of-personality, the soul-catching proves an angry and unmanageable lament riddled with grief, often as laden as it is uplifting. La Serpenta Canta, on the other hand, is surprisingly playful, tackling major standards and classics of American blues, country & western, R&B;, Motown, and soul. Each, of course, becomes hers alone. For instance, when Galás holds a particularly cackling note towards the three-quarter mark of Screamin' Jay Hawkins' ""I Put a Spell on You"", it's the stuff of a real hex, not just an interpretation of another's poetry. This is followed by a restrained take on Chip Moman and Dan Penn's ""At the Dark End of the Street"", which proves more Tom Waits than the violently cascading Pandora's Box that erupts at the coda of her reprisal of John Lee Hooker's ""Burning Hell"", a song she performs twice here with equally glorious results. Elsewhere, her guttural ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" transforms Hank Williams' tear-in-my-beer ballad into a spiraling downpour that carries with it a banshee wail from the top of Mount Olympus. But despite these warped old favorites, it's her own ""Baby's Insane"" that steals the show. Taken from The Sporting Life, her unlikely but surprisingly fruitful 1994 pop-art collaboration with Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones becomes the campiest of torch songs in a live setting. Recorded at Joe's Pub in NYC on August 31st, 2001, the cabaret lilts, and she jokes with the audience about the song's macabre subject matter before issuing the central warning: ""Baby's insane/ Baby's insane/ Baby's on a trip to the morgue again/ Hide all the knives/ 'Cause baby's insane."" Though La Serpenta Canta consists of lighter fare than the gorgeously pained Defixiones, Will and Testament, there are stylistic linkages (Galás, after all, is Galás). In both, the palette consists of her voice, piano and minimal electronics. Another less stylistic connector is the across-the-board inclusion of the traditional ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"". Equally powerful on both releases, the song's central request (""There's just one last favor I'll ask of you/ See that my grave is kept clean"") carries more intense resonances in the context of Defixiones. What's a grave keeper to do, for example, if the site's left unmarked or there's no burial at all? Yes, Galás' caustic voice is at times overblown, and you won't likely plop these discs into your stereo after a rough day at the office; like a complex modernist tome, their richly idiosyncratic materiality demands patient intelligence. At times, listening to these records is like treading water in the Black Sea: To experience them fully involves unraveling codes, grabbing after spirits, and immersing yourself into sinking shadows. It's an effort, but with more and more classifiably ephemeral and easily digestible sugar blasts erupting in the underground, breaking a sweat now and again with something that feels like it's been shot straight out of hell provides a nice change of pace.",,8.5,
Escape Velocity,Paul Schneider,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6715e6ef95969320d35/1:1/w_160/d620fcba.jpg,2004-05-19 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7762-escape-velocity/,Semaphore,"In the center of a black hole, called the singularity, the gravitational force is so great that the escape velocity of any object or radiation exceeds the speed of light, thus making escape from the hole's gravitational pull impossible under the laws of space-time as we currently understand them. A black hole isn't literally a hole so far as we know, but it comes close, given that it has no volume despite its infinite density-- we can't even know what a singularity looks like because it's obscured by something called the event horizon, beyond which all light is trapped. Though it can be explained by pages' worth of dry theory and alien-looking math equations, it's difficult to deny the inherent romance of the concept. Once you've passed beyond the event horizon, your only hope is that you're crushed into oblivion quickly enough that you feel nothing-- that light can't even escape its clutches is especially chilling and fascinating. Songwriters being a generally romantic lot, it's surprising that the fertile symbolic ground of these cosmic phenomena hasn't been more thoroughly plowed-- most songwriters just focus on the stuff you can actually see, like the moon and the stars. But Paul Schneider, your friendly guitar-toting servant (and not the guy from Múm), has apparently noticed this oversight, and attempts to remedy it on the opening track of his debut album. ""Event Horizon (Pulls a Body)"" is a lushly melodic song that nicely captures the essence of attraction amidst discord in a relationship-- even as his paramour does all she can to degrade him and crush his spirit, he's slipped past her event horizon, and now he's drawn to her despite himself. Schneider does an impressive job of keeping a potentially hazardous metaphor under control while his acoustic guitar bubbles over spare drum machines, his tenor's peculiar blend of gravel and nasal resonance articulating a deeply ingratiating melody. Elsewhere, Schneider's studied melodicism is at its best on uptempo songs like ""Don't Walk Around"", its bounding, unison-harmony hook met by a slightly distorted guitar riff placed low in the mix. Producer Dave Snyder keeps the bass sound loose and sharp, letting the drums and guitar do most of the rhythmic heavy lifting. ""Echo of Your Heart"", however, is the undeniable highlight, with its brisk rhythms sweeping along Schneider's fluid melody. Here, guest guitarist Oscar Rodriguez leads the band into a bloodrush coda that finally pulls back for a slowly churning, chiming outro. Rodriguez also breaks open the midsection of the country-ish ""Tourniquet"" with a positively liquid solo, and provides the menacing bassline for ""Waiting"", the album's darkest, loosest song. Schneider handles the lead guitar himself on ""Waiting"", with a choice outburst near the three-minute mark. His leads on ""Man"" enter more Stephen Stills-ish territory, ringing in the lower registers, with the top EQ'd off for a strange, mellowing effect. Escape Velocity is an accomplished debut for a promising young songwriter who thankfully seems as interested in the musical content of his songs as the lyrical. Fans of recent offerings by (to pigeonhole) neo-folkies like Tom McRae will definitely find much to like here, though the appeal certainly doesn't stop there: Escape Velocity is also a solid indie rock record, announcing the arrival of a songwriter to look out for.","In the center of a black hole, called the singularity, the gravitational force is so great that the escape\n ...

This Is Where We Live,Paco,by: Stephen M.

It's a nice touch, not just because Durand and Chase are wife and husband, nor because they have a history together in the band Ivy, but because all the possibilities of this side project finally come into view. This simple, short duet is a turning point on an album that, at least for its first half, feels like the band's potential may never be realized. In addition to Durand and Chase, Paco includes studio engineer Gary Maurer and guitarist Michael Hampton who build on Ivy's sound by texturing Durand's vocals with dense, atmospheric keyboards and programmed drums. Side projects, of course, can be sweeping successes (like, say, The New Pornographers), capturing the lightning-in-a-bottle dynamic of musicians working together for the first and maybe the only time. Or they can be instantly forgettable (like, say, King Biscuit Time), lacking the chemistry or a distinct enough sound to justify a new line-up. As it begins, This Is Where We Live falls squarely into the latter category. Songs like the ambitiously titled leadoff instrumental ""Satie"" sound so ephemeral that they dissipate as the notes emerge from the speakers, while others never seem fully developed, as if they need a second draft. ""Adore"" hinges on an awkward chorus and trite rhymes, while ""Shaded"" sounds like an ill-advised cover of another band's song: Durand's soft-focus vocals, which are perfect for conveying Ivy's urbane casualness, simply cannot believably sell lyrics as dark and cynical as ""Everything, everyone/ Every word you've ever heard is a lie/ Don't buy the dream."" After this initial awkwardness, however, Paco begin to loosen up considerably on ""Let It Go"", playing off one another with more confidence and achieving a unified direction. It almost sounds like they recorded the album in tracklist order, as they become increasingly dynamic and eclectic with each song. ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" is a moodier and slightly darker version of the shimmering pop Ivy nearly perfected, while the music on ""Thin"" creates a nice summer's-day groove out of Hampton's reggae-inflected rhythms. Whereas Durand sounds a bit sheepish near the album's beginning, she gives one of the most accomplished performances of her career on ""Promises"", where Hampton successfully connects his textured music to her voice, neither drowning her out nor completely abandoning her. The bouncy final track, ""Never"", which evokes the ethereality of Air, provides the album with a soaring outro in Hampton's George Harrison-style slide guitar. Though the promising second half of This Is Where We Live cannot quite compensate for its flat first, this shortcoming is clearly not a matter of too-little-too-late, but a question of what-next. If Paco can continue this trajectory, they could conceivably drop the ""side"" from the project on their next release.","There's a moment about halfway through Paco's debut album, This Is Where We Live, when all of the ...

You Are the Quarry,Morrissey,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c613d197565213bde3/1:1/w_160/90f48bbc.jpg,2004-05-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5437-you-are-the-quarry/,Attack,"The now-forgotten British author Horace Vachell introduced polo to the Pacific Coast when he relocated to Southern California in 1882. Purchasing a large cattle ranch near Arroyo Grande, which he renamed Tally-Ho, Vachell bred ponies and even socialized in the costume of the sport. His greatest acclaim came from the 1905 novel The Hill, an aristocratic Icarus fable in which the son of a Liverpudlian merchant attends the elite Harrow boarding school, rising to cricket prominence before his evitable downfall and dismissal due to class difference. On his adopted home Vachell wrote, ""In addition to the family fool, the Englishman to be found on the Pacific Slope include the parson's son, the fortune teller, the moral idiot, the remittance man, and the sportsman."" One could lob three of those labels at Steven Morrissey, the most unremittingly Albion presence in modern Los Angeles, but he remains an entirely unique breed of Englishman in home or Hollywood. Bitter, witty, hypocritical, contradictory, self-aware, sardonic, and nostalgic, Morrissey's persona-- in person, or in song-- is never one-dimensional or quickly read. Consider the ""I"" in his songs to represent ""Morrissey"" with peril. The media and his audience have consistently misinterpreted Morrissey's lyrics and statements. Everyone from the Warlock Pinchers to the Windsors levied opinions at his persona. The trend continues with You Are the Quarry. The record is not an anti-American treatise, an encomium to England, an epistolary revelation, or even a bold comeback, and magazines who claim such are lazy and reading off the kit. Laden with brilliant contradictions, press baiting rouse, dark comedy, and real human complexity, You Are the Quarry simply stands as the most entertaining and lushly melodic work of Morrissey's solo career, one of the most singular figures in Western pop culture from the last 20 years. In an epitomatory 1989 interview with Greenscene Magazine, Morrissey castigated those in chinchilla coats. ""It's disgusting. They're disgusting,"" he spat. ""If I see someone wearing fur I ask them to take it out of view."" In the same interview, he pointed out that synthetic shoes ""look silly"" and confessed to wearing leather footwear, as there's ""no sensible alternative."" The first scenario seems unlikely and makes for a comedic envisioning (At the Savoy: ""Excuse me, madam, but that rabbit shawl must be taken out of public view""), while the second statement reiterates that Morrissey never forsakes his role as photo-ready icon and dapper fashionist for a few cows. Similarly, when he puts his hands on the hips of Liverpool and Hull to slowdance with England in ""Come Back to Camden"", the lyrics should be taken with the whole of the Winsford Rock salt mine. Obviously, a ""discoloured dark brown staircase,"" a ""slate grey Victorian sky,"" and ""the taste of the Thames"" fail to paint a whimsical postcard of home. Even those who've never choked for air while riding the 15 down Fleet Street can read the sarcasm without a spider map. Yet those weeping synthetic strings (violins and cellos use catgut and horsehair, by the way) flash ""I miss you"" in garish American neon. When Morrissey humorously mocks Americans with, ""You wonder why in Estonia they say, 'Hey, you, big fat pig, you fat pig,'"" we laugh because most Americans don't know what Estonia is, let alone where it lies on the Baltic; fat Americans travel to Tucson not Talinn. Each of You Are the Quarry's 12 songs contains an equally delicious line. In ""Let Me Kiss You"", which incidentally features the most romantically melodic quasi-Marr guitar, Morrissey pulls the mask off an ostensible smooching ballad with the desperate gob of, ""And then you open your eyes and you see someone you physically despise but my heart is open."" Those artificial maudlin strings that sweep back in afterwards seem like the most appropriately feeble yet crushing sound on the record. The supposed ode to his Hispanic fans, ""First of the Gang to Die"", even contains poetic and dreadful images like solar illumination sparkling in cement reservoirs and on human bone. Two songs drive home Morrissey's modi operandi. On ""The World Is Full of Crashing Bores"", the fear of being a suburban meatsuit and an opposing love of cheap pop thrills drives him to an ending refrain of sincerely conveyed cliche with ""Take me in your arms and love me."" The album closes with the quiff quivering mammoth, ""You Know I Couldn't Last"". Morrissey's tommy gun is pointed directly at the pop stars who take their passing charge with less zeal and erudition than himself. Robbie Williams and Jason Mraz would never use ""gelignite"" and ""evil legal eagles"" in a chorus, or dare stick their neck out for the critics. ""The teenagers who love you, they will wake up, yawn, and kill you,"" he croons. At his most biting he sounds most relaxed. At his most self-deprecating he sounds most energized. By the time the title comes up, after ""there's a cash register ringing and it weighs so heavily on my back,"" it's again clear that ""I"" is not the first person. But it could be. Like fellow Southern Californians Harry Nilsson and Randy Newman, Morrissey shows no fear of offending or wrapping emotions in black humor, while exhibiting a deep passion for classic songwriting forms. Few-- possibly none-- would call the police ""uniformed whores"" and mockingly thank Jesus for bestowing him with love for which there is no receptacle on an album bulging with desire and soppy diapason. With a producer to match the vocal boldness of Morrissey, the record could have been pushed, musically, in a futuristic cinescope folk direction similar to recent The Flaming Lips. Flutes and piano and electric squelches peep through the sidewalk of simple lulling rhythms, acoustic guitar, and synthesizers. Jerry Finn, a Hollywood hack, knows only to throw all the parts out there with money stuffed in the panties. Prancing the choice embellishments in polo gear and avoiding standard rock mixing would have made the album perfect. That's a rather considerable caveat to tag on the end on a review, but if you're listening to Morrissey albums for riffs and licks you're missing the point. Any instrumental bed under such incandescent personality and booming voice would pale. Envisioning the songwriter at work brings to mind a woman picking at an acoustic or a fellow hunched over a piano with a drink. The genesis of Morrissey music remains ambiguous both physically and in intent. You Are the Quarry sounds effortless, and seemingly anything that pours from Morrissey's mouth comes wrapped in well-formed wit and melody. Some may want him to simply yearn for his homeland, or a woman, or a man, or bitterly attack pop stars or American culture, as this is seen as some sort of bold personal statement, but personalities rarely run down such black and white divisions. Creating an emotionally muddled, cantankerous, baroque, funny, longing, introspective, world-critiquing album is the most personal act a man like Morrissey makes. It trickles down to the logo on the cover, the resuscitated Attack imprint, a vinyl reggae label that has no relation to his music, yet reflects the taste and scholarship and attitude of man who began his career in music writing geeky teenage letters to NME begging for better New York Dolls coverage. Often during the course of writing a review, as the CD plays again and again for the 13th and 14th times, a critic finds himself convincing himself more and more that the record is essential. Morrissey's nature inherently emboldens those looking to make a statement, and now that he's on the mark, I similarly feel the need to stick out my neck for his record. Then again, Horace Vachell eventually sold the ranch and moved back to England. You can go home again.

26-Inch EP,Danger Mouse,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4e13d197565213b06c/1:1/w_160/2e813d0c.gif,2004-05-18 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2518-26-inch-ep/,LexLex,"There are few things more difficult than recommending an EP. The concept of the extended player is adverse to positive results in either of its two incarnations: the fully-realized EP that is developed to display a genuine change of direction for an artist, or the EP that bunches together several oddities or remixes in a grab for additional spending. In the case of Danger Mouse and Jemini's newly reissued (and repackaged) 26 Inch EP, the collection unfortunately leans closer to the latter. The talent is here, although the cast of characters don't seem to have much of interest to say. Repeated verses from The Alkaholiks, as well as Cee-Lo's decision to forgo rapping entirely to sing the chorus of ""What U Sittin' on Remix"" are early disappointments, while Sadat X phones in a stilted verse on ""Ghetto Pop Life Remix"", continuing the trail of missed opportunities. Jemini's new verses, too, while strongly delivered, are lyrically disappointing: He spends ""The Shit"" praying to the god of self-aggrandization, who is described not only as ""the shit,"" but also ""the boss,"" ""a bad motherfucker,"" ""the Incredible Hulk,"" and, on a particularly good day, ""the Son of God."" ""Ghetto Pop Life II"" is the disc's strongest remix, giving the anthemic original more of an A.M. radio overhaul. Light string flourishes and subtle keyboard wash over the listener, while Jemini juxtaposes quickly spun, low-toned verses with soulful crooning reminiscent of The Pharcyde. And he kills it, too: ""Some might question my openness/ I'm not your average mediocre local vocalist."" The thing that sets this song apart from the others on the EP is the way in which elements of the original remain in the remix, while all others are altered beyond recognition. The immediate production standout comes with ""Omega Supreme (DM Remix)"". Although lacking any new vocal treatments from Jemini, Danger Mouse flips the original song on its head by chopping 80s piano-funk with ridiculous timing, precisely layering in extra drums for variety, tossing in a two-bar change-up near the end of the verses, and otherwise wholly reinventing one of Ghetto Pop Life's best cuts. It almost singularly makes up for other more disappointing moments over the course of the EP-- a good sign for any remix. Viewing the album from the lens of the more involved EP style, 26-Inch fails to show any development from Jemini, and generally just allows Danger Mouse to experiment with different sounds. I'm hoping that Jemini takes to the topical variety he doled out on the group's preceding full-length, and chills out on the singing when he unveils his upcoming Kill Your Heroes LP later this year.","There are few things more difficult than recommending an EP.

Kesto (234:48:4),Pan Sonic,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb465e6ef95969322b94/1:1/w_160/f486e3d0.jpg,2004-05-18 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6139-kesto-234484/,Mute,"The computer, with its non-destructive editing and infinite power of magnification, invites those who use it as a creative tool to focus on the micro. In the digital realm, people have an almost unlimited control of detail, and so the microscopic naturally become more important. In electronic music, where the standards of commercial software gently tug sound in the direction of familiar poles, the details are often the only way to separate yourself from the bedroom laptop guy down the street. For one to find their own sound, they have to match up a half-dozen sonic parameters that they hope will differ at least slightly from what others have done before. Finland's Pan Sonic is on another trip. If your average click + cut technician makes music by carefully placing drops of sound in the clear pool of stereophonic space, Pan Sonic prefer to crank up the fire hose. Descriptions of their live show usually contain the word ""brutal"" and, as with inspiration Throbbing Gristle, they're rumored to contain the kind of sub-audible tones the Department of Defense developed for use on the battlefield. Generally eschewing computers in favor of analog tone generators run through a series of filters and pedals, Mika Vainio and Ilpo Väisänen do their best to steer raw electrical current toward something approaching music. But hey, no promises. It's been three years since Pan Sonic's last full-length, a time of touring and side projects, and Kesto finds them throwing their hat back into the ring with panache. Kesto is a 4xCD quadruple album set packed in individual slipcases housed in a box that matches the Touch and Rune Gramophone labels in visual presentation. In a time when almost everyone considers CDs too long, lumping four nearly full discs together and calling it your new album is self-aggrandizement bordering on clinical mania. Kesto works, though, because Pan Sonic, through intelligent sequencing and a burst of inspiration, are essentially offering four separate, complete, and internally consistent albums. Each disc has its own mood and offers a rounded take on a different mix of genres. CD1 is by far the most aggressive, but also conforms most closely to pop structure. Three short tracks called ""Mayhem"" (all tracks are titled in Finnish with rough English counterparts, and I will cite the English versions here) are the viscera that hold the taut flesh of CD1 together. ""Mayhem I"" is, in my mind, the finest album opener in recent memory, a positively inspired and life-affirming blast of horribly overdriven chords that somehow congeal into an anthem. All I can think of when I hear ""Mayhem I"" is Merzbow covering Gary Glitter's ""Rock and Roll Pt. 2"". It's a risky Jock Jam that verges on criminal negligence, seemingly designed to further incite a stadium packed with meth-heads. ""Mayhem II"" has a fast and jerky new wave rhythm but is no less generous with its colossal riff, and Pan Sonic have a lot of fun here with layering. When you think the disc can't get any more abrasive, a sudden shriek of white noise arrives to push ""Mayhem II"" even further into the red. The rest of CD1 ranges from a gritty tracks that solder industrial shoegaze to breakdancing rhythms (""Fugalforce"") to breath-catching drone interludes. Kesto's CD2 keeps the short tracks and hooks of CD1 but strips the sound and focuses more on rhythm. If CD1 is inspired by the 1970s-- specifically Suicide's take on machine rock (Pan Sonic dedicates CD1's ""Diminisher"" to the group), CD2 finds them exploring 80s electro, pitching the normally chilly atmospheric temperature of the genre toward absolute zero. The classic electro syncopation is the driving force, but Pan Sonic fill the space in and around the drum hits with sound effects, banging chords, laser beams, Dre'd-out Minimoogs, and another dollop of noise. Though electro is the running theme of CD2, the actual mood is quite varied, going from the dispassionate downtempo of ""Arctic"", the perfect soundtrack to a slow 3 a.m. cruise into the Canyon down Mulholland Drive, to the ruff'n'tuff housequake tubthump of ""Current-Transformer"". CD2 winds around but sounds great straight through. CD3 begins with a low hum that leads to the sound of a toilet flushing, and while the effect is not really indicative of the sound to follow, the third disc is indeed the weakest of the lot. Here is Pan Sonic at their most abstract and soundscape-oriented, offering a handful of long tracks that sound like field recordings from a secret concrete chamber located beneath a decaying prison-- lots of banging metal echoing sharply off of concrete, with disconcertingly large gaps of silence. ""Corridor"" and ""Appearenceform"" incorporate unpredictable eruptions of noise interspersed with imperceptible tones. ""Air"" begins with the sound of a hanging garden of live jumper cables sparking wildly on a windy day, and then morphs into what sounds like a series of overlapping gongs. While it is often effectively spooky, CD3 too often feels like merely passable dark ambient. Better is ""Radiation"", the hour-long track that makes up the final disc of Kesto. The drone rules the day here, and Pan Sonic builds the kind of vaguely Eastern future/primitive texture first explored by early 70s electronic music like Tangerine Dream. And believe me, they have plenty of time to explore every last nuance of their basic set of sounds. Does it need to be an hour, you ask? Well, no, but ""Radiation"" seems the kind of track designed to provide a slightly tense atmosphere and can be variously tuned in or out over time. For an album that begins with such a shocking and brief blast of rock power to end with an endless exercise in ambience provides a pleasing ying/yang effect. No four-disc album is lacking dull patches, and Kesto is certainly not an exception, but there's a lot of really excellent music here, and you have to give Pan Sonic credit for audacity. This is truly the width and breadth of what they are capable of-- if they've ever thought it, it's here-- and it's actually difficult to imagine them ever making another record. Where else could they go?","The computer, with its non-destructive editing and infinite power of magnification, invites those who use\n\ it as a creative ...

Radio One Sessions,Syd Barrett,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b5c0084474cd0bfc36/1:1/w_160/2cb4c285.jpg,2004-05-18 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/569-radio-one-sessions/,Strange Fruit,"To keep this ""fair and balanced,"" let's look at two different bios of Roger ""Syd"" Barrett: Adoration. Barrett's innocently brilliant psych-folk first set Pink Floyd in motion; when he left the band after one record, too erratic from drugs or mental illness to keep up with its growing fame, the Floyd lost the bright wit of his songwriting and started its slide to light-show-dominated arena-rock. Barrett cut a couple albums as a solo artist before giving up music and retreating from the world, and his legacy is colored by his audible struggle to keep it together in the studio. Hearing this witty, charming performer disintegrate in front of you evokes nothing less than the tragic destruction of innocence. Backlash. Though talented, Barrett influenced more great post-psych songs than he ever wrote himself, and he would have gone down as a few-hit wonder if not for his legend, which was built more than anything by the melodrama of Pink Floyd. The band that let him go repeatedly paid him tribute, from the slick classic rock touchstone Wish You Were Here to the blood-curdling shrieks on The Wall, where ego-maestro Roger Waters tried to have it both ways by imitating Barrett's madness while holding on to his own stores of wealth and ass. Barrett's mythologists have ruined his catalog by combing through every line and every mistake for signs of his deterioration, and even that may have been overplayed: While Barrett suffered tragically, plenty of artists saw worse fates, including Nick Drake, Phil Ochs, Gary Glitter, or heck, Richard Wright, who had to keep working with Waters for a whole 'nother decade. Wherever you stand on Barrett, his legacy regularly buries everything that was great about his tiny catalog: two proper (but shaky) solo records, some outtakes and bootlegs, and these two sessions for the BBC. The supply-and-demand also explains why the 20 minutes of music on The Radio One Sessions will run you $20, and why the fans who already own the first half will still buy this for the three new tracks, taken from a session that the BBC lost but that someone had taped off the radio, probably on equipment that the Germans dropped on them in the war. The album starts with the five tracks from Barrett's 1970 Peel Session, which were already available on a separate release. Joined by David Gilmour on guitar and Humble Pie's Jerry Shirley on bongos, Barrett performs a set of his best songs. The hilarious ""Effervescing Elephant"" sounds more spontaneous, and ""Gigolo Aunt"" and ""Baby Lemonade"" are easy-going complements to the studio versions. But you also get ""Two of a Kind"", a song that's so clumsy and devoid of imagery that some critics doubt Barrett even wrote it; some blame Richard Wright, but he won't confirm it. The second session, from 1971, includes the Barrett tracks ""Baby Lemonade"", ""Dominoes"" and ""Love Song"". The sound quality of these, unfortunately, is garbled and sub-bootleg, and what's worse, the distant, distorted recording plays up the most patronizing stereotypes about Barrett: that you can hear him slip away from us, and that the dark recording quality suggests the end of his career. If you're one of the people who gets off on that, you'll wet yourself over the fade-out. But even if this is a lousy value, The Radio One Sessions has one major strength: Barrett. Listening to him strum out these songs with these guys, you can hear everything that's charming about his voice. It's a comfortable session, and Gilmour also shows how much warmer his early, Zabriskie Point-era guitar sounded than his later, studio-perfected leads. Not unlike Pink Floyd's contemporaneous Atom Heart Mother, this is engrossingly mellow music, perfect for the heat of late summer and sprawling in a meadow. Once you've gotten your pulse to slow far enough, think about Barrett: Don't dwell on the fame that ruined him or the legacy that he ran from, or any other kind of ""big picture."" Just dig how much fun he's having making this music with his friends.","To keep this ""fair and balanced,"" let's look at two different bios of Roger ""Syd"" Barrett:

Who Is This America?,Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b6b1335d7bf16980a3/1:1/w_160/6997dbc2.gif,2004-05-18 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/214-who-is-this-america/,Ropeadope,"Just when I start gloating about afrobeat legend Fela Kuti's influence permeating the underground, what should find its way through my mail slot but the new Antibalas LP? Let it be known: the American afrobeat awakening is in full effect. [Much rejoicing ensues.] All year, Fela-inspired ensembles have been rocking dancefloors and picking fights with nervous Republicans across the country. Antibalas, of course, predates them all, having staked their claim to Fela's dynasty back in 2001 with their Ninja Tune debut, Liberation Afrobeat Vol. 1. That release beautifully conveyed Fela's bravado and bluster, even while the band was yet unable to evoke his humor, intimacy and personality. Of course, while I was thrilled to hear a new multi-culti spin on the Nigerian afrobeat legacy, I couldn't shake my disappointment at the record's lack of focus, or its departure from Fela's tried-and-true blueprint. But, never daunted, Antibalas regrouped to drop the bomb the world was waiting for: Their 2002 follow-up Talkatif lightened their sound with sharper songwriting, including some truly memorable melodies (no mean feat within afrobeat's syncopated firestorm) that popped with addition of bright major chords, Afro-Latin rhythms, briefer track lengths, and more compelling lyrical fomentations from Duke Amayo. Now arrives the third installment of the Antibalas handbook for global empowerment, Who Is This America?, which, in the midst of the current trickle-up afrobeat revival, has Antibalas bringing a more galvanized and urgent righteous noise than ever before, and proving they lead the pack when it comes to the re-imagining and recreating of Fela's archetypal artform. If you're familiar with afrobeat, you'll have a basic grasp of this record's sound: Clean, staccato guitars and conga 'n' snare breakbeats are quickly avalanched by monstrous horn sections, shakere counter-rhythms, and kinky clavinets. Opener ""Who Is This America Dem Speak Of?"" enters with several minutes of polyrhythmic pyrotechnics, before Amayo finally busts in with a scathingly ironic vocal introduction, kicking the album into a high gear it never shifts back down from. At 12 minutes, it's one of the longer tracks in the group's repertoire, though a peek at the runtimes reveals that America contains two even lengthier tracks, one of which nears the 20-minute mark. Indeed, where Antibalas' previous works were abridged for accessibility, here they've clearly become more comfortable with their staying power, and more confident with their voice. While Fela was a master at submerging political censure under metaphor (see his 1973 release, Gentleman, a denouncement of colonialism that employed pants as symbolism), Antibalas is more didactic, though they do dabble in some amusing poetics. Both the opening track and the breakbeat powerhouse ""Big Man"" come down on America's wholesaling of capitalist consumerism, augmented by a newfound razor-sharp wit. That sense of humor is also apparent on ""Indictment"", a stylistic watershed for the band. The track opens with a Superfly-echoing riff as spastic tenor sax man Stuart Bogie recites a litany of offenses committed by everyone from Donald Rumsfeld to ""the game of baseball,"" in what sounds like some funky People's Court. The terrific throwback production-- cracking, overmiked drums, theme-show guitar, and background chatter reminiscent of James Brown's original Live at the Apollo-- make for one of the most unique, compelling songs the group has ever laid to tape. The decision to close America with two monumental midtempo songs gives Antibalas the opportunity to show off all the tricks and insight they've gained in their seven years together. Victor Axelrod's liquid organ initially takes something of a plodding lead on ""Elephant"", but at six minutes in, the track briefly dubs out and Ernesto Abreu's Yoruba vocals come on like a Nuyorican boogaloo crooner. ""Sister"" is a 19-minute percussive workout; every instrument-- clavinet, horns, guitar, bass-- is a drum, rising and falling through a sexy, hypnotic and occasionally spacey plotline that, even in its extended length, keeps a tight, tense grip on the ear. Like hip-hop and reggae, afrobeat is one of the crucial forms of expression for the world's disenfranchised. As time passes and we get further from the initial heat of Fela's influence, bands like Antibalas play a greater role in keeping the flame lit. Who Is This America? is the group's most powerful fuel for the fire.","Just when I start gloating about afrobeat legend Fela Kuti's influence permeating the underground, what should find its way ...

A Grand Don't Come for Free,The Streets,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5875e6ef95969320b0d/1:1/w_160/3748194f.jpg,2004-05-17 05:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7533-a-grand-dont-come-for-free/,AtlanticVice,"Whether it's a reaction against the MP3's pending usurpation of the album format or just simple coincidence, the concept record is enjoying a small comeback at the moment. But perhaps careful not to echo the supposed sins of bloat and misbegotten puffery that characterized the psychedelic and progressive rock eras, many of the artists responsible for the best recent concept records-- Sufjan Stevens' Greetings from Michigan, the Magnetic Fields' i, and The Fiery Furnaces' upcoming Blueberry Boat-- share a willful intimacy that borders on the quaint. On A Grand Don't Come for Free-- the follow-up to his internationally acclaimed debut, Original Pirate Material-- Mike Skinner audaciously weaves an 11-track narrative over an often bare and inert musical backdrop, one that acts more like a film score than the foundation of a pop record. The plot is pretty bare-bones: boy loses money, boy meets girl, boy loses girl. But by focusing as much on the minutiae of life as on its grand gestures, the impact of Skinner's album-- essentially a musical update of ""The Parable of the Lost Coin"" peppered with Seinfeld's quotidian anxiety and, eventually, a philosophical examination of Skinner's lifestyle and personal relationships-- transcends its seemingly simple tale. Cynics and/or detractors could sneer that Skinner's sonics are too slight and that his flow is too rigid-- particularly when compared to ""other"" hip-hop artists-- without being entirely off the mark: Skinner's awkward, sometimes offbeat delivery is even more charmingly/frustratingly clumsy here than it was on Original Pirate Material, and the record's beats and melodies are subservient to its story. But while those perceived weaknesses may make A Grand a non-starter for those who disliked Skinner's debut, trying to place his square peg into the round holes of either hip-hop or grime/eski seems a mistake. After all, this is a record that starts with its protagonist trying to return a DVD and ends with him chastising himself for improperly washing his jeans. In between, he spends time at an Ibiza burger stand, smokes spliffs on his girlfriend's couch, grumbles about a broken TV, sorts out his epilepsy pills, philosophizes about the nature of friendship, and grumbles about the failures of mobile technology. Clearly, Skinner is on a singular place on the pop landscape. Echoing his ability to compensate for his own musical weaknesses, Skinner manages to turn his character's personal shortcomings into A Grand's strengths: Communication failures, both technological and human, allow Skinner to deftly examine body language and small gestures. His character's lack of prospects and disconnect with work and family highlight the importance of friendship (especially, perhaps, to young urban adults). His crippling self-doubt (at the record's start, any hiccup in his day is proof that he should just spend it in bed) and need for approval from others makes his solipsistic epiphany all the more heart-wrenching. The album's ultimate contradiction may be that while Skinner's life is seemingly driftless, his understandable attempt to tether it to another human being-- any other human being-- often causes him more harm than good. Considering that Skinner showed such a gift for post-laddish humor on Original Pirate Material, the most surprising aspect of A Grand may be that, here, he's at his best when he's at his most sentimental. His love and/or relationship songs overflow with melancholy and the inability to express emotion at crucial moments. In short, they're pretty truthful and sometimes painfully familiar. Along with the drug haze of ""Blinded by the Lights"", A Grand's best moments are a pair of tracks that bookend the story's main boy/girl relationship: The first-date track ""Could Well Be In"" (""I looked at my watch and realized right then that for three hours we been in conversation/ Before she put her phone down, she switched to silent and we carried on chatting for more than that again"") and the dissolution of that same relationship on ""Dry Your Eyes"", a tongue-tied, heart-in-throat ballet of non-verbal expression. That Skinner is able to coax so much from a cliché-heavy, 50-minute examination of solipsism and self-pity is a tribute to his ability to reflect and illuminate life's detail. By stressing his paranoia and doubts (""It's hard enough to remember my opinions, never mind the reasons for them,"" he blubbers as he loses a domestic dispute), he deftly avoids the melodrama of today's network reality TV. Instead, his approach echoes the faux reality of The Office (which shares a non-ending ending with A Grand) and the me-first neediness of its ""star"" David Brent (whose final-episode self-actualization echoes Skinner's). Like The Office, Skinner's anthropological humanism typically focuses on either the mundane or disappointing-- and, let's face it, life is most often one or the other--- but he does so with such endearing intimacy and bare honesty that it's easy to give yourself over to the album's narrative on first listen and, perhaps just as importantly, to want to revisit it over and over again.","Whether it's a reaction against the MP3's pending usurpation of the album format or just simple coincidence,\n ...

Alphabetical,Phoenix,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05e5e6ef9596931ff1e/1:1/w_160/fde0ed4b.jpg,2004-05-17 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6273-alphabetical/,AstralwerksSource,"Look, when the time comes, we're all going to have to repent our wrongdoings to someone. You and I can sit here and pretend we're saints and that everything is fine, but in the end, while the message board sinners are getting theirs and the bookies who fix the Grammys are in line for theirs, we'll be sweating out that time we stole money from the donation jar at the 7-11 and bought the soundtrack to Footloose. Twice. But I'm not one to spend too much time dwelling on the past. Let bygones be The Bangles-- fifth graders need girl singers to have crushes on, too. However, what might have been common knowledge in 1984-- say, that Hall & Oates were, at best, music my parents listened to, and at worst, pretty fucking terrible-- seems to come out much better in the wash. I heard Toto in the mall two days ago, and had to fight the urge to proclaim ""Africa"" the best song of the 80s. Okay, bad example, because I even loved that one in grammar school. But I didn't love H&O;, Steely Dan or Michael McDonald (that much). So, I grew up, and somehow look back on all that stuff semi-fondly, like an infected wound a torture victim was forced to live with for four years in captivity. Later, he looks at the scar as a companion, the only other being who really knows what went down all those years ago. ""Out of Touch"", you are my beautiful scar. French quartet Phoenix are either drenched in the same sentimental soul-searching, or, hey, actually like soft, 80s-powered MOR pop. And you know what? I think I'm with them, for the most part. Vocalist Thomas Mars couldn't break a sweat on the sweatingest day of his life, but when it comes to smoothing out the velvet, he's singing second tenor for Green Gartside. Mars' voice goes down almost too easily on the band's second full-length, Alphabetical, which occasionally works against the full-scale pop invasion his songs might otherwise deliver. Adult contemporary hallmarks abound (chimes, ""tasty"" rhythm guitar, midtempo rock that sounds like mid-tempo funk), but fortunately for me, so do good melodies and arrangements. As any survivor of the mid-80s eventually discovers, adult contemporary doesn't have to be evil. Wisely, Phoenix place most of their best material at the head of the album. The first single, ""Everything Is Everything"", is a glorious example of how to write a classically ambiguous soft-pop song: ""Things are gonna change/ And not for better/ Don't know what it means to me/ But it's hopeless, hopeless."" Sounds pretty down. ""What I can't explain/ I'm sure you'll get it well/ Since I always wanted/ I always wanted you."" Okay, who wants what now? It doesn't matter, because when you factor in the ace acoustic guitar jazz chords (yep), itchy triangle and Mars' pleading, cute lil' French guy croon, you realize that life is more than good lyrics. Life is about finding jams with triangles. Or Moog-squelch bass (""Run Run Run""), or grown men holding out falsetto harmonies so long they run out of breath (""I'm an Actor""). There is necessary filler, too: ""Anybody"" is decent VH1 fare with a hip-hop backing track safe for soccer moms, and vocal unison choruses that hearken back to the glory days of Fleetwood Mac. (You heard me.) However, I'd argue that the band's penchant for lite-sounds gets the better of them here, particularly in comparison to, say, Justin Timberlake. ""Señorita"" could be a good short-term goal for Phoenix, but on Alphabetical, they're content to settle in a comfortable rut of ultra-suede and Parisian cool. ""Holdin' on Together"" psychically channels Private Dancer but forgets it was by Tina Turner; the title track threatens to become Sheryl Crow at any moment, but without the preoccupation of being ""rootsy."" There's something admirable about a record that proves it's possible to remove grit from adult contemporary pop. Still, it's tough to argue with the overall sheen of the thing. Just as Mars slips and slides through my ears, Alphabetical, like the best 80s jams, does that thing it does and gets out before the stale aroma of decay sets in. It doesn't ask you to remember it in the morning, and even leaves a few calling cards to reminisce those special moments in the foyer, gripping a glass of wine and buzzing on the twinkle in your eye. Sounds gross, doesn't it? You'd be surprised.","Look, when the time comes, we're all going to have to repent our wrongdoings to someone. You and I ...

Hummer EP,Fog,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde413d197565213b648/1:1/w_160/4b0ba010.gif,2004-05-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3131-hummer-ep/,Ninja Tune,"Although hardly as shocking as the John Carpenter film, Fog is as unsettling and about as ambiguous. But a more fitting cinematic comparison may lie in the noir expressionism of David Lynch's Eraserhead. Like that film, Hummer follows a static-headed, haunted protagonist as he struggles with alienation, naivety and a disjointed otherworldliness, mirroring Lynch's fondness for subtle humor and shaky delirium. Hummer also betrays the mundanity of its title, challenging you to feel at ease within its seven uncomfortable, nagging creations. If you're familiar with Fog's self-titled debut or last year's Ether Teeth, this disc's twisted pop mechanics and freak-show instrumentation may not be so jarring; if you're not, Andrew Broder's capricious approach to arrangement and continuity may take some adjusting to. In either case, you should find Hummer as uneven as it is fascinating-- but then, the EP has always been the most sensible medium on which artists can spill their temporary departures and outlandish experiments. Fog has never courted cash-register acclaim, but this release seems intent on proving its ""difficult"" credentials by almost instantly pulling the musical guts out of its fledgling opener, ""Whom That Hits Walls"". Broder does get around to laying down a droning, thumping dirge after a short while, but then takes a knife to it as well, before finally allowing the song to limp out in a thrashing tantrum. It's a technique that recalls the kind of artsy self-sabotage Sonic Youth employed on Washing Machine's ""The Diamond Sea"", which similarly operated more as an understated glimpse of talent than a cacophony designed to mask a deficiency of it. ""I, Baby"" marries the kiddy-speak of Nick Cave's ""All the Pretty Little Horses"" with stark piano and a hushed vocal delivery. Although Broder's decision to tack a 'Y' onto the end of every line (""When I grow uppy/ Me get strongy/ Me lifty/ See me strongy"") can be grossly irritating, the damaged vocalizing and awkwardly out-of-sync phrasing asks us to see the simple pleas beyond the seemingly gimmicky vehicle. The track clatters out in a pots-and-pans shuffle, stirring a poignant current that flows through the rest of the EP. On later tracks, his stream-of-consciousness approach holds up to scrutiny, rarely sounding too indulgent or trite. Although the technique fails to provide a tangible narrative or resolution, songs like ""Melted Crayon"" and ""Stink of Kings"" paint an even deeper sense of fragility and foreboding than Broder's usual fare. On ""Melted Crayon"", in particular, a strong undercurrent of menace permeates Broder's gentle acoustics: ""I must have strange glasses on/ I must have taken strange poison,"" he sings, before perverting the images of childhood in lines like, ""Drink melted crayons for me/ Drink every crayon in the box,"" and gurgling to a string-swaddled close that hints at a quiet madness. Hummer evades easy classification due to Broder's overambitious nature and general lack of cohesion-- the disc dips as heavily into leftfield electronics as it does indie pop-- but, wisely eschewing a traditional coherence and fully embracing the odd rhythms of his mind, Broder presents an uncompromising vision that could have hideously backfired. The EP's centerpiece, ""Cockeyed Cookie Pusher"", acts as a microcosm for the entire EP: It is beautifully sung and deftly arranged, but oh what a silly title.","Although hardly as shocking as the John Carpenter film, Fog is as unsettling and about as ambiguous.

On Vacation,The Robot Ate Me,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28bea9e61561daa4a85/1:1/w_160/b96d3a4e.jpg,2004-05-17 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6805-on-vacation/,Swim Slowly,"A common lament amongst music fans is that certain albums would be greatly improved if only the artist had cut certain songs from the tracklist. But On Vacation, the sophomore full-length from San Diego-based lo-fi pop group The Robot Ate Me, marks the first occurrence I know of for which the band has made the distinction between their worthwhile and subpar tracks so staggeringly clear. To this curious end, On Vacation is spread over two discs: The first indulges all the pretenses for which many people dismiss lo-fi indie rock completely: half-baked noodling in the name of experimentation; painfully ironic lyrics for songs with titles like ""The Genocide Ball"" and ""I Slept Through the Holocaust"", and loads of novelty instrumentation. In marked contrast, The Robot Ate Me cut the shit on the second disc to offer their best songs yet. The band's 2002 debut, They Ate Themselves, was nothing if not promising: The Robot Ate Me consists of three clearly intelligent musicians, and as that disc showed, when they take the extra time to structure their good ideas and censor their bad ones, their music comes out creative, compelling and often stunningly catchy. With On Vacation's second disc, they seem to have realized this themselves, crafting songs rewarding enough to forgive the first disc's utter tripe entirely. Compare disc one's hissy emo closer, ""On Vacation"", with the second disc's upbeat and clever opener of the same name: Drummer Dave Greenberg's jumpy hi-hat swish is pushed way back in the mix, making room for Ryland Bouchard's perfectly shaky, bittersweet delivery. Deadpan lines like, ""Let's go back home to where it's familiar/ I can't take this bright burning sun,"" work brilliantly here, stringing out fantastic lyrical/musical tension that felt so clumsily and obviously executed on the first disc. ""Apricot Tea"" is the lush sibling track to disc two's ""On Vacation"". Bouchard is still dead-on here, but with an even more curious rubato for his introductory remarks: ""If you want to lie at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, I'll/ Be the one that comes with my ship and be the one that drops the anchor down."" What follows is a thick but wispy vocal chorus of disembodied, wordless harmonizing that forms the waterfall backdrop for the song's anthemic line, ""Oh, will you be the one that smiles for me?"", which provides the record's biggest and best hook. The album closer, ""I'm Ok"", employs Chris Meng's tasteful banjo accompaniment as the glue for the song's many moods, and jumps back and forth through various crosshatchings of Bouchard's simultaneous joy and despair in the song's chorus line, ""Hey, I'm all right down here.../ And really, it's ok."" This is The Robot Ate Me's most robust song, and a promising end to an album that so unnecessarily wades through its own detritus on disc one to fully showcase itself on disc two. Maybe there's a point to On Vacation's disparity, or some subtle concept behind it that has to this very sentence remained elusive. But if there isn't one, The Robot Ate Me should feel free to skip the noise and cut straight to their songs next time-- when they want to be, they're actually quite good.","A common lament amongst music fans is that certain albums would be greatly improved if only the artist had cut ...

The Derby Ram,The Anomoanon,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0acc0084474cd0bfc24/1:1/w_160/c6ba8dd7.gif,2004-05-17 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/204-the-derby-ram/,Box Tree,"The Anomoanon can be a painfully organic outfit, evoking craggy branches, rotted bark, and well-packed dirtballs. Subsequently, listening to their latest record, The Derby Ram, feels a little bit like squeezing your eyes shut and chugging a giant mug of swamp water and blindly swallowing your way to a big, natural communion. But before you start conjuring pictures of handmade corduroys and hackeysacks, know that The Anomoanon are hardly hosting a gooey, neo-Dead flower fest-- The Derby Ram is overloaded with chew-or-be-chewed choices, and it's Ned Oldham's toothy ferocity that makes their jam-wankery so telling and immediate, the story of the forest as told by ripping Fenders. Miraculously, The Anomoanon have seized the Dead's scrappy, rollicking prowess, but eschewed their tye-dyed, hide-your-joint-in-your-beard meandering: The Anomoanon shoot to kill. For years, rock music has been tethered to one lone, misconstrued apex: the presumably unparalleled magic of the late 1960s. Check every Rolling Stone special issue, cable TV retrospective, and White Stripes review (almost all of which overflow with wistful, ""golden age"" laments)-- critics may spit and squabble about the technicalities, but most just clench their fists and insist that shit was so, so much better 35 years ago. The Anomoanon may remind us, at least peripherally, of why 1968 has been so stupidly puffed up, but their methods are more adventurous than derivative. All of the music on The Derby Ram was written by Oldham (The Anomoanon itself rotates through players, although Aran Stith, Jack Carneal and Willy MacLean have all made multiple appearances), but the lyrics here are simply credited as ""traditional""-- given 1998's Mother Goose, which recounted the old Mother Goose fairy tales, and 1999's A Child's Garden of Verses, based on Robert Louis Stevenson's collection of the same name, it's hardly surprising that Oldham has once again shied away from scribbling his own words. Still, the traditional lyrics included on The Derby Ram are the perfect compliment to The Anomoanon's sprawling, bizarre country-rock, which seems as displaced and poetically nonsensical as the snatches of verse it showcases. Each of The Derby Ram's 12 tracks coalesce effortlessly, perfectly anchored by the eerie (and-- at over seven minutes-- epic) title track. ""Bourbon Whiskey/The Derby Ram"" is a brooding, hellish smear of freaked-out psychedelia, kicked off by Oldham's interpretation of ""Rye Whiskey"", a traditional folk cut that, incidentally, also appears on Alan Lomax's American Ballads and Folk Songs. With Ned up front, The Anomoanon spew ancient prophecies, as told by squeaky banjoes and throbbing drums. The resulting song is both horrifying and enthralling, a sparse retelling of long-buried secrets. It's awfully easy to hop out of your chair and applaud music that successfully wiggles out of contemporary restraints, cracking head-on into the future and fashioning a fresh sonic path. But it's equally difficult to afford the exact same courtesy to bands and records that eschew the present by picking loosely through the past. The Anomoanon make ancient, outmoded sounds, all sprawling, plucky guitar and throaty vocals, traditional lyrics and wild, Vietnam-era noodling, but rather than sounding familiar or benign, they're brutally anachronistic, proving that, just as a laptop doesn't guarantee innovation, electric guitars can still knock everybody down.","The Anomoanon can be a painfully organic outfit, evoking craggy branches, rotted bark, and well-packed dirtballs.

Charlemagne,Charlemagne,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a704ea9e61561daa54ce/1:1/w_160/cd27d0b8.jpg,2004-05-16 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1761-charlemagne/,Winterlander,"I don't care what you think of Charlemagne's music; you have to dig the handlebar moustache. It's small on your screen, perhaps difficult to see in that tiny representation of the sepiatone album cover photo, but Charlemagne's sole operator, one Carl Johns, sports, in addition to antlers, a perfect handlebar, waxed up into sinister hooks flanking his nose and conferring order upon his bedhead. So, congratulations, Charlemagne, your record is guaranteed a solid rating of 1.0, regardless of its content. Thankfully, there's enough quality content encoded on the disc behind the moustache and its constituent face to render a rating that low unfathomable. Rather, Charlemagne's debut (Johns also has three albums out with his left-field country project NoahJohn-- Charlemagne appears to be his pop outlet) is a fine one-man-band effort bursting at the seams with glowing harmonies and spry pop that suggests a more caffeinated Kingsbury Manx. Johns' impressive texture of subtle, chiming synth, acoustic guitar and downplayed drums reaches apotheosis on ""Holland Daisy"", opening with a whistled melody and proceeding through a catchy verse to a prechorus that actually outdoes the chorus itself with its serpentine melodic twists. ""How Could He?"" is nearly as good, buoyed by a brilliantly simple bassline and a modest guitar solo, the vocals billowing in big, pillowy clouds of honeyed harmony. Though the record never quite reaches the high of these two songs again, the rest of the album is solid nonetheless: Slower numbers like ""Autumn Evenings"" and the watery epic ""Portrait with No Shortage of History""-- the latter a poem by Tenaya Darlington set to music by Johns-- unveil expertly crafted melodies over spare backing featuring puttering programmed percussion, electric piano and droning organs. Johns uses a limited tonal palette to achieve numerous effects over the course of the album, blanketing ""Prisoner Of..."" in a shroud of melancholy with the same ingredients that make ""How Could He?"" and ""Dawn Upon"" unmitigated blasts of sunshine. Of course, that limited tonal palette also means that the album as a whole is somewhat monochromatic, which is really the chief failing of Charlemagne. With all those too-genetically-perfect Carolingian harmonies slathered all over everything, it's easy for things to blur a bit, no matter how airtight the melodies are. Still, Johns has put together an engaging record all by his lonesome, which isn't terribly common in the realm of singer/songwriters.","I don't care what you think of Charlemagne's music; you have to dig the handlebar moustache.

Das Not Compute,Division of Laura Lee,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a85e6ef959693229fb/1:1/w_160/08886779.jpg,2004-05-16 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2344-das-not-compute/,EpitaphBurning Heart,"When it was released stateside in 2002, Division of Laura Lee's caustic debut album, 2001's Black City, sounded anonymous next to other much-hyped Swedish groups: The band lacked the idealistically retro politics of The (International) Noise Conspiracy, the delinquent nostalgia of The Raveonettes, the hippie-hobbitness of Soundtrack of Our Lives, and The Hives' ambitions for global domination-- not to mention their matching suits. The vaguely politicized punk of Black City certainly possessed ferocity and intensity, but toward no immediately apparent end. It wasn't that Division of Laura Lee didn't have a gimmick (which is certainly not required), but that they hadn't developed a collective identity-- or, if they had, they didn't seem to know how to convey it through music. On their follow-up, Das Not Compute, that skittishness is gone. By mixing the Detroit punk they claim as a defining influence with decidedly British-sounding elements, the band have carved a niche for themselves somewhere between motor city punk and grandiose production. This is neither an original nor a safe move, but it's definitely an upgrade, and to their credit, Division of Laura Lee aren't as interested in sweeping, soaring art-rock as in capturing a more aggressive, dirty sound; the elements they borrow from contemporary, effects-laden indie rock merely add artillery to their attack. A sculpted onslaught of stylized static, ghostly keyboards, and minor-key guitars highlight propulsive tracks like the opener, ""Does Compute"", and especially ""Endless Factories"", whose signature guitar line bridges the gap between The Bends and New Order. The surprisingly tender ""Breathe Breathe"" and ""To the Other Side"" (about the differences between Eastern and Western Europe) are quietly anthemic not-quite-ballads whose nearest kin might be Snow Patrol's ""Run"" or Coldplay's ""In My Place"". And the final track, ""There's a Last Time for Everything"", ends the album on an epic note and brings the band full circle-- thematically, at least-- to their debut EP, There's a First Time for Everything. These newer influences ebb and flow throughout Das Not Compute, completely defining a song like ""Endless Factories"" while notably absent from the more streamlined tracks like ""Sneaking Up on Mr. Prez"". But the album proves consistent enough to cohere into a clear sonic statement, which has refocused Division of Laura Lee's songwriting, both structurally and lyrically. The band have learned to sharpen their hooks to gouge deep into the skin, making songs like ""Does Compute"" and ""Dirty Love"" sound simultaneously distinct, yet part of a larger whole. Lyrically, Das Not Compute isn't nearly so consistent. Singer Per Stålberg crafts several awkward lines that don't seem to have translated very well, such as ""Give me back my wisdom"" from ""Does Compute""-- although the barreling momentum and the infectiousness of the chorus make that line barely noticeable. On the other hand, ""Dirty Love"", which features The Cardigans' Nina Persson, hinges on a particularly poetic chorus: ""I hate to see you blocking all the exits/ Turning into ghosts/ What can I do to get you on the dance floor?"" Division of Laura Lee realize they aren't going to cure listener ennui, but they at least give the crowd a beat to dance to. And later in the song, when Stålberg asks, ""What can I do to get you off the dance floor,"" it's unclear whether he's trying to bring the house down or foment a political movement. Or, perhaps, both: For Division of Laura Lee-- as for their former Burning Heart cohorts (International) Noise Conspiracy-- politics and music are so closely twined as to be practically indistinguishable. By combining American punk, British art-rock, and Swedish smarts to beef up their already muscular sound, they've not only developed a distinctive sonic personality on Das Not Compute, but they've developed a pose into a stance.","When it was released stateside in 2002, Division of Laura Lee's caustic debut album, 2001's Black City,\n ...

Ego Scriptor,Frog Eyes,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be71abf31b7dc7156151/1:1/w_160/f174b19d.gif,2004-05-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3266-ego-scriptor/,Absolutely Kosher,"O, the four-track. Simultaneously the most naively underrated and clumsily misused tool in all music (besides maybe the euphonium), it inhabits a special place in every musician's heart. It's where many of us laid our first bedroom opuses to tape, songs unmolested by Audio Units Parametric EQ'ing or other digital affectations. It's also a device that many (wrongly) associate with bad songs: Just because lots of musicians start writing and recording using it doesn't mean an artist can't one day commit his best material to a hissing C90. It's simply that, after a while, most songwriters choose to upgrade to better equipment, for the obvious advantages, leaving the four-track in the realm of embarrassing memories from one's humble beginnings in the craft. Ever mysterious and difficult to categorize, Frog Eyes have endeavored to deliver their songs back to the close-mic'd uteri on Ego Scriptor, a diminutive limited-press collection of 11 acoustic performances from the band's existing repertoire. Though many of the songs rendered on Ego Scriptor already had a distinctly lo-fi feel, they were buttressed by crystalline guitars and compressed drums-- nothing over-the-top for studio work, but polished nevertheless. On Ego Scriptor, those songs come unchained, losing their amplified baggage and morphing into vastly different creatures. Here, the band's bizarre, cockeyed song structures and Carey Mercer's sallow, serpentine vocals are lent heightened amorphousness by the austere musical backing. Not only are these songs stripped down in production, they're also uniformly limited to one or two verses. Of the 11 tracks, the longest, ""Sound Travels from the Snow to the Dark"", clocks in just shy of three minutes, while the album itself blows by in a scant 24. However, such brevity brings a sense of immediacy to the music, exaggerating the band's already abundant idiosyncrasies. The songs on Ego Scriptor range from intensely moving to intensely weird, poles Frog Eyes are no stranger to exploring. ""A Latex Ice Age"" opens the disc in the groggy amniotic fluid of a rainy Sunday morning, featuring Mercer's gruff, formless lyrics over a gently plucked acoustic guitar. ""Bells in the Crooked Port"" follows, impeding the sullen tone with more oblique, fairytale-esque verses and the album's most ineffaceable melody. Nowhere on Ego Scriptor is Mercer's voice more unsettling than here, especially when he moans, ""I need matrimony like a captain need's his pony."" Perhaps most instantly recognizable of any number, though, is ""One in Six Children Will Flee in Boats"", a standout from last year's The Golden River. In acousticized guise, Mercer recreates his vocal delivery almost verbatim over a simplistic strum, but the result is no less affecting. On the flipside, ""Sound Travels from the Snow to the Dark"" is nothing like its original, and hardly resembles a traditional song at all, winding through non-repetitive verses over a seemingly improvised guitar line. As with all Frog Eyes releases, Carey Mercer's bewildering voice steals the spotlight. I'm hard-pressed to think of anyone who so fully epitomizes the notion of the voice as an instrument. Mercer is a virtuoso of the human ability to make noise, and Ego Scriptor limns his talent in a harsh but honest light. My only complaint is that the songs are texturally limited, but that's to be expected from an acoustic album. The four-track is still an underrated tool, and Frog Eyes have used it keenly to produce a beautifully and often challengingly intimate album that fully capitalizes upon its possibilities.","O, the four-track.

Shadows Collide with People,John Frusciante,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be51eb335119a49ed046/1:1/w_160/dbab1e6e.jpg,2004-05-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3233-shadows-collide-with-people/,Warner Bros.,"After returning in the role of Lazarus to the long-running L.A. school play called RHCP, John Frusciante had a star turn in repurposing Californication and By the Way as wise, unwanky meditations on the mellow gold of life after hedonism. Parts of Shadows Collide with People align nicely with those records, both sonically and thematically, but the album is really an exercise in focusing, for Frusciante to ground his self-made stuff in the same resignation and emotion that makes the Chili Peppers' latter period more resonant than, say, ""Magic Johnson"". For Shadows, Frusciante has finally harnessed the energy and unqualified honesty that pulsed underneath the wandering Syd Barrett-ness of his weird work, and applied them to a reedy, vaguely psychedelic, and consistently melodic collection of songs. Heaven, pain, swirl, death, time, belief: on Shadows Collide with People, these are the splotches of color that burst most before his retinas. He probably never was, but Shadows proves Frusciante's unconcern with upholding his oft-referenced stature as The Most Awesomest Guitarist of His Generation, or whatever. Yeah, yeah, there are electric guitars here-- the fame rumination ""Second Walk"" ends with a great solo full of fuzzy tone and bent notes to crack Carlos Santana's skull-- but mostly, Frusciante and principal collaborator Josh Klinghoffer (of Bicycle Thief) indulge in the tricks and tracks of a full-fledged studio, building sparkly platforms for mercurial thoughts and snatches of meaning from whatever instruments and styles seem right in the moment. ""Carvel"" opens Shadows with punch, crosshatching urgent, bass-heavy modern rock with a brittle sort of psychedelia that becomes elemental to the record. ""Sending a dummy to my God,"" a newly vocally confident Frusciante sings over filtered synthesizers-- and then everything's brought back for a triumphant rock finish. ""Omission"" is a cousin to ""Californication"", its dry acoustic guitar getting help from processed electronics and what might be a mellotron. Frusciante's groggy yorn also melds nicely with Josh Klinghoffer's breezy falsetto. This record is actually filled with all manner of keys and electronic freakery, particularly on brooding instrumental pieces like ""Failure33Object"" or ""-00Ghost27"", but the rambling garage-rock of ""This Cold"" or the aforementioned ""Second Walk"" seems like an equally comfortable workspace. Not surprisingly, Frusciante also drifts regularly into the echoing astral stardust-- ""The Slaughter"" and ""In Relief"" both zig on cool comet's tails of bittersweet detachment: ""I was afraid to be me,"" he says on the latter. ""Be anything you want to be."" Shadows Collide with People, like all of Frusciante's earlier solo experiments, revels in self-indulgence. It's a steady flow of introspection and bent-light reflection. However, with a newfound attention to melody and structure, his hemming and hawing about life, death, and fluorescent guts comes into focus for the rest of us. In a previous time, a track called ""Regret"", with the only lyric being ""I regret my past/ Stay alone,"" might have been the darkly bruised heart of a destructive, impenetrable sonic diary. Not so in these new shadows. Here, shimmering over a tapestry of orchestral programming, Frusciante's voice cracks and yearns between processed splutters and reverb. Of course, he regrets his past-- he has, after all, come close to death on more than one occasion-- but in ""Regret""'s quietly surging melody, his own heartrending singing, and the overall warmth of Shadows Collide with People, what Frusciante's saying has never been more clear.","After returning in the role of Lazarus to the long-running L.A. school play called RHCP, John Frusciante had a ...

Since We Last Spoke,RJD2,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28213d19756521388b9/1:1/w_160/837099b5.jpg,2004-05-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6798-since-we-last-spoke/,Definitive Jux,"Since its release in the summer of 2002, Rjd2's commercial debut Dead Ringer has become recognized as one of hip-hop's most highly regarded turntablist records. A drum-funk tour-de-force, the record continued Def Jux's then-unparalled creative streak, spotlighting Rjd2 as the only hip-hop producer since DJ Shadow capable of taking to both long-form rhythmic experiments and 3:30 rap cages with such effortless dexterity. But just as seasons lead to new colors and moods, careers lead to new directions, and in two years, things have changed dramatically for R.J. Krohn. Since We Last Spoke is a dizzying taster's choice that plays like a broken radio dial, jumping from nostalgic A.M. soul and funk-rock cantinas to tech-house jams and retro synth vamps. Yet, while variety has been inherent in all of Rj's work, the mish-mash of styles on display here feels less like a result of intent than of indecision, and as a result, these sudden 180s tend to cut into the record's cohesiveness. Fortunately, Rjd2's picked up a wealth of new tricks since Dead Ringer to compensate for the unexpected stylistic transformation: Since We Last Spoke is packed with crashing silences and false senses of security, radical mutations of Dead Ringer's gritty electronic textures, and an overall darker tone that conjures rusted bridge girders, fractured kaleidoscopes, and smog-shrouded sunsets. ""Making Days Longer"" in particular breeds success, opening with the light pluck of oriental strings as a cavern opens to reveal a double helix of Metroid-evoking synth lines. Here, framed by reverberating analog lines and an aorta drum pulse, Krohn sweetly dictates the greatest telephone jingle never made: ""Strange how a phone call can change your day, take you away/ Away from the feeling of being alone/ That's the telephone."" For a guy who's been shadowed by a certain comparison throughout his relatively brief career, it's ironic that his sophomore slump, while never as problematic, so closely mirrors that of Josh Davis. Many of the missteps of Shadow's The Private Press are repeated here, as Rj shirks rapping and scratching in lieu of synths, and discovers the gentle strength of the indie rock vocal. On ""1976"", Krohn dons a leisure suit and bongos out his own copa-cobanger while subtle Moog helicopter drones, machine-gun horns, and car-chase bass spin a tale that might've felt more at home soundtracking Magnum P.I. than serving as the showcase cut from his latest LP. Rjd2 does return to his strengths on occasion here: ""To All of You"" is a soft-focus blaxploitation love theme recalling Isaac Hayes' Shaft mood-setting; ""One Day"" mellows out with gently pressed piano chords and dusky synthtones punctuated by a muted kickdrum and handclap-inflected snare hits; ""Exotic Talk"" jumps between a reworking of his fiery Urban Renewal Program contribution ""True Confessions"" and tense dropouts dripping with wah-wah'd clavinet. Still, Since We Last Spoke is something of a checker game: For every track like ""Someone's Second Kiss"", portraying the emotional severity of an android funeral dirge, there's another in which Rj throws back to the worst of the 1980s with a cheesy, guitar-centric pop/rocker like ""Through the Walls"". Over the course of Since We Last Spoke, Rjd2 experiments with indie rock, IDM, metal, Italo-disco, downtempo, and 80s R&B.; Unfortunately, few of these tracks wield the same impact as his tried-and-true hip-hop productions, and more often than not, feel like attempts at being everything to everyone. At the end of ""To All of You"", there's a minute-long stretch of rugged blues boom-bap and a scratched vocal repeating, ""Play that beat."" If only Rjd2 had heeded that advice.","Since its release in the summer of 2002, Rjd2's commercial debut Dead Ringer has become recognized as one of ...

The album has recently found its way into more than a few blue-and-orange Other Music bags, which, given its influences, is no real surprise: The album recalls everyone from Can and Joy Division to Tan's fellow countrymen Air and Serge Gainsbourg-- all names commonly dropped in reference to records with at least a week's worth of faded black jeans cred. Add to this a companion DVD of music videos (Colder is first and foremost a video artist) and the fact that the album is currently available only on import, and Again becomes the embroidered, double-button collared shirt of taste-made 2003 releases. Which is maybe part of why I was so hesitant to come to a conclusion on it. At the moment, its sound is at the height of chic, the perfect late-night complement to an evening of jealous lovers and Le Tigre remixes. To this effect, the beat-driven album is neither ambient wallpaper nor sweaty loveromp-- if anything, it's an enticing after-shower cigarette that, with any interest in the current musical climate, one can't help but smoke. Stylistically, though, the album (especially the first half) complements its uptempo brethren almost too perfectly, and at the expense of substantial songs. Each of Colder's nine tracks is expertly stylized with the rubbery dub and dark groove primacy this year has indulged to a dangerously indiscriminate degree-- they're equally average, and one would be hard-pressed to pinpoint any particular standouts. The suction cup bassline of ""Confusion"" stammers as if through rain puddles, a remarkable texture that teethes Tan's hushed but charmingly mispronounced vocal melody. Album single ""Crazy Love"" initially seems excusably repetitive, but as Tan continues singing, the song becomes unnecessarily tedious. A similar problem plagues the sexy electro-dub of ""One Night in Tokyo"", which opens with conviction but soon whimpers out, and the found sound and renegade funk of ""Version"", which curiously recalls musique concrete icon Pierre Henry's psychedelic Messe Pour le Temps Present. Again would have made a much more solid album had it exhausted its ideas in half the runtime. As it stands, there's simply not enough development within any track to justify its length, and the loops are too subdued and unengaging to hold its listeners' attention. The album's second half seems less guilty of this than the first, as tracks like ""Silicone Sexy"" and ""Where"" undergo ample metamorphoses with a surely German, vaguely Kompakt degree of subtlety, as does ""Colder"", the goth album closer in which Tan's words trip over organs and minimal rhythmic affections.

Cool to Be You,Descendents,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6deb335119a49eca2a/1:1/w_160/707ad120.jpg,2004-05-13 05:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2547-cool-to-be-you/,Fat Wreck Chords,"Serious is a subjective term. In 25 years as a band, writing songs on such blithe yet cosmically related topics as girls, television and spicy food, the Descendents have been called a lot of things, and serious isn't one of them. On the other hand, ten albums and a best-of collection is a pretty serious output, regardless of the band's sometimes trifling subject matter. And though they've always affected an irreverent, lighthearted persona, the Descendents have written more than a handful of seriously great songs. Ever battling a self-styled ""war against mediocrity,"" the band have witnessed the relentless ebb and flow of countless cultural trends, and on Cool to Be You, their first album in eight years, they continue to resist deviation from a sound they helped bring to the fore in the early 1980s. After spending most of their first two decades on SST, the band moved to Epitaph in 1996 to release Everything Sucks, a wontedly transient collection of pop/punk nuggets, many of which saw immediate induction into the Descendents pantheon. ""Coffee Mug"" was a memorable, if paltry, punk seizure that beat Michael Johnson in his best 400 meters, and more importantly, kept pace with other classic sprints in the band's catalog. But following that effort, frontman and cover art muse Milo Auckerman returned to his on-again, off-again career as a chemist, effectively putting the Descendents on the backburner. So behold the fruits of eight years' relentless experimentation-- that is, real experimentation, in an actual biochemical laboratory. Though it appears Auckerman's day job has finally earned him the bankroll to support a new pair of horned-rims, the Descendents have emerged as their same old selves. During their downtime, members Karl Alvarez, Stephen Egerton and ex-Black Flag drummer Bill Stevenson managed to release three studio albums as the wacky but inessential spin-off All, and while that band has never pulled the critical weight of the Descendents, it seems to have kept them sharp technically-- now reunited on Fat Wreck Chords, the group seems strong as ever, thrashing as always in the name of food and flatulence. Case in point: ""Blast Off"", a song that attempts to reconcile both interests with lyrics like, ""Stay away from the chili verde/ Unless you want to get blown away,"" and, ""Capsaicinoids are a thing to avoid/ Unless you want to burn in that 'roid."" While maturity may not have gained any import to the band in their time off, they remain as good for a hook as they were 20 years yore. ""Talking"" is the most anthemic of the Cool to Be You lot, featuring a winsome guitar melody, a giddy bassline, and Auckerman's typically pining verses. ""Nothing with You"" revels in their signature braindead juvenilia, and its music is pleasantly complementary. Meanwhile, on ""Dreams"", Milo affirms his reputation as an inwardly self-loathing nerd, spitting cynical, clever salvos like, ""Why do I get my hopes up at all?/ I've been living this Walter Mitty life for too long."" The song represents Cool to Be You's fiercest moment, and though it lacks pubescent humor, it would feel right at home amongst the band's 80s arsenal. Elsewhere, the band waxes serious: On EP-carryover ""'Merican"", they step outside their teenage matrix and reach for relevance. The result, however, betrays the tongue-in-cheek introspectiveness that won the band the bulk of their adoration, and its lyrics about American arrogance and double standards not only lack the dumb fun of the rest of the record, but are also disconcertingly trite. Luckily, ""One More Day"" and ""Maddie"" are redeemingly heartfelt and riff-laden, while the album closer, ""Dry Spell"", catchily (if needlessly) reiterates the point. Its speedy final chorus seems somewhat anticlimactic-- but somehow, it seems humbly appropriate: Rather than forcing an ostentatious grand finale, the Descendents unassumingly steal away, leaving their legacy fully intact.","Serious is a subjective term.

Good Morning Good Night,Sachiko MOtomo YoshihideToshimaru Nakamura,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45eeb335119a49ed924/1:1/w_160/5c896fee.gif,2004-05-13 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5585-good-morning-good-night/,Erstwhile,"Even taking into account its unusually mundane title, I could never shake the feeling that I was hearing an almost literal translation of natural ambience on Good Morning Good Night. This isn't the first time I've suspected that Japanese minimal improvisation was pulling chief inspiration from the ""outside""-- think the color of horizons and sound of wind on a contact mic-- but here, I was confronted with what seemed like obvious references to nature. And you really have to be careful with stuff like that, because looking for literal translations in something so at the mercy of not only chance, but also rampant subjective interpretation on behalf of the musicians and the rest of us, usually ends up short-changing the sounds at hand. Improvised performance isn't bound to a concept in the way that more traditional ambient music can be; yet, the music on this set clings to natural impressions like a portrait. Sachiko M, Toshimaru Nakamura and Yoshihide Otomo need no introduction to anyone following electro-acoustic improv (""EAI""), and specifically Tokyo's Onkyo scene; they're the three most celebrated proponents of minimal electronic improvisation in Japan. Through many releases and performances since the mid-90s, these musicians have contributed to a kind of music that simply didn't exist before them. However, since Onkyo hasn't really translated well to more rock-centric circles (in the same ways that, say, Merzbow does), I'm not expecting all of you to share the anticipation I had for Good Morning Good Night, a two-disc set marking the first time they've released music as a trio. Yet, unlike Merzbow, this music will hardly clear rooms, and given its apparent relationship to the organic world, it could very well hit the spot for many folks not ordinarily down with the whole crazy-freak-noise thing. Beginning with ""Good Morning"", the set seems to detail the cycle of a day, following with ""Good Afternoon"", ""Good Evening"" and ""Good Night""-- and like most mornings, it begins hesitantly before waking into a flutter of activity. No instrumental credits are listed, but I can guess that it's Sachiko's sine crawling from beneath Otomo's scratchy turntable several minutes into the piece. The first segment of the piece seemed to signify only hints of movement underneath a horizon, and after a resulting clamor, Sachiko's ""voice"" is like the initiation of the normal morning routine. Vinyl scratch eases its way back in, like dozens of slightly annoying tasks the outside world takes for granted, and just before shutting down momentarily, the sine raises its pitch in protest. The piece is like a topological diagram of a.m. activity, not so much depicting the pace of one person, but the scheme of a whole city tracked by a particularly perceptive satellite. To my ears, Good Morning Good Night is sparser than other outings featuring the same musicians (Filament, Cosmos, Nakamura's solo work). ""Good Evening"" might well be an interesting diagram of a community winding down, but it's a decidedly tranquil one. Again, I wonder if linking this music to specific scenes (much less the titles) is for the best, as moments suggest more individual activity than meta. Sachiko's sampler has a brief, fragmented volley with Otomo's turntable, moderated by the sine from Nakamura's no-input mixing board; I'm hard pressed to read much into it, but it's one of the cooler moments on the set. Likewise, during ""Good Night"", after having occupied most of the piece using extended bass and sine tones, the trio suddenly engages in relatively tense, static-ridden dissonance. It's an enigmatic way to end the piece if they were going for a programmatic depiction of late-night, but a pretty cool way shake things up otherwise. Even if I wouldn't recommend that Onkyo neophytes start here, there's still plenty to hear for fans and satellite surveyors alike.",,7.3,
It's Not Funny,David Cross,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ae9d034d5c69bf35ca/1:1/w_160/d9dd25df.jpg,2004-05-13 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1676-its-not-funny/,Sub Pop,"The devastating paradox of David Cross' pre-recorded comedy: Is it funny that everything Cross says is nauseatingly smug, yelped out in smarmy, supercilious prose? Or is David Cross just a giant fucking asshole? That Cross is such an immensely unlikable live performer-- condescending, defensive, arrogant, patronizing-- is both his greatest asset and his most crippling flaw, and it's that conflict-of-interest that makes him such a polarizing (and compelling) comic. Ultimately, Cross has somehow manipulated self-satisfaction, the least funny of all post-collegiate states, into a perfectly valid comedic persona, leaving it up to his audience to sort out their guffaws from their grimaces. And there are always plenty of both. Having signed a contract with Sub Pop, liner-note-repped for The Fiery Furnaces, stunt-reviewed for Rolling Stone and Spin, toured with rock bands, publicly mocked Staind/Evanescence/Scott Stapp, and acquired a perfect pair of black, plastic-framed glasses, David Cross has inadvertently embedded himself in the contemporary indie scene, amassing wads of useless cred and granting hipsters even more reasons to be annoyingly sarcastic over cans of PBR. It's Not Funny conceals bits of comic gold (on fresh fathers who complain about the trials of paternity: ""Try talking your girlfriend into her third consecutive abortion. That takes finesse! You're just inconvenienced""), but Cross' onstage persona, unlike the genius of Mr. Show, is also stupidly tiring, all balls-swinging swagger and brainy pseudo-superiority. Recorded in January at Washington, D.C.'s The Improv, It's Not Funny (oh, and the knee-jerk critical reaction to pre-emptive album titles? It's not funny) sees Cross faced with a responsive-if-feisty crowd. As with 2003's Let America Laugh, Cross approaches all hecklers with genuine, undisguised disgust. When Cross is questioned on a bit in which he glibly suggests that dogs are smarter than women, he pauses briefly to ask, ""You don't believe it? You believe that I didn't do a series of tests? You're right to not believe it, because I'm gonna go ahead and admit that I do not believe what I just said. It is what is described as 'a joke.'"" Cross' material has been progressively skewing towards the political, and, for better or worse, the post-9/11, where-we-are-now theme persists throughout most of It's Not Funny. Some of Cross' terror-talk is supremely well-played, but a lot of his material also seems tired and curiously dated, particularly since It's Not Funny was only recorded four months ago. Cross' fuck-off snarkiness may be a welcome antidote to the nauseatingly maudlin faux-sincerity perpetuated by men in public office, but is it still clever to snicker about the futility of the color-coded terror system? Everyone already gets that announcing an ""Orange Alert"" is stupid. Same goes for the call to secure duct tape and plastic sheeting from your local Home Depot. 36 episodes of Saturday Night Live later: Um, hee-haw. Cross, like most Americans, remembers how, in the weeks following 9/11, a big, throbbing wave of convoluted friend-of-friend free-associating plowed through the U.S. Everyone immediately removed from the explicit devastation of Ground Zero struggled for the appropriate entranceway into earnest empathy, noting second cousins in Hoboken or that friend whose plane got re-routed through Ft. Lauderdale. In some ways, that kind of blind, desperate grasping was perfectly understandable-- curling your fingers around one lone tragedy (or near-tragedy) is a lot easier to swallow than attempting to reconcile yourself to a gaping and anonymous mass grave. Still, many New Yorkers (in impeccable New Yorker form) found America's faux-brotherhood annoying, scowling disgustedly from behind their paper surgical masks, rolling their eyes, and snorting at sobbing newscasters in Phoenix. The behavior of both sides has already been well-explored, but Cross still opts to launch into a half-cooked skit about how employees of Vegas' New York New York casino may have ""felt it a little deeper."" Cross successfully lands some giggly barbs (riffing caustically about the sobbing overweight woman in Accounts Receivable, with a ""Hunky Fireman"" calendar and stack of Dilbert cartoons), but his over-indignant NYC pride/national irritation still reeks of Georgian transplantation. Subsequently, it's hard to find his defensive posturing funny: Cross may be joking, but it's still clear that he wants to own the tragedy of 9/11, like all New Yorkers who spent hours re-routing their morning commutes or trying to forget the sound of a plane crashing into a building full of people. The problem is that his plea-for-possession-masquerading-as-a-joke ends up being far too self-serious to be even a little bit laughable. Still, in the end, it's impossible not to appreciate Cross' political tirades, particularly since precious few independent artists seem to have the balls/gumption/awareness to tackle what is easily the most salient and divisive conflict of the new millennium so far. Comedy has always been politically brazen where music is meek, and Cross is unrelenting: His high-speed, Michael Moore-ish indictment of the Bush administration's manipulation of public fear is both convincing and entertaining, while his whispered mockery of Bush's misappropriation of ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" elicits loads of knowing sniggers. Anti-war proselytizing aside, Cross lobs plenty of other, equally legitimate (if disappointingly predictable) darts at the hypocrisies of the American government, and at the general idiocy of Creationists, racists, homophobes, Republicans, people with children, Trent Lott and Strom Thurmond, electric scissors, fundamentalist Christians, the rich, and Fox News. It is, for the most part, standard white liberal disdain-- but sometimes funnier, and with lots more cursing.","The devastating paradox of David Cross' pre-recorded comedy: Is it funny that everything Cross says is nauseatingly smug, yelped out ...

Treddin' on Thin Ice,Wiley,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa959d034d5c69bf3e91/1:1/w_160/739f3e4e.jpg,2004-05-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8775-treddin-on-thin-ice/,XL,"Emerging from the ranks of low-budget London beatsmiths who subscribe to a post-garage sound called ""Eski Beat"", Wiley made himself the pirate radio vanguard of his scene, founded the genre's dominant group Roll Deep Crew, and affiliated himself with Dizzee Rascal, the hottest blue-chipper in the game. Now, on his solo debut, he attempts to bring one of the British urban landscape's few legitimate youth beats to a wider international audience. But before we go any further, let's establish something: Wiley is not Dizzee, and those who approach this record expecting highwire vocal acrobatics and dirt-merchant bass/synth blasts will likely be caught off guard by Wiley's more pop-orientated approach and comparative stability. Additionally, while both artists hail from the same crew, their methods of dealing with problem are markedly different: Wiley seems to feel remorse for his days as a young gunslinger on E3, while Dizzee still appears perfectly content to take out those who oppose him, despite his distinct comprehension of society's ills. Wiley's music also falls closer to a straight amalgam of rap and dancehall than Dizzee's icy curveball beats and synth stabs, dictating his verses with crystal clarity while riding a bouncy, repetitious style that complements his undulating basslines. ""Goin' Mad"" shows the Eski Boy in top form, taking to schizophrenic self-help over tetherball ragga bass and rubber duck sounds. Here, he relates money as a gateway to insanity (""Money is paper, how could paper be evil?/ It must be people, doing those evil things with money/ But you'll go mad""), coaxes himself from a bout of crippling apathy (""Pick... yourself... up/ Get up, stand up/ Dust... myself... off/ Realize I' m someone/ Yeah, yeah""), and triumphantly regains his stability. ""Reason"" stands out as well, with one of Thin Ice's most explosive and technical beats. Wiley once again shirks snares, dressing his kickdrums with top hi-hats and handclaps before sailing into a typhoon of mercurial synth bass. Lyrically, he attempts to reconcile with both former love interests (""I'm real, I wouldn't do anything directly at you/ Come on, this is me we're talkin' about"") and rival crews (""I know you hate me 'cause you think I write lyrics/ And I aim them at your crew/ Come on, blood, that's not true""). Much of the grime scene's draw can be traced to its unusual production, and Wiley's solo inauguration is no exception. Whether taking a rusty cleaver to an SWV track (""Special Girl""), leaving a synth bird loosely caged in a blizzard (""Treddin' on Thin Ice"") or conducting a robotic version of Fat Albert's Junkyard Gang (""Wot Do U Call It?""), Wiley proves an incredibly technical street professional that's only now hitting his stride. Although his beats do tend to err a bit on the repetitive side (there are a few sounds in particular he seems quite fond of), subtle and intriguing variations quickly distinguish themselves with repeated listens. I could probably have done without Thin Ice's various instrumental interludes, and would have enjoyed more topical and lyrical diversity, but ultimately, Wiley's snapshot of London's ghettos proves worth the trip across the pond.","Emerging from the ranks of low-budget London beatsmiths who subscribe to a post-garage sound called ""Eski Beat"", Wiley made himself ...

C'mon Miracle,Mirah,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35613d197565213bcf5/1:1/w_160/a28faf1e.jpg,2004-05-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5332-cmon-miracle/,K,"I know nothing about Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn's early years but I always assumed that The Microphones' most promising alumna grew up in a commune-- the kind where children tend to their own herb garden, perform light kitchen duty and rotate ownership of a bicycle. This (admittedly reductive) theory would explain not only the persistent whiff of the campfire that hovers about Mirah's music, but also her staggering lack of self-consciousness. A terrific songwriter when she bothers to finish her songs, Mirah finds her own creativity fascinating enough to share every stage of the process with her listeners: To date, her albums have brimmed with sketches, songlets, snatches of ambiance (crickets, etc.) and private snapshots of in-studio fun. At times, this 60/40 mix of confessional folk and art brut collage has felt somewhat unnatural and not a little indulgent. At the same time, Mirah's blissed-out obliviousness to form and format has kept fans and critics in suspense: It was clear that as soon as she dropped the shtick, a great album would follow. Teasers were plentiful-- the Cinemascope sweep of ""Cold Cold Water"" chief among them-- but the record she hinted at didn't arrive until now. If all the past tense hasn't tipped you off already, C'mon Miracle is it. Mirah, it appears, has made the album we've been waiting for. The author's endearing weirdness is still present; she's so utterly unconcerned with context that she kicks things off with a jazzy ballad whose chorus coos, ""Come away with me."" This time around, however, Mirah's wilder impulses miraculously defer to songcraft first-- there's not a meandering note on the album. Her trademark plinky ukulele draws polite curlicues throughout the record (and never receives its own track listing); her barking percussion loops co-exist with warm 60s-style drums. ""The Light"" is an immediate highlight. A two-parter that unfolds like a power ballad in reverse, its first 90 seconds rock assuredly with a fantastically winding vocal line, while the second half slows to a serene coffeehouse strum. ""We're Both So Sorry"" is also quick to stand out-- of all C'mon Miracle's 11 tracks, it comes closest to matching the bizarre grandeur of ""Cold Cold Water"". Unidentifiable instruments (is that an autoharp? harmonium? horns?) float in and out of its mix, just before a nasty synth pulse takes over halfway through. And at song's end, Mirah's fragile vocal enters just in time to keep it all from collapsing in a heap: ""I'm sorry about so much, baby, but I know you understand."" Straightforwardness does occasionally hinder Mirah in the lyric department. ""Jerusalem"" squanders one of the album's best melodies on ""lessons we should learn from all the fighting in the days of old"" and the admonishing chorus of, ""So, now, Jerusalem, you know that it's not right."" Thankfully, the singer's sense of humor reappears just in time, in the album's gentle final third. Mirah loves a fun shuffle (witness Black Mountain Music Project's ""Oh! September"" and the French-folk pastiche of ""Light the Match"", off Advisory Committee), and here, ""The Dogs of Buenos Aires"" and the tango closer ""Exactly Where We're From"" lighten the proceedings a bit. The album winds down quietly, almost apologetically, as if seized by second thoughts about its own catchiness. But these songs need no apology-- C'mon Miracle is not a crass bid for popularity, just an organic shift towards pop idiom. I hope that Mirah herself doesn't view it as a compromise or a concession; from here, it just looks like growing up.",,8.5,
Fancey,Fancey,by: Johnny Loftus,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be90eb335119a49ed09f/1:1/w_160/bd3800d1.jpg,2004-05-12 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3297-fancey/,March,"Welcome back to First Turn-On, where our next guest is Todd Fancey. Todd enjoys New Pornography, raglan, teardrop windows, timeless curves, and burnt sienna. He's been called a throwback, even a kitschist by some elitist duffers. But our audience thinks otherwise, and Todd's here today-- all the way from Vancouver!-- to tell us how it really goes down. Take it away, Todd! As it turns out, Todd Fancey does have a fetish for the filtered bliss of 1970s pop, strains of which stream through his self-titled debut like Toughskins through the turnstiles at a Stand Back-era April Wine gig. But the New Porn guitarist seems to figure that the best way to celebrate is to reinvent, so he shades his songs in sun-dappled, modernist progressions. ""Carry Me"" kicks things off with a warm, if slightly melancholic organ tone, but the introspection is quickly chased off by the introduction of a Wurlitzer, Fancey's first-class Beach Boys vocal, and that bouncy-ass arrangement. Still, he admits to not knowing just where he's going: ""How pathetic I've become,"" he sings, the sentiment reflecting the sadness of the song's initial notes. It's this sort of smart songwriting that makes Fancey such a now album. It's referential, yet more mindful of mood than your average bearded 70s van driver/songwriter. Keys and women are recurring themes on Fancey-- ""Dial Jupiter"" plays them off moon cheese and fuzz guitar, while ""Sunbrite"" layers whizzy synths and backup coos over a slight disco beat suggestive of Tahiti 80 or Ivy. Paranoia also continues to percolate here and there, particularly under the pedal steel shimmer of ""In Town"", but Todd is also content to sing about the simpler things in life: Getting high, for instance, figures mightily into this soft-focus equation. But Fancey is at his best when he's focusing on utterly simplistic immediacy. Would you like to hear a fun, giddily rocking song about drivin' and ""Rock and Roll Rhythm""? Perhaps the pleasantly hungover quality of ""Saturday Morning"" is more your speed. Well, close your eyes, then, and listen to the buttery Todd tones. As he sings, harpists and wah peddle guitarists flicker and appear in the corners of your bedroom, and summer sunlight gleams in your girlfriend's hair. Of course, wily pop freak that he is, Fancey has to fuck with that fuzzy Friday sex fantasy, following ""Saturday Morning""'s buzz with the resigned downer duet of ""'Til the Morning Comes"". The contemplative organs and pretty synth washes are still here, but there's that melancholy again. ""I was better off in bed,"" Todd begins haltingly, and his girl just asks for a ride home. Still, despite its relationship woe, ""Morning Comes"" is one of Fancey's stronger songs, beautifully sketching freehand over 70s references and the clean lines of 21st century soft rock. After all its highs and those little counterbalancing lows, Fancey ends with the sweeter-than-citrus ""I'll Be Down"". The Wurlitzer is happy again, and there seems to be some talk about doorways to the other side and dosing. As the lilting beat starts to take effect, an accordion fades in from the ether, and the harmonies rise and fall like the breath of an early summer day. Throwback? Hardly. Todd Fancey's just singing about those moments when the world is in focus, and life's as pretty as Miss September '73.","Welcome back to First Turn-On, where our next guest is Todd Fancey.

Neurofibrio,Claro Intelecto,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7035e6ef95969320e94/1:1/w_160/0ffdec10.gif,2004-05-12 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1760-neurofibrio/,AI,"Hearing certain electro records on a warm evening can make you want to rent a convertible and drive a stretch of highway that runs along the ocean. Call it the Jan Hammer Miami Vice effect: stiff beats, Star Wars laser sounds, simple three- and four-note melodies so unyielding in their repetition you can close your eyes and see the green lights moving left to right along the sequencer-- put these ingredients together in the right way and you have a seriously enjoyable simple pleasure. Purely electronic music found early popular acceptance in electro, and sometimes the genre seems like the form most perfectly suited to the intuitive life of the machine. On his debut full-length, Neurofibrio, Manchester's Mark Stewart (who releases music as Claro Intelecto) does electro right. Electro is not all he's doing here-- the strong influence of Detroit techno is detectable as well, and he occasionally dips his toes into a more abstract ambient pool-- but the electro spirit is at the core of every musical gesture. Though Stewart is a fan of 80s electropop, no track on Neurofibrio suggests that it could be a proper song if fleshed out with the right vocalist. These songs work strictly by addition and subtraction; rather than developing, they snap in and out of place like joints. The cool ""Percentages"" can be reduced to a few squelchy bass notes put together in a catchy way, a keyboard stab that sounds like a funk guitar sample, the kind of vintage Roland keyboard Jan Jelinek loves to sample, and a barely-there drum machine pattern. They come and they go, but the piece never dulls over more than six minutes because each individual sound is so well rendered. ""Mono"", with its half-clap snare hit and impossibly funky circular bassline is like Grandmaster Flash's ""Scorpio"" with the Furious Five laying out. ""Nobody"" and ""Contact"" add a 4/4 pulse and come closer to classic techno, upping the alienation and moving away from the street party vibe. Though heavy on upbeat rhythmic cuts, a few impressionist tracks round out the record and make Neurofibrio even more compelling as a collection. ""Baudrillards Supper"" and ""You Not Me"", for example, are stark, quiet tracks built from stark piano melodies that use glitchy percussion for contrast. Yes, the record is a bit retro and we've definitely heard these sounds before, but electro is not a genre that demands constant innovation. Nervous future-shock jitter and melancholy synth washes never go out of style. This is the sound of the city from back when Blade Runner seemed like prophecy, but Claro Intelecto's take is patient and ultimately lets in a bit of light.","Hearing certain electro records on a warm evening can make you want to rent a convertible and drive a stretch ...

Rocket Redux,Rocket from the Tombs,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29613d19756521388e1/1:1/w_160/e0922a5c.jpg,2004-05-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6815-rocket-redux/,MorphiusSmog Veil,"When most old bands reunite, they have a real history. A couple of albums, maybe some EPs or seven-inches to their name-- a discography that they crafted in their initial time together. Frequently, it must be said, these reunions do much to tarnish the legacy of their discography. But what happens when a band whose history is primarily the stuff of legend, and whose discography is mostly unofficial or pieced together from disparate sources, reforms to take another shot at something that never fully coalesced in the first place? If this album from a reconstituted Rocket from the Tombs is any indication, great things. Rocket from the Tombs were originally only a band for about 200 days in the winter of 1974 and the spring of 1975, but what transpired in that condensed period was intense, and helped to plot the course of punk and post-punk a couple of years before either of those phenomena reached the mainstream. Part of what makes Rocket from the Tombs such an intriguing piece of rock arcane is that, as a band, they were lacking in a singular vision and direction-- rather, each member had his own ideas about where ideas and songs should be taken. This tension naturally ripped the band apart at the seams, and in the process, spun off two of Cleveland's greatest groups, The Dead Boys and Pere Ubu. However, the music written under those circumstances was a fascinating mélange of rock convention and restless experimentalism. Most of it never made it to tape in any kind of fully realized state-- although both Ubu and The Dead Boys held over a few songs from the Rocket from the Tombs repertoire for their own catalogs-- instead surviving only in the form of crude demos and lo-fi live recordings made in the lofts of Cleveland as the city rusted outside. Two years ago, we were finally treated to an official compilation of existing Rocket from the Tombs recordings, in the form of The Day the Earth Met Rocket from the Tombs, a hardly comprehensive but nonetheless invaluable and much-needed document that helped to flesh out a chapter of the punk story that had only previously been sketched in lightly. The surviving band members couldn't help but notice the warm reception this disc received, and now, nearly 30 full years after they were written, Rocket from the Tombs have finally made a proper album out of these tunes. Calling it Rocket Redux is somewhat accurate, but frankly, the flippancy of the title doesn't do quite enough to recommend the album, which is as vital and energetic as any of their past recordings, although with much better sound. The fact that these guys are all in their 50s now is astounding: David Thomas (who performed as Crocus Behemoth in his RFTT days) is still as deranged and surreal a vocalist as ever, and with the grit that original tombsters Cheetah Chrome (aka Gene O'Connor) and Craig Bell put into their respective guitar and bass playing, it feels like scarcely a day has passed. Current Ubu drummer Steve Mehlman subs for Johnny Madansky, while Television's Richard Lloyd fills the void left by late guitarist Peter Laughner, perhaps the band's most visionary member, tragically felled by a drug habit in 1977 at 25. (Ironically, Laughner was once a candidate to replace Lloyd in Television). This potent lineup spins through 12 Rocket from the Tombs originals, and it's easy to make the case that this is actually the best starting point for the curious seeking to check out the band. Laughner's amazing ballad ""Amphetamine"" could go toe-to-toe with any Springsteen anthem from the same period, and is made all the more crushing by Laughner's references to premature death. Thomas' delivery on this track is remarkably restrained, and you can tell that this performance means just a little bit more for him than the punk rave-ups that surround it. Of course, those rave-ups are all excellent, with demented guitar interplay strangling ""Down in Flames"", while ""Never Gonna Kill Myself Again"" reveals itself as a close cousin of Mission of Burma's ""That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate"". Elsewhere, ""Final Solution"" jitters and twitches, its crumbling melody (which heavily references ""Summertime Blues"") held up by adroit guitarwork, and eventually, spooky backing harmonies. The guitars drip with passion on ""What Love Is"", as though Lloyd is trying to prove he belongs, while Thomas' refrain of ""Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?"" (penned by Laughner) comes out haunting and almost resigned. The high-speed punk bookends ""Frustration"" and ""Life Stinks"" are frenzied and brutal, and the sound is like a punch in the gut compared to the previously available version. Rocket Redux never sounds like a complacent reunion record, and in a way, I suppose it's not really a reunion record in the first place so much as it's a debut album, played with all the hunger and fire of a band eager to make their mark on the world. Rocket from the Tombs have already done that, of course, but I'm glad they came back to give it one more go, because the result is an album anyone investigating the roots of punk should have-- one that finally completes the band's chapter in rock's great book.","When most old bands reunite, they have a real history.

50 Foot Wave,50FootWave,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be8eea9e61561daa78f9/1:1/w_160/822426cc.gif,2004-05-11 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3295-50-foot-wave/,Throwing Music,"After clocking two decades behind an electric guitar and howling at one club crowd after another, nobody would blame Kristin Hersh if she cut out touring altogether and switched full-time to an acoustic guitar and long spells in the studio. On last year's sorely underrecognized The Grotto, Hersh's intense solo act had never sounded better. But even as her solo work gets quieter, Hersh's rock side is louder than ever: Throwing Muses' 2003 reunion album, cut in just three weeks, knocked more cracks into plaster than any of their past albums. This year, with almost no fanfare, Hersh started a brand-new punk band. Like the Muses, 50 Foot Wave is a rock trio, and it features Muses bassist Bernard Georges-- but it's a different band, with none of the baggage and a completely new business plan. 50 Foot Wave is Hersh's rapid response project, built for short albums and long tours, and she promises that the group will self-release new EPs every nine months and support them with a hard-to-believe 100 shows a year. Their first disc is so recognizably Hersh's that it immediately sounds like the Muses: Truck-collision guitars and flayed screams scrape over a pounding rhythm section, and the lyrics that make it to the surface either sound pissed off or grotesque (sample truism: ""Bones were made to be broken."") But if 50 Foot Wave resemble the Muses, they do so without the drama. Much of the Muses' loudest work blew open like the earth and heaved with mood swings, like the emotional see-saw ""Pretty or Not"". By contrast, 50 Foot Wave is a succession of angry blows that end too fast to hurt. Much as the bandname's promise of tsunami torrents fits the magnitude of Hersh's distortion, a sleeker metaphor might have suited them better-- something like a hyper-tuned sports car, that can take the corners of the band's multi-sectioned math-rock and run you down like so many pylons. At this intensity, the six songs-- already broken into quick changes and hastily-dropped riffs-- can fly like an undifferentiated blur. These aren't songs you'll get attached to, and if the band doesn't push its parameters, you may not need more than one EP at a time. And, of course, Hersh can release that way if she chooses, like postcards from the road. You can credit a lot of the date's exuberance to that marketing plan: After years of fighting with record labels, struggling for money and releasing albums on someone else's schedule, Hersh has total control of the product. Younger bands play this hard because they're just psyched to record; mature bands sound this excited because they know they're getting the money.","After clocking two decades behind an electric guitar and howling at one club crowd after another, nobody would blame Kristin ...

Hotel Morgen,To Rococo Rot,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c45e6ef95969321068/1:1/w_160/2b7096f2.jpg,2004-05-11 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8081-hotel-morgen/,Domino,"Well, I like the title. Hotels are places of transience, refuge and the very briefest of romantic encounters. As I unwrap the cellophane from To Rococo Rot's fifth album, I can scarcely shake the memories of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in which Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo violate hotel rooms in ways that would have Aerosmith shrinking in repulsion. Things happen in hotels. The White Stripes (""Hotel Yorba""), Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds (""God's Hotel""), and yes, even Cassidy & R. Kelly (""Hotel"") have all recognized the strange echoes and rhythms that permeate these rooming houses of the drifting, unsettled and hedonistic. I, for one, was looking forward to To Rococo Rot's entry into this canon. This German outfit started as an art project back in 1995, but despite their trademark smoothness, they seem to mute all expressive idiosyncrasies in favor of tribute to (and emulation of) any number of influences. Broadly speaking, Hotel Morgen fills in a few gaps between Kraftwerk and Plaid, but is never as interesting as this might suggest. To their credit, they've resisted the forays into drum-n-bass that seem to tempt most stalwart electronica artists, but the Lippok brothers and Stefan Schneider do lean towards house (""Bologna"") and lounge (""Sol"") here without ever owning the styles. In short, Hotel Morgen mirrors an array of contemporary electronic approaches, but its reflected image takes a bit of the luster away. Not exactly The Animals' ""Hotel Hell"". More than previous To Rococo Rot releases, Hotel Morgen is rooted in somnambulance, with lulling tracks like ""Non Song"" and ""Opak"" recalling Eno's Music for Films and Apollo Atmospheres and Soundtracks in a kind of hazy ambience that's always a little too clinical to ever be called ""warm."" Minimalist act SND, meanwhile, are masters of the palette borrowed by cuts like ""Bologna"" and ""Ovo"", the latter being this album's most abstract and challenging contender. Unfortunately, this liberal borrowing of well-regarded electronic templates poses a problem for the trio, as they erratically adopt a few too many styles, and rarely live up to their inspirations. Hotel Morgen may be beautifully produced, but despite its expert attention to detail, few of these tracks truly engage in the way they seem meant to. Although the adjective ""pleasant"" frequently springs to mind, To Rococo Rot are lagging creatively here, and as a result, the bulk of Hotel Morgen seems to soak in a kind of noncommittal sonic hibernation. Perhaps they could do with a few nights in a real hotel.","Well, I like the title. Hotels are places of transience, refuge and the very briefest of romantic encounters. As I ...

The record pulls no punches: Each track is stuffed with simple and catchy vocal and guitar melodies set against tight, no-frills rhythm sections and a Basement Jaxx-worthy sonic overload in between. And with one big exception, the disc is front-to-back footworthy, never losing a bit of the steam it works up to within its first minute out of the speakers. In fact, though it's probably to say too much or too little, U.S.E. could very well be 2004's Junior Senior: their debut delivers the immediate gratification that we came to associate with last year's D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat, and given the density of some of these songs, U.S.E. might eventually pack a little more replay value than their '03 predecessors. The songs are consistently solid here, but if we're to rally behind one song as a possible single, ""Emerald City"" seems the surest shot: Its glittery vocoded opening gives way to a steady rhythmic pump and spiraling, intertwined choral and guitar melodies. As the track progresses, U.S.E. wisely reconfigure their instrumentation, most notably keeping in check the guitar lines-- which could have been a mess of riffage and FX-aerobics-- without leaving them unrequited. Elsewhere, ""Climb the Walls"" features some dynamic synth and guitar lines working wonders in tandem amidst ambient party noise and bass thump, and the shouts, horns, and seering guitar riffs that serve as the prologue to ""Open Your Eyes"" are rivaled only by the further developed reincarnations as the song plays out. ""Vamos a la Playa"", meanwhile, appropriates what U.S.E. seems to think is a characteristically ""Latin"" shuffle, and with huge help from an 80s synthesizer line, anchors the album's last third quite well. U.S.E.'s only critical misfire is when they tread in the shark pit of ""Night Shift"", whose G. Love-style pleasure rapping should have been confined to another plane. Still, U.S.E. have put together a consistent collection of well-considered, boneheaded party anthems: Their album is just terribly fun-- nothing more, nothing less.","United State of Electronica are a party band, and on their self-titled debut, they pull out all the stops for ...

What's Wrong with Bill?,Ill Bill,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99d5e6ef959693229df/1:1/w_160/fe66230f.jpg,2004-05-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4154-whats-wrong-with-bill/,Uncle Howie,"The de facto leader of underground luminaries Non-Phixion, Ill Bill has steadily gained notoriety over the span of the last decade, and with this release, is the first of his crew to unleash a solo record. Produced entirely by shock rap magnate Necro, What's Wrong with Bill? is expectedly unflinching in its portrayal of the white ghetto experience with the feel of a dirty, limited run, behind-the-counter comic book. But does it really take to new ground or is it the same routine that the Uncle Howie label seems to be running ragged? Ill Bill seems to have two major precursors: Nas, and early Eminem, the latter of which is evident in his gruesome subject matter and aggressive, multi-syllabic lyrical style-- even his punchlines are macabre (""hotter than a crematorium""). Here, Ill Bill portrays a character that sees in monochrome, struggles in Technicolor, and speaks with blood scarlet letters, rapping about serial killers, drug dealing and illicit sexual encounters. Nas' influence, meanwhile, shows in Ill Bill's housing project observations-- though he goes a step further and commits as many of the crimes as he witnesses. Either way you cut it, Ill Bill raps like a Tarantino film: verbose and violent, with opinionated societal overtones. This is never more evident than on ""American History X"", where Bill spits vitriol over chimes, a jagged bass riff and a chopped soul vocal, detailing his disgust for the United States socio-political construct. Most of his dissension is pointed towards taking down the powers that be, but his choir-preaching here proves one of the most grounded moments on the album. Ill Bill raps like there's a bomb strapped to his chest, so his description of the American government hits hard when paired with his emphatic delivery: ""A Roman Empire in the present tense/ Murder for corporations that they represent/ Whether democrat or republicans, it's the same scumbag government/ With scumbag ways of running shit."" Considering the negative stigma that the music community holds for Necro as a sinister whoremonger, few will deny his ability as a producer. Distilling DJ Premier's processed drums, Pete Rock's seamless sample chops and the Automator's clean mixdowns, Necro amalgamates several pivotal elements in production to create a unique backdrop for Ill Bill to play across. Whether he's juxtaposing G-funk synth lasers with 70s bass grooves on ""Glenwood Projects"", crisscrossing suspended strings and shitkicking snares for ""The Final Scene"" or incorporating pedal-stomping guitar funk, hockey organ and barbershop choruses on ""Unstoppable"", Necro seems to have a delicate feel for the production that best suits his artist. Still, Ill Bill's got a few issue to overcome: His heavy dependence on adlibs, for one, tends to turn every verse into its own chorus. His songs also tend to settle for only two verses, which limits the album's length and conceptual development, and his disproportionate number of guest emcees can prove troublesome, depending on your taste (Goretex admittedly steals a song with ""Elvis is dead, but Tupac is living in Queens""). Additionally (and ironically), it seems Ill Bill's most creative song concepts fare the worst: ""Alien Workshop"" is a painfully rehashed X-Files rerun and ""The Anatomy of a School Shooting"" fails not due to its expected tastelessness, but in the way it refuses to expound on its tired subject matter. That said, the production on What's Wrong with Bill? manages a surprising consistently across the span of the album, Bill's performances are always raw and tightly spun, and overall, his combination of intelligent gangster and masochistic serial killer is more effective here than ever before. Ill Bill closes a song, stating, ""Fuck who's on top, 'cause I'm a lot hungrier than them."" I'm inclined to agree.","The de facto leader of underground luminaries Non-Phixion, Ill Bill has steadily gained notoriety over the span of the last ...

Blue Cotton Skin,Petracovich,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a172b1335d7bf169826d/1:1/w_160/14f4b7a7.jpg,2004-05-10 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6537-blue-cotton-skin/,Red Buttons,"Lazy music critics-- the kind routinely given the brush-off by this shamelessly overachieving publication-- often rely on half-realized juxtapositions and convoluted, name-dropping analogies that circumvent the brainwork required to actually say anything useful. But sometimes, comparisons are so bull's-eye-accurate they can't be avoided. So I apologize in advance, Ryan; the rest of you go ahead, call me lazy: Petracovich sounds like Aimee Mann fronting Sparklehorse with Beth Orton calling in plays from the sidelines. Of course, just because the dots are so easily connected doesn't mean Blue Cotton Skin is a simple piece of work. Petracovich mastermind Jessica Peters produces a hypnotic dreamtime soundtrack, all misty insinuations and shimmering mirages, a surprisingly enduring album of muffled bedroom folktronica wrapped in the silken sheen of Peters' subdued songbird voice. Blue Cotton Skin is one of those remarkable debuts that, even as it pulls at so many stylistic threads, capably establishes a unique, cohesive vision. There's an array of ingredients here that in less assured hands might unravel the consistently crystalline, dreamy mood, but Peters maintains the mystery. For instance, the Portishead dub noir of ""Nighttime"" and the Julee Cruise minimalism of ""Fall from Trees"" are the dark yin to the sunny yang of ""Birds in Flight"", with its anthemic guitar, handclaps, sweeping strings, and sugary girl-pop background vocals. The album's two instrumentals are mildly dissonant, experimental pieces: ""Coyote on the Moon"" rides an underwater calliope hum, while ""Rosebud"" plays with reversed reverb. Meanwhile, the stunning, sun-drenched ""Driving Home"" showcases Peters' sharp songwriting skills, its slow-unfolding and sensual, druggy buzz evoking a female take on ""Summertime Rolls"". Here, Peters' cooing vocals, though understated and at times even whispery, are self-assured and strong, unleashing emotion through intonation rather than volume. Like the low-key lullabies of Iron & Wine, Blue Cotton Skin might first settle into deceivingly shallow territory, but close listening reveals rich production details and unusual song structures. ""Footsteps"", a patient, fuzzy revelation, offers a musical storyline that develops over a repeated piano melody, a programmed drum track, and droning guitar, closer to Michael Brook than Sam Beam. Consisting of only thumb piano, kettledrums and Peters' phase-shifted vocals, ""Water House"" spooks like Tom Waits, while ""Company"" astral-travels with spacy effects and somber piano. Peters and co-producer Tad Wagner, who also adds electric guitar and bass, introduce subtle electronic nuances and studio tweaks that give these songs a deep, alluring luster. Clearly, Peters has a broad creative reach, exemplified by the album's overall haunting, stark beauty. But the fact that Petracovich only delivers 30 minutes of music is unsettling in the end-- it seems odd that the record's so short and its ending so sudden. Like a dream, Blue Cotton Skin entices the listener to a hidden island floating in the ether, but doesn't last long enough to allow him to dwell there.","Lazy music critics-- the kind routinely given the brush-off by this shamelessly overachieving publication-- often rely on half-realized juxtapositions and ...

"Derbe Respect, Alder",FaustDälek,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6aabf31b7dc7155f44/1:1/w_160/460fafba.gif,2004-05-10 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3019-derbe-respect-alder/,Staubgold,"True experimentalists never die, they just alienate all their friends by refusing to settle into a comfortable rut. German legends Faust, represented on this collaboration with New Jersey hip-hop mavericks Dälek as Werner ""Zappi"" Diermaier, Hans Joachim Irmler, Steven W. Lobdel, Lars Paukstaff and Michael Stoll, have fashioned a pretty unbelievable catalog of tunes from a stubborn insistence on constant movement. Granted, they haven't always moved at the same breathless pace they did in the early 70s, but like their krautrocking peers in Can, Faust have proved to be among the most reliably forward-thinking musicians of their generation. Small surprise, then, to hear their glorious, droned-out take on hip-hop with Dälek. Derbe Respect, Alder (or ""crude respect, elder"") hardly sounds like any hip-hop I've heard; more like a druggy, clamorous collage of industrial noise and feedback, with a stray loop every now and then. Rather than simply using Faust as their backing band, the trio of Dälek (Will Brooks), producer Oktopus (Alap Momin) and turntablist Still (Hsi-Chang Lin) attack fragments and panic-ridden, acid-damaged jams as raw source material, and opt to spout Last Poets-style free form verse over the more unhinged moments. And like The Last Poets, Dälek's agenda seems politically charged, as titles like ""Bullets Need Violence"" indicate. Still, pure sound rules this collaboration, and they produce an intimidating, blunt jab indeed. Most of the music on Derbe Respect, Alder was recorded in 2002 and 2003 by Faust, then manipulated by Dälek-- though the final (listed) track ""T-Electronique"" was taken from Faust's 1999 album Ravvivando. I had first heard the track on the last Wire Tapper compilation, and it is, by some measure, the most straightforward piece on the album. Its bass-heavy, loping drum loop flails like cold, machine-generated funk, but the heavenly organ clusters overhead are pristine and sweet, and could only have come from Germany. Brooks references ""filthy tongues slowly severed"" and ""the constant threat that we easily forget,"" and aligns himself perfectly with the claustrophobic paranoia of the track. This version of ""T-Electronique"" should be a godsend to anyone into hypnotic drone-funk. ""Imagine What We Started"" begins the album with cold wind and deep, unidentifiable bass tones, like stepping into an endless underground tunnel and realizing all the fleeting noises behind and above aren't just products of your ketamine buzz. When the drums hit, all hell breaks loose: Oktopus and Still drench the loop with delay so that Diermaier's drums sound like the work of three men hammering out polyrhythms best suited for inducing motion sickness and hearing loss, yet it's fascinating in its disorientating force (which is one way to describe my feeling for the album in general). ""Hungry for Now"" introduces Brooks' voice for the first time on the album, warning, ""If I have not met your expectations, try to conceive my frustrations with an earthly tongue,"" over ever-offcenter drum/bass vamping from Diermaier and Stoll, while Lobdell's guitar stains all available space with guitar drone and feedback approaching white noise. See also the second half of ""Dead Lies"" and grotesque motorik of ""Collected Twighlight"" for more apocalyptic dream-shriek. Derbe Respect, Alder is a tough record to size up: On one hand, its middle third can get so dense, so unrelentingly bleak that it takes a particularly receptive thrillseeker to make it through unscathed; on the other, its best moments (for example, the first and last tracks, not counting the brief hidden track) are some of the best music I've heard this year, and their payoffs are reason enough to let the undertow swallow you whole. Regardless, Faust and Dälek demonstrate the capabilities of potent, creative minds and insistent forging ahead of born experimentalists. If that means a few people are left behind, all the better to take in the hardcore bliss on your own.",,7.6,
Forget Tomorrow,Macha,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3585e6ef959693237f8/1:1/w_160/84739780.jpg,2004-05-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5019-forget-tomorrow/,Jetset,"It's been a while since we last heard from Macha, and with all the scenes that have risen and fallen in the interim, it's easy to forget that they were once viewed as one of indie rock's greatest hopes for the future-- a future that, at the time of their second album, was still a calendar century away. The Athens, GA trio got off to a quick start, gracing 1998 and 1999 each with a forward-looking, genre-defying album. In 2000, they dropped a highly-acclaimed collaboration with now-defunct slowcore nap-rockers Bedhead and then seemingly evaporated, leaving us to figure out where to redirect our anticipation. So forgive me if I didn't figure they even existed anymore. Four years is a long pause, but brothers Joshua and Mischo McKay, and their former housemate Kai Reidl, have emerged on the other end of their layoff with an album that, while not quite justification for the wait, nonetheless brims with the same restless creativity that spiked their early records, updated just enough to incorporate the moping massive's newfound fascination with all things rhythmic and pulsing. Macha still retain the passion for Indonesian gamelan and arcane instrumentation that made their initial burst so distinctive, but it's relatively played down, relegated mostly to the corners in favor of Neo-Tokyo synths and a river of bass: Forget Tomorrow is a futurist's sonic Eden, a soundtrack to the arcades and clinics of William Gibson's Chiba City. The album's first half cruises through this territory with the top down, breathing its air fully, and scooping up most of the good ideas that lie there. The title track ought to be a single, with its deadpanned, vacuum-sealed melody, plasticine synth, flourishes of koto, and polished steel neo-Moroder groove. It's sleeker than a Mitsubishi TV spot, but the recording's workmanlike nature renders it real. ""(Do the) Inevitable"" adds the clanking Indonesian percussion that we've so come to expect on a Macha record, but the funky bassline and kick/hihat boom-chik are all Macha Mk II. That beat comes back to support the echoing buzz of ""Smash & Grab"", which smacks slightly of The Faint without nearly as much aggressive edge. A sprinkling of instrumentals provide the best link with the band's exotica kick, ""D-D-D"" clanging with gamelan, ""Paper Tiger"" awash with repetitive hammer dulcimer figures, and Silk Road melodies wafting on synthetic strings through the vibe-cluttered buzz of ""Sub II"". All of this makes Forget Tomorrow a welcome return for Macha, who seem just as ready to expand their sound as ever. A few ponderous interludes (especially ""While the People Sleep"", a go-nowhere ambient drag) hamper the record's momentum at inopportune times, which is a shame, given that, along with the joys of rhythm, the world has also recently rediscovered the benefits of the 40-minute runtime. Still, this album confirms that Macha truly are long for this world, and I'll take that any day.","It's been a while since we last heard from Macha, and with all the scenes that have risen and ...

Fela's complex history, unwavering politics, and indelible musical legacy have created the kind of iconic anchor necessary to hold down an increasingly flimsy global culture. Thank Universal for beginning the flood of reissues in 2000: now Fela's dark continental grind and scathing socialist message are reaching more Western listeners than ever before. The dense, syncopated rhythms and low-end swell of Afrobeat currently tints almost the entire urban dance music palette, from revivalists like Antibalas to Common's hip-hop highlife to Afro-dub rockers Tussle. Obviously, electronic music's extended instrumental breaks are especially suited to the Afrobeat makeover; witness Masters at Work's sweaty, traditionally propulsive ""MAW Expensive (A Tribute to Fela)"" or Bugz in the Attic's buzzing broken-beat remix of ""Zombie"" from 2002's Red Hot + Riot compilation. Ubiquity is perhaps a little late to the party, showing up with Bristol's Will Holland, under the moniker Quantic, doing his take on four-on-the-floor Afrobeat and breezy Braziltronica. I've come to expect consistently fresh sounds from Ubiquity, and Mishaps Happening delivers a fair dose of their usual smoothed-out California breaks/sunrise house cocktail. But when Holland dips his ladle into the Afrobeat bucket, he comes up lacking; watery production and hollow beats fall short of a potentially thunderous dance floor deluge. Maybe it's a state of mind thing, because with certain clues, a listener expects certain results. For instance, the shuffling rhythm, twangy guitar, and creaking sax that open the album have me anticipating an eventual knockout blow, which somehow never arrives. The polyrhythmic chatter, organ-driven swagger, and crisp vocals on ""Use What You Got"" seem to prelude some kind of heavy climax, but again, we're left wanting. If he were to steer clear of these Afrobeat signposts, Holland might have a much more effective album that perhaps relies on standard touchstones but actually delivers. That's what we get at the album's midsection, which stands out with some interesting arrangements and well-crafted songs. The funky ""Trees and Seas"" carries a blunted Thievery Corporation sparkle through another late night, while ""Angels and Albatrosses"", with its moody, distinctly downtempo sway, bobs along on waves of flute, marimba, and baritone, eventually leading to a satisfyingly serene resolution. ""Prelude to Happening"" combines a subtle, snaking bassline, rolling drums, somber strings, and eerie vocals into a sizzling midtempo reverie; Holland's production and songwriting skills shine through in this pretty, elegiac dirge. Holland's first two solo Quantic LPs received accolades from all the right tastemakers (Gilles Peterson, Richard Dorfmeister), and despite Mishaps' missteps, you can hear why. Philly soul vocalist Spanky Wilson gives a true school feel to ""Don't Joke with a Hungry Man"" and ""When You're Through"", while ""Perception"" delivers just the right amount forward-pushing velocity without veering into drum-n-bass histrionics. The closing tune, ""So Long"", is perhaps the stylistic bridge that Holland strives for throughout the album. I'm fairly certain that's banjo I'm hearing behind staccato strings, right after the dubbed-out breakdown and Alice Russell's silky crooning. It's a sharply distinctive number that starts with a traditional break and lives up to its promise seven hypnotic minutes later. There's no sign of Afrobeat pretense here-- except for perhaps in its ardent grasp at funky forms-- and the song works beautifully.","I've been waiting forever to write this sentence: Fela Kuti is everywhere these days.

Call It Sleep,The Places,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a099ea9e61561daa45d7/1:1/w_160/0832189c.jpg,2004-05-09 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6330-call-it-sleep/,Hush,"Last time around, The Places set their sights on comets and quasars. Singer/songwriter Amy Annelle tapped a who's who of Portland, Oregon to record The Autopilot Knows You Best, a minor masterpiece of indie pop where folky violin and accordions complemented the crazy-scientist sounds of shortwave static and lost voices. Melodic indie pop brushed against swaying acoustic ballads, and although her low, murmuring voice gave it a dreamy coherence, Autopilot was also an exciting patchwork: Each track made a new discovery. The follow-up, finished in 2002 but not released until this month, couldn't be more different. On Call It Sleep, exhaustion hangs from Annelle's voice like dust in her hair. Each ballad sounds weary to the bone, not from melancholy or a nameable heartache, but like built-up fatigue: Annelle has flopped on your couch after ten hours of crossing dry, identical landscapes, and you can't tell if she wants to talk about it. The album runs more slowly and evenly than Autopilot, as lazy guitars scraggle over the shuffling of drums and upright bass, but the focus lies with Annelle and the nuances in her vocals. She sings in a low voice whose undertones resonate like blowing on the neck of a beer bottle. Intimate and unforced, she comes close to vanishing before your eyes: Witness how ethereally she blends into the radio static on ""Program Ten"". And by singing quietly, she compels, especially when she pipes up or lets the notes swell and coast, as on ""Ruined New Life"". At its best, Call It Sleep has gorgeous melodies and a clear sense for atmosphere, never overplaying its fragility or stifling the mood. She refrains from big moments, except on the album's more propulsive finish, ""'Til the Death""-- but more typical are the sways from troubled to resolute, the shift from ""Travel Light""'s desolation to the steady outdoor cantina waltz of ""Clean Starts"". But it's also a less remarkable album than its predecessor, despite its own round of guest stars. Members of The Decemberists, The Swords Project, and Death Cab for Cutie, but nobody steals the spotlight: The extra instrumentation they provide is subtle, from the treading-on-glass vibes to the half-drowned piano on the achingly delicate ""Dead Reckoning"". Additionally, fans of Autopilot might miss the quirky variety and ""geek chic"" of its experimentation and science references; on her cover of The Dreamies' ""Program Ten"", Annelle takes some playtime with shortwaves and sampling, but it's not as ebullient as the last album's cover of Syd Barrett's ""Late Night"". The tone is heavy, and the decision to sequence the slowest songs (""What I Wouldn't Do for You"", ""Travel Light"") in succession almost stops the album. Where The Places' last LP served as a pop complement to Annelle's quieter solo outings, Call It Sleep doesn't spark new ideas so much as shore up her work as a singer and songwriter. Ultimately, Call It Sleep works as a transition album-- in her career, and also in the content of her lyrics. Even at its quietest, the record isn't sad so much as pensive: The ballads' reserve and the song titles like ""Clean Starts"", ""Travel Light"", or ""Ruined New Life"" evoke a sense of Annelle changing gears and deciding where to head next. She doesn't conjure as many possibilities as before, but she hones in on the choices that count.","Last time around, The Places set their sights on comets and quasars.

Killers and Stars,Patterson Hood,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c15a13d197565213bbb2/1:1/w_160/4d1206d0.jpg,2004-05-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3982-killers-and-stars/,New West,"Patterson Hood laid out his music-making motivation in ""Do It Yourself"", the accusatory suicide anthem from the Drive-By Truckers' most recent album, Decoration Day: When ""the dead-end life just drags you down/ [You] turn those demons into walls of goddamned noise and sound."" For more than a decade, Hood has been transforming all that preys on him into songs that are loud, rowdy, and angry, but also humorous, intelligent, and compassionate. His demons are both personal and regional: He's been scarred by the racial, cultural and economic double standards that pervade the South and outsiders' perceptions of it, as well as by the tragedies of his own life, which include divorce, deaths, desertions, and Drive-By Truckers. On Killers and Stars, his first solo album, these same demons inform songs that are quieter, but no less haunted or intense. Originally not intended for commercial release, the album was recorded Nebraska-style in Hood's living room and in various locations-- Auburn and Florence, Alabama; Athens, Georgia-- following his divorce, and then pressed in small runs and sold exclusively at shows. In the liner notes, Hood writes that the album was ""therapy"" and insists he left it purposefully unfinished. While these assertions may sound like expectations-lowering disclaimers-- that the sound and the songs will be rough, that the tone will be achingly confessional-- Hood is too extroverted a songwriter to be wholly defensive or self-absorbed. Alone or with the band, he comes to himself through other people, whether musical influences like Ronnie Van Zant, cultural figures like George Wallace, or just friends and family. As the album and song titles suggest, there's a crowd of people on Killers and Stars-- including Walt Disney, Belinda Carlisle, Georgia native Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power), Frances Farmer, even people you don't know, like Phil and Alice-- and these songs are more about them and how Hood sees them than they are about him solely. He foresees Walt rising from his deep-freeze and wrecking havoc on the Eisner-ized company for ""forty years of decisions made""; chastises Carlisle for shedding her punk roots for ""cocaine and milkshakes, milkshakes cocaine""; and gently criticizes Cat Power for her precarious stage persona, although he could be directing that last line at himself: ""If you're really so shy why are you standing in the light?"" The most interesting people on Killers and Stars, however, are the unnamed non-celebrities: the rising son, the assassin, the hobo, the old timer. Songs like ""Rising Son"" (a cover of which might have fit nicely into Johnny Cash's American Recordings repertoire), ""The Assassin"" and ""Hobo"" are not literally autobiographical or genealogical; they tell their truths figuratively, almost literarily. But as always, Hood's family supplies him with his richest subject matter. His then-recent divorce produced ""Miss Me Gone"", a break-up song every bit as conflicted and complex as Decoration Day's ""(Something's Got to) Give Pretty Soon"". ""Old Timer's Disease"" begins with Hood's grandfather being drafted at 42 and describes his hard life after World War II, then discloses his illness: ""He spends his days just looking around/ But he's forgotten what he's looking for."" Hood understands the importance of character and story, so the first two verses build to those quietly devastating last lines, which form the album's climax. That ""Cat Power"" instead of ""Old Timer's Disease"" ends Killers and Stars belies its unfinished state, and reveals a paradox almost endemic to projects like this: The songs can stand by themselves, never requiring the Truckers' larger sound to liven them up, but as spare as they are and given the circumstances of their recording, they're somewhat limited in their scope and sound. While its ultimate fate will likely be as a footnote to his full-time band's long haul, Killers and Stars is strong enough to stand as a separate entity, a personal statement from Hood, sovereign from the interlocked identities of the Drive-By Truckers.","Patterson Hood laid out his music-making motivation in ""Do It Yourself"", the accusatory suicide anthem from the Drive-By Truckers' most ...

One Thousand Bird Ceremony,The Skygreen Leopards,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66e5e6ef95969320d2e/1:1/w_160/a5988b80.jpg,2004-05-09 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7759-one-thousand-bird-ceremony/,Soft Abuse,"During one particularly magnanimous period recently, I lugged my tattered, half-burnt stereo to a rare books room every day for a couple weeks so a friend could listen to Kenneth Patchen read his poetry on hissy Folkways LPs. Though a total pain in the ass, the effort seemed in keeping with the rambling spirit of the wordsmith: Patchen published more than 36 books between 1936 and 1972, and his style, experiments and collaborations with jazz musicians inspired what folks eventually started pigeonholing as the Beat Generation. Also a painter, he often created luminous impressions of his poetical works on canvas. These ornate broadsides-- crammed with cursive lettering, brightly colored flowers, bird-torn wind and smiling bird people-- resembled fliers for psych-rock concerts held in the trees. The Skygreen Leopards took their bandname and the title of their third album from Patchen's writings. The liner notes of One Thousand Bird Ceremony offers a blessing to the artist, and judging from the feathered collages decorating the album, the band is nearly as fond of anthropomorphic fowl as he was. Formed in 2001, The Skygreen Leopards are Glenn Donaldson and Donovan Quinn. My vote for man of the year 2003, Donaldson founded the Jewelled Antler label/collective with Loren Chasse and plays in quite a few amazing groups including The Blithe Sons, Thuja, The Franciscan Hobbies, and The Birdtree. Quinn, another regular Jewelled Antler contributor, is the son of Country Weather bassist and vocalist Dave Carter and records as Verdure. This is the duo's third album, and their first widely distributed release after two limited-edition CD-R's. Like much of Glenn Donaldson's other work, One Thousand Bird Ceremony starts off with ambient forestal noises, chirps, the acoustic peregrinations of other animals, and properly spare bells. While certainly making use of Jewelled Antler tenants such as recording without predetermined lyrics or chord changes, instead of droning psychedelia, The Skygreen Leopards create blissful pop songs interwoven with ambient hiss and naturally occurring sounds. At times comparable to The Birdtree, the work's even tighter here, bringing to mind tiny nuggets of Syd Barrett and the Incredible String Band. Or a pack of silvan spirits on a Beatles kick. Unlike the usual one-track Jewelled Antler outing, One Thousand Bird Ceremony was recorded on an on 1/4"" tape to an 8-track; accordingly, the works house additional layers of 12-string guitars, banjo, bouzouki, jaw harp, mandolin, dulcimer, organ, and echoplex. It's like listening to a muted late-period Lilys (or Kinks) recording in the bird house at the local zoo. Yes, rural folk for the hook-obsessed pop fan. In an album full of highlights and very few lows, the best moments are incredibly beautiful. ""Where Do Songs Come From"" answers its stated question with the lilting sound of a breathless penny whistle disappearing below a horizon. Turning jaw harp into a lovely percussive accompaniment, ""Let Me Grow in Your Meadow"" rings with Monkees lamentations and pastoral crab-grass drifts. Equally idyllic, ""Walk with the Golden Cross"" hits echoing falsettos that rise and fall above a field of tinny percussion, downcast arpeggios and tambourine. The lengthiest track, ""A Breeze of Pine Blows Through Me"", follows a sleepy firefly in a race amid the browning needles of a sapless tree. The final track, ""Summer Pharmacy"" (linked thematically to the opener, ""Summer Alchemy"") points towards Donaldson and Quinn's ability to find the benefits of song in the most unlikely places, including the shifts between seasons, within blades of grass, in the honeyed clouds, on the dark side of a leaf changing color, beneath an icy rock. As the concept of ""New Weird America"" broadens to encompass more than it likely should, The Skygreen Leopards drift languidly in and out of song, quiet locating the best sun spots in a way that seems both tossed off and perfectly formed. Actually, Patchen's ""Pastoral"" describes it dead-on: ""The Dove walks with sticky feet/ Upon the green crowns of the almond tree/ Its feathers smeared over with warmth/ Like honey/ That dips lazily down into the shadow..."" Now translate that into joyful song.","During one particularly magnanimous period recently, I lugged my tattered, half-burnt stereo to a rare books room every day for ...

Penance Soiree,Icarus Line,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99c9d034d5c69bf5274/1:1/w_160/6b624798.jpg,2004-05-09 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4153-penance-soiree/,V2,"If rock 'n' roll had nothing to do with music and everything to do with attitude, the Icarus Line would be the greatest fucking band. Oh wait, rock 'n' roll does have everything to with attitude, and the Icarus Line are the greatest fucking band. Sure, there are thousands of bands who are wittier, louder, more sophisticated, and in general, more musically rewarding. But if you want obstinance, irreverence and depravity, I dare you to find a band that offers it in such gratuity. Too late: You see, after six years of infamous live shows and a scant yield of exactly one EP and one full-length, the Icarus Line have finally gotten serious, which means the derisive West Coast braggarts have sacrificed their reputation. This, of course, means they're no longer the greatest fucking band. They're better. Call it a fair trade off: By simply playing by the rock 'n' roll rulebook-- whose article 17, section 4 strictly dictates that ego, excess and publicity stunts are to take complete precedence over, you know, songs-- Penance Soiree is one of the better straight-up records you're bound to hear from the genre all year. Known for their manic behavior onstage and scuzzy surfeit off, the Icarus Line could win over scores of fans without even playing a note. But who cares that the band wear moddish black-and-red uniforms when they sound red and black? Unlike most groups who arch back to rock 'n roll's premillennial salad days, the Icarus Line are visceral enough in their music alone, and Penance Soiree proves it before even the chorus of its opening track. Of course, this isn't anything you haven't heard before. All the requisite pieces are in place: scalding guitars, amply flanged vocals, bombastic drums, and a bassline that sounds like nothing so much as running sewage. But while a track like ""Up Against the Wall"" may not be aching to raze any monuments, it forcefully achieves all that it sets out to accomplish: Dubiously recorded to be difficult to hear unless played at a high volume, the song leaves the listener itching for a bath. In fact, one would be wise to come prepared for this record with plenty of sweat rags and water bottles: Like a good workout, Penance Soiree pushes you until you're red-cheeked, wet-faced and utterly exhausted. Hearteningly, the album loses hardly a step in its finery. Joe Cardamone's vocals are properly wanton throughout this rabble-rousing tour de force, and while it's all too easy for lyrics about sex to succumb to sleaze, on ""Party the Baby Off"", it's all too tempting to oblige Cardamone's cries of ""Take off all your clothes!"" Carnal and prurient throughout, Penance Soiree is absorbing in its decadence and rarely alienating in its ferocity. Technically, the music is necessarily indestructible; sloppy performances would allow these reckless tunes to spiral out of control, but the compositions are unerringly tight, nailing unison figures and hopping meter with insane dexterity. But alas, the well of ideas from which the Icarus Line draw is limited, and while all their efforts are deftly executed, a handful of the tracks fall flat. While most records of its kind are precariously frontloaded, Penance Soiree lags only in its third quarter. Earlier on, the album's repetitive helps impede the galvanizing (if static) riffs, but later, the songs move from a torrid gallop to a haggard chug, as Cardamone's libidinous wails peter out into a bluesy drawl. ""Big Sleep""'s title is particularly apt: The song is full of razoring kicks, but pitifully low on hooks. Elsewhere, ""White Devil"" and ""Meatmaker"" are mercifully fast-paced, but nevertheless somewhat cloying melodically. Thankfully, the two closing tracks redeem the missteps of the preceding numbers. ""Seasick"" provides Penance Soiree's most interesting textural moment in its icy two minute decline, an arrhythmic descent into a howling ocean of feedback. And then, just as the album has seemingly crashed from its meteoric highs, the band sign off with ""Party the Baby Off"", a bouncy rocker that may well inaugurate its own British-style Invasion from the snowy peaks of Sierra Nevada. They may not be the wittiest or most erudite band around, but the Icarus Line pummel with an intentness and honesty that trumps the best of their contemporaries.","If rock 'n' roll had nothing to do with music and everything to do with attitude, the Icarus Line would ...

Taste Like Daughter,S PRCSS,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66db1335d7bf1698e1a/1:1/w_160/547b9eec.gif,2004-05-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7758-taste-like-daughter/,My Pal God,"On their 2001 debut More Me, and last year's Frenchkiss-released follow-up MNML, S PRCSS operated as trio of musical penpals: The guitarist sent a track to the bassist, who in turn added his own line before shipping it off to the vocalist. They would trade these tapes back and forth via post, until deciding as a group that their collection of overdubbed tracks had become a song, and finally an album, and would then present the material as a complete full-length. If this is no longer the case, and S PRCSS have become a full-fledged, in-the-flesh studio band, their latest outing, Taste Like Daughter, still both benefits and suffers from a certain internal distance. In fact, if anything, the double-edged nature of the band's schtick is more pronounced than ever: S PRCSS seem to embrace this distance and capitalize on it, whereas previous recordings offered the sense that at times the band was attempting to mask its compositional wiring. Here, the writing recalls less rock riffs than rockish dance loops, the mere risk of which makes S PRCSS worth talking about in the first place. Every song immediately showcases the fantastic depth and openness of the production. Take ""Look: Explosion! New Spring"", which opens with a set of autonomous guitar and basslines which form airy chords as if accidentally. Yet, while momentous, the song somewhat stagnates by its second minute, perhaps because the gild of coincidental parts loses its initial luster, and, in light of the honest production, a paucity of ideas becomes apparent. In this respect, the longer but infinitely more developed ""Your Motivation Is: Less Like This"" fares better, capitalizing on heavy reverb, healthy vocal melodies, and prominent basslines, and continues to traverse new ground six minutes in. Drums play a more dominant role in other parts of the album, adding just enough punch to songs like ""The Sun Provides Vitamin D"" to temporarily compensate for the familiar 16th-note MNML pulses that seem all too convenient for the band to synch their individual parts to. This guise, unfortunately, fails to conceal the song's uninteresting modulations and good but eventually tired hooks. S PRCSS as a project is incredibly tight, but perhaps sterile as a consequence. ""I'm a Motorcycle Drummer"", for its killer syncopation and haunting female vocals, should be more effective than it is. To a lesser extent, the same goes for ""I Call I Gorilla (Mountain Lifter)"", a two-minute power rocker with some seriously great vocal work-- for all its excitement, the end of the song seems contained and non-threatening. It's an unorthodox thing to say, but I wanted to hear more mistakes on Taste Like Daughter. It's simply too precise, and as a result, lacks the immediacy and spontaneity expected from its genre. As a closer, ""Give the Beaches to the People"" is a good summation of what S PRCSS has accomplished so far, and what lies in store for them if they choose to continue in this direction. Stuffed with hooks and catchy vocals, the song retreads typically energized territory, but then launches into the album's first bonafide riff: all instrumentation drops out to a bassline that's eager to rise to this solo occasion. It's flat-out sick, and in the last 30 seconds of the song, the drums and guitars just chase the line to no avail. It's the album's most blatant battle wound, an unexpected break from precise S PRCSS stratego, but the payoff is huge. The band could stand to indulge in more of these sanguine moments.","On their 2001 debut More Me, and last year's Frenchkiss-released follow-up MNML, S PRCSS operated as trio of musical ...

DJ Kicks,Erlend Øye,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12f13d1975652138583/1:1/w_160/9af053d5.jpg,2004-05-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6079-dj-kicks/,!K7,"Dance music is pretty gay. Let's not beat around bush, my stalwart indie-rocking comrades: In our world, lyrics can be heartfelt, songs can be ironic, albums can be post-grammatological, and occasionally, guitars can be acoustic. But unless there's some punk behind that disco, we aren't likely to indulge in dance music too often-- let alone dance to it. Because unlike indie rock, dance music's all the same, it's gay, and if it's in Massachusetts, its equal marriage rights are probably going to be denied. Wait a second: Is it 1998 again? Because I remember more than a few of us thought the same thing about IDM, until we were all persuaded to pick up Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children. It was electronica and it was taboo, but we purchased in good faith because it was on Matador, a label we trusted. Boy, did we love the shit out of it-- and there weren't even guitars! Erlend Øye's DJ Kicks seems like that kind of gateway record. Its most instantly alluring trait is its surprising pop/rock-accessibility, but-- for a guy most people know for his tenure in the hushed folk duo Kings of Convenience-- it's also remarkably innovative in its field. Here, in a move that really is not as gimmicky as it might seem, Øye frequently dubs his own buoyant tenor over bright dancefloor instrumentals and vocal tracks. Interestingly, these lyrics are often culled from well-known pop classics (such as The Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out""), with slight melodic changes. It's a fascinating, vaguely mash-up-like approach that effectively softens the blow for non-tech-house listeners, while also assuring each track a strong hook and lending the record a quality often underdeveloped in other DJ mixes: namely, a discernible personality. Enough can't be said about the quality and variety of these tracks, and the unique sense of humor with which Øye approaches their sequencing. Take how subtly Øye gives new life to Jürgen Paape's ""So Weit Wie Noch Wie"", an instant tech-house gem that notably appeared on Kompakt's Total 3 compilation: If only because the song is so often associated with the close of that mix, it takes on an unusual potency as Øye's kickoff. The Paape opener is firm anchorage for the string of slick German dance tracks which Øye weaves in and out of the other numbers: Justus Köhncke's slick 1980s-meets-2100s groove ""2 After 909""; Jackmate's phaseshifted jitterbug ""Airraid""; Ricardo Villalobos' blipped-up but downtrodden ""Dexter"". Øye's slick tech-house base allows him some indulgences: There are the truly laidback moments like his tasteful remix of Cornelius' ""Drop"", Phoenix's less dance-oriented but utterly catchy French house gem ""If I Ever Feel Better"", and downright silly tracks like Avenue D's ""2D2F"". It's amazing the latter track works as well as it does: its lyrics (""Don't pass out going down on me/ Or I'll wake you up with a mouth full of pee"" is but one) put the entire Peaches and Fannypack catalogs to shame. For these moments alone, the mix is perfectly enjoyable, but where Øye distinguishes himself is on two back-to-back tracks near the end of DJ Kicks, in which he explosively pits the familiar against the obscure. Over a dark monochromatic Silicon Soul remix of Röyksopp's ""Poor Leno"", Øye overdubs his soft but confident croon of The Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", which reaches a quiet climax when Øye's vocals from ""Poor Leno"" surface momentarily in the background, then disappear. Just as compelling is when the ultra-obscure track Skateboard's ""Metal Chix"" provides a velvet-metal backdrop for Øye's heartfelt delivery of ""Always on My Mind"", synching up the chorus with the accompaniment's dreamy interlude. We could stand more mash-ups like this and much less Jay-Zeezer. Those two songs seem to encapsulate Øye's intentions with his DJ Kicks album. In the liner notes, he places his DJ style somewhere between a house DJ who plays to drugs, dancing shoes, and ""the artistic dimension"", and a wedding DJ who plays strictly to vaguely foot-worthy nostalgia. ""I am not really a skilled beat-mixer,"" says Øye-- which is only sort of true-- but it's clear that he's as concerned with his track selection as with making sure that his listeners are enjoying themselves: ""A good DJ is not only musically responsible, but he is also the host of the party."" With DJ Kicks bearing testament, Øye's party is truly a democratic one: The record is as warm and welcoming for first-timers as for longtime tech-house addicts. ","Dance music is pretty gay.

Chickasaw County Child: The Artistry of Bobbie Gentry,Bobbie Gentry,by: Stephen M.

Factory,"Bobbie Gentry's ""Ode to Billie Joe"" was the Twin Peaks of its time. Just as viewers in 1990 asked who killed Laura Palmer, listeners in 1967 debated what the narrator and Billie Joe McAllister dropped off the Tallahatchie Bridge. Was it a stillborn baby? A murder weapon? Drug paraphernalia? Was it her doll, as the 1976 movie version claimed? Or was it, as writer Ron Carlson theorized in The Oxford American, our collective loss of innocence as the Vietnam War raged and a counterculture surged? Originally intended as a B-side to ""Mississippi Delta"", ""Ode to Billie Joe"" was an unlikely hit: With a decidedly Southern Gothic atmosphere, the song unfolds mostly at a dinner table, builds a mystery around the narrator's unspecified relationship with Billie Joe, and touches on suicide, home cooking, and the plight of rural farmers, as Gentry's guitar and Jimmie Haskell's strings swirl around the words like eddies in swampy southern creeks. ""Ode to Billy Joe"" wasn't Gentry's only hit-- just the one that's still popular today, canonized by K-Tel and various cover versions both blatantly ironic and boringly sincere. Shout! Factory's new collection, Chickasaw County Child: The Artistry of Bobbie Gentry, seeks to erase that one-hit-wonder stigma by emphasizing her dusky and dramatic voice, confident interpretation, and geographically and culturally specific songwriting, all of which combined to create a unique Deep South style. By portraying her as a true artist and a legitimate contemporary of Dusty Springfield, Jessi Coulter, and even FraxE7oise Hardy, this collection intends to introduce Gentry to a new generation of listeners more familiar with the Black Lodge than Choctaw Ridge. As a testament to her woodwind coo, Chickasaw County Child succeeds effortlessly: Deep and expressive, down-home yet sophisticated, Gentry's voice transcends the country label, which she earned in the late 60s, by incorporating a range of styles to put her songs across, from blues and folk to pop and rock and even a little mariachi on ""Beverly"". However, as a collection of songs meant to showcase that voice, this collection proves more complicated and not quite revelatory. Often, her vocal performance so far surpasses the material that the effect is unintentionally comical, like watching a great actor spout wooden lines. Sometimes her songwriting veers too close to precious (""Bugs"") or Vegas smooth (""Marigolds and Tangerines"") or just plain weird (""Refractions""), and in retrospect, many of the songs here sound dated, their production too gimmicky and, by now, kitschy. In other words, too many of the songs on Chickasaw County Child sound more like artifacts of the 70s than timeless art. Discounting Gentry as outdated, however, is dangerous: Credited with all but two of the nearly two dozen tracks on Chickasaw County Child, she proves herself a smart, intuitive songwriter with a distinctive voice that incorporated childhood reminiscence to conceal rather than convey her autobiography. There's a lot more of her life in these songs than the lyrics suggest-- and the lyrics suggest plenty. Obviously, ""Mississippi Delta"" and ""Papa, Won't You Let Me Go to Town With You?"" draw from her childhood spent on her grandparents' rural farm, a nostalgia that lent her a marketable wholesomeness (despite the implied indiscretions of ""Ode to Billie Joe""). As her celebrity grew with her early success, Gentry eventually turned her attention from Southern youth to a less geographically centered adulthood. Consequently, her songs became less overtly autobiographical, although she still plays the lead. She may not be the title character of ""Fancy"", a poor girl who has no qualms about how she earned that ""Georgia mansion and an elegant New York flat,"" but she certainly identifies with her tough-mindedness. Following her contribution to the 1974 movie Macon County Line, Gentry retired completely and (so far) permanently from performing, refusing to give concerts or interviews and declining offers to record or collaborate. On the amazing ""Lookin' In"", the penultimate track on Chickasaw County Child, she describes her hectic routine: ""Laying in my hotel room wantin' to be alone/ Needin' the time to rest my mind/ But they bring in another stack of papers to sign/ And L.A.'s a-waitin' on the other line."" The song contains all the information we need to understand her self-imposed exile, but just like ""Ode to Billie Joe"", the answers it gives only draw more questions. Gentry promises confession in these songs, but she remains unknowable and irresolvable. As Chickasaw County Child makes clear, her true artistry lies not in what she revealed through words and music, but what she kept hidden-- and what her songs continue to guard so closely today.","Bobbie Gentry's ""Ode to Billie Joe"" was the Twin Peaks of its time.

Disconnection Imminent,Decahedron,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb7713d197565213b0c7/1:1/w_160/ba88089e.jpg,2004-05-06 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2555-disconnection-imminent/,Lovitt,"I think I might be missing something. According to my dictionary, a decahedron is a ten-faceted, 3D object. Meanwhile, Decahedron, the new trio featuring Fugazi's Joe Lally and ex-Frodus members Shelby Cinca and Jason Hamacher, have plastered a big two-dimensional octagon all over their artwork of their debut album, presumably taking it as their logo. Don't get me wrong; it's a fine image. But shouldn't it at least be ten-sided? I'm just saying is all. As tenuous as the band's relationship with mathematics may seem from a glance at the cover, though, they don't seem to have any problem with complex meters or nasty syncopation when they're throwing down in the studio. Hamacher and Cinca recorded and produced Disconnection Imminent themselves, giving it a sharp-edged yet accessible polish that accentuates the band's brutal precision. Cinca tends to deliver his lyrics with ragged shouts, but also exhibits impressive control over his screams, which at times manage to border on melodic; Lally's smooth, even tenor, meanwhile, offers a balance that's highly effective in driving home the political rage that seethes within the band's lyrics. Though Decahedron take pains not to tailor their criticisms too specifically to the moment at hand, Disconnection Imminent puts its agenda upfront more forcefully than any album I've heard since Bush, Jr. took office. As a general rule, their criticisms of current Administration policy are open to interpretation, but anyone who's close to being on the same page with these guys will know who and what is being referred to by lines like, ""A half-wit was his henchman/ Whose limbs thought for themselves/ Building casket after casket/ Lining warehouse shelves."" The raging ""Not These Homes"" takes specific issue with the conflation of the Iraq invasion and the euphemistic War on Terror with this choice bit: ""The sky shivers/ Not this time/ Not these homes/ A hundred buildings fall for two that once stood tall."" It's not exactly the kind of thing that'll have them all over the Clear Channel affiliates, but one supposes they'd rather have it that way, given that they attack Clear Channel by name in impressive opener ""Delete False Culture"", Cinca exhorting his audience to ""delete Clear Channel"" in nearly with a paint-peeling scream in the song's frenzied coda. The song is a heap of snapping guitar riffs, crunching bass and whiplash rhythms that actually plays host to low-key two-part harmonies in its opening verse, gradually building to Cinca's manic outbursts. ""No Carrier"" follows with breakneck punk fury, the wiry guitars bordering on psychedelia and strange glitch-plagued backing vocals tumbling through the final verses. Decahedron are also the rare post-hardcore band that's just as compelling at slow tempos as they are more pulse-quickening paces, and a handful of excellent slow songs here help to diversify the mix. The instrumental ""Dislocation"" flows through passages of liquid guitar, while ""Every City Is a Prison""'s creeping harmonies and hornet clouds of guitar flow like oil slicks from bombed pipelines. ""Pay No Mind"" layers Lally over tribal toms as Cinca's guitar stalks the background, framing lines like, ""Take these for anxiety/ Keeps the eyes content with the floor,"" with dread. Disconnection Imminent is a stunning debut, with a bit of filler as its only real fault. Anyone intrigued by the names involved is apt to be pleased with the record, and fans still aching over Frodus' demise will certainly find consolation here.

Heroes to Zeros,The Beta Band,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2885e6ef95969320430/1:1/w_160/c430f92a.jpg,2004-05-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/671-heroes-to-zeros/,Astralwerks,"It's been said that any truly great song can remain just as recognizable and distinctive when broken down to its most basic structure and played on a solo instrument. If this is to be taken as an accurate gauge of musical value, then the Beta Band might be the worst fucking band in history. On their debut, The Three EPs, the Scottish foursome turned the periphery of songwriting into the main attraction, applying multilayered production and serpentine song structures to chords and melodies that repeated to the point of self-nullification. The group's second, self-titled album took this approach even further, as what seemed at first like petty musical asides were developed into the record's most striking and fully realized moments. These records' effects were world-class icing on cardboard cupcakes, using the traditional foundations of strong songwriting as a placeholder before smothering them in sweetness. A steady diet of icing, however, can only last so long. The Beta Band's last record, 2001's Hot Shots II, showed the band grappling with a lack of ideas for the first time. The songs themselves were every bit as drony and repetitive as those on the first two records, but lacked the fascinating production tricks and odd instrumentation of their best work. Indeed, the un-structure that made the first two Beta Band records so captivating seemed to have evolved into a structure of its own. On their fourth album, Heroes to Zeros, that structure is further solidified, to decidedly mixed results. ""Assessment"", the album's first single, toys with the kind of playful dynamics that made The Three EPs such a dense listen. In true Beta Band fashion, the heart and soul of ""Assessment"" is little more than the interplay between two similar guitar parts, and one fantastic drum fill. A few minutes into the song, a simple bassline rises to prominence before quickly and elegantly segueing back into a chorus. It's a nice diversion, but one can't shake the feeling that The Beta Band of yore could have turned it into an epic. The more disjointed final section of ""Assessment"" is similarly frustrating-- several great ideas are explored, but the band moves between them with an abandon uncharacteristic to even their most slapdash work. Still, ""Assessment"" remains one of the best tracks on Heroes to Zeros. On ""Lion Thief"", frontman Stephen Mason's recurring deadpan, ""The fruits are the loops are the friendships that droop,"" approaches self-parody, rendering painfully clear the more formulaic aspects of the band's sound. And sadly, the attempts at departure don't fare much better. ""Easy"", with its embarrassing Stevie Wonder keyboards, could be the low point of all of The Beta Band's catalog. The tepid ""Wonderful"" is particularly unfortunate for its thematic similarities to The Three EPs' awe-inspiring ""She's the One"", host to one of the most forceful and moving crescendos I've ever heard. The Beta Band's best moments often came when they worked in extremes-- minimal sampled beats followed by insane, multitracked chipmunk vocals and massive, reverb-soaked drum fills. Here, as with Hot Shots, the band attempts to split the difference, and in doing so, sacrifices the momentum that made their first two albums so thrilling. Thankfully, Heroes to Zeros picks up with ""Out-Side"", by far the album's standout. Opening with overbearing beats and an unusual barking dog sample, the song soon breaks into reverb-laden vocals and rough electric guitar. Later, screeching synthesizers penetrate the mix, signaling yet another substantial textural change. But then, the song is awkwardly followed by ""Space Beatle"", whose chorus of, ""I love you to pieces,"" registers as a watered-down rehash of ""Out-Side""'s subtle and charming ""I love you"" chorus. Indeed, Heroes to Zeros is host to an unusually large number of deja vu's. Most of these moments simply evoke Heroes to Zeros' increasing reliance upon form and formula-- but not all of them. At about three minutes through ""Out-Side"", I found myself checking my stereo to see if what I was hearing was still part of the same song, and it immediately brought to mind the experience of listening to The Three EPs for the first time. For just a little while, The Beta Band once again sounded like a band that could turn three notes into a symphony.","It's been said that any truly great song can remain just as recognizable and distinctive when broken down to ...

Shanghai My Heart,Surferosa,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66b5e6ef95969320d23/1:1/w_160/cd4b9ccd.jpg,2004-05-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7756-shanghai-my-heart/,Versity,"Irony is a fickle mistress. There was a time when an author couldn't get a book published in this country without a heady dose of the stuff. Now there's a million-dollar market for literalist (but no less bodacious) claptrap about adultery or impending nuclear holocaust, for those who aren't up to Madame Bovary or A Childhood's End. Music, meanwhile, has performed an inverse about-face: Where Mötley Crüe, and their fans, once proudly patronized strip clubs, folks who dig The Darkness constitute a putatively ""enlightened"" set. Similarly, there may be some ulterior motives behind Surferosa's Day-Glo merriment. Frankly, I no longer care. This irony shit has gone too far. When it all boils down, the songs are what matter, and by that standard, the Norwegian quintet are as indistinguishable from novelty as artists like Andrew W.K. and Electric Six. Naturally, Mariann, the group's luminous lead singer, has already attained celebrity status in her homeland, and was reportedly the subject of a feature-length documentary on one of Norway's highest-rated television channels. Her presence here is that of Debbie Harry in Blondie, or, more aptly for her comparable suck quotient, Gwen Stefani in No Doubt: It could be anyone playing behind her. For better or worse, she dominates. Shanghai My Heart's 11 songs all carry the same saccharine vibe, bouncing from verse to chorus to verse on bubbles of blithe synth and hackneyed riffs-- and Mariann's brazen ubiquity is hardly captivating or original enough to sustain the gimmickry. Unfortunately, Surferosa are unrelentingly catchy. After a listen or two, you'll likely find many of the songs on Shanghai My Heart entrenched in your brain like terrorists in an Afghan cave, and it may take some serious sonic artillery to smoke 'em out. But no lame simile could fully convey the unadulterated poppiness of this album; that task is best left to the omnipresent forebears of Surferosa's rah-rah retro rock. Despite ""Lucky Lipstick"", which opens the record on a promising note, Shanghai My Heart suffers from a dearth of original ideas, and fails to resurrect those it parses in a noteworthy manner. Adding to the list of bands that have rehashed kitschy musical trends in wildly exaggerated form, Surferosa take aim at Debbie Harry and Kim Wilde with the same outrageousness with which The Darkness and Electric Six took to schlock rock, and the result is equally vacuous. ""Canuba Toystore"" is replete with quixotic guitar-synth interplay that might have helped get Rocky pumped for his showdown with Ivan Drago. Meanwhile, over the track's power-chord-laden intro, a petulant Mariann shouts, ""This is a song about... toys!"", in what could perhaps be an awful twist on the Pixies' ""Tony's Theme"" off the album from which this band takes its name. Elsewhere, ""Neon Commando"" and ""Olympia"" dish out synth-happy dross that falls somewhere between Avril Lavigne and ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"". Particularly brutal is the nonsensical ""Bim Bam Boom"", which aspires to poignancy in its grave chorus: ""Scooby, Scoo-by Doo/ Bim, Bam, Boom/ Bim/ Bam Boom."" Self-proclaimed ""fun"" music is notoriously difficult to pull off without slipping towards vacuity. Major keys and songs deluged in synthetic production effects aren't inherently bad; rather, their relationship with poor songwriting is stigmatic, not causal. Shanghai My Heart isn't repellent because of its convivial synths and aseptic production, but in this context, these elements only serve to make weaker songs more obnoxious.","Irony is a fickle mistress.

I Love My Organ,Tom Recchion,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2feb1335d7bf1698606/1:1/w_160/c9d52449.jpg,2004-05-04 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6916-i-love-my-organ/,Birdman,"Having lived under the same Californian sun as fellow Left Coast weirdos Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, it's no surprise that Tom Recchion, in homage to titles like Lumpy Gravy and ""White Jam"", has called this record I Love My Organ. The Wire suspected that the quote could be onanistic, but in the tradition of another off-his-axis ambient master, Erik Satie, it could as easily be in the tradition of that lost art of omphalism, meditating on one's own belly-button. Self-absorbed, unaware of trends and times, and generally out of the loop, tape-splicer Recchion has existed in his own world since the mid-1970s, helping to found the bizarre Los Angeles Free Music Society-- which had connections to everyone from The Residents to Beefheart to Keiji Haino (still decades away from recognition outside of the Japanese underground)-- a collective that released their own records in DIY fashion before punk even hit. Recchion even worked inside the system, designing Grammy-nominated album covers for R.E.M. and Prince along the way. I Love My Organ is Recchion's latest batch of kooky, newly unearthed tape improvisations to see release via Birdman Records, and judging from the material on display, its contents were created in some nondescript haze of the 80s. As composed as they may appear to be, 11 of the record's 15 tracks are real-time improvisations, with Recchion jumping between unballasted tape loops with arrays of organs, strange exotica samples and homemade instruments. The liner notes' dedications point to the middle ground it all inhabits, shouting out to horn-rimmed geeks like Ferrante & Teicher and Jad Fair, as well as ambient gurus Terry Riley and Brian Eno. For those already taken with the disintegrating tape loop majesty of Brooklyn composer William Basinski, Recchion's ""Narcotic"" (which is dedicated to him), shows a striking synchronicity of melancholic sound; it's the result of two musicians operating on two different coasts during the Reagan era, utterly unaware of the others' work. Other pieces engage in exotic, obsolete rhythms from the rim of the memory hole: Imaginary Italian mod soundtracks and rhythms such as waltzes, calliopes and sambas paint each distinct meter as a woozy and wasted 3am ride on a destitute carousel. The record finishes with an eerie whispered bit by David Toop, whose Exotica book was inspired by a handful of peculiar easy-listening mixtapes sent to him by Recchion. The culminating, off-the-cuff results are as unsettling as a Martin Denny album cover as rendered by performance artist Paul McCarthy: a grass-skirted nymphet in a rubber Mister Rogers mask, blood on her feet.","Having lived under the same Californian sun as fellow Left Coast weirdos Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, it's no ...

Look Mom... No Hands,Vast Aire,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a99ac0084474cd0c1078/1:1/w_160/e8645a2c.jpg,2004-05-04 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8531-look-mom-no-hands/,Chocolate Ind.,"It was easy to get behind Cannibal Ox. A scrappy duo of New York ne'er-do-wells, their struggle was rich with emotion and anger, siphoning ghetto struggle through El-P's fish-eye lens. And then Vordul got his collarbone broken. We stood behind Vast's questionable freestyles and guest appearances. We even thought about buying his Dirty Magazine mixtape (until we downloaded it and wept). Now, three years after The Cold Vein made them underground hip-hop's next big thing, comes Vast Aire's solo debut for Chocolate Industries, an awkward, inconsistent amalgam of wasted talent and musical apathy. The magic behind Vast Aire's early work is almost intangible, considering that his vocal exterior consists of a hazy cadence, off-kilter flow, unrelenting repetition, and dependence on punch-ins. But his stoic confidence was immediately compelling-- almost as much as his effortless control of metaphor. But the Vast Aire that shows up on Look Mom No Hands is confusing and confused. Here, his darts lack the sharpness of his Cold Vein cuts, and as he frames his tracks with lame choruses (""Saying his rhymes ain't fresh/ Is like saying Ted Koppel's toupee is okay""), there's nothing to counter his arrhythmic delivery. Whether this lack of ambition results from Vordul's temporary departure or just a sudden comfort with his craft is uncertain; what isn't is that Vast Aire just doesn't sound hungry anymore. There are a few moments in which Vast offers glimmers of hope, from the amusing back-and-forth of the MF Doom collab ""Da Supafriendz"" to the pleasant summer barbecue vibe of the obligatory R&B; cut ""Viewtiful Flow"", but never is the promise of greatness more apparent than on ""Life's Ill Pt. II: The Empire Striketh"". Madlib's instrumental sounds like someone playing church organ in a spaceship's engine room, with Breeze Brewin ""writing dead sea scrolls,"" Vast juxtaposing 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Cold Vein's release date, and Vordul chastising ""half-comedians, not really soundin' funny."" Unfortunately, these are the best of the lot, and on a 16-track outing, these brief diamonds can't overshadow the rough. The production is a spotty affair as well, though it too has its moments. On the upside, Rjd2 pours incredible strings and 70s bass atop the pointless Esoteric diss ""9 Lashes (When Michael Smacks Lucifer)"" and Madlib contributes the suspended flute, recoiling horns and marching drums of the title track. But for every ""Pegasus (Remix)"", there's an ""Elixir"" (which, by the way, sounds like something from an aborted Daz Dillinger/Erick Sermon compilation). This kind of inconsistency helps to illuminate Vast's lack of lyrical commitment throughout the album. All said, even with Aesop Rock, Sadat X, Blueprint, Breeze Brewin, MF Doom and Vordul on the lineup, Look Mom... No Hands consistently fails to impress lyrically, or to convince fans that Vast's first solo venture is really the individual effort it purports to be. Sure, he drops the occasional jewel (""The third movie of The Matrix was gonna be wack/ It ain't like I didn't care/ But the Oracle said 'spend your money elsewhere'""), but otherwise it's a sleepwalk-- one on which Vast takes for granted the name recognition and industry connections that snagged him the underground's top rappers and producers.","It was easy to get behind Cannibal Ox.

Reconfigures,Schneider TM,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37bea9e61561daa4cac/1:1/w_160/625819f7.jpg,2004-05-04 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7030-reconfigures/,Earsugar,"Given the choice, I tend to prefer a collection of a remixer's work over a collection of an artist's work remixed by different producers. Since the sonic character of a song belongs to the person who last had their fingers on the mouse, an album collecting a producer's remixes tends to flow better and possess something closer to a singular identity. Over the last couple of years, Schneider TM's Dirk Dresselhaus has been a busy remixer, and now he's collected 12 of his remixes and collaborations on Reconfigures. Schneider TM have developed a distinct sonic identity that typically includes vocodered vocals, bits of acoustic guitar, and the kind of squelchy electropop production that Germany made famous, and he's not shy about using his signature tricks to dress up another song. So, immediately, the best thing this collection has going for it is that it works together as a record, with similar elements used in various configurations from track to track. In other words, it sounds something like a Schneider TM album with a host of guest stars. But the stars, well, they're shining pretty dim on Reconfigures. The problem is that most of the songs just weren't that interesting to begin with, and though Dresselhaus does make the most of his source material, the limit to what can be done is apparent. His version of Margo's ""Take Me"" is plodding electro-indie, with slightly interesting noises that nonetheless fail to raise the song to the level of a Sukpatch B-side. His take on Lamb's ""Wonder"", in which he adds some backward drums to the light-gray gothic melody, breaks the rhythmic spine of the song, transforming it from merely dull to actively unpleasant. The Faint's ""The Conductor"" gets some vocodered vocals and chunky beats, and probably wouldn't be terrible if I could stomach Todd Baechle's voice. The collaboration ""Ephe Kicks In, Feel Like Kevin"" with K.pt.Michigan and Rechenzentrum, features Marc Marcovic on vocals trying to do Prince track (""When Doves Cry"" handclaps feature in the production) and coming away with a bad Beck impression instead. On the bright side, the collaboration with Pulseprogramming ""Suck or Run"" is essentially a new (and rather good) Schneider TM song, as Dresselhaus layers his vocals and guitar over the squishy beat, with a faux-Stones lead on acoustic and bits of harmonica. Ruby's ""Grace, Space"" has some fantastic wah-wah guitar that rises to the level of the most intricate hip-hop production, along with the classic-sounding soul vocals. Lambchop's ""The New Cobweb Summer"" has an interesting ""broken"" quality that goes beyond the processing of Kurt Wagner's voice, too. But ultimately, despite a few positive blips, Reconfigures fails even with the lowered expectations of a remix collection.","Given the choice, I tend to prefer a collection of a remixer's work over a collection of an artist ...

Steel Wound,Frost,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be7aeb335119a49ed07d/1:1/w_160/0857de60.gif,2004-05-04 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3277-steel-wound/,Room40,"I generally try to leave cover art out of the discussion when it comes to reviewing albums, but every once in a while you just have to do it because it makes sense. In this case, what you see when you look at the packaging for the album is exactly what you get when you listen to it: a limited tonal palette, lots of wide-open space, and a decidedly minimalist approach. It's probably kind of difficult to tell in tiny 72 dpi, but the lines stretching across the bottom of the brown field are steel-wound guitar strings, whose vibrations are the source of all but two sounds on this CD. It's also worth noting that the package itself is the signature slipcase of Australia's Room40 Records, a promising ambient-focused upstart with a highly distinctive visual calling card. Frost consists solely of guitarist/soundscaper Ben Frost, and his approach to the instrument is more textural than harmonic or melodic. He draws long sounds from the instrument, processing and layering to create a slowly swelling and morphing mass of shimmering icicle tones that hang in the air like wraiths of smoke. It sounds especially great in the dark, as the waves of guitar echo around the room. The first two compositions are both soft-edged swells, clouds of drones that rise and fall separately to build dozens of subtly different textures. Stars of the Lid and Keith Fullerton Whitman have more or less perfected this approach, and Frost does a good job of it, crafting an enveloping haze. The standout track, though, is ""You, Me and the End of Everything"", a languid ice flow built around a few sparsely plucked, heavily reverb-drenched guitar figures. Vocalist Jane Wentzki provides color, often merging with the guitar as Frost chops her voice and distorts it, laying it between inky chords and long, wailing drones. It's ten minutes of pure phase aural bliss, a total bath for the senses. The title track wounds as if it was recorded in an old stone castle, the way the sounds reverberate, but of course it's all artificial reverb. Field recordings of crackling sounds and muffled voices lie deep in the frigid lake of feedback and string noise, but it seems clear that they're not really the focus of the piece, but rather a sort of measure taken to lend the listener a sense of place. The album closes with two pieces that, despite failing to expand much on previous tracks, are nonetheless entirely agreeable. Steel Wound is an exemplary ambient experience, and another fine release from an intriguing young label. The chilly textures Frost creates are easy to immerse yourself in, and even occasionally transcendent. Whether he can spin this approach into another album this interesting or moves on to something else only time will tell, but Steel Wound speaks well for itself in the meantime.","I generally try to leave cover art out of the discussion when it comes to reviewing albums, but every once ...

The Pretty Toney Album,Ghostface,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bff013d197565213b980/1:1/w_160/20d79937.jpg,2004-05-04 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3636-the-pretty-toney-album/,Def Jam,"Dennis Coles' career may be even more enigmatic than that of the Wu-Tang collective that birthed it. Since notoriously recording his first album from behind a fencing mask, Ghostface Killah has spent his solo discography facing tracklisting errors, guest appearances from subpar MCs, and a quest for commercial acceptance that's netted him exactly zero Top 40 singles. It would seem high time for Coles to shrug off label expectations, focus on pleasing his fanbase, and finally escape the spectre of his financial shortcomings. Where the solo releases of so many Wu-Tang alumni have suffered from lagging production, or seemed naked without backup from fellow Clan members, Ghostface has managed to cultivate a unique sound and identity apart from his former crew on the strength of his own technical merit. Still among the rap game's finest, Ghostface possesses one of history's most malleable flows: he growls, screams, sputters, speeds up, stumbles, coos, whispers, croons, pleads, cries, and indulges in onomatopoeia-- sometimes all in the same song. Considering this distinct style, the quality of his albums has always been relative to his subject matter. Here, he assumes the role of Do the Right Thing's Radio Raheem: one fist spells ""HATE"", the other ""LOVE."" ""Beat the Clock""'s strings hit like a right hook, as producer Minnesota (best known for Mos Def's ""Beef"") throws down an unchanging blaxploitation funk loop that keeps in line with the minimalist backing of Ghost's best work. Taking advantage of the open space, Ghost styles like crazy, arguing with himself between verses and periodically switching to a sing-song cadence. Quotables pop up all over the place here-- from scenes that have him ""hopping over chairs like O.J."" to straight disses like ""get off my D-I, then go C the K"")-- but the track's most stunning line has Ghost pushing opulence through the creative threshold: ""I put my ring up to my man's waves/ I seen the ocean."" On the other end of the spectrum is ""Save Me Dear"", a self-produced throwback sampling Ghostface's own Supreme Clientele highlight ""Child's Play"" and Jam Master Jay's cavernous 808 beats, and bears a surprisingly resemblance to MF Doom's recent work. An open plea to womankind, Ghost offers a testament to true thug love, asserting, ""We mad tight, in the way she never call the cops on a nigga,"" and rallying, ""To all the ladies who love they man/ Though they fucked up and you still let 'em back in."" Of course, as is customary with Wu rappers, Ghost sometimes makes missteps in the name of personal preference. There are cases in which Ghost allows his old-school heart and love for homage obscure or detract from the quality of his music (or album cover-- witness the sad Photoshop hackjob paying tribute to Doug E. Fresh's 1988 classic The World's Greatest Entertainer). Yet, The Pretty Toney Album remains incredibly on-target otherwise, with uniformly stunning production work that feels like a ramshackle Blueprint. From the short sample chop and four-bar horn flourish of ""Be This Way"", to True Master's paused piano and fuzz saxophone drum stomp on ""Biscuits"", to the fear-soaked, twisted-horn chase music of ""Run"", Pretty Toney evokes hip-hop's storied past even while its polish and gloss reveal its 2004 release date. Expectedly, minor shortcomings hold the record back from classic status. The lack of his usual obligatory Raekwon collaboration hurts Pretty Toney's variety, and the skits, despite featuring topics and idiosyncratic raps far above the standards of his contemporaries, tend to bog down the album's progress. I'm also disappointed by the exclusion of mixtape tracks ""Gorilla Hood"", ""The Splash"", and ""My Guitar"", which could have offered the record a better batting average. But all things considered, Pretty Toney far surpasses 2001's Bulletproof Wallets, finally finding the missing link between street cred and commercial respect.",,8.2,

You've put off reviewing this record for weeks; left it at the back of your mind while trembling through this stubborn, clinging winter. When you're staring at a sick-note sun that only appears through breaks in the black clouds; with waves of rain that harass you on the slow trudge home, the last sound you want to hear is some twee-pop poem about daybreak in Santa Monica. I have Joy Division box sets for days like these; do I need to listen to Sandy fucking Denny? Which is lazy-assed journalism: Why should sunshine dictate whether a record's great or not? Shouldn't the hardened rock hack, given a gram of coke and a poisoned pen, carve out some scene-stealing review of Pet Sounds even in the cold grip of a nuclear winter? Maybe. But maybe half the trick of music journalism is empathy; of leaving yourself open to the blues and moods that shaped the sounds under your radar. How can you say if an album's any good if you can't even tell where it's coming from? But then, maybe some albums just aren't worth the effort. Being the coy-voiced, synth-fiddling, fair-haired minstrel behind both The Essex Green and Ladybug Transistor, in recent years Finishing School's Sasha Bell has lent her lemon-scent vocals to some divinely arranged, pillow-soft 60s pop. However, when removed from the cynicism and nosebled sincerity that stopped such projects from simply being a bore of psychedelic pastiche, her first solo outing seems like a rash of formulaic sweetness, without the strength of song to see it through. Too often on ""Destination Girl"", Bell revels in by-numbers arrangements. Take how opening track ""Reno"" surprises no one with its cushion of cheap synths, baroque strings, spiked surf-guitar, go-nowhere lyrics and Bell's off-key, adolescent croon-- and proceeds to repeat the formula throughout the rest of the record. All of this would be less jarring if her melodies had the kind buoyant, sunlit gleam as her other projects; but here they seem weightless, drab, and lacking the sparks of grace and passion that permeated the last Ladybug album. Despite its damning flaws, there's still a strange charm to this record. At her best, Sasha Bell's songs are like a schoolgirl crush; listen to the ditzy love-stung waltz of the title track (""I feel like somebody you wouldn't even look at twice""), or when her keyboard line mimics the heartbeat flutter of a melody on ""Morning Light"",' and you find that however frustrating this record may be, some of these homemade reveries still have a genuinely touching warmth about them. Sunshine or not, what we're left with is an album of mixed fortunes; at once graceful, passive, charming and sunburnt, it is also plagued with a predictability and deficiency of ideas that drag it into a mediocre, self-repeating quagmire.

Escondida,Jolie Holland,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c159eb335119a49ed551/1:1/w_160/445ecb9c.jpg,2004-05-03 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3981-escondida/,Anti-,"Texan songstress Jolie Holland regularly wrangles comparisons to the Cowboy Junkies and Gillian Welch, but her more formidable likeness is homestate neo-powerhouse Norah Jones: No matter how boring or stupidly inconsequential Jones' records may be, Jones has proven herself one of the most unexpected new forces in pop, forgoing the seemingly predictable pop landscape in 2002 and single-handedly exposing a new, painfully untapped market of cocktail-partying music-buyers. Thus, witness the aftermath: Now, plucky Jolie Holland has to contend with a new, post-Jones landscape, wherein slow, salty coos have become alarmingly ubiquitous, and a female singing scrappy, country-tinged jazz is forever linked with a Borders-shopping, latte-drinking, Nantucket-summering herd of yuppies. Like Jones, Holland produces her own records, and plays several instruments (guitar, piano, ukulele), but Holland also single-handedly scribes all of her own material, injecting a healthy bit of confessionalism into her lyrics (see Sascha's ""I fell in love with a boy/ Who has a real life romance with a train"") whereas Jones' quips tend to fall embarrassingly flat, each verse impossibly lifeless and smooth. This is, ultimately, where Holland exceeds most notably-- her vaguely gothic cautionary tales and lovelorn laments are always strikingly personal and passionately rendered, with traditional arrangements, heated narratives, and sprays of big Texas spark gently folded in. Holland's pipes are dynamic enough to suit a variety of vocal styles, and Escondida, Holland's second full-length (and her first not culled from demos), boldly embraces an entire handful of tried American genres, her voice often flitting from country-rock twang to frantic crooner scats, or brazenly hopping from sultry, neo-beat jazz whispers (see repeated references to ""Billy Burroughs"") to benign singer/songwriter musing. Leaving little room for speculation, Holland repeatedly assures us that, yes, she can sing it-- and while self-diversifying is a perfectly acceptable (and sometimes glorious) approach to recording a fully realized, internally cohesive album, Holland's scope periodically makes Escondida appear non-committal and/or scattered. Thus, the record occasionally becomes the sonic equivalent of playing dress-up or signing up for seventeen youth sports leagues-- and there are only so many hat-changes an audience can faithfully endure. But all fickleness aside, Escondida still offers a spooky, blues-driven platter of jazz-folk, with plenty of interesting-- if vaguely predictable-- melodic turns. The guitars-and-cymbals-only ""Black Stars"" is a spare and prickly incantation, while ""Goodbye California"", which sounds as though it's being sung by a woman with a rubber mouth, putters proudly, an epic road story. Holland refers to standout ""Old Fashioned Morphine"" as a ""bastard hybrid"" of Old Time Religion and Willie Johnson's take on ""Wade in the Water"" (Holland also includes a hilarious-if-ridiculous cautionary blurb in the liner notes: ""I wrote this... in the midst of a meditation on the history of medicine.

Scratch or Stitch,Melt-Banana,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c426c0084474cd0c3618/1:1/w_160/c70a0cbc.gif,2004-05-03 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5219-scratch-or-stitch/,Skin GraftSkin Graft,"As the subway pulls into Shibuya on the Yamanote Line in Tokyo, nothing can prepare you for the sensory onslaught that awaits. Leaving the station via the Hachiko exit reveals a piercing overload of blinking neon, tennis court-sized media screens, and a relentless and chaotic surge of humanity through the streets that spiral dizzyingly off into the horizon. As a city gripped by paroxysms of furious activity, Tokyo seems to be a very reasonable home for the spasmodic, psychotic hardcore of Melt-Banana. And if you've spent a little time in the world's most baffling metropolis, this reissue of the equally startling tech-punk classic Scratch or Snitch should resonate with familiarity. Melt-Banana are not the only purveyors of excess to emerge from Japan, but like spiritual brethren Boredoms and Ruins, their best releases stand as a testament to the power that a well-produced and inventive punk band can command with focus, technical prowess, and sick levels of ambition. Heavyweight Chicago auteurs Steve Albini and Jim O'Rourke recorded and mixed this 22-track, half-hour punk rocker back in 1995. The presence of two of the industry's most respected creative technicians infused this energetic four-piece with a shot of credibility that, in light of this band's musicianship, almost seems gratuitous. Evidently, nothing so drastic as a remastering was ever going to be needed for this repressing. When forming Melt-Banana, Yasuko Onuki tore through ranks of personnel, finally settling with the guitar and bass duo of Agata and Rika, who provide electro-convulsive therapy to compliment Onuki's rapid-fire Japanese pop-culture musings. Her search paid off: The maelstrom that ensues here is never less than impeccably rendered-- one of the most coherent and illustrative recordings of the notoriously sloppy punk genre. ""Rough Dogs Have Bumps"" shows Melt-Banana in full control of an adrenaline-heavy hardcore frenzy that twists Heavy Metal guitar clichés into a delirious romp. Nonsensical as they predominately are, Onuki's frenetic utterances slice through the mix, setting the band on a jagged path fraught with hysteria and anger. Each instrument twitches fervently yet clearly in the expert mix that evokes Tokyo's busy streets: crammed with activity, yet immaculately litter-free. Scratch or Stitch's track titles blare like the advertising slogans and brand name nonsense flashing on Osaka's electrical billboards. ""DIG Out!"", ""DisPosable Weathercock"" and ""BuZZer #P"" combine a parody of pop culture with a lively humor that sits well with the delirium of their contents. The 1\xBD-minute average track length echoes shortening attention spans precipitated by the quick-fire editing of youth culture TV, while Melt-Banana play with Japan's preoccupation with elaborate packaging and presentation by building layers of sound before ripping them to burning shreds as Onuki gleefully narrates their demise. 22 tracks might seem a bit ambitious, even for such an inventive and technically varied act, but then, hardcore punk is an ordeal at the best of times. The inclusion of the stunted 10- and 20-second ""TYPe B for Me"" and ""A Finger to Hackle"" (amongst other sub-minute explosions) does something to punctuate and shape the record, but tracks tend to bleed into one another, the quirky titles being all that separate the likes of ""It's in the PillcaSe"" and ""Sick ZiP Everywhere"". Thankfully, Melt-Banana do have a healthier than usual tendency toward riveting experimentation, judging by the torture chamber soundscape of ""EYE-Q Trader"" and the lycanthropic transformation from gentle to rabid in ""Back to the WomB"". Scratch or Stitch sits among subsequent Melt-Banana releases with an air of superiority. Although influences and comparisons are not difficult to find, it's a mistake to bundle this album into any anonymous hardcore classification. What you're listening to may seem to be sensationalist and carnal, but that belies the album's wry center, steeped in cultural exposure. Hardcore? This release is Tokyo-core, and looking out across this sleepless behemoth of commerce, there's nothing accelerated or excessive about it.","As the subway pulls into Shibuya on the Yamanote Line in Tokyo, nothing can prepare you for the sensory\n ...

Sunset Scavenger,DJ Zeph,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9dd13d197565213af53/1:1/w_160/b05961bc.jpg,2004-05-03 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2393-sunset-scavenger/,Wide Hive,"After ten years behind the decks, a 2001 debut LP, and last year's well-received ""Floorwax"" 12-inch, San Francisco beat scientist DJ Zeph's sophomore release fights for the royal echelon of turntablism. He must realize he's on the cusp of reaching a wider audience: Sunset Scavenger pulls out all stops. Forgoing previous experimentation for superior songcraft, the album is innovative and fresh, driven equally by Zeph's warm, deft sampling technique, his ear for tight composition, and the organic vibe brought by an array of prestigious guest artists. Sunset Scavenger, named for the perpetually busy Bay Area recycling and composting service, couldn't ask for a more apt title: It sifts through heaps of styles and moods, cleverly referencing classic themes while constructing an absorbing, purely original work from the bits and pieces. From the live electro tabla breaks of ""Go Back"", to Zeph's pairing with DJ Quest on the Bukem-esque opener ""Unsubtractable"", to Rahsaan Ahmed's Kurtis Blow flow on the rollerdisco bounce of ""Floorwax"", this record spans the entire breakbeat landscape to stunning effect, using history as it building blocks and wrapping its MCs in a warm blanket of crackling vinyl and analog purr. When huge, unmistakable personalities show up-- like The Coup's Boots Riley and a typically raucous Lyrics Born-- Zeph's seamless production one-ups that of his contemporaries by complimenting, rather than obstructing, his guests. In fact, the music's luxurious, necksnapping immediacy itself takes on a personality of its own: That's live violin and cello on ""Underscore"", beautifully amplified to swelling, orchestral proportions. The percussive ""Organ Eyes"" pours syncopated Hammond atop live tabla and former Tower of Power drummer Ron Beck's ride and snare cracks; ""Sunset Samba"" braids live flute, trumpet, and a sizzling Brazilian rhythm. These collaborations have Zeph exhibiting the malleability of an expert arranger and producer-- through his wholly sample-constructed pieces, he flexes all the vinyl jockey flash that's rocketed his live shows to must-see status. The soul vocals on ""Raw B Interlude"" are cratedigging gold, resting against conga beats and jangly guitar that suggest Latin-flavored Bootsy bass. ""Cormorant"", meanwhile, captures Zeph at his most downtempo, his low-key beat and intermittent guitar samples trickling beneath hip-hop poet Tim Barsky's urban spoken word fairy tale. Zeph's allegiance to Asian breaks crew Dhamaal is evident in his consistent use of Eastern instruments. His employment of sitar, doumbek and tabla never revels in the instruments' indigenous exoticism; rather, he seems as comfortable with their unique sounds as he does with traditional American accompaniment, allowing them to lend rhythmic texture and diversity without any hint of the kind of world beat undercurrent that could so easily shut the party down. Still, there is one misstep here, as the Dhamaal drummers are set free on an a cappella tabla/doumbek duel which, while fascinating, momentarily sends the album's continuity off its rails. To call Sunset Scavenger a breakthrough would be appropriate if not for Zeph's long-running presence on the West Coast turntablist scene. He's been creating music in this vein for more than a decade now, and while this is his most fully realized piece to date, it doesn't offer the same level of innovation that propelled his best-known predecessors to DJ superstardom. Still, like Rjd2's Deadringer, that doesn't stop the record from overshadowing its competition as a solid state-of-the-genre release.","After ten years behind the decks, a 2001 debut LP, and last year's well-received ""Floorwax"" 12-inch, San Francisco beat ...

"Kill Bill, Vol. 2",Various Artists,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fbea9e61561daa54b0/1:1/w_160/12a26bc5.gif,2004-05-02 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7888-kill-bill-vol-2/,Maverick,"I've discussed the nuances of this soundtrack with many people over the last two weeks, from freckled Sbarro employees to former Diamondback Efrain Valdez. The verdict is unanimous, transcending race, creed, and musical preference: Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is no match for Vol. 1. Curiously, though, this seems to be through no fault of Vol. 2's. People just seem to feel that comparing the two is as ludicrous as comparing a typhoon to the Sistine Chapel. In fact, most of my queries concluded with condescension or confusion. As one city clerk put it, ""You want me to do what now?"" It's no wonder people prefer the exhilarating thrust and groove of Vol. 1. Tarantino's world is one that thrives on thrashing swiftness and attention deficit disorders. And he works in a culture where entire residential areas are paved in neon lights, and anyone that goes the speed limit is labeled an effete bore or a terrorist. But the actual reason for this universal preference is more ambiguous. For every claim that ""the Vol. 1 soundtrack is faster, sort of catchier,"" you'll catch a brief, addled grimace, a mark of uncertainty. How can you possibly compare the two halves of this film, regardless of whether you derided or adored them? The first is all blustering, epileptogenic havoc; the second explores the first volume's motivation, history, and identity. And if it's a bit slow-going, it's because the creases in the characters' faces took a while to form. So do the soundtracks mirror this relationship? Does the Vol. 2 soundtrack redress Vol. 1's pop euphoria, and try to instill a little culture and history through the same musicians and characters? Does this explain the recurrence of certain artists-- Charlie Feathers, Meiko Kaji, Luis Bacalov, and Ennio Morricone? Of fucking course not, you pompous shit. Let's axe this disc like it ain't got no kids: Any fears are swiftly squelched with Shivaree's opening ""Goodnight Moon"", a skulking ooze that slinks down the stairs and leaps to the floor, part innocent, haunted-house shiver and part libidinous excess: ""There's a blade by the bed/ And a phone in my hand/ A dog on the floor/ And some cash on the nightstand."" It's as intoxicating and drenched in blood/sex/sweat as a three-minute Corona commercial. The broiling lust and loss is continued in Charlie Feathers' ""Can't Hardly Stand It"". Feathers basically made his entire career out of sounding like he was always endlessly and exquisitely enjoying a total mental and physical breakdown, and this song might be his climax: a limping, slashed voice punctuated by incredible, stinging gasps for air. It's as downtrodden and chilling as anything I've heard recently, with the possible exception of a full choir of Spanish children singing mass-- which happens to constitute the soundtrack's next torrid track. But the absolute masterpiece is Morricone's ""L'Arena"", an ode to pernicious anticipation that surrounds itself in bizarre, contorted construction sounds, like dirt being thrown over a grave. Whistling and brass is torn between elegy and celebration, while an effervescent choir sings a rain dance of noxious beauty. It's the kind of piece you can't listen to very frequently because you'll never want to do anything else again. The only possible competition lies in another Morricone dervish, the indefatigable ""A Silhouette of Doom"". Every single instrument here is played to its full capacity-- pianos are stomped, trumpets are excoriated, and guitars are brandished in a strangulating combination of Indian warcry, Hitchcockian dread, dog whistle, and recycling plant. There's really only one lonely misstep: Malcolm McLaren's preposterous ""About Her"", which is, literally, a trip-hop Zombies classic. The bigger issue, however, lies with the sequencing. For the most part, Tarantino seemed to have little idea of how to match his song choices with the film's scenes. Johnny Cash's slow death, ""A Satisfied Mind"", is given a few brief moments on Budd's stereo, while two of the best songs ever-- Morricone's Fistful of Dollars and Navajo Joe themes (neither of which are represented on either of the two soundtracks)-- are given hardly any coherent visual accompaniment. Likewise, Tarantino doesn't seem to have put much thought into how to represent the songs on this release. Vol. 1 offered a much more cohesive listen, with all sorts of elaborate connections between its songs: Bacalov's scalding Santa Ana winds segued into the Twisted Nerve whistle; Issac Hayes's militaristic snare whirled into Al Hirt's ""Green Hornet Theme"", etc. But Kill Bill, Vol. 2 simply doesn't make any sense; despite the quality of these tracks, the disc plays like a blur of arbitrary inclusions, more like a Sunday afternoon college radio DJ than any of the soundtrack releases that have made Tarantino as respected a music archivist as he is a director.","I've discussed the nuances of this soundtrack with many people over the last two weeks, from freckled Sbarro employees ...

The plain's location is indeterminate-- it could be in Israel, or the U.S., or any number of other places-- but what interests me more than the plain is the clouds above it. Really, I gave them no second thought until I looked at the booklet stowed within the outer casing, which uses two blown-up portions of the rear cover photo-- the thing is that when you open the booklet and view the front and back together, the two sections blend seamlessly as though they were one contiguous image, an impossibility since in the actual, full photograph, the section of the image that appears on the left is actually on the right. Why am I ranting about this? Honestly, I have little reason beyond the fact that it just struck me that somebody took the time to doctor these two details of a single photograph and serve them up as something new, probably knowing full well that almost nobody would notice it. I suppose I also mention it because it's the sort of double-take detail that Rockfour build their music on. The album that introduced them to American audiences, 2002's Another Beginning, was loaded with left turns and deceptive juxtapositions like that, and also happens to be one of the most enjoyable tributes to 1968 I've heard in ages. Two years later, with Nationwide, they seem poised to equal and perhaps surpass that album, but run out of steam before they get the chance. The album opens with a trio of knockout tunes spiked with 12-string jangle nicked from Roger McGuinn and honeyed harmonies. ""Honey"" immediately strikes a darker tone for the album with its midtempo pound and lyrics that sound innocent enough until you realize that, ""You call her honey/ She gets in the car,"" details an encounter with a prostitute. The title track is a rambunctious landslide of bouncing rhythm and thick harmony, highlighted by a warped guitar break that sounds beamed into the middle of the song from another planet, while ""Next Monroe"" drapes a sad minor melody over a dramatic chord progression. The problem is that, after this impressive opening salvo, the guns are only on target about half the time. Part of the problem is that the band has largely left behind the fun 'n' frenzy of their earlier material in an attempt to add a heavier, more serious edge to their sound, an entirely unnecessary exercise. ""To the End"" has a wonderfully Lennon-esque melody, but the music underneath just thrashes with no center of gravity, finally coughing up an absurdly indulgent guitar solo. ""Mad Routine"" finds more success with the fuzzier, more brutish take on the band's sound due to its propulsive rhythm and oozing hot glue melody, but the band muddies up ""You Said"" and ""Crush on Subtitles"" with too much distortion and rhythmic homogeneity. So while Rockfour have bulked their sound up with roomfuls of steroidal guitar pedals, they've also sacrificed some of the character and attention to detail that they built their name on. They can still kick out a melody with the best of them, but the slight update they've attempted has a tendency to load their songs down with too much dead weight. The occasions where they get it right are sublime, but Another Beginning hits it out of the park every time and remains the best introduction to the band.","On the rear of the digipak that houses Rockfour's Nationwide, the Tel Aviv band's sixth album (second stateside ...

On the Speakers EP,On the Speakers,by: Stephen M.

But its pun potential aside, On the Speakers is a ho-hum name for a group-- characterless and unevocative, not to mention a bit awkward to use alongside other prepositions (see below). The foursome behind the name, which includes former Creeper Lagoon frontman Ian Sefchick, barely transcends this nomenclatural blandness: On the Speakers seem to have few ambitions beyond picking up where Creeper Lagoon's final album, 2001's Take Back the Universe and Give Me Yesterday, left off. Their self-titled debut EP, which was originally released in late 2003 by San Francisco's 17 Reasons label, features the same type of self-effacing loser's anthems Sefchick wrote with his former band, along with the same chiming guitars and big-drama choruses. While the songs are unsurprising as a general rule, there are some not-so-guilty pleasures on On the Speakers (see?). Dan Horne's bass trips along on ""Share Your Self"", never content to settle for playing either rhythm section or melody, but trying to straddle both. And Sefchick still has an admirable talent for investing obtuse or unoriginal lyrics with actual sincerity. ""The heart is just a muscle,"" he observes wryly on ""Could I Be Right"" (perhaps unwittingly referencing a similar line from Clem Snide's song ""Exercise"", from 2000's Your Favorite Music). And on the workplace love song ""Click Your Heels"", he counsels, ""It's alright to be female,"" before asking, ""Are you the pawn of love or the king of discipline?"" Somehow, he manages to make these lyrics sound like dares rather than whines. The problem with On the Speakers, however, is the overfamiliarity of Sefchick's songwriting formula. He begins with a fairly subdued verse backed by the interplay of immaculate guitars, then-- dependable as clockwork-- he launches into an anthemic chorus that comes down like a wrecking ball. Sometimes this trajectory from small to big, from club venue to arena, fits the songs naturally and perfectly. The first (and best) track, ""Could I Be Right"", tinkers with this formula by adding a catchy lead-in to the chorus, and the final song, ""Dance Crazy"", promisingly expresses a deep, sober-voiced anomie as Sefchick sounds genuinely addled by war-time paranoia and uncertainty. But the four songs that separate these two tracks rely too heavily on Sefchick's cookie-cutter song structures, each one indulging in a sweeping chorus about one minute and fifteen seconds in. This constant reiteration not only renders each track indistinct from the others, but breeds an unimaginative predictability that increasingly dilutes the songs' cumulative effect. As a result, On the Speakers sounds repetitive at a mere six songs, and On the Speakers barely skirt redundancy themselves. At the same time, these songs reveal a relatively new band still working on building a distinct, dynamic identity. As they prove with the catchy melodies of ""Could I Be Right"" and the unexpected topicality of ""Dance Crazy"", On the Speakers sound best when they're willing to risk something, which suggests that they have all the elements to live up to-- or live down-- their name.","Depending on your threshold for wordplayful band names, On the Speakers can either aid you in a cute throwback to ...

Sung Tongs,Animal Collective,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09e5e6ef9596931ffc9/1:1/w_160/89f05691.jpg,2004-05-02 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/,Fat Cat,"At the break in ""Winters Love"", from Animal Collective's feral, sentimental Sung Tongs, when the guitar picks up and Avey Tare and Panda Bear's voices flail like children who know they'll never die, it occurs to me that youth isn't always wasted on the young. This is an old cliché, about how kids can never really appreciate the finer aspects of immaturity-- in fact, it's their immaturity and naiveté that all the gray adults crave like zombies. It's a child's lack of self-conscience and ""common sense"" that make them holy, just as it's an adult's knowledge of their own mortality that makes them a little bit dead. However, even if the sickly, aching adults might long for days spent wasting precious time and forgetting precious lessons, most of them wouldn't turn back the clock if given the chance. Youth isn't wasted on the young at all, because only kids on holiday could afford to leave their hearts exposed for so long, to sing as loudly and to take so much for granted. Rather, wisdom is wasted on the old. Since their first release, Brooklyn's Animal Collective have soundtracked the surreal, manic experience of ""immature"" euphoria. In fact, the Tare/Bear duo responsible for Sung Tongs is the same that issued 2000's Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished, a singular, idiosyncratic take on fairy tale folk and starchild pop. Fairy tales and star-children: These are impressions of 'The Beyond' for imaginative children, and it's this mentality that Animal Collective explore and evoke. It might seem whimsical or silly, but only in the sense that these perceptions are the birthrights of all children, and this band have such facility with their musical environment that they manage to turn something primal into something almost timeless. Rather, grace is wasted on the elegant. Unlike last year's impressive Here Comes the Indian, Sung Tongs opts for folky ambience and late-night, summer camp sing-alongs to carry the weight (or weightlessness) of its strains. Campfire Songs, which followed Here Comes the Indian, suggested a similar kind of sprawling, communal minstrel-craft, but without much of Sung Tongs' flair for soaring melody and delicate, buoyant pace. As it happens, the last third of the new record does return to more of an open-ended, exploratory rote, but there it seems less a part of an endless ballad than the come-down from scenes of a jungle almost too fantastic to imagine. And despite its eclecticism and relatively Dadaist leanings, Sung Tongs is a romantic album; romantic in its celebration of innocence and nonsensical shared knowledge, and the sweet, trusted idea that everything will be fine-- as if it hadn't always been. Musically, Animal Collective sound more ""pop"" here than they ever have, which is to say most of the songs have clear melodies that beg to be doubled and tripled by you or anyone else who cares to join. In songs like ""Leaf House"", ""Winters Love"" and ""College"", the duo stake a direct claim to the ideal American folk of the Beach Boys and Simon & Garfunkel, as their harmonies are pure, without suggesting perfection. As Tare and Bear leap over each other in wordless, sparkler-trail counterpoint, I think about the already-gone ambitions of ""Cabinessence"" and Smiley Smile. However, as Brian Wilson's visions were damaged symphonies to god, Animal Collective don't stop down long enough to mire in the dust left behind. ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"" revels in a thousand parts of some giant timepiece, as the pair of delirious children slide over screws into a bright green den of gears. The acoustic guitar rings in the start of this race with a fanfare, major chord strum, and just after the chimes cheer in pandemonium, harmony vocals spit out as many syllables as possible to describe who knows what country fair, bread-and-butter game. Sometimes their voices cross, or fly so near each other for long stretches that what seems like intricate polyphony approaches unhinged, acrobatic maneuvering. Above all, a sense of overwhelming happiness at having discovered this strange place abounds. Elsewhere, the music is more reflective. ""The Softest Voice"" layers clear-toned guitar figures upon each other, as Tare and Bear whisper in harmony above, as if singing to the vision peering back at them from the skin of a backwoods creek. The rustic, secretive manner of their voices and the barely disturbed forest around them suggests that whatever ghosts inhabit these woods are only too happy to oblige a lullaby or two. Likewise, the epic ""Visiting Friends"" gathers in faceless, mutated ghosts (i.e., oddly manipulated vocalizations from the duo) to hover over their dying fire in visage of nothing better than the tops of trees. The constant strumming moves alongside the voices, helping to keep them afloat, but never suggesting they should organize themselves into anything recognizable or predictable. It's windy, and if it rains they'll get wet and continue to play. The ritual dance ""We Tigers"", passing like a pagan baptism for children in war paint, gives way to a trilogy of almost formless ballads, beginning with the erratic hymn ""Mouth Wooed Her"". Here, Animal Collective, no longer satisfied to keep their enthusiasm in check via tribal drums or faintly Brazilian guitar figures, glide through scenes with impressionistic glee. Wordless coos and birdcalls light up the song, and the pair eases into their narrative with wispy, echoed melodies, before running into each other headfirst and pouncing on their guitars like real savages. This is how Sung Tongs communicates; in place of organized chaos, there are chance meetings and reunions, and plenty of celebratory dances and momentary epiphanies. In truth, it may be too much for some people to take, especially if they're too far removed from this strange environment. For others, it's a wonderful place, as these guides know only too well.",,8.9,
Treats for the Nightwalker,Josh Roseman,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fdea9e61561daa4b9c/1:1/w_160/ef1c4a65.jpg,2004-05-02 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6915-treats-for-the-nightwalker/,EnjaJustin Time,"It's a familiar theme in the story of America's musical evolution: At the dawn of the last century, when jazz first jitterbugged onto the national bandstand, uptight tastemakers considered it risqué, uncouth and demoralizing. Seen from the outside, its propulsive rhythms and improvisational swagger could only signal an uneducated turn away from the staid, swollen rigidity of the Classics. Jazz moved forward anyway, its forebears far surpassing the creative limitations imposed by a shortsighted public and pushing the limits of music. But they were both right, the squares and the swingers: Jazz was dangerous music, and for an extended golden era, its impassioned bite and mutant beauty illuminated the musical landscape. Then, in the 1980s (how many bummer sentences start with that phrase?), we got Wynton, a man who rose to national acclaim by sucking all the innovation and risk from the music founded on innovation and risk, and it's been an uphill battle to regain jazz's vigor and progressive approach ever since. For the past 15 years or so, ground zero has been the stylistic incubator of downtown NYC. Progressive luminaries like John Zorn, Marc Ribot, and MMW were all weaned on the City's well-informed, uberhip teat, and they've brought truly challenging, thrilling new music to an adoring fanbase. A staple of this downtown scene for years, Josh Roseman was one of the founders of acid jazz goliaths Groove Collective and has toured with artists like MMW and Soulive and jazz heavies Dave Douglas and Dave Holland. On his first album, 2001's Cherry, Roseman was a virtuoso showing on a variety of pop covers and weakish originals, impressive though never outstanding. His follow-up, however, delivers a potent, smoldering statement that harkens back to jazz's headiest days. Roseman starts off Treats for the Nightwalker on the right foot by surrounding himself with some of today's best and brightest. Besides Roseman's lyrical trombone, the lineup also features Hieroglyphics Ensemble leader Peter Apfelbaum on organ, flute and sax, and guitarists Ben Monder and Liberty Ellman, while the rhythm section features Dave Holland Quintet's Billy Kilson on drums and Patrice Blanchard's understated bass. This underground all-star ensemble succeeds because, despite individual pedigree, it's bound into a tight, multi-layered Bitches Brew-esque knot. As the album winds through a boldly diverse array of styles, Roseman picks his players to suit the song, but the dense, sinuous sound remains consistent. Roseman's major triumph here is in focusing a whole slew of genres-- free jazz, funk, hip-hop, dub, world beat, pop, psychedelia-- through his own interpretive lens and projecting a completely cohesive, original sound. Swirling compositions like the Far-eastern, prog-rocking ""Prospect"" and the ethereal, sensuous title track are more ideas in motion than static songs; they're not sketches, per se, but slowly unfolding mysteries. Along the way we encounter effects-smudged trombone, wah-wah guitar, muted trumpet, and hypnotic bass. Burt Bacharach's ""Long Day, Short Night"" receives a heavy-lidded dub treatment that easily bounces into a swinging ska breakdown, but its chorus retains the original's grand, showtunish grace. The handclaps and Hammond opening ""Meera"" give the song a frantic, On the Corner feel, but electronic effects along with Diego Voglino's breakbeat drums and Jay Rodrigues' bass clarinet add a buoyant futurefunk drive. ""Regression"", flecked with sampled birdsong and underscored by Jon Maron's throbbing bass, brightens slowly like an island sunrise. With several numbers stretching past the ten-minute mark, these songs travel far before resolving and pass through a variety of structures and moods, yet Roseman's joyful, surprising arrangements always keeps them interesting. Length, however, is the album's weak spot. It's tough to swallow 71 minutes of music so thick and compositions so vast. Like a lot of epic fusion and soul-jazz albums of the 70s, Treats could benefit from one less song. Too much of a good thing is still a good thing, but Roseman's point would be far more effective if it were just a bit more succinct.",,7.2,

Already this year there've been a slew of great and different releases in the genre-- it seems Devendra Banhart, Charalambides, and Espers will all top year-end lists-- and the juggernaut that is Animal Collective's Sung Tongs hasn't even officially hit the streets yet. Among these names we can now count Chicago's Born Heller. The duo of Josephine Foster and Jason Ajemian have put together a chilling debut album of distant backwoods folk, remarkable particularly for its depth of sound despite the duo's insistence on sparse, straightforward melodies. Strummed chords are typically passed over in favor of deliberate note-for-note string harmonies and some proper counterpoint. The ensuing nudity of the compositions forces Born Heller, in order to keep the listener occupied, to move from one idea to another without much brooding time-- no moment is wasted on mere repetition. What results is an album that's deceptively slow-paced, yet consistently engaging for the entirety of its half-hour runtime. Ajemian is clearly a competent instrumentalist, as his work with Rob Mazurek and Ken Vandermark attests. But Foster, a veritable American Shirley Collins, is the star here. From her first croons on ""I Want To"", Foster manages what some might liken to a clandestine amateur opera: Her voice is quiet, shaky even, but she manages a practiced control over her pitch and delivery. Which is important: Foster often taps into a certain melodrama that finds a face only in the most assuredly private bathroom mirrors. The glam works here perhaps to its own chagrin because it sounds quite real and vulnerable; if someone told Foster she sounds like an idiot, I get the feeling she might tailspin into depression. As on ""I Want To"", Born Heller's compelling brittleness can be attributed to its circumspect broken-glass-on-floor approach to tandem guitar/vocal rubato. ""Mountain Song"" provides one of the album's best moments, pitting double-plucked strings against Foster's calmly delivered, yet gritty brown narrative: ""We're lost in the mountains... Call a paramedic."" The song's most brilliant stroke, however, is Born Heller's suspended violin tones, which, by moving in and out of key, lend gravity to an otherwise vaudevillian display. ""Lulu Fellows"", an outwardly darker counterpart to ""Mountain Song"", succeeds for similar reasons, though perhaps glosses over the low-level tension which worked so well earlier. Ajemian accompanies a moaning Foster in the highly charged duet ""First Kiss"", and, whether wittingly or not, recalls Thom Yorke when in mid-high register. The other duet, ""Big Sky #4"", comes off similarly over-the-top, but in turn, Born Heller seem to acknowledge their own indulgent stage drama on melodically upbeat no-frills ditties like ""The Left Garden"" (""In the left garden, this dead bird is all I found""), and the two sparse harp-driven numbers, ""I Am a Guest in Here"" and ""Pansies, Will You Ever Grow?"". If one could characterize the rest of the debut as creepy, then ""Good Times"" is Born Heller's most terrifyingly beautiful nightmare, without question the album's standout track. While for the most part a distant co-presence, Foster's voice occasionally cannot help but nod to the chaos behind it: In this riveting soundstorm, strings screech in menacing atonal unison, and Foster's own mandolin manages some remarkable intermittent melodies. In just over two minutes, ""Good Times"" summarizes the degree of sound texture and honest melody Born Heller can squeeze not only out of such sparse instrumentation, but such deliberately honest composition as well. The paradox makes the duo's debut a particularly interesting grower-album, as the duo's most initially accessible melodies become increasingly problematic with increased rotation, and compellingly so.","Get used to hating it, because experimental folk has pretty much become the dancepunk of 2004.

Life on the Fly,Azita,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16a5e6ef9596932019e/1:1/w_160/ddda3ed5.jpg,2004-04-29 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/397-life-on-the-fly/,Drag City,"During one of America's periodic cocktail revivals, I peddled Connie Francis discs in the music section of a chain bookstore. For a while, the storewide promotion of non-raucous jazz, skinny cappuccinos, and other telltale tropes of now-sound bourgeois hep was funny and even engaging. But soon enough, the fixation on sparkly confetti, martini culture, and Miss Ann-Margret's ""13 Men"" inside a beige superstore grew awfully humiliating. I've avoided easy listening ever since. Imagine my surprise, then, upon discovering Azita's 2003 Drag City release Enantiodromia, on which Chicago no-wave icon Azita Youssefi traded the jagged energy of her early work with Scissor Girls and Bride of No No for boogie piano and jazzy lounge-- albeit mostly for Steely Dan fans and the punk-at-heart. A year later, she's returned with an even smoother mix. Despite its jarring approximation of the bubbly stuff, Life on the Fly is by no means an unchallenging album. Making use of the same adept back-up band as on Enantiodromia, the core trio consists of herself playing piano and singing, boyfriend John McEntire executing nimble rat-a-tat (as well as pristine mint-julep engineering) and Isotope 217 bassist Matt Lux contributing a sparse and tasteful low-end. The guest musicians share a similar Chicagoan pedigree: improvisational jazzman Aram Shelton blows alto sax and clarinet, while Tortoise's Jeff Parker and Rob Mazurek contribute sometimes over-the-top guitar and cornet intrusions. Like smokey torch singers of old, or Come vocalist Thalia Zedek with a subtle hint of Neko Case twang, Youssefi infuses vocal lines with unexpected over-enunciations and dramatic flourishes. Likewise, her dense songwriting offers flippant chord progressions and weird dynamics. For example, the buoyant opener, ""Wasn't in the Bargain"", takes Robert Johnson's crossroads to a barbecue where ol' Lucifer returns to collect his debt from a hapless bargainer: ""When the devil comes to take his pay/ You look into his eyes and know your sorrow/ Cursing that you never thought you'd see this day/ You didn't have to borrow."" Musically, it's Bruce Hornsby jamming to the Sea & Cake and Vince Guaraldi, but despite a couple cheesy turns-- including Jeff Parker's disconnected guitar solo and Youssefi's over-emphatic repetition of ""Well, I think that I will go""-- it's one of the album's better tracks. It'll take some picking and choosing, but if you give these tickled ivories a chance to seep into your pores, there are breezily erudite pop moments. In the meantime, shuffle past the busy approximation of a Dirty Dozen Brass cornet duel on ""Just Joker Blues"", ""Miss Tony""'s remarkable resemblance to a Muzak-y Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together"", and a few too many vocal grinds bringing on a blush like Billy Joel crashing his car while fatuously replaying some lost collaboration of ""Movin' Out"" with Twyla Tharp. Whatever the mishaps, Youssefi's making a transition into a new and complex phase of her already admirable career, and Life on the Fly's eccentric dose of ambition and indulgence in a sea of half-assed garage rock, out-folk and IDM turns an otherwise middling project into a post-no-wave musical worthy of repeat engagements.","During one of America's periodic cocktail revivals, I peddled Connie Francis discs in the music section of a chain ...

Morals and Dogma,Deathprod,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb76ea9e61561daa7249/1:1/w_160/5dbde1a5.jpeg,2004-04-29 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2554-morals-and-dogma/,Rune Grammofon,"Deathprod (aka Helge Sten) has spent over a decade tied into Oslo's music community, but his role is impossible to pin down: a performer and a producer, usually at the same time, Sten has worked on multimedia installations and rock concerts, remixes and live improvisation. He brought his ""audio virus""-- his mystery box of electronics and production techniques-- to rock band Motorpsycho in the early 90s, while today he's the fourth member of Supersilent, the non-jazzman who adds electronic jolts and subliminal ambience. He's both the band's nervous system, and its agitator. Rune Kristoffersen describes meeting Sten as a crucial event in the founding of his Rune Grammofon imprint, and Sten remains one of the label's key players. But Morals and Dogma is his first solo release for them, and it's part of a push that includes a box set, simply titled Deathprod, which collects some out-of-print and unreleased material. (Consumer warning: the set also includes this album.) Morals and Dogma's ominous, immersive tone may not surprise anyone who's encountered Deathprod before, but its purity and rigor are startling. Working with his audio virus and two guest musicians, Motorpsycho's Hans Magnus Ryan and the violinist and saw player Ole Henrik Moe, Sten has created four pieces that are gorgeously horrifying. Even when he makes kitschy or literal decisions-- implying dark rituals, naming a song ""Dead People's Things"", choosing a sleeve design that's as black as a coal pit in hell-- nothing detracts from the actual music. Reportedly, Sten often builds a piece out of a single source, and on ""Tron"", it seems to be a recording of wind-- variable and evolving, but trapped in a membrane to keep it from blowing disruptively free. The sounds of heavy footfalls and the increase in volume at the lowest registers make the track increasingly unsettling; if you listen to it with a subwoofer, you may respond the way your pets to do thunder. The few musical tones at the end, which chime like the sounding of a gong, are almost intrusive. When Sten uses an instrument or a found sound, he obscures the source, refusing to take advantage of any associations it brings. Although there are acoustic instruments on the album, he blurs the edges or manipulates the attack, keeping control of every detail of the timbre. For just one example, he uses a sound on ""Dead People's Things"" that resembles the suction tool you'd use to clean an aquarium. You can try to pick apart the sound of pebbles gurgling against the plastic, or the drone of streaming water, but the outlines blur before you can make out what it really is; and in the end, it may be something as basic as a stretched-out violin sample. ""Orgone Donor"", the most musical track, was actually written by Ryan and Moe. The piece unfurls on long, droning tones of rising pitch, and it's a break from the rest of the album: The only track here with a clear, simple shape, it's like a beacon of clarity against the amorphous dread around it. But by the time the record closes on ""Cloudchamber"", Sten has pulled you back into the fog. Calling the album ""immersive"" overlooks how much it pushes you away. The more you sink into the details, the more they assemble into something unsettling. It's hard to believe that Sten could perform this material when he plays this year's Sonar Festival in sunny Barcelona: A stern, cold wind will blow through whatever space he's playing, and the audience might wonder why the floor continues rumbling after he's left the stage.","Deathprod (aka Helge Sten) has spent over a decade tied into Oslo's music community, but his role is impossible ...

The Trial of the Century,French Kicks,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be26ea9e61561daa785f/1:1/w_160/ed65005a.jpg,2004-04-29 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3194-the-trial-of-the-century/,StarTime,"There are few topics more boring than the neo-New York sound of the new rock millennium, and few attacks less challenging than lobbing (more) half-assed jokes about skinny, over-privileged white boys sporting vintage t-shirts and pencil-leg Ramones jeans. As part of a burgeoning metropolitan scene heralded more for its influences than its innovations, the French Kicks have long been served their fair share of glib, mostly meaningless descriptors, most of which include some comment about their addresses, pants, or haircuts. By way of spiky L.E.S. fashion, or just via simple geography, the Kicks have always seemed to fit rather nicely into the Strokes/Interpol/Walkmen scene, despite not sounding a whole lot like any of those bands. Consider, then, how the French Kicks' heralded hometown has since become both the band's most efficient publicist and most formidable enemy: Fans of NYC new-wave pilfering inevitably flock towards them, but quickly figure out that, save their outfits, the French Kicks might as well be from anywhere-- and that, unfortunately, their music is just as expressionless. On their 2002 full-length debut, One Time Bells, the French Kicks gave up sloppy garage noodling for hyper-stylized post-punk, maintaining just enough of their scrappy beginnings to lend their first long-player some youthful punch. The Trial of the Century is a far more lush, lilting effort than its predecessor, ultimately destroyed by the monotony of its sweeping pop swells: Essentially, Trial is just one semi-interesting idea (retro-tinged, Smiths-influenced, synth-friendly rock) repeated 11 times-- and no matter how able or committed the French Kicks may be to that lone notion, their conviction alone can't make their sophomore record feel any less tedious. Falsetto harmonies, pumping synths, and stay-put vocals tumble out in waves, while Nick Stumpf's thunderous drumming and brother Lawrence's sticky bass push everything on and on and on. Opener ""One More Time"" is the record's most dynamic track, with bouncy, puttering percussion, gently yawning synths, giggly twitters, and fey, sighing vocals, while the almost-interesting ""Oh Fine"" starts off with hand-claps, melts into drums, and then kicks up a lowly bassline, Nick Stumpf's vocals gently sliding in to purr a gloriously high-pitched, ""We'll be fine/ She'll be fine/ He'll be fine,"" chorus. Meanwhile, ""The Falls"" wouldn't feel too out of place on The Strokes' Room on Fire, although Stumpf's vocals never quite reach Casablancan heights of bored disaffection. The insurmountable problem with the rest of the record is that most of the tracks feel entirely indistinguishable, their retro-styling and pompadour crooning melting into one giant song (see also some borderline formulaic quirks-- opening with prickly bits of percussion, or always building into high, harmonized choruses). The French Kicks shouldn't be forced to swallow the inevitable NYC-backlash alone, but The Trial of the Century doesn't help anyone argue that there's something new and compelling about low-idea retro-rock. Having already proven themselves capable players, all the French Kicks have to do now is figure out how to channel their skills into something a little more remarkable.","There are few topics more boring than the neo-New York sound of the new rock millennium, and few attacks less ...

Van Lear Rose,Loretta Lynn,by: Stephen Deusner,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc8c0084474cd0c2d95/1:1/w_160/ee343ff0.jpg,2004-04-29 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4961-van-lear-rose/,Interscope,"Like so many honky-tonk singers of her own and previous generations, Loretta Lynn was always a little country-come-to-town, a rural-raised girl in the big city whose pre-fame struggles lent her music grit and authenticity. Born in a Kentucky mining town called Butcher Hollow, a teenage bride and a mother several times over before she even arrived in Nashville, Lynn sang with a hill-country accent (notably different from typical Music Row stars) and with the unchecked candor of her toughening experiences. In this smoothly defiant voice, she sang of her man's and her own cheating ways, as well as the hardships of motherhood, wifehood, and celebrity as if each were one and the same-- and they probably were. In Nashville, she was a rough in the diamond: Her hard-edged songs like ""Fist City"" and ""Rated X"" were backed by pristine countrypolitan production-- mostly courtesy of Owen Bradley-- which helped sell her to a wide audience. At the same time, the disparity between her voice and her accompaniment created a fascinating rural/urban friction that never let listeners forget that she was less a superstar than a small-town girl at heart. Crucial to her image and her success, the depth of Lynn's noncelebrity is perhaps why her old material still bristles and burrs even today. On her new album, Van Lear Rose, producer and admirer Jack White (who dedicated White Blood Cells to Lynn in 2001) immediately erases that friction with a rawer, in-one-take live sound that adds texture to her songs without overpowering her voice. White's intention isn't to update or revise Lynn's music or her persona, but simply to recast her voice in a new setting, to make her sound like she's right back in Butcher Hollow. To this end, White has corralled a backing band that consists not of Nashville veterans, but of young 'uns from the decidedly non-rural locales of Detroit and Cincinnati. Dubbed the Do Whaters by Lynn (""I named them that because they got in there and did whatever we needed them to!"" she explains in the liner notes), the group consists of The Greenhornes' rhythm section Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler, with Blanche's Dave Feeny adding elegant pedal steel and slide guitar flourishes. Together, they prove a dynamic backing band, able to set a warm country atmosphere but not afraid to make some rock noise. And they do just that on the first single, ""Portland, Oregon"". Lynn and White exchange verses about sloe gin fizzes and drunk lovin', recalling her adultery duets with Conway Twitty but with more of a boisterous sound, courtesy of White's Zep blues riffs. On ""Mrs. Leroy Brown"", the band bang out a bar-stormer to match Lynn's adventures riding around town in a pink limousine. Even bigger than that limo, though, is the unmistakable smile on her face as she disses her man and his floozy: ""I just drawed all your money out of the bank today/ Honey, you don't have no mo'."" If Van Lear Rose recasts Lynn's sound, it also revisits the subject matter of her earlier hits, following her stories through to their sometimes dire ends in songs like ""Women's Prison"" and ""Family Tree"". But on the album's most memorable songs, Lynn tells her own story, singing in no other voice but her own, and it still soars with surprising grace and with all the sass and intimacy of her younger self. Most of Van Lear Rose is autobiographical, relating her life in both Butcher Hollow and Nashville with evocative detail and steady candor. The title track, for example, recalls her father's stories about her mother and ""how her beauty ran deep down to her soul."" Her voice trembles with a tender, nostalgic wistfulness, especially when she remembers how the miners teased her dad: ""You're dreamin', boy, she'll never look your way/ You'll never ever hold the Van Lear Rose."" After the spoken-word reminiscence ""Little Red Shoes"" and the devastating widow's lament ""Miss Being Mrs."", Van Lear Rose ends with ""Story of My Life"", which is exactly what its title purports. The coal miner's daughter happily relates the events of her life-- early marriage, motherhood, stardom-- leading up to the present, but instead of dwelling on hardship and tragedy, she sounds satisfied, even joyful. It's perhaps a testament to her modesty that she winds up this autobiography in less than three minutes, but by song's end, her contentment feels undeniably hard-won and admirable: ""I have to say that I've been blessed/ Not bad for a country girl, I guess."" Lynn's triumphant return on Van Lear Rose isn't exactly unprecedented: Ten years ago, Johnny Cash won a younger audience with the Rick Rubin-produced American Recordings, and George Jones, Merle Haggard, Dolly Parton, and Willie Nelson have all released strong albums late in their careers. Nor is it surprising that fans would flock to such sturdy music, that critics would celebrate such a comeback or pursue such a great story. But the rating above does not reflect critical sentiment as much as it does critical amazement: Van Lear Rose is remarkably bold, celebratory and honest. It's a homecoming for a small-town musician gifted with poise, humor and compassion, but at its very heart, it's happy to be just a kick-ass country record.","Loretta Lynn was always a little country-come-to-town, a rural-raised girl in the big city whose pre-fame struggles lent her music grit and authenticity.

Lycanthropy,Patrick Wolf,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa9313d1975652139a74/1:1/w_160/f4596cc7.jpg,2004-04-28 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8773-lycanthropy/,Tomlab,"Patrick Wolf certainly has his drooling admirers; not a glowering, baleful eye is cast on this 20-year-old on the first three pages of a Google search for his name. It's easy to see why. For one, the encumbering folklore that drags heavy about Wolf's skinny shoulders is intriguing in all the right ways: He casts himself as a neo-Dickensian laptop minstrel, a wandering electro-folk organ grinder, and a pacifist werewolf bent on a nomadic musical existence. Whether or not you buy into his mythology, though, his debut album confirms better reasons to check his music, not least of which is that the stockpile of personal issues he doles out here contains enough agony and energy to fuel the fires of several puberties. When Fat Cat Records discovered him four years ago, and saw fit to kit him out with his own mini-studio, he was just 16, but had already chalked up ten years of musicianship. He toured Europe with an orchestra, before going on to form the now-defunct punk band Maison Crimineaux in Paris. (The alias ""Patrick Wolf"" was conceived there shortly thereafter, with the assistance of a local clairvoyant.) And this impressive background has paid off with Lycanthropy, on which he wraps his folk-pop musings in lush blankets of violin, viola, harp and harpsichord, and tricks out the mix with aggressive electronic textures. His singing voice is fantastic as well, with a broad British accent recalling the caustic androgyny of Suede's Brett Anderson. Late British author Angela Carter played a formative role in Wolf's thematic development; her novel, The Brotherhood of the Wolf, inspired his lycanthropy obsession. Carter based much of her work on themes of adolescence embodied in erotic folklore metaphor, and here, Wolf occasionally paraphrases or condenses some of her passages in lyrics like, ""I was once a boy/ Until I cut my penis off/ And grew a hairy scar of stubborn fire."" But if his transformation from boy to wolf is complete, he's still marked by a mortal vulnerability-- a result of an unsettled childhood of bullying and rejection. ""A Boy Like Me"" is a perfectly sculpted pop song for the ubiquitous dissolute youth: ""A boy like me is told he is both nine and ninety/ And a boy like me should shut those books and join the army."" Alienation and teen misery are not rare commodities in music, but Wolf throws up such provocative contrasts (""I want total chaos/ And a holiday home in the east"") that his naivete often seems acknowledged-- possibly even a put-on-- just another undercurrent in the clever, serpentine narratives that guide us through this densely self-aware work. When Wolf brings his considerable sequencing skills to the forefront, Lycanthropy echoes Warp Records prodigy Chris Clark's raw and uncompromising 2000 release Clarence Park. But then, Wolf's influences are so numerous that if occasional snatches of Clark or Nick Cave or Joni Mitchell are briefly detected, they quickly give way to fusions of other artists, or combine to create a sound of their own. Meanwhile, the music itself is polarized and raw, with (naturally) lycanthropic juxtapositions of rustic/urban, ordered/chaotic, naive/cynical. It may be tempting for some to judge Wolf in terms of his age, but this would be doing a disservice to a lyricist of such courage. If any complaint could be lodged against Lycanthropy, it's that it sometimes lacks subtlety, as it's possessed by a heady, pubescent intoxication that can result in some indiscriminate vocalizing. Still, witnessing such breathless unraveling of the heart and such thoughtless conviction that never quite sounds arrogant is exhilarating-- not to mention rare. Indeed, with Lycanthropy, Wolf has constructed a themed record that deftly manipulates myths while brazenly striding into new, tumultuous territory. On the eve of his virgin U.S. tour this May, it would seem he has more in common with the Pied Piper than with Peter Pan, and his eerie playing will surely seduce many into his following.","Patrick Wolf certainly has his drooling admirers; not a glowering, baleful eye is cast on this 20-year-old on the first ...

Musicology,Prince,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a134c0084474cd0bfd5f/1:1/w_160/6473b070.jpg,2004-04-28 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6479-musicology/,ColumbiaNPG,"One of the first things a rock critic learns is not to emphasize the character on the other end of the speakers when reviewing records. This person, who is playing the tunes and singing the songs, isn't to be treated as a performer so much as the instigator of all the terrible/wonderful noise infesting the writer's world, and should be judged accordingly. That is, by the social rules of rock criticism, one shouldn't judge the musicians at all, merely their music-- and even then, only in terms of how it affects the writer, and in turn, how it might do the same for other listeners. The ""argument"" comes during the moments when you either agree or disagree with the writer's experience. The next thing writers learn is that just thinking of one's own experience isn't enough, because there's a whole world out there giving clues to the real value of the music. If music ""matters,"" it follows that its impact should be obvious outside the window; ""relevance"" is paramount at this stage of criticism, though since bitter humility is a daily part of any rock writer's life, it pays to phrase arguments stressing relevance in ways that don't obviously indicate its bias. This kind of criticism may seem harsh (and pretty unrelated to the actual musical experience), but it also shares much with traditional journalistic aims of reporting and immediate interpretation, and as such, is a method emphasized at most mainstream music pubs. All of this brings me to Prince and his latest album, Musicology. What happens when, by the two most common forms of writing about music, a legend comes out looking like a drastic underachiever? Do I dare call him out on this, especially after seeing many educated people pledge their written testimonies to this stuff? I've lived with this record for a few weeks now, and by any normal measure, I fail to see how anyone could seriously call it a comeback, or a return to his intimidating good form. But that's presumptuous: Despite the tried-and-true edicts of rock crit, there really is no accounting for taste, nor is Prince's extended absence from the top of the pops a concrete sign that he no longer matters. Yet, I know what I hear: an artist who is beyond condescending his interests to generate relevance. I hear someone who's honestly more concerned with the pristine state of his record collection than he is in buying all the latest hits. I hear someone who's probably worked out most of the bigger issues in life, and is satisfied to stay with a groove for its own sake, offering his take on things rather than arresting you with it. Prince has never been embarrassed of himself on record, but on Musicology, his direction only makes sense to me in the broadest sense of appreciating life and love. The revolution is over in this corner, and I'd bet it all he could care less what anyone thinks about it. Unfortunately, in this case, it translates to music that, while often pleasant, lacks the power of not only his best work, but also most of his successors' stuff. And since Prince's ""successors"" could be considered half of everything on the radio, it's tough for me to give him the benefit of the doubt. The most interesting moments on Musicology come when Prince either hits on a good concept (like the rich white girl who can't dance paying out for the ""funk"" in ""Illusion, Coma, Pimp and Circumstance"") or drops the pretense of keeping the party going altogether. Today, slow jams are his forte: the infidelity warning ""What Do U Want Me 2 Do?"" beats Phoenix at their own game with smoother-than-smooth vocals and a breezy chorus that would seem to close the book on anyone else attempting lite-jazz pop in the future. ""Call My Name"" is hardly as distinct, but is a perfectly functional slab of loverman soul along the lines of Marvin Gaye. Typically, Prince saves his best moves for the chorus (he's still pop, through and through), as his layered harmonies impart the rather straightforward admission, ""I know it's only been three hours, but I love it when you call my name."" Those songs seem a tier above others on Musicology partially because Prince isn't doing his one-man band thing. Despite that I've always thought it was cool to hear him make records mostly by himself, some of the songs here betray either a disinterest in fleshing out arrangements or an inability to pull them off. ""A Million Days"" has the structure of good Prince rock ballad, but the sound of half-finished demo. The synth that powers the opening sounds piped in from a home studio built about 20 years ago, and even then it's not loud enough. His guitar and vocals are lavishly spread all over the mix, but the drums are too soft and muddy, so ultimately his track comes out like a bad Lenny Kravitz throwaway. Elsewhere, ""Life O' the Party"" and the title track suggest nothing in Prince's life these days was born this century. Not only does he waste valuable time on the former making fun of Michael Jackson, but the track is mired in stale funk a notch below the Martin theme. ""Cinnamon Girl"" is the best straight rock track on Musicology, not only because its production is on par with Prince's typically well-crafted hooks, but also because it manages to keep all the details in check via relatively simple performance. Prince's grasp is hardly lacking throughout, but for various reasons, his reach comes up short many times. ""If Eye Was the Man in Ur Life"" starts out as an incredible jam with metal guitar, a tight, slow beat (not played by Prince) and a glorious harmonized verse melody, before bogging down at the end with some kind of be-bop thing right out of a Blood, Sweat & Tears song. I'm all for experimentation, but this seems more like a bad case of mid-song boredom and a lack of anything better to do. The worst part is that Musicology is probably the best Prince album since at least the ""symbol"" album from 1992, and possibly since Sign O' the Times. But that's misleading, since this album isn't close to Sign's league-- it's also depressing to think he hasn't made a great record in over 15 years. But don't take my word for it; look out the window, see if any of your friends are jamming to this. Failing that, chart your own experience in your own headphones. By either measure, despite a few good moments, I'm missing Prince now more than ever.","One of the first things a rock critic learns is not to emphasize the character on the other end of ...

Playtight,Foreign Legion,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be8d5e6ef9596932327e/1:1/w_160/1833d064.jpg,2004-04-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3294-playtight/,Look,"Rap artists bent on party atmospheres are always a tricky proposition. Most end up progressing towards more positive, ""enlightened"" styles (De La Soul, Jurassic 5) while others fall for the promise of financial success allowed by the party rap platform (Black Eyed Peas). But in the case of Foreign Legion, the listener isn't inclined to care either way. From the outset of their second record, Playtight, we're immediately made aware that this ""fun rap"" isn't actually rap-intensive, or even fun, for that matter. Prozack, DJ Design and Marc Stretch encompass Foreign Legion, a group best known for their explosive live show (I've heard tales of Prozack rapping out of Stretch's backpack) and a lackadaisical musical style. To be fair, they do pull off the party vibe pretty well, translating on record like a bunch of drunk fat guys leading the soiree from the balcony. Unfortunately, they also rap just like him. Over the course of the album, you'll hear embarrassing falsetto choruses, various ""style changes"" (poor homages to their commercial influences) and most frequently, incredibly offbeat rapping. What's surprising is the locale from which Foreign Legion hails. Considering that California has been a breeding ground for the most amusing, innovative and exciting fun rappers of our generation (Hieroglyphics, Freestyle Fellowship, The Pharcyde, Quannum), you'd expect them to have some semblance of charisma. They can incorporate the whitest faux-soul imaginable, put on silly voices and recite amateurish verses (""My crew comes tighter than masturbating with vice grips!""; ""You could be a butler but ain't no way that you're serving me!""; ""The whole club looks like a bunch of Pez dispensers!""), but they also lack flow, delivery, and any sense of likability. Half the problem with the record is the ridiculously bad production. Other than problems like lyrical nonsense and lame rappers, the reason groups that have a similar aesthetic (Cunninlyguists, Ugly Duckling) end up with better results is ultimately down to the beats that frame the music. From the Tom Jones-inspired ""It's Working"" (cut atop soap opera piano stabs and a corny synth bounce), to the lazy electro throb of ""Happy Drunk"", to the wanky wah-wah pedal and clavinet of ""Voodoo Star"", the results are wholly unlistenable . DJ Design lists his equipment in the liner notes before the lyrics to each song, but in this case, it looks like his laundry list of gear is worth a lot more than he is. So what did I like about the album? The beats for ""Bring It"" and ""Party Crashers"" are tolerable. And Marc Stretch rhymes a lot of words in his bars. Oh yeah, and when Prozack said that he ""rocks an O.J. Simpson jersey,"" I giggled. I guess that's about it. All I have left to ask is: What exactly would possess someone to pay money for this? Which is where you come in: If you or someone you know owns this album, I ask you to email me with the exact reason this record came into possession. If this is supposed to be a representation of the future of underground rap, sign me up for my old school revivalism.","Rap artists bent on party atmospheres are always a tricky proposition.

Random Harvest,Friends of Dean Martinez,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be32abf31b7dc71560f0/1:1/w_160/3cf9c766.gif,2004-04-28 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3205-random-harvest/,Narnack,"Antarctica is a desert. At first blush it seems illogical-- the place is covered with ice and snow, after all-- but huge swaths of the continent receive less precipitation in a year than the Mojave. In my mind, this is an interesting factoid in and of itself, but in terms of this review it would be useless if it didn't relate directly to the direction Friends of Dean Martinez have taken lately. And it does. The Friends built their name on capturing the open air and empty expanse of the American Southwest in their high, lonesome sound. Every drumbeat was a fence post eroded by wind-blown dust, the organs were the lengths of barbed wire and the illusion of water on the horizon, while Bill Elm's steel guitar was the open sky, blistering in the sun and frigid at night. As members came and went, the band shifted further from the sun-fried day and deeper into the mysterious desert night, crafting a sound over two recent albums-- A Place in the Sun and On the Shore-- that seethed with escaping heat and nocturnal energy. Now, with Random Harvest, they call to mind a place of utter desolation, a place that feels more like the desert on the bottom of the world than the desert outside Tucson. Mind you, there's still a heaping helping of the Old West here, but when the band reaches for the cold on songs like ""The Winter Palace"" and ""Why Does My Heart Go on Beating?"" they wind up in a deep freeze. ""Why Does My Heart Go on Beating?"" sounds as though it were mastered from vinyl, with its crackling surface noise, and the creeping mass of echoing pings and skin-tighteningly cold drones. ""The Winter Palace"" is more structured, resting on an ice sheet of humming Moog bass and smeared organ and synth while nylon-stringed guitar wanders through the landscape trying to find its way. Elsewhere, the guys find themselves in more familiar territory, opening the title track with a plaintive string theme that the drums only sweep aside as they usher in Elm's steel and Mike Semple's arid electric guitar. If Elm and Semple's guitars dance with each other in complex melodic interplay on ""Random Harvest"", then they spar openly on ""Ripcord"", Semple's tone dripping with acid and Elm's steel sporting ragged distortion. ""Dusk"" plays like the approach-- and finally, the arrival-- of a torrential desert storm, building on the horizon with thunderheads and lightning, and finally gushing buckets as the band reaches a climax. And that's not even the best stuff. They save that for the end, with the skywalking waltz ""Lost Horizon"", resplendent with majestic slide work and a gorgeous acoustic guitar solo, and the astral lament ""Nowhere to Go"". On that final track, Elm's steel searches the heavens, grounded by glockenspiel and acoustic guitar flourishes, but the song comes crashing to earth for Semple's ferocious multi-tracked guitar solo. Semple's playing suggests that the random harvest of the album title might one of souls by angry gods rather than a reaping of grain by humans with threshers. And with that, Friends of Dean Martinez have done it again, crafting an album of absorbing texture and rending grace. Random Harvest isn't quite as stunning as A Place in the Sun or On the Shore, but it's close, and besides, equaling the majesty of either of those records is a tall order. Either way, it's a fine testament to the fact that our driest, emptiest expanses can also be some of the most beautiful.","Antarctica is a desert.

Rare Wood,Sunburned Hand of the Man,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ac5e6ef95969320b6d/1:1/w_160/f36f59e2.jpg,2004-04-28 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7570-rare-wood/,Spirit of Orr,"Welcome to Massachusetts. Life goes on here irrespective of the outside world. It's all one big long Bohemian vacation, where bushy beards and handrolled cigarettes are protocol. The laws are different here than elsewhere; take, for instance, the painted crosswalks, designated points in the street at which one may cross at any time, regardless of traffic lights, at the bequest of penal-code-abiding motorists. Billboards are rare. Outside of Boston, there are no news tickers to update locals on the truly fucked-up shit an average hour brings. And if there were, no one would pay attention anyway. At least that's how I see things when I visit. Sunburned Hand of the Man might have a TV, or occasionally peruse The Berkshire Eagle, but my money says they don't. The Massachusetts free-folk collective is too busy making bizarre, limited-press albums and engaging a formidable cult following to do otherwise. Oddly enough, in eight years as a band, Sunburned Hand have never before released a CD, eschewing accessibility both physically and intellectually. Rare Wood is the group's first foray into formal studio recording, which is both good and bad news for fans of the group. Gone are the handpacked hemp protective sleeves, replaced by the infinitely more mundane digipak, in exchange for the much wider availability a studio issue offers. Sadly, that availability isn't fully capitalized upon, as Rare Wood will likely only appeal to the band's ardent stable of fans. Newcomers would be far better off seeking out one of the group's mysterious CD-R or vinyl-only releases through rare-records vendors such as Ecstatic Yod. To be frank, Rare Wood simply pales in comparison to many of the group's previous releases, especially Headdress or Wild Animal. Where those records were harsh, but also tuneful and emotive, Rare Wood is, well, mainly harsh. Bestial vocals play a more prominent role on this album than elsewhere in the group's discography, and as a result, the expansive milieu of guitar, bass, found sound, and oddball percussion that has come to epitomize the band's sound is muzzled in favor of a more confrontational approach. Though the record might seem to fall in fairly close proximity to Sunburned Hand's other work, and marks no significant departure from their organic free-folk logotype, it fails to live up to better work from the group's LP series. ""Shitless"", alone, from Headdress, packs more melody than Rare Wood's entirety. Unless you've got an ear for particularly strident music, vocals that sound like nothing so much as Andre the Giant spooning molasses probably won't sit too well in your stomach. Some might argue that that's the point, but on prior outings, the band managed to sound as immersive as they were acerbic. That elemental blend of bitter and sweet is what has made the group's best work so enjoyable. Here, it's hard to ignore the caustic stream-of-conciousness vocals and just appreciate the seductive, primeval freakout happening in the background. Rare Wood does pack a scant handful of instrumental passages in its curt 42-minute runtime that recall the strength of the group's earlier work. As the paranoid opener ""Easy Wind"" fades into ""Gyp Hawkin'"", along with it go the glottal squeals, and the subsequent ten minutes are pleasantly reminiscent of the band's better moments. ""Gyp Hawkin'"" expands upon the amorphous instrumental rambling of the band's earlier material by featuring sparse organ swells and haphazard bursts of synthesizer. Texturally, it's by far this album's most affable moment, due in no small part to its lack of vocals. Unfortunately, the similar, centerpiece-length ""Glass Boot"" fails to diverge from Rare Wood's central instrumental motifs, and is overpowered by more jarring vocal jabs. ""Buried Pleasure"", the album's abrupt closer, feels like a beginning to a new piece, rather than a summation of one to which it has no discernable stylistic connection. When a band releases 14 albums in three years, as Sunburned Hand of the Man have since 2001, it's unrealistic to expect them to be on the money every time. Rare Wood wouldn't be such a disappointment if it were just another one of the myriad homespun release in the tumescent Sunburned Hand catalog, instead of the band's first album proper. As it stands, the album is a landmark document for a group whose career has been shrouded by isolation and mystery. Beyond that, however, its interest is marginal.","Welcome to Massachusetts.

"I, Lucifer",The Real Tuesday Weld,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21f13d19756521387c5/1:1/w_160/91c27b0b.jpg,2004-04-27 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6703-i-lucifer/,Six Degrees,"Steven Coates must spend a lot of time swimming through the currents of his unconscious. A few years ago, Coates awoke from a dream certain he had been 1930s jazz dandy Al Bowlly and 60s cult actress Tuesday Weld in the nocturnal presence; that day he adopted a new name, sidetracked a career in the visual arts, and began to make modern music that drew inspiration from classic European cabaret and throwback romanticism. With I, Lucifer, Coates, under nom-de-chanson (The Real) Tuesday Weld, draws the listener deep into a scratchy, sepia-toned fantasy that first suggests the gap between boozy, swinging ragtime, sophisticated lounge poetics, and innovative beat technique, then bridges it in one swooning swoop. Besides its musical dexterity and pastiche of divergent styles, I, Lucifer is interesting for the fact that it's the soundtrack to English author Glenn Duncan's novel of the same name. The story is the devil's first-person account of his attempt at redemption by spending a month in the all-too-human body of down-and-out author Declan Gunn (hello, anagram?) without committing grievous sin. Though clearly the CD and the book don't match up song by page, they both evoke the same wry British humor and sense of inevitable, tragic love, making for a unique intellectual experience that gets through to the heart via the head. It's a pretty grandiose prospect that surprisingly never settles into self-conscious preciousness or pseudo-scholarly pomp, revealing instead a consistently alluring narrative vision. Writing and producing I, Lucifer's self-styled ""antique beat"" variety act, Coates also enlists some interesting secondary players, such as veteran British musical comedian Earl Okin on ""Bathtime in Clerkenwell"". ""Bathtime"", the album's most sweeping, memorable number-- something like a breakbeat ""Belleville Rendezvous""-- layers Okin's rustic, gonzo scat over a manic rimshot and cymbal rhythm, and slips bright, swelling brass under Aphex Twin effects in an era-twisting Gramophones-to-headphones mashup. This song gives Coates' introduction to the surreal, intriguing dream world of (The Real) Tuesday Weld, and it's an improbable stunner. Coates' vocal delivery is of the subdued, Gainsbourgian variety-- he hardly sings, instead relying on his whispery, melodic cadence and a natural, naked delivery on songs like ""(Still) Terminally Ambivalent Over You"" and ""The Ugly and the Beautiful"", which exemplifies I, Lucifer's lyrical sensibility: ""The drugs just ain't enough/ Though I like the way they made us crazy/ But love's the only drug/ That turns the ugly into the beautiful."" Bolstering the vocal element, the Tiger Lilies' Martyn Jacques lends his crisp, quivering croon to the bittersweet ""Someday (Never)"" and French singer/guitarist David Guez fills the Gallic quotient with the tender acoustic ballad ""La Bete Et La Belle"". With the help of Scottish alt-jazz chanteuse Pinkie McClure, Coates moves from ethereal anxiety on the Badalamenti-esque ""One More Chance"" to his own slick, RZA-darkened Brit-hop rap on ""The Life and Times of the Clerkenwell Kid"". ""The Eternal Seduction of Eve"", meanwhile, falls somewhere between a buoyant hip-hop bump and Air's vast spaces, with Coates lamenting like a lovelorn Joe Frank, ""From the Brooklyn Bridge to St. Petersburg/ And every boardroom or boudoir across the world/ From the fall of Rome to the Renaissance/ Through reformation, Cold War, Vietnam/ I'm waiting for you to notice me."" Like any superior story, the variety of moods and settings I, Lucifer spans is inspiring. Coates not only has the grand imagination and facile wit necessary to build an evocative fictional world, but he's got the musical prowess to keep the plot moving forward without leaving the listener behind. An album worth reading.","Steven Coates must spend a lot of time swimming through the currents of his unconscious. A few years ago, Coates ...

Ratatat,Ratatat,by: Loren Ludwig & Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fcc0084474cd0c018f/1:1/w_160/69bf3519.jpg,2004-04-27 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6913-ratatat/,XL,"As French monks discovered centuries ago while under gothic spires, there is nothing like the sweep and pulse of intertwining melodies to lend momentum to music. Their melodic lines would twist along, gathering dissonances that would eventually explode against their rhythms into warm, open intervals. But back in those days, they didn't have drum machines to pull their lines into orbit. Ratatat does, and it gives their music an epic quality that would send any monk into fits of orgiastic glee. Ratatat is a collaboration between lead guitarist Mike Stroud and bedroom producer Evan Mast, with piercing sheets of guitar and synthesizer yoked to a bass-heavy metronomic grid. The project marks a new direction for both musicians: Evan Mast's 2001 debut as E*vax, Parking Lot Music, was a stroll through a collection of debris both sleek and gritty, while Mike was known for ripping it up on stage with Ben Kweller and Dashboard Confessional. With Ratatat, however, the pair establishes a plush, crisp sonic space, and then holds court there for a good three quarters of an hour. Theirs is an imperial presence, somewhere near the crossroads of rock, electronic and hip-hop. Though their songs are pop-length, and each is bound to get stuck in your head, these are not actually songs in the conventional sense. There are no vocals, for one thing, and they grow from point A to point B without looking back over their shoulder for a chorus. While the album is a home studio creation, most of the material begs to strut on stage for a hungry crowd. Indeed, what we have here is a long-awaited stepchild of IDM and hair metal sensibilities, joined by the omnivorous appetite of hip-hop. And Ratatat is hip-hop. For starters, ""Lapland"" and ""Breaking Away"" feature the sort of spacious, head-nodding beats that fuel freestyle fantasies, and recently led the duo to a mixtape collaboration with Wu-Tang's Buddha Monk. The two waifish Crown Heights boys also sprinkle their album with samples of local rap veteran Young Churf, who starts out the album with a sly boast: ""I've been rapping for about 17 years, okay? I don't write my stuff anymore. I just take it from my head..."" So it begins. The opener, ""17 Years"", is heavy artillery singed with the roar and crackle of distorted power chords. But it has a change of heart halfway through, wandering from the guitar-rock battlefield to graze on bittersweet, twilit pastures. ""El Pico"" cultivates a brighter kind of melancholy. Layered with scraping percussion, sweet electric piano figures, wiry synthesizers, and even an old accordion, it sets a tone that somehow manages to be intimate and epic at the same time. Ratatat is also good old-fashioned rock. ""Desert Eagle"" has a sing-songy quality that explains why so many people have been trying to put words to these tunes since Mast and Stroud started performing together as Cherry last year. But if ""Desert Eagle"" promises an indie rock ballad, it soon turns into a towering arena-rock anthem that delivers a healthy dose of Brian May. There is, after all, more than a little Queen in Ratatat's sound, which, when paired with Evan's husky, meticulous beats, results in a surprisingly buoyant thrash that delivers on the promise of early rock/rap crossovers. The duo's debut tends towards harmonic saturation, folding over you with great swaths of guitar and synthesizer. Unsurprisingly, the effect is intensely pleasurable, giving the album a warm and almost amniotic sense of immediacy. But a womb can also be a prison. Despite the risk of claustrophobia, Ratatat keep the oxygen flowing with well-proportioned chord cycles backed by spare, expansive beats. In soaring like a motet yet pounding like cavalry-- or, in modern terms, in ripping like Jimi but bumping like Dre-- Ratatat deliver on the ancient promise that harmony and rhythm, often set against each other in the history of Western music, are really just facets of one another.","As French monks discovered centuries ago while under gothic spires, there is nothing like the sweep and pulse of intertwining ...

The Well of Memory,P.G. Six,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6699d034d5c69bf3523/1:1/w_160/e6440963.jpg,2004-04-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7755-the-well-of-memory/,Amish,"Sometimes it's hard to believe there even is a rural America anymore. When you spend months at a time without leaving the city and suburbs you get so used to pavement and manicured lots that it starts to look normal, as though there never was any prairie or forest there to begin with. While the sprawl I'm used to is Chicago, Patrick Gubler is similarly incubated from the natural world in New York City, but he's somehow managed to keep in touch with the backwoods and dirt roads that make up the parts of America in which most of us have never resided. Since exiting Tower Recordings to cut albums on his own as P.G. Six, he's crafted a deeply naturalistic sound rooted in the early 70s progressive folk of the British Isles, with room for diversions into abstract expressionist interludes. The Well of Memory is Gubler's second album as P.G. Six, and it treads similar ground to his debut, opening with a creepy/pretty harp improvisation and dialing up Pentagle, Steeleye Span and Magna Carta from there with a clutch of songs and instrumentals that wouldn't sound out of place in the score for a new cinematic adaptation of MacBeth. Gubler plays a mean Renaissance Faire guitar, and his even, earthy croon helps keep the fog from blowing too far off the moors. The opening title track is a lengthy harp improvisation that sounds played on an open-tuned instrument, which Gubler plucks and strums, the lower strings ringing with a guttural quality that clouds the sound with overtones. He revisits this approach twice more on the album, which is unfortunately twice too much, as it's easy to lose interest during these meandering passages. He slips free-folk elements like these into a lot of the more conventional songs to better effect, winding down ""Come In/The Winter It Is Past"" with a prolonged passage of droning buzz, while his hovering electric guitar lights fire to ""Crooked Way""'s entrancing acoustic folk. The most traditional song Gubler offers is ""The Old Man on the Mountain"", a narrative ballad so simply worded and old-school that I'm surprised Smithsonian Folkways hasn't picked up the publishing rights. Over his fluttering acoustic, he falls asleep by the roadside and dreams of walking up the mountain finding an old man living among the remnants of a past settlement. Closer ""The Weeping Willow"", with backing vocals from Helen Rush, sounds almost ancient with its spare acoustic guitar and piano arrangement, while ""Considering the Lateness of the Hour"" is a hill gnome freakout with guitars melting and running like slag over plunking hand drums and shaker. Unfortunately, the album's scattered peaks aren't enough to overcome a general sense of aimless drift that hangs over the album as a whole-- the songs have a tendency to slip by unnoticed if you start doing even the most minor thing while listening. Fans of P.G. Six's debut, Parlor Tricks & Porch Favorites, should be pleased with this effort, as the two albums are extremely similar, but this is primarily recommended for only the most intrepid fans of the recent free-folk explosion.","Sometimes it's hard to believe there even is a rural America anymore.

9pm at GFM,Gaji,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bed7abf31b7dc71561f0/1:1/w_160/45d7ab34.gif,2004-04-26 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3375-9pm-at-gfm/,Inoxia,"Gaji's most recent album didn't exactly make them household names in the U.S., which is no surprise considering that they've yet to play in America or even release a record outside of Japan. The few of you who might have heard them wouldn't be surprised to hear me compare them favorably to bands such as Fugazi or classic Wire or Gang of Four. Other names to drop would be concert partners The Locust, Ruins, and Melt-Banana. So, do they sound like a mathy punk band to you yet? Well, that's not exactly the case: Yui Kimijima's grinding, wiry guitar figures ensure that you know exactly where they're coming from, just as Chisaki Taguchi's drumming spikes like broken mirror shards. Yet they aren't spastic or crazy or whatever Japanese post-post-punk bands are supposed to be. They're a band like any other you might listen to-- I only imagine they're not household names because most people haven't been introduced to them yet. Of course, Gaji haven't made it very easy for people outside of Japan to find them: In order to find their records you have to search strange, scary Japanese distro sites (or worse, ask Japanophiles like me about them). I guess this harkens back to punk's original days when word-of-mouth meant as much or more than what the media was telling you; but in 2004, word-of-mouth seems about 1,000 times slower than an Internet connection. So, please meet Gaji: Surely one of the best bands you haven't heard. 9pm at GFM is Gaji's fourth full-length release, and was recorded live at the Tokyo club Grapefruit Moon. It's not really a ""live album""-- there's no audience and all but one of the songs is new. The band, despite initiating a new bassist, sticks fairly close to the sound of their prior releases: tight, angular guitar figures over almost-but-not-quite unhinged drumming. Another way of putting it is that they play downtrodden post-punk at the speed of muso hardcore-- tense as hell, but not devoid of emotion. In fact, 9pm improves on their most recent album, Ten to Ten Past Ten, in its efficient use of dissonance and concise aggression, using these traits as painters use blacks and whites to sharpen archetypes. Opener ""Sand"" begins as tentative amp fuzz and deceptive, subtle ebb from Kimijima. When the full band enters like a jackhammer locomotive, it's clear this will be no ambient affair. As it happens, though, the song is relatively low-key. Vocalist Yuko Hasegawa intones passive protest with her lines. I have no idea what she's saying (no lyric sheet is included), but she sounds pretty tired of something or someone. Just as Yasuko O's vocals do for Melt-Banana, Hasegawa's blunt admissions serve as iron fist rhythm as much as melody. As the bass grinds below, Hasegawa bleats like a cold lion, leaving very little to chance. I don't normally go for the desensitized thing in vocals, but she wears it well and, in turn, helps make music that might otherwise lapse into pseudo-metal grandeur come out a bit more broken. In short, she has a cool voice. ""Jagg"" speeds up the tempo, but wisely trades out tension for a major mode. Still, Hasegawa's low range utterances suggest dissonance even as the band surges forth like Can introduced to the industrial age. Similarly, the noir (yet propulsive) indie balladry of ""Fire in Hands"" would beg for melodrama along the lines of the most grotesque soul baring of Courtney Love, but Gaji stick close to a black curtain. It stays soft when they're supposed to go soft-loud-soft, and Hasegawa stays gray when she's supposed to be florescent and anxious. I wouldn't ordinarily think subtlety and introversion would be great qualities for a band like this, but they make it seem obvious. And yes, when the super loud stuff happens later on, it fucking kills. So if Gaji are so great, etc., etc. Well, I can complain about the sound of this release. Live albums are nice and all, but when your stock in trade is playing intricate riffs, while the vocalist has a dark-toned alto rather than a piercing falsetto, a proper studio mix is in order. As it stands, Ten to Ten Past Ten is still the best introduction to the group, but 9pm at GFM suggests that not only are these guys and gals for real, they're practically slept on.","Gaji's most recent album didn't exactly make them household names in the U.S., which is no surprise ...

Here Comes Love,Superpitcher,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6685e6ef95969320d1b/1:1/w_160/0c677358.jpg,2004-04-26 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7753-here-comes-love/,Kompakt,"From the bubbling warmth of his 2001 breakout track ""Heroin"" to his sympathetic click-house remix of Dntel's ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"", Superpitcher's Aksel Schaufler has always been Kompakt Records' resident softie. While his string of one-offs for various twelves, remixes, and Kompakt-branded compilations over the years have proven him master over all the Cologne label's chosen elements (microhouse, schaffel, pop), somewhere along the line he began to imbue his Superpitcher tracks with a warmth that made them unmistakably his. Here Comes Love marks Schaufler's long-anticipated debut full-length and affords him the opportunity to tease out the gushy, starlit house template that his output has so far suggested. Opulent and lovestruck, it's a stunning record, not just for the way it decorates the Cologne sound with orange-y hues and elastic textures, but for the way it integrates them with a whole mess of newly introduced elements-- ambient collage, cabaret, and even glam. We begin as we will finish, between the sheets. Crisp and clear, the seductive ""People"" drifts along on a watery bell loop, a clipped 2/4 beat and a lonely mellotron line while Schaufler whirs sweet nothings that eventually collapse under a tangle of limpid bell tones. As opening tracks go, it's a gorgeous beginning: surefooted, simple, and sweet. What follows, however, is indisputably the album standout: With its bright schaffel beat and scuffled loops, ""The Long Way"" begins with a nervous edge, constrained by its stuttering rhythm. Schaufler toys with that tension for a few minutes before introducing a piano line that diffuses it into thin air. It's a subtle tweak but a beautiful one nonetheless, the kind of minuscule detail that makes all the difference in the world when songs are as wide open and as spacious as these. The three-minute ""Sad Boys"" is our first hint that Schaufler may have more up his sleeve than just lovey variations on the Kompakt theme. It's also the beginning of a four-song suite that sees him completely abandon anything resembling a house beat. Over a moody, two-chord organ loop and a spliced-up samba rhythm, Schaufler cops a trick from Roxy Music and goes straight for the elegantly overblown. ""We ain't going nowhere 'cause... we don't go nowhere,"" he whispers. ""'Cause... we stay right here 'cause... we are... sad boys for life."" From there, Schaufler jumps headlong into the shimmering cabaret of ""Träume"", the only one of the album's nine tracks to feature vocals by someone (Charlotte Roche) other than Schaufler. Destined to become the mid-morning centerpiece in many a summertime DJ set, ""Träume""'s plastic, Casiotone production and brooding, Weill-influenced melody line mark Here Comes Love's dramatic high point. And that's when things briefly go off the rails. The next two songs-- ""Love Me Forever"" and an ill-advised cover of the pop standard ""Fever""-- are the album's low points. With its jerky organ line and absent-minded melodies, the former is a beatless, aimless mess that temporarily breaks the spell. ""Fever"" isn't quite as bad, but it does come across as clumsy and unnecessarily campy, as if Schaufler didn't trust that his original material would be enough to help us to locate his reference points. However, not only does the album's final third restore the momentum, it also marks Schaufler's faithful return to deep, surging house. Framed by a mixed bag of submerged synth sounds and clanging chimes, the moody ""Lover's Rock"" lumbers out of the gate before settling into a nice trot. Better still is ""Happiness"", which, with its stomach-tugging electric keyboard vamp and gothic stringscape, counts as the record's rushiest six minutes. Rather than closing out with a bang, the bittersweet disco shuffle of ""Even Angels"" unfurls itself gently, like a wool blanket coming undone, with a celestial reverb drone piece that accounts for at least eight of the track's 14 minutes. Vaporous and sweet, it's a more appropriate end to Schaufler's doe-eyed ruminations than any clubfloor banger could've been. Instead of sending us home with an abrupt kick out the backdoor, it lovingly parachutes us back to earth and then vanishes in a puff of goodwill. In spite of its slight missteps, Here Comes Love is a beautifully textured, well-paced and sweepingly romantic record, the kind that has the swoony 18-year old in me conjuring twilight raves and beachfront campfire scenes in my head. Executed with a subtlety that the uninitiated might mistake for simplicity, it's also convincing proof that few artists are as gifted as Aksel Schaufler when he's got his warm jets on. Summer starts today.","From the bubbling warmth of his 2001 breakout track ""Heroin"" to his sympathetic click-house remix of Dntel's\n\ ""(This ...

Why does this matter? Well, it doesn't to you-- at least not directly-- but it's still something to think about. While you're waiting for the Jiffy Lube crew to finish up your oil and filter change, any number of life-and-death struggles are occurring in the animal kingdom; from the bat chasing the moth to the lion in pursuit of the bongo, and all the way back to my favorite evolutionary holdover-- the nautilus-- mindlessly plucking lives much tinier than itself from the sea, living on perpetual autopilot. This album reminded me of the nautili, as much of it conjures the echoing of distant sound through huge stretches of water, albeit with some crunchy drum machines added for good measure. Australian sound sculptor John Chantler has his way with sines and sawtooths on Monoke, concocting pieces with a sense of drift worthy of the continental plates. ""Play. Play."" moves in shuddering waves over twittering programmed percussion, a wash of rounded sound. The middle of the record is especially aquatic, with the lava-lamp bubbling of ""Autu"" and ""Vendor"". The latter is like listening to the sonar pulse of a modern submarine. A thumping kick drum and something similar to a dot-matrix noise join deep-space pings and rhythmic, muffled returns, forming a truly otherworldly piece of music. It's somewhat reminiscent of John Chowning's 1970s experiments with early FM synthesis that yielded a series of surprisingly accessible, enveloping soundscapes. ""Slow Closure"" ends the record in a mid-Pacific abyss of reverb and hollow, pulsing sound. Monoke is ultimately an album that falls about halfway between outright pop and outright minimalism: accessible but not exactly melodic, and simple without being especially sparse. There are times when the liquid sonics don't flow as smoothly as they could. In particular, ""Personal Rock"" is too thin an electronic wheeze, but on balance Monoke makes a nice slice of post-millennial electronica.","Somewhere, deep in the vast blackness of the middle ocean, nautili are scuttling through the darkness, skimming tiny creatures and ...

Music Has the Right to Children,Boards of Canada,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a8dcb6db366e0276e71e3bb/1:1/w_160/Boards-of-Canada-Music.jpg,2004-04-26 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/838-music-has-the-right-to-children/,WarpWarp,"Sometimes an album is so good and makes its case so flawlessly that it spawns a mini-genre of its own and becomes shorthand for a prescribed set of values. The Velvet Underground's third and Miles Davis' Bitches Brew are two older records that spring to mind, and I'd toss in Spiderland as well. It's not a long list, but somewhere on it belongs Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children. Earlier this month, Warp Records reissued Music Has the Right to Children worldwide, adding the bonus track ""Happy Cycling"" (which we Americans with our Matador-licensed copies have always known as the album closer) and redesigning the cover art as a foldout digipak. It's always a bit strange when an album is reissued when it has not, in any sense, ever gone away. How could we possibly have forgotten about Music Has the Right to Children when the sound Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin created here is still the predominant inspiration in IDM? And yet, here we are, new package and new marketing push. Even so, six years after its original release is as good as any time to look into why Music Has the Right to Children has resonated so strongly. Boards of Canada's sound was not wholly original. Seeds of it can be found in Eno, Aphex Twin (in a big way), The Orb, and all over the home listening electronic scene that sprang up in the wake of Warp's Artificial Intelligence compilation. Boards used drum machines, samplers, and an unfathomable collection of analog and digital synths, like others in their sphere. Their chords were typically gauzy ambient, their beats head-nodding downtempo. Properly speaking, they invented nothing. And yet, the parts had never come together quite like this. The first thing to note is that Music Has the Right revealed Boards of Canada to be geniuses with texture, where god is in the details. The incredibly simple melody of the short ""Bocuma"" becomes a lump-in-the-throat meditation on man's place in the universe through subtle pitchshifts and just the right mist of reverb. The slow fade-in on ""An Eagle in Your Mind"" is the lonesome sound of a gentle wind brushing the surface of Mars moments after the last rocket back to Earth has lifted off. The long history of the electric piano was nothing but a lead-in to the tone Boards used on ""Turquoise Hexagon Sun"", the perfect evocation of a happy walk through the woods in an altered state. Every IDM artist since has at least once labored over their modular unit to get a patch that sounds like one of the many brilliant sounds found here. Boards of Canada had released some singles and two EPs previous to this record's release, material which showed that they'd already developed their sound. But with Music Has the Right to Children, the duo set out to make a proper album, and approached the album from a rock perspective, carefully mixing and editing the track sequence, while drafting interludes and tightly restricting the palette. You aren't likely to hear more subtly effective layering of sounds on any electronic record in the last 10 years: Music Has the Right to Children is as unified and complete they come. Here, Boards of Canada set their sights on a small set of moods and characteristics-- innocence, apprehension, wonder, mystery-- and probed every possibility in minute detail. What's it all about, then? ""Childhood"" is the usual answer, but that's not as easy a connection as it seems on the surface. The giggling voices of kids that crop up are a sure giveaway, as are the song titles (""Rue the Whirl"", ""Happy ""Cycling""), but Music Has the Right to Children avoids the twinkling music box melodies that Múm has been coasting on for a while now. Boards managed to evoke childhood without seeming cute or twee. It's childhood not as it's lived but as we grown-ups remember it, at least those of us with less-than-fond recollections. The shades of darkness and undercurrents of tension (qualities which came further to the fore on 2002's Geogaddi) accurately reflect the confusion of a time that cannot be neatly summed up with any one feeling or emotion. When you discover that Boards of Canada took their name came from an organization committed to educational film, the overriding idea of their project clicks immediately into place. I've no memories of the National Film Board of Canada but I remember tapes with narration and incidental music accompanying filmstrips, tapes that were always damaged from age and overuse on poorly maintained equipment. The warbly pitch and warped voices mirrored the anxiety that came with the ""carefree"" days of being a kid and living subjugated to others. Boards of Canada tapped into the collective unconscious of those who grew up in the English speaking West and were talented enough to transcribe the soundtrack. No need to get hung up on specifics; however we lived and whoever we were, Music Has the Right to Children reflected back the truth for a lot of us. You can't ask more of an album than that.","Boards of Canada’s 1998 album is a beat-music touchstone, a record that took the previous decade of home-listening electronic music and essentially perfected it. This reissue offers a chance for a fresh look.

The Locust EP,The Locust,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd34ea9e61561daa7667/1:1/w_160/37a9df14.jpg,2004-04-26 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4825-the-locust-ep/,GSLGSL,"""I just want to change the way people look at music, or maybe just destroy it in general,"" reads Justin Pearson's manifesto on The Locust's official website. An impressive goal, to be sure, but he's still got some personal obstacles to navigate before he comes close to it. Like prog-rockers and avant-gardists before him, Pearson laments the prevalence of 4/4 time, sending his brief, mathy anthems through speakers in headspinning time signatures that any ordinary fool (myself included) would likely find unclockable. But interestingly, despite his aim to break free of the public's preconceptions of ""what pop music ought to be,"" Pearson does conform nicely to all the stereotypes of underground rockers-- he even followed his indie rock contemporaries by commissioning a remix that turned his band's earlier, more ""uncompromising"" work into a drill-n-bass electro rave-up at the height of that particular craze. Chart The Locust against Alec Empire's superior efforts in that area and Pearson's manifesto begins to sound like the attention-seeking squeal of an underachieving sibling. Fortunately, Pearson's vocal immolation produces just the kind of hellish shrieks loud enough to drown out his irrelevant philosophies and questionable publicity ploys, and force you to understand what a juggernaut his band can be when at its best. Over the eight years since its conception, The Locust's lineup has assimilated a murky hardcore gene pool in which Cattle Decapitation's David Astor and The Album Leaf's Jimmy LaValle have soaked. These black sheep have helped to cement The Locust's status as the causes celebres of the new hardcore movement. This newly reissued early EP features none of the band's later contributors, though, and as such, offers listeners the chance to ponder which approach-- the early years, or the more refined, newer incarnation-- is more satisfyingly obnoxious. Of course, there's one big roadblock with this release: It's saddled with a remixing/remastering treatment that sands down some of the original's edges. The Locust tend to gain the most leverage when they echo Pearson's primal screams and mainline their ferocity through frayed studio wire and blown speaker cones. This edition might sound ""cleaner"" through your hi-fi, but it contradicts the rough-cut impulsion of the original recordings. Still, that doesn't hinder the proceedings too much: Only a chronic migraine sufferer could imagine the kind of blinding misery conjured by this disc's opening 45 seconds, a little track called ""Halfway to a Worthless Ideal Arrangement (An Interlude to a Discontinued Sarcastic Harmony... Yea Whatever)"". And William Burroughs would balk at the caustic cut-ups that form the lyrics of ""Hairspray Suppository"": ""Illness is a problem, not a convenience/ Sometimes things are started and never finished/ The stitch out of time never saves nine/ Diagnosed with a fucking illness/ Rome was never built in a day."" The song titles here are as base and scatological as their volatile contents; ""Cattle Mutilation"", ""Head Hits Concrete"" and ""Keep Off the Tracks"" read like the bleakest news report snapshots and hint at concerns deeper than Pearson's nonchalant bravado would suggest. But trying to pick through the cacophonous catharsis to explore these themes is as fruitless as attempting to transcribe the explosive guitar phrasing that rips up the mix, leaving it bleeding and sore like a fresh suture. A further textual analysis becomes pointless as well, since The Locust is best experienced as an entirely carnal, sensory experience. Purists might prefer this earlier work to the more textured approach of late, but what are purists doing listening to The Locust anyway? Contradiction and alienation are integral parts of the band's charm. The bassist is wrong, they aren't going to change anything at all, and, in fact, they hardly even seem like they're trying. But then, as any virus coder can attest, the most effective means to corrupting a system is to Trojan Horse your way in and mutate it from the inside.","""I just want to change the way people look at music, or maybe just destroy it in general,"" reads Justin ...

This kind of dumb, excessive billowing is the single defining force behind most nu-metal, and probably the impetus for a shitload of bloody guitar solos, cymbal crashes, and ridiculous cock-rock binges. Giggle or sprint. Listen or die. British upstarts Seachange have isolated the fiery barb behind getting retarded-mad and gently smoothed it over, crafting something decidedly more sophisticated (and satisfying) than their chubby, swashbuckling contemporaries. The glitch is that, in the process, they've also started to sound an awful lot like mid-grade Idlewild, watering everything down to a soupy mix of standard alt-rock punches, complete with post-punk guitar zaps, the occasional folk oasis, and a requisite blanket of cloudy booze-and-bummers melancholy. The confounding result: Seachange sound like the slightly better version of every mediocre band you heard eight years ago. But now with a violin! Seachange formed in Nottingham in the late 90s, and their debut long-player, Lay of the Land, is heavy with the gummy residue of pre-millennial/post-grunge angst, alternately seething and wistful, pressing and distanced. Vocalist Dan Eastop spits typical rock and roll grunts over the band's thick guitar bleating, and his Brit clip and disaffected, vacant delivery tend to make his lyrics sound more like heckles than wishes. Guitarists Dave Gray and Adam Cormack noodle and thrash, while violinist Johanna Woodnutt weaves quivering string melodies in and out, all three players incessantly puttering between frenzied bursts and thoughtful contemplation. Meanwhile, bassist James Vyner and drummer Simon Aldcroft pump out steady rhythmic bits, ably gluing the whole mess together. The resulting clash can be momentarily compelling, but lacks the nuance and character and to really pull it off, which all leaves Seachange huddled on the cusp of something significantly worthwhile, but still a few wild, miscreant swings away. Ultimately, Seachange's biggest problem is their steadfast refusal to break formula, even for a second: Virtually all of Lay of the Land's 12 tracks indulge the very same schematic (quiet/loud dynamics, guitar/violin tradeoffs, solid midtempo gunning), sometimes to successful ends, and sometimes not. When Seachange are good, they're very, very good-- ""The Nightwatch"" is a haunting, thunderous success, and ""Anglokana"" is a violently pleasing burst-- but when Seachange are bad, they're just boring (see the rambling songlessness of ""Come on Sister""). Seachange's idea to smarten up the teeth-bared tumult of neo-dude-rock could, in the future, lead to some genuinely impressive feats. For now, though, listeners will have to content themselves with a generous handful of decently textured throwbacks. The verdict: Don't laugh, don't run. Just wait.","Witness the moment in which a person becomes so stupidly, overwhelmingly angry that rational thought dissolves, societal norms become meaningless ...

Peace Love Death Metal,Eagles of Death Metal,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcef5e6ef95969322f58/1:1/w_160/084085f8.jpg,2004-04-25 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2903-peace-love-death-metal/,AntAcid,"The Eagles of Death Metal may be the most misleading bandname since 10,000 Maniacs: On their debut album, Peace Love Death Metal, the band sound like neither The Eagles (a relief) nor death metal. Instead, the record's churning guitars and hook-driven choruses suggest a bizarro-world version of Queens of the Stone Age, specifically the Nuggets-inflected ""Another Love Song"" from Songs for the Deaf or their cover of ""Who'll Be the Next in Line?"" from the Kinks tribute This Is Where I Belong. Which makes sense: Queens frontman Josh Homme is listed as producer on Peace Love Death Metal. But who are the Eagles of Death Metal? The liner notes credit J. Devil Huge on guitar/vocals and Carlo Von Sexron (nickname: Baby Duck) on drums/backing vocals. Huge is apparently the stage name for J. Everett Hughes, a friend of Homme's from Palm Desert, CA, while Von Sexron is an alias for both Josh Homme and (as the nickname's initials hint) Distillers frontwoman Brody Dalle. While the connection between Hughes and Homme goes way back, the band's fraudulent nomenclature and misleading identities-- along with the general one-off vibe of the album-- suggest that Peace Love Death Metal is really the sonic manifestation of an elaborate inside joke, in this case possibly fueled by either ""nicotinevaliumvicadanmarijuannaecstasyalcoholc-c-c-cocaine"" or just an appreciation of cartoonish rock clichés. Adopting a bluesy loverman persona that at times, intentionally or not, recalls Jon Spencer, Hughes sings most of the songs in a jokey falsetto that would be unbearable if he didn't occasionally dip into a Elvis-channeling low-end grumble. On the lead-off track, ""I Only Want You"", he lays out his dishonorable intentions: ""I'm not really interested in what's in your heart/ I don't want you to fall in love with me so don't start."" Elsewhere, Hughes promises that his good lovin' will leave you babbling in religious ecstasy on ""Speaking in Tongues"", and even offers an articulate demonstration as he sings, ""Muh-muh-muh-muh-oooh-da-galing-ling-ling-ling-da-da"" over the bridge. Backing up this self-conscious braggadocio are bundles of bandsaw riffs that add enough edgy swagger to skirt outright garage-rock parody. The stripped-down instrumentation and live-in-the-studio recording occasionally sound thin, as if you could turn the volume all the way up to 11 and it still wouldn't be loud enough. The trade-off, however, is a spontaneity and resourcefulness that adds honky-tonk piano to ""Wastin' My Time"", beat-keeping finger snaps to ""San Berdoo Sunburn"", and four false starts to ""English Girl"". Peace Love Death Metal is at its best when the inside joke is buried deep in the music, but whenever the deathtongue is planted squarely in the deathcheek, the songs turn not just silly, but lumbering and self-indulgent, overburdened by the overriding concept. ""Kiss the Devil"" and ""Midnight Creeper"" are nudge-nudge exercises in rock Satanism, and ""Whorehoppin'"" seems to exist solely for its over-the-top chorus of, ""Shit! Goddamn! I'm a man!"" Similarly, the cover of Steelers Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" doesn't add anything to the original that Reservoir Dogs didn't at least suggest; most likely, it's only here to provide the easy pun of retitling the song ""Stuck in the Metal"". Nothing rocks like a bad pun. In another post-Songs for the Deaf death metal side project, some-time QOTSA drummer Dave Grohl recreated real head-banging metal with a revolving line-up of singers and no trace of irony. Eagles of Death Metal, on the other hand, try so hard not to sound like death metal that sometimes all you get is irony. They're not resurrecting a fallen-from-grace genre or even attempting to subvert any of the rock clichés they indulge in; their only agenda is to have a good time, dude. Still, while it sounds disingenuous compared to Probot, and the whole concept wears thin over 15 tracks, it's hard not to get caught up in the jovial fuck-all spirit of Peace Love Death Metal's best cuts. It may be an inside joke, but Homme and his cohorts, whoever the hell they are, seem to want us all to get it.","The Eagles of Death Metal may be the most misleading bandname since 10,000 Maniacs: On their debut album,\n ...

Small Town Murder Scene,FemBots,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be8ceb335119a49ed09a/1:1/w_160/d6501bfa.jpg,2004-04-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3293-small-town-murder-scene/,Paper Bag,"Country music signifiers have been exploited in some truly atrocious ways over the years: gratuitous pedal steel interludes, lyrics peppered with highways and cardinal directions, people from Connecticut asking for more ""gih-tahr"" in the mix. Such ill-conceived attempts at evoking American roots music virtually always sound forced, if not downright stupid, and currently seem to plague so many Americana and alt-country releases. From that angle, I approached Small Town Murder Scene, the second album from roots-informed Canadians the FemBots with a healthy level of skepticism, but much like Summer Hymns' beautiful Voice Brother and Sister, Small Town Murder Scene won me over in spite of my preconceptions. What really impresses me about this record, and what sets the FemBots apart from their more derivative contemporaries, is how the band cultivates a truly busted ambiance without ever seeming remotely contrived or manipulative. Unlike Voice Brother and Sister, which caught me completely off guard upon its release in 2000, Small Town Murder Scene came to me with nothing but the highest recommendations. Darlings of the wildly supportive Toronto music scene, the FemBots have garnered rave reviews from local journalists, musicians, and record store owners, and rightfully so. Small Town Murder Scene is a humble, thoroughly charming record-- the kind you want to tell people about precisely because it never ostensibly announces its own strength. The record opens with a call to attention-- a rattle and a scream-like siren-- before segueing into the gorgeously downbeat ""Broken and Blue"". The amount of open space on this record is striking, as the band reifies the gap between sounds to great effect. ""Broken and Blue"" makes use of sparse guitar, reverb-soaked percussion, and train whistle screeches, but the palpably spatial arrangement of these elements seems to be the primary element holding the record together. ""Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist"" most directly evokes the aforementioned Summer Hymns, with its organ high in the mix, subtle flourishes of bells, and My Morning Jacket-esque finale. The FemBots continue to explore their penchant for unconventional percussion on ""A Million Dead End Jobs"", which follows the insistent ticking of a clock for its entire duration. Again, a shimmering organ is introduced about halfway through the song, one of many subtle additions that greatly alters the overall tone of the song by the three-minute mark. Only on ""Mom's Ether Blues"" do the FemBots' manipulated country-isms lapse into obnoxiousness, eschewing their usual melodic strength in favor of trite blues noodling. Small Town Murder Scene is punctuated with thoughtful instrumentals, occasionally recalling David Pajo's early work as Aerial M. ""The Transit Song"" is a minimalist epic of clean and dirty electric guitar, piano and organ. ""Theme from a Radio Play"" comes across like an experiment in pure texture until a blast of bass and drums blows it wide open. Sometimes, the FemBots' reliance on traditional song structures obscures the freshness of their sound, but the effect of the overall listening experience is profound. Right now, it's late afternoon on an unusually nice day, and simply put, listening to Small Town Murder Scene feels just right.","Country music signifiers have been exploited in some truly atrocious ways over the years: gratuitous pedal steel interludes, lyrics peppered ...

The art of letter-writing gets lost in the mail, phone calls from three time-zones over come at the most inconvenient times, sweet words distort in signal static or get dropped in the middle of ""I love..."", victims to a conspiracy of star-crossed satellites. Though the two producers here-- Japanese composer Sohichiro Suzuki (who has recorded under the name World Standard since 1985) and German producer Jorg Follert (responsible for an album recorded as Wunder on the Karaoke Kalk label, and one as Wechsel Garland for Morr Music)-- met just twice in Japan to play and record music together, and then filled in the spaces from their respective, distant locales, the result feels like they never left each other's company. Suzuki's picking of nylon strings on ""Dande Lion Wine"" could be mistaken for lonesomeness. He gently swathes it the instrument in lines of piano, chimes, harp, violins, and marimba, each additional timbre embracing and furthering the melody, while never quite shaking that pensive feeling. It's not until the second track, when that lone guitar figure starts to flicker by the hand of Follert, that the long-distance relationship manifests itself. Each producer, instead of simply recording and splitting each side of a record, passed their ideas back and forth between Japan and Germany, correlating their themes and expounding on them in their own miniatures (seven by each-- their only shared credit is the title track). What makes the relationship work is that each partner is comfortable creating his own self-contained sounds while being aware of what came before and what will follow: Wechsel Garland's songs tend to be more upbeat, brightening the proceedings with patches of sunlight and electronics. He tends to go for percolating pulses and babbling streams of digital nuances, making the first half of the album more buoyant. When his initial guitar themes comes around again, he either chops them into a samba shape (""Octant"") or else gives them a brisk Hawaiian air (""A Found Chart""), each time new and refreshed. Suzuki, meanwhile, is the more wistful half of the partnership, not so much melancholic as hopelessly romantic, and prone to spells of sweet exotica breezes. He pens dreamier airs like ""Atoll"", with a reserved piano touch that fleshes out every melodic contour. As the album winds its way down, his role comes to the fore, the gentleness setting the lullabies and chanteys in a peaceful sea for ""Canopy of Heaven"" and ""A Fire Under the Stars"". Whether acoustic or electronic, no sound addition ever stifles the primary lonely-island feeling with unnecessary melodrama or overproduction. Perhaps that's why it opened up DJ Koze's eclectic mix on Kompakt, and that it could embrace both the Langley School's innocence-loss as well as the click-knowledge of Jan Jelinek. By the disc's sumptuous, twinkling end, Suzuki and Follert show the best way for such musical relationships to work out, by being sympathetic to their partner and remembering that succinct advice: Keep it sweet and simple.",,8.4,
Ghost Man on First,Currituck Co.,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a701c0084474cd0c0ac7/1:1/w_160/063268aa.gif,2004-04-22 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1758-ghost-man-on-first/,Lexicon Devil,"A solid traditionalist, Currituck Co.'s Kevin Barker doesn't shy away from paying homage to precursors. On his second proper full-length, Ghost Man on First, he combines Nina Simone's ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"" and ""Waring Cuney"" into ""A Raga Called Nina"", offers name-checking props to 60s folkie Fred Neil and bluegrass killer John Fahey, and covers Bert Jansch's ""Silly Woman"", a track from the 1971 album Rosemary Lane. Barker borrows his project's name from a county in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, but resides in Brooklyn. Firmly lodged within the Big Apple's out-folk context, the urban hillbilly released his 2002 debut, Unpacking My Library, on Mark Robinson's TeenBeat label, and also plays lead guitar for Aden. From this indie rock vantage point, he could very well find contextual links to Tower Recordings offshoots Matt Valentine & P.G. Six, as well as kindred, but less topically similar spirits Animal Collective and Devendra Banhart. To avoid petty regionalism, you could draw a family tree with Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny as well as Espers' Greg Weeks. Of those players, his practice most faithfully corresponds to the beautifully faded standards he admires. As those who saw Gus Van Sant's updated Psycho know, this has its positives and negatives. Though not opposed to experimentation-- he does sometimes tease out or expand upon particularly sumptuous threads of an iconic players' work-- he remains within his forebears' shadows, for the most part. There's no doubting that Barker's one heck of guitarist, but a number of these compositions, as prettily intricate as they are, come off like guitar exercises rather than compelling pieces. Cheekily, he offers a service through his website for eager beavers who want to learn how to play Currituck Co. songs via instructional videos and tablature. Folks choose the songs (""choose any four songs and the fifth song's free!"") and he passes along the goods. Ripe for this by-the-books treatment, ""Requiem for John Fahey"" and ""Dedication: Fred Neil"" are solo guitar pieces that sound out the smooth finger-pickers they reference. Similarly structured, ""The Tropics of Cancer"" brings to mind the warmth of the geographical grid rather than the chaotic hedonism in the texts of Henry Miller. Despite his skills, though, I'm more a fan of the moments in which he opts to screw with expectations. For instance, the crackling Eastern-flavored ""Raga Called Pat Cohn"" unrolls over nine minutes with patient guitar plucks, flutters, and equally rarified harmonium. The repetitions are catchy on their own, but he adds a subdued vocal drone that eventually turns into actual language just as the harmonium takes on the crisply breezy properties of a muffled flute. Not as digressive as Henry Flynt or as noisome as Sunburned Hand of The Man, the work still manages to wander admirably. More compactly stated, the cover of Jansch's ""Silly Woman"" shares likeness with the original, but lulls in the vein of Six Organs of Admittance's Compathia. Of the eight works, the biggest anomaly is the metallic ""The March of the People Who Do Not Know You"", a full-frontal distorto guitar jam that shows up unexpectedly just prior to the heart-achy closer, ""I Truly Understand"". It's far from riveting, but the yammering guitar shield disrupts the folkie atmosphere in an interesting way, and points towards the different avenues Barker has at least tangentially explored more fully on other releases. Currently, Barker's working on Garden of the Deadroom, which has a tentative winter release date on Troubleman Unlimited. Quite obsessively, he's been honing the album since August 2002. Of course, time doesn't necessarily equal quality, but it'll nonetheless be exciting to see how much weirdness he allows to creep in to thwart the conceptual purity of the finished product.","A solid traditionalist, Currituck Co.'s Kevin Barker doesn't shy away from paying homage to precursors.

Here Comes Shuggie Otis / Freedom Flight,Shuggie Otis,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba1513d197565213afd7/1:1/w_160/14b04d3a.jpg,2004-04-22 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11795-here-comes-shuggie-otis-freedom-flight/,EpicEpic,"Shuggie Otis, we hardly knew ye. No, the former child prodigy hasn't spun off this mortal coil just yet, but Shuggie's erstwhile recording career has certainly seen better days-- and unfortunately, those days were 30 years ago. Back in 1974, Shuggie managed to raise critical eyebrows with his ambitious Inspiration Information LP, an elegant, absorbing collage of delta blues, soul, R&B;, and funk laced with the velvety psychedelic twist of his own flawless production. At the time, due to promotional misfirings and a fickle music market, album sales barely registered, and a despairing Shuggie turned reclusive. But finally, following a 2001 reissue on David Byrne's globe-spanning Luaka Bop label, the record gained the widespread acclaim it was previously denied, and rock's standard bearers hailed its genius at last. Sadly, Shuggie's ain't the Cinderella story it could have been. Grasping at his 15 minutes three decades after they were due, Shuggie embarked on a major-city tour in the fall of '01, culling voracious audiences on both coasts. But this time, the press wasn't so thrilled-- SF Chronicle critic Joel Selvin called Otis' Fillmore performance ""haphazard"" and ""inept""-- and Shuggie once again retreated from the spotlight. Whether this release from Australian two-for-one reissue mavens Raven Records is a worthwhile listen for fans of Inspiration Information depends on how much of a completist you are. Raven packages Shuggie's solo debut, 1971's Here Comes Shuggie Otis and its '72 follow-up Freedom Flight together on one epic CD, but only Here Comes Shuggie Otis contains any true classics not featured on the Luaka Bop release. That disc added Freedom Flight's four best tracks, including the cosmic funk of the title song and Shuggie's most famous composition, ""Strawberry Letter 23"", a swirling, swinging midtempo breeze inspired by his girlfriend's scented stationery. ""Me and My Woman"" and ""Someone's Always Singing"" elicit Shuggie's gentle bump, but fail to merit revisitation rights. And even though his B.B. King-inflected guitar and deft, overdubbed bass on the instrumental ""Purple"" reveal his rootsy intuition, the song is far from classic. The liner notes, which are interesting but never revelatory, can't overstress Shuggie's youth during the original recording of Here Comes, and the depth of the record's content certainly belies his 16 years: He played six instruments, sang, and co-wrote each tune with his famous father, bandleader Johnny Otis, Sr. Kicking off the twofer, ""Oxford Gray"" is second only to ""Freedom Flight"" as Shuggie's grandest stroke. Blazing guitar and harpsichord lead into a massive, stirring pizzicato-strings-vs.-slide-guitar duel which trips through a rock 'n' soul jitterbug crowned by a elaborate orchestrated horn section. It's an astounding opening statement from the father-and-son team, and its heaving, soulful psychedelia rivals even Axis: Bold as Love. But from there, Here Comes becomes less focused, and its quality wavers. ""Jennie Lee"" is noteworthy for its gorgeous strings and horns, darkened blues guitar, and Shuggie's Alan Toussaint-esque vocals, while ""Bootie Cooler"" brings standard Sly/Meters funk nodding to Shuggie's bouncy organ and Hammond overdubs. Namedropping his guitar influences (B.B., Elmore, Son House), Shuggie busts into a rolling blues shuffle on ""Shuggie's Boogie"". Elsewhere, the rolling horn section and syncopated guitar on ""Hurricane"" provide a gritty Stax/Volt spark, while ""The Hawks"" closes with a Memphis country funk feel. Casual consumers will likely pass up this reissue like they did Inspiration 30 years back-- which is probably fine, as the majority of these songs fail to add much of significance to Shuggie's discography. Still, for groove hounds, funk archivists, and collectors, there's more than enough solid material here to justify at least a few spins.","

Inches,Les Savy Fav,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce713d197565213b40b/1:1/w_160/9b5e9c98.jpg,2004-04-22 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4752-inches/,Frenchkiss,"It's no secret: Les Savy Fav like to fuck shit up. Baldly transgressing the most basic assumptions about rock singers, the band's frontman is a pudgy, bearded, wild-eyed freak whose unpredictable stage show tends to scare off men and women alike. Their studio output varies from barked, discordant indie anthems to synth-heavy art-punk. And their new singles record, Inches, reverses all the usual rules that compilations of its ilk abide by. For most rock bands, a singles compilation is an afterthought-- an offhanded concession to fans who may have missed out on the limited pressings. For Les Savy Fav, a singles compilation was a forethought, conceived before the band had even recorded a song for it. Now, seven years after its conception, the career-spanning project finally comes to fruition, collecting the A- and B-sides of nine seven-inches, all originally released by different labels. For those who've been keeping up with these singles, the excellence of Inches is a foregone conclusion. While many contemporary indie bands reserve their singles for the release of marginal or subpar material, Les Savy Fav's tend to offer songs that are not only better than the band's album cuts but, despite the disparate conditions of their production, more consistent as well. For a band so prone to brilliant and exhausting outbursts, it's not surprising that their defining album would come in this form. And without a doubt, this is Les Savy Fav's defining album. The high points on Inches are not only the finest songs the group has ever recorded, but are also the most indicative of their strengths as a band. ""Our Coastal Hymn"", released in live form as a hidden track on The Cat and the Cobra, is possibly the catchiest song in their entire repertoire-- hook after blistering hook, all energized by the band's trademark frenetic grandiosity. Never overpowered by its angularity, ""Our Coastal Hymn"" is less an anthemic punk song than it is a pointy anthem, unconventionally catchy and tremendously forceful. Tracing the band's chronology backwards, Inches shows Les Savy Fav continually reshaping and revitalizing their sound with new textures, and expanding their palette of both sounds and approaches to recording. The album's newest track, ""Meet Me in the Dollar Bin"", is a sparse and direct dance-punk epic, with Harrison Haynes' terse, robotic drumming perfectly anchoring frontman Tim Harrington's pained screams. Les Savy Fav's most recent LP, Go Forth largely failed to sustain itself, as the band's energy was substantially defused by Phil Ek's production, but Inches' diverse pacing allows even the Ek-produced ""Fading Vibes,"" on which the band revisits the more straightforward guitar-rock sound of their first album, to stand out as one of the best and most unique recent Les Savy Fav tracks. Of all the remarkable tracks on Inches, ""Yawn Yawn Yawn"" remains my personal favorite. Here, Seth Jabour's endlessly inventive guitar playing is in top form, masterfully and subtly building from a clean, rhythmic figure in the verse to a soaring, distorted chorus. Lyrically, the song is further proof that Harrington has more in common with Daniel Bejar and John Darnielle than he does with his harder-rocking contemporaries. Like many of Les Savy Fav's songs, ""Yawn Yawn Yawn"" explores themes such as sex, partying, decadence and disaster. And, as usual, Harrington relishes his words like a storyteller, delivering them with both conviction and humor. The first pressing of Inches comes with a bonus DVD that further solidifies its status as Les Savy Fav's most essential and representative release. Videos of three songs from a 2003 performance at Brooklyn's Northsix provides a welcome glimpse of the awe-inspiring Les Savy Fav live experience. Although Harrington's theatrics are usually the most frequently discussed aspect of Les Savy Fav's live show, the distance provided by the footage puts the emphasis largely on the virtuosity and spontaneity of the band's individual players. And the video of ""Who Rocks the Body"" is just fucking hilarious, as Harrington asks a stuffed rabbit, ""Who rocks the party that rocks the bunny?"" Unfortunately, Harrington's notorious live antics have resulted in many people writing off Les Savy Fav as a joke or a novelty. And without a doubt, the band's previous recorded output has largely failed to demonstrate the musical prowess spoken of by their fans. But Les Savy Fav have always demonstrated a uniquely off-kilter sense of humor, and it seems strangely fitting that the very album their fans have been waiting for has, in fact, been underway since the band formed. With Inches, Les Savy Fav brings together a full seven years of solid musicianship, deviously catchy songwriting, and explosive punk rock energy, discarding all the gratuitous dissonance and convoluted song structures that often plague ""post-punk."" Finally, this is Les Savy Fav. ","It's no secret: Les Savy Fav like to fuck shit up. Baldly transgressing the most basic assumptions about rock ...

Junk Magic,Craig Taborn,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8795e6ef95969321203/1:1/w_160/625dba83.jpg,2004-04-22 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8257-junk-magic/,Thirsty Ear,"Too often when electronica mates with jazz, one side gets the upper hand. Either the producer trips, chops, or buries the musicians and masks the flow of their improvisation, or he stands back, letting the musicians run blithely past the light colors or static backdrops set behind them. The Thirsty Ear Blue Series has repeatedly tried to put both sides on equal footing-- or at least to start a wrestling match-- like on last year's sadly dull Antipop Consortium vs. Matthew Shipp. But even when the music works, you can still see the separation: The two camps mix, but don't synthesize. Then there's Craig Taborn, who approached his latest album as a performer and as the producer. It's hard to believe this is only Taborn's third record as a leader, and his first with electronics. When you flip through his work as a sideman and keyboardist-around-town in New York City, the breadth is overwhelming. With James Carter and on his own Light Made Lighter, Taborn is a methodically swift pianist who can solo like Scott Joplin's piano player plugged into the wrong voltage. He's also acclaimed as a leading Fender Rhodes revivalist, blowing the cobwebs off fusion licks for Tim Berne or Dave Douglas. But Taborn is most distinctive as a textural player. He's said he follows the example of Sun Ra or Larry Young, pushing his keyboards to see what they can do for him; but Taborn uses the latest technology. If the hypnotic see-sawing of ""The Golden Age""'s melody recalls the theme to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, that's just one touchstone for his digital space jazz, which also co-opts Detroit techno and dance beats. But he also constructs immersive spaces, opening up rough-hewn synth backdrops or triggering a deep sonar ""ping"" that creates the illusion of light-eating depths. Each track on Junk Magic is crammed to the gills, and then made light by the restlessness and motion that drive the album. Taborn may have spent weeks constructing a machine but he gets to flick the switch right in front of us, and the product unfurls in real-time, even as you acknowledge the overdubbing. This starts right on the opening track, where IDM chirps fly like tacks over the synth lines that pile on top of the piano figure and thick organ chords at the low-end-- wheels spinning within wheels. Taborn works with a group here, although he easily outnumbers them. Of his three sidemen, The Bad Plus' ""dude, holy shit, you've gotta check this guy out"" drummer David King is the chief commercial draw. He gives up some freedom when he joins Taborn's cyborg army, but it's worth it to hear the way Taborn bats him around-- as on ""Mystero"", where he's cut up like a stop-motion photograph. Aaron Stewart joins what you could call the frontline on tenor sax, but microtonal violist Mat Maneri adds the most color, sawing seared lines and rasping soliloquies over Taborn's precision. The musicians submit to cameos on some tracks and get full-contact jams on ""Prismatica"" and ""Mystero"", and ""Bodies at Rest and in Motion"" even starts as a stumbling acoustic piece-- though you know it's only a matter of minutes before the digital insects fly back in. Impeccable taste keeps this project on track. Taborn sticks to one palette but never uses it the same way twice: Each piece is distinct, even the busiest tracks have a hook or clear melody to hang onto, and best of all, the record is concise, clocking in at just over 40 minutes, which leaves no time for screw-ups. It could've been stiff, crass, or even grotesque; instead, it's a definitive recital, and it throws down a challenge for the rest of the Blue Series. We've spent several records hearing Matthew Shipp flirt with electronica or gently funkify his piano, and the whole time Shipp had the spotlight, Taborn was already on the other side of the moon. Here's hoping people finally notice.","Too often when electronica mates with jazz, one side gets the upper hand. Either the producer trips, chops, or buries ...

The Iron Point,Noxagt,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96dea9e61561daa6fae/1:1/w_160/e0027159.gif,2004-04-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5897-the-iron-point/,Load,"Chaos: perhaps the most oft-misused word in the musical lexicon. The term, meaning a state of intense disorder or confusion, is commonly applied to loud bands who offer a somewhat masochistic listening experience. Load Records is an unfortunate victim of this naive branding. While many of its bands are excruciatingly loud, few fit the true definition of chaos. Even Lightning Bolt, one of the most unrepentantly ear-splitting groups ever, are far from chaotic: Their compositions weave in and out of rigidly preordained constructs, stretching the taut skin of rhythm to maximum tension, yet never breaking it. Noxagt are certain to be smote by the term in the wake of their second LP, The Iron Point, yet while many of the Norwegian trio's songs may be deafening, they're also often downright sublime. Continual high-volume pummeling can be quite soothing, particularly when a band is content not to overstuff their songs with breakneck changes and spitfire riffage. One more than one occasion, I've blasted this record on car trips, and the music has a surprisingly sobering effect. While an epileptic band like The Locust certainly isn't the best thing to drive to, Noxagt's behemoth soundscapes are easy to become immersed in: The Iron Point moves as one sprawling, ambient suite, albeit composed for glottal bass, metallic drums and palsied viola. While Lightning Bolt construct minimalist masterpieces by distilling the adrenal essence of rock, Noxagt's song structures are more finessed, and thus lose some of their intended potency. But such gracefulness and attention to detail isn't always a hindrance. ""The Hebbex"" is as anthemic as it is jarring, the stylistic double whammy that makes Lightning Bolt's music so toothsome. ""Acasta Gneiss"" stutters on a spasmodic bassline, replete with tremolo-heavy viola and primal tom-bashing, creating a textural kaleidoscope that makes for one of The Iron Point's most interesting moments. ""Regions of May"", another standout, shows a more sensitive band influenced equally by Loveless-style noisemaking and more dire hardcore and metal acts. ""Thurmaston"" illustrates the potentially hypnotic effect of exceptionally loud music. Beginning with a spliced viola whine that sounds redolent of a weedwhacker gone haywire, the song features an unflinching drum rhythm that starts entropic, before being finally pinioned by a dirgeful bassline. From there, the track gradually builds momentum, as the subtly mutating viola line provides the sole melodic underpinning. Four minutes later, not much has changed, but it's hard to imagine where the time went: Like the best ambient and drone music, ""Thurmaston"" seems to bend time, disintegrating our physical relation to the world around us. The primary difference between this and, say, Selected Ambient Works II, is the instrumentation and volume. A stringently singular coherence might be both this record's greatest asset and detractor. While appreciable as a whole, the songs on The Iron Point often blend into one another, offering no significant difference in tempo, instrumentation or volume. Additionally, some of the more searing numbers-- especially ""Blood Thing"" and ""A Blast from the Past""-- seem like throwaways: Not only do they languor in the album's sequence, they're downright tedious in and of themselves. Still, The Iron Point has plenty of beatific moments within its just-right 33-minute runtime. Like the jagged, sun-drenched slab of granite that adorns its cover, the album poses a striking dichotomy that limns an unconventional beauty.","Chaos: perhaps the most oft-misused word in the musical lexicon.

Palm Fronds,The Double,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb74ea9e61561daa7242/1:1/w_160/2ca73795.gif,2004-04-21 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2552-palm-fronds/,Catsup Plate,"It's taken a while for me to get around to yammering about The Double, a Brooklyn group that abandoned its originally mathy, precision-bound leanings to embrace more traditional songwriting. As orally fixated as the New York hype machine is, The Double have already been on cognoscenti lips and weekly paper tips with biting mentions of Echo and The Walkmen. However, a funny thing happened on the way to record their debut: Drummer Jeff McLeod severely fucked up his hand, and his cast muffled the chances of capturing the impressive punch of their live sound. As a result, the band did a re-think and Palm Fronds was recorded while McLeod's hand healed: The band opted to forego the rock drumkit and instead use drum machines and loops to propel its songs. While working within these new parameters, both technological accidents and the freedom of creating within a studio setting began to stack up in oddly appealing ways as the group stumbled onto a new creative process that echoed Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies and the sonic permutations in their record collections. ""Blanket on the Beach"" would merely be a sunny slice of bikini- and bleach-blanket pop were there not a melodica and acrid slush acting as an undertow, pulling the bottom out from under the band. Similarly, tinny distortion eats at the edges of ""Ghost Song"", while ""Standing on a Levee"" follows the long-forgotten weed forestin' paths of early Sebadoh and Smog by recording a catchy pop song onto a four-track tape that crunches like Grape Nuts. The disc's second half comes across like Coney Island arcane arcadia by way of clattering barrelhouse piano and broken merry-go-round melodies, making the tracks seem woozy without straying too far from their Shantytown shack rhythms. The best mashed imagining is ""Firecrackers in Sawdust"", which could be the ghost of Ian Curtis channeled through Keith Hudson's Kingston studio-- all aslant rhythms and stumbling echoes falling into a brittle balance. As those who remember Catsup Plate's Black Dice, French Paddleboat, Destroyer, and Animal Collective releases can attest, the label's handmade packaging reflects all their records' irregular layers. Here, a water-painted wraparound hides a jewel case of swirling foliage in sloppy bloom, just as naïf noises obscure and heighten the pop highs that lie at the bottom of The Double's concrete jungle.","It's taken a while for me to get around to yammering about The Double, a Brooklyn group that abandoned ...

Pasada Professional,Angel Molina,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45dc0084474cd0c368d/1:1/w_160/919ce2aa.gif,2004-04-21 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5584-pasada-professional/,Fragil Discos,"For gray days, there is gray music. I don't know why I wanted to walk outside today anyway; it was humid and about to rain. It wasn't a particularly interesting day; nothing much to see except the same old pulse of the same old engines zipping past me on their way to some place that could never matter. It would have been a depressing day had I cared enough to pay attention. But in fact, it wasn't depressing at all. The footstep beats of those cars, and of the change in my pocket when I reach down to make sure I still have something to put in the newspaper dispenser, ensured that whatever wandering train of thought I carried didn't veer too far within. For gray days, there is gray music, and I'm glad I brought along Pasada Professional. Spanish DJ and modern techno producer Angel Molina has done more than his part for this kind of gray. Pasada Professional is a mix featuring artists from the Argentinean label Fragil Discos. The general sound is close to the Kompakt/Force Inc. style of minimal techno, with soft house beats and ambient textures providing sparse color. Of course, this is not exactly ""dance"" music, in the same way that Herbert's Around the House isn't necessarily dance music, but it comes from a similar place, and in these gray days, that's enough to get going. However, unlike most microhouse (there, I said it), Molina's mix is less concerned with keeping the beat alive than it is sculpting ebb and flow from its sources. As it happens, there isn't a beat to be found until the fourth track, and even then, you have to catch it on your own as Leo Garcia's ""Clap 4"" only implies it at first. Prior to that, Molina eases into a pulse, using a high-pitched bell tone from Pablo Reche's ""Campanitas"" and the fuzzy, mechanical hum of Audioperu's ""Ciao Morocco"" to introduce his own fuzzy, mechanical vision. Romina Cohn's ""Let's Rock (Voz)"" is straight glitch-noise growl, while Andy Love's ""Andy Loops"" drastically slows down a sample of Andy Warhol that some listeners will recognize from David Bowie's homage to the legendary pop artist. No beats, not even gray ones. Those don't really appear until Molina brings out his ""heavyweights,"" like Kompakt's Leandro Fresco, who gets two tracks on Pasada Professional. ""Pol-Pol"" seems pure Cologne, despite its South American origins. Imagine Kraftwerk removing the few human traits they exhibit (including playing synthesizers) and opting instead for bleak, almost colorless textures using only a couple of hazy loops and vinyl crackle. Alternatively, imagine Fennesz and Philip Jeck collaborating on a house track, vowing never to get louder than the doorbell. Pommerenck's ""Diacido"" evaporates out of ""Pol-Pol"", using two watercolor chords as its backbone and keeping the tick-tock from the previous tune. Fresco returns with ""Pasta de Cristal Congelado"", sounding relatively extroverted in comparison-- though in truth, it's merely the beautiful music of passing trains and sunsets. As these samples die, so does the track, and ""Diacido"" halfway returns, removing its harmonic weight in favor of beat afterthoughts like missed trains. Romina Cohn's ""Angel"" brings in an erratic glitch, like a broken Casio working just well enough to hint at some ages-gone programmed melody destroyed because someone left the floppy on top of the television too long. It carries over into Fantasias Animadas' ""Ascensor de Aluminio"", so much so that it's hard to really tell where one track ends and the other begins. Throughout Pasada Professional, Molina delights in blurring the lines between tracks, and his sense of pacing seems to favor mood and atmosphere over pure beatmatching. My only complaint is his inclusion of Ocio's downtempo chill track, ""No es Palabras Escritas"", at the end, as it seems to jump out from nowhere. But even so, the final track featuring only children walking and singing seems a perfectly enigmatic way to close a perfectly enigmatic mix. For bright days and nights, there is plenty; for gray areas, Pasada Professional seems right.","For gray days, there is gray music. I don't know why I wanted to walk outside today anyway; it ...

The Volunteers,Onelinedrawing,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3cc0084474cd0c27cf/1:1/w_160/b3820230.jpg,2004-04-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6095-the-volunteers/,Jade Tree,"Jonah Matranga, the only true member of Portland, Oregon's Onelinedrawing, is a diarist at heart, both in his music and in his daily life. He offers reflections on the recording of his third full-length that run longer than the printed lyrics in the liners and, man, does he ever rip his heart out and show it to you in his songs. Matranga developed this habit with emo punks Far, but he's refined it on his own, developing a loose, free-roaming approach to confessional songwriting that pushes his music beyond the normal sad-sack singer/songwriter clichés. The Volunteers comes packaged in artwork that suggests Stephen Foster and the Civil War era more than the modern grab-bag it actually contains, and Matranga's liners are a good stream-of-consciousness accompaniment to the music, which opens with a plinking xylophone and ghostly female vocals before giving over to ""Over It"", a sing-along anthem which casts the personal struggle of the lyrics in a strange light. Like most of the songs that follow, ""Over It"" moves from section to section seemingly when it occurs to Matranga to switch things up; there's no traditional verse/chorus/verse structure to anything here. The meat of the album is primarily in the middle, though, as tracks three through seven swerve all over the road finding different ways to toy with emotions. ""A Ghost"" follows a dead man as he watches his wife and son go on living, drifting through the door of his wife's bus and floating above the seats, and builds to a majestic conclusion wrapped in a warm blanket of synth. Matranga's voice gets breathy and relaxed while hovering around Chad Waldrup's layers of spacious guitar on ""Stay"", the melody wrapping around the simple lyrics for the album's most transcendent moment. But he's back to his normal croak when he opens ""We Had a Deal"" with the couplet, ""I had a deal with Heaven, but it fell through/ I had a dream or seven and I'm not sure which one came true."" The most infectious song on the album is actually a joke-- Matranga wrote ""Oh, Boys"" for his girlfriend after damaging her car, and the vocal round of ""boys keep fuckin' up my car"" in the outro is hilarious. For its peaks, though, The Volunteers does have its lows, and it more or less trails off in the last quarter, especially with ""Portland?"", a revisitation of the album intro that consists mostly of a sample of a gas pump and some wandering keyboards. It fades into near-silence for too long before ""As Much to Myself as to You"" strikes up to close out the album with its solo acoustic lament, a serviceable folk tune with some nice couplets, but a limp melody. But even while it's unfortunately anticlimatic, The Volunteers is a fine record, and a welcome addition to the modern singer/songwriter canon.","Jonah Matranga, the only true member of Portland, Oregon's Onelinedrawing, is a diarist at heart, both in\n\ his ...

This Affair Never Happened... And Here Are Eleven Songs About It,Bigger Lovers,by: Stephen M.

And Here Are Eleven Songs About It. One song is titled ""Ninja Suit"", the following track namedrops Bionic Man, and even the word ""affair"" in the title seems oddly old-fashioned. The four band members are children of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and their songs of failed romance emanate from a shared period nostalgia. However, they don't ape early XTC or prime Cheap Trick, for example, the same way Interpol echo Joy Division. Instead, for The Bigger Lovers, these influences fall in the category of older-sibling bands: groups your big sister or brother played and therefore you thought had to be the coolest. On This Affair Never Happened, the band comes across as candid and self-effacing-- as well as a little self-congratulatory for being so candid and self-effacing. But beneath the back-patting and the reflexive jibes lies a sober sincerity. The heartache, the romantic confusion, the almost adolescent hopelessness-- it's all very, very serious business. In a sense, it's the flipside of irony: Rather than not caring enough, The Bigger Lovers care so much that they sometimes lose perspective. At times this tunnel-vision romanticism can be endearing in a shamelessly escapist way, a tonic for life's real hurt. On songs like ""I Resign"" and ""Slice of Life"", they prove themselves a more-than-capable pop band. Ed Hogarty's guitar cuts through with riffs that are as concise as they are catchy, as Scott Jefferson and erstwhile Pernice Brothers drummer Patrick Berkery maintain a strong pop momentum. But too often on This Affair Never Happened, the band sounds like they just need to get over it. ""Blowtorch"" is a humdrum shuffle that tries to sell us lines like, ""Black coffee, booze and cigarettes/ Have kept me running on fumes."" And who knows what to make of the line, ""And it's hard to sleep/ When the shit is ankle deep"" from ""Hollywood"". Additionally, the determinedly inconsequential ""No Heroics"" brings This Affair Never Happened to a screeching halt midway through, and the record doesn't get moving again until two tracks later, with the dermatological love song ""Peel It Away"". The album ends with ""For Christ's Sake"", a Christmastime lament that mixes cloying coyness (""Thoughts stick to my mind/ Like head lice"") with a chorus (""Come back to me/ For Christ's sake"") whose cleverness undercuts its heartfelt plea. As a follow-up to the more focused songwriting of their two previous albums, This Affair Never Happened ultimately sounds disappointing and a little hollow, with no real experience behind the sentiments. Maybe if that affair really had happened, these eleven songs might pack more punch.","Call it Big Wheel pop: Philadelphia's Bigger Lovers make music influenced as much by the detritus of their youth ...

Antithesis EP,Keith Fullerton Whitman,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa239d034d5c69bf3dad/1:1/w_160/3e3ffdec.gif,2004-04-19 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8661-antithesis-ep/,Kranky,"Keith Fullerton Whitman's 2002 album Playthroughs brought me both comfort and a feeling of being alone. I experienced an aesthetic connection with that minimal ambient record that is arguably the sole reason art exists. An artist creates something that is his way of saying: ""You know how __________ and __________, and it feels like __________?"" And I play the CD and-- despite his communicating with music rather than words-- I'm able to say, ""Yeah, I know exactly what you mean."" The space between us is diminished. And yet, Playthroughs gave me a sense of isolation because I felt as if no one else heard in it quite what I did. I received a number of e-mails from readers about my Playthroughs review telling me that ""there was no there there"" and I was just pretending to like it to be cool or deep or something. Others readers went as far as claiming that anyone with half a brain and a single finger could make that album. Plenty of people did like Playthroughs, but to most of them it was just an ambient album among many ambient albums, a bit more skeletal than most, perhaps, but nothing to go crazy over. I maintain that there were a million ways Playthroughs could have been different, but very few ways it could have been better. To tide us over to the next Whitman full-length, Multiples, Kranky offers the vinyl-only Antithesis EP, which contains four worthy tracks that didn't fit the new full-length. The Antithesis material is very much an odds-and-sods hodgepodge: four pieces recorded over a span of eight years in different home studios with widely variable set-ups. All of the tracks are instrumental compositions created by layering traditional sounds like guitar, feedback, keyboards, and percussion, without computer sources or digital processing. ""Twin Guitar Rhodes Viola Drone (For Lamonte Young)"", recorded in 1994, is the oldest of the pieces, and it fittingly has a shoegaze feel. Although Young is namechecked, the feedback hum and recurring three-note suggestion of I/IV/V chords are pop tropes, far from gallery-presented art music. The song has a unique melancholy vibe coupled with a sense of endlessness, as if it could continue to unspool forever. And its primitive-sounding recording places its aural space in the vicinity of where Windy & Carl and Flying Saucer Attack were in 1994, with a bit of VU/Theater of Eternal Music viola folded in. ""Obelisk (For Kurt Schwitters)"" is from 1997 and would have fit on one of the Storm/Swarm/Throne drone compilations Asphodel released around that time. With echoing bits of tribal percussion and held tones that sound as if they're disappearing down some mantle-bound cavern, ""Obelisk"" is not far from the dark ambient of Steve Roach. ""Rhodes Viola Multiple"", from 1995, is closest in sound to Playthroughs, with an overlapping series of keyboard throbs that combine with guitar feedback into a constantly shifting drone. The closing ""Schnee"" is a timeless and terrifically evocative piece of music, one that sounds uncannily like vintage krautrock. I've heard comparisons to Ash Ra Tempel, but it sounds more like Popol Vuh doing soundtrack work for Werner Herzog. Its ancient, blurry guitar tone and endless cascade of cymbal reference a time when psychedelic rock was tightly bound to the medieval, a connection exploited to maximum effect by Genesis and Gentle Giant. Each time Whitman offers a glimpse of what else he's been up to in the past 10 years, we get a deeper understanding of his impressive range. He started out as an impressive drum-n-bass beat technician and then experimented with minimal ambient music to unveil some worthwhile instrumental rock-ish sounds. And to think, I once thought of this dude only as the guy who wrote the witty and informed blurbs on German electronic music for the Forced Exposure catalog.","Keith Fullerton Whitman's 2002 album Playthroughs brought me both comfort and a feeling of being alone.

Combat,Mochipet,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45c13d197565213bf36/1:1/w_160/bf96a3e5.gif,2004-04-19 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5583-combat/,Violent Turd,"As the electronic descendant of the lowly ""cover version,"" the remix has become an inventive genre in its own right. The free Internet distribution of Danger Mouse's Grey Album-- the now-infamous blending of Jay-Z's The Black Album with The Beatles' self-titled White Album-- invited the wrath of EMI and reopened the debate over music ownership and the rights of artists to re-interpret. It's a good thing industry stuffiness isn't universal; otherwise, we'd have been denied expert recycling from the likes of Two Lone Swordsmen, art-house sonic terrorists V/VM, and the quirky lounge styling of Mike Flowers. Despite such capable company, Mochipet has elbowed to the top of the pile with this ridiculously unpredictable collection of reworked material. Combat takes an intriguing angle: On each track, two or more artists are pitted against each other in a cacophonous ""battle of styles,"" with Mochipet stirring the cauldron into a frenzy of seizure-inducing mayhem. Mochipet is Taiwan's David Wang, who made his name with self-released original material he'd send free in CD-R form to anyone who requested it from his website. Following his second CDR release-- Randbient Works 2002, which was released just as his idiosyncratic esoterica began to see recognition in the underground-- Wang was offered the opportunity to cut a 12"" for Ellen Allien's Teutonic imprint, Bpitchcontrol, and happily took on the staggering workload that comes with the territory for electronica auteurs. Now there's Combat, his first official full-length, which comes courtesy of the Tigerbeat6 label's mischievous subsidiary, Violent Turd. Here, Wang epitomizes the revisionist tendencies inherent in his genre, and produces surreal distortions and grotesque caricatures of some of music's most established institutions, from Yes to DJ Qbert. But Mochipet is no common mashup artist: Here, he complicates that formula by selecting source material purely via word association. Those of you who might balk at the uneasy pairings of Barry White with The White Stripes, or Captain Beefheart with Captain & Tennille may be alarmed to imagine Mochipet's own tireless techno battery scaffolding such unsteady constructions. But relax: Combat is a riotous, hilarious success. After the introductory megamix of ""Mochi vs. Soulseek"", in which Wang prepares us for the maelstrom to come by borrowing from Rod Stewart, Destiny's Child and Vanilla Ice, the bombastic party-scape of ""Wang Chung vs. The Real Wang"" reveals an infectious enthusiasm for juxtaposition. But ""Johnny Cash vs. Cash Money Millionaires"" is the kicker, treating the originals with affection and intuitive invention. Here, Wang coaxes humor and optimism from Cash's ghostly vocals, doing no disservice to a legacy he could so easily have offended. ""Aphex Twin vs. Thompson Twins"", meanwhile, finds Combat at its most perverse. A cheekily crooned rendition of ""Come to Daddy"" degenerates into an unruly musical brawl as Wang's wacky interpretations overlap psychotically in a glorious flourish of creativity. At worst, this record can be frivolous (see the banal but mercifully brief ""Thundercats vs. The Stray Cats""). Some may also scorn the lack of structure which hovers over the proceedings, threatening to break up these strange marriages, but I'd argue that in such scattered sensory eruptions, Mochipet tends to incites the maximum incredulity and hilarity in his listeners more often than not. Naturally, of course, there are exceptions: ""Barry White vs. The White Stripes vs. White Lion"" can be oppressively jerky, despite offering an amusingly discordant vision of 70s, 80s, and contemporary pop. And ""Neil Diamond vs. King Diamond vs. Lion King"" is an unsettling carousel that reels drunkenly before slamming into the ghost train, ending the album on a mysteriously callous cackle. Sonically, Combat pushes few boundaries, but does revel in an obsessive pop fascination that playfully upsets all preconceptions. Perhaps the album's most disturbing moment-- a candid reproduction of Captain & Tennille that escapes unmolested for one entire, terrifying minute-- best illustrates how gripping Mochipet's relentless showmanship can be. Indeed, Combat is too involving to be considered pure mockery, too self-involved to be simply a tribute. But maybe Combat is best-described as a sort of deranged karaoke. Wang plasters himself all over the guilty pleasures in which he so degenerately indulges. As such, this record is best enjoyed by the drunk and the whimsical, all of whom should be prepared for one stupefying, maniacal experience.","As the electronic descendant of the lowly ""cover version,"" the remix has become an inventive genre in its own right ...

Fingers Crossed,Architecture in Helsinki,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a19aea9e61561daa483d/1:1/w_160/9c96d270.jpg,2004-04-19 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/440-fingers-crossed/,BarNoneTrifekta,"Paper plates have been liberally smeared with bright yellow icing. Blue cocktail napkins, sticky and balled, float in partially consumed cups of apple juice. Shreds of wrapping paper and ribbon dot the lawn, abandoned sacks of loot topple over into the flower bed, candy necklaces and pink rubber balls slowly spill into the topsoil. Children run at full speed, in every direction. And on a cheap portable stereo, Architecture in Helsinki's debut, Fingers Crossed, starts to spin, each bit of gleefully bizarre pop somehow blending perfectly into the haphazard hollers of cake-stuffed toddlers, mirroring their soft mania, providing what might be the only appropriate soundtrack to a throwdown attended exclusively by knee-high tots no longer wearing their shoes. While goofy backyard birthday parties have long been rendered formulaic, chalked up as another standardized offshoot of American minivan culture, Fingers Crossed is an oddly surprising invention, curiously unparalleled and quietly compelling: In a rapidly changing landscape, it's rare to stumble onto a record that actually sounds new, and Architecture in Helsinki have managed to take ""neo-psych"" to entirely unforeseen levels of blippy eccentricity. Ultimately, what's most disarming about the band's brand of blissful musing is that it's so stupidly pleasant to listen to: Melding lilting harmonies, sweet, high-pitched synthesizers, tittering percussion, and assorted woodwinds, Architecture lay out a weird and whimsical electro-pop buffet, effortless yet perplexing. A collective of eight Australians (five men, three women), Architecture tote around a massive pile of gear-- xylophone, flute, four different kinds of guitar, glockenspiel, trumpet, tuba, trombone, assorted synths, melodica, thumb piano, clarinet, recorder, bass, and various drums, their tinny din augmented only by a mess of vocals (including contributions by some craggy-voiced kids), handclaps, tap dancers, and finger snaps. It's impossible to understand the group without understanding their pile of stuff and the penchant for tinkles and beeps it so blatantly implies; despite employing more than thirty noisemakers and a diverse choir of age-ranged voices, Fingers Crossed manages to end up sounding excessive and slight at the very same time. The combination is beautifully baffling. Credit the band's songwriting prowess: ""The Owl's Go"" is Fingers Crossed's brilliant creative apex, an insane and addictive menagerie of sounds, melodies, and gleeful circus bits-- listening feels a little like cracking open the mind of a manic-depressive in full-on hysteria, climbing inside while he shakes with joy, elated to the point of drooling. The track starts with a whispered two-voice countdown, figures tap-shoes-and-finger-clicks-as-percussion, and then positions flute, jangly guitar, finger snaps, xylophone, a smattering of boy/girl voices, shouting children, and sighs as prominently as possible. While the rest of Fingers Crossed never quite matches this high, there are other notable moments: ""Fumble"" is a goofy-but-engaging tuba-heavy celebration, and ""Like a Call"", with its muted beats and meandering bassline, is an inadvertently touching promise. But just as benign backyard clowns have earned a spot in pre-adolescent nightmares, there's something sort of terrifying about Architecture in Helsinki's strung-out ecstasy. The band's incessant squeaking could make Fingers Crossed become vaguely unbearable, overwhelming in its promise of total, uncompromised happiness. Still, like any good birthday binge or uncanny high, it's worth the hangover. You might swear you'll never touch it again. But you so will.","Paper plates have been liberally smeared with bright yellow icing. Blue cocktail napkins, sticky and balled, float in partially consumed ...

Sleep No More,DJ Signify,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb73eb335119a49eca38/1:1/w_160/5547d6ba.gif,2004-04-19 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2551-sleep-no-more/,Lex,"Too many hip-hop records these days fail to offer a stable atmosphere. Maybe it's the fear of a looming backlash that drives artists to cram as much diversity as possible into their records, but while this often shows that an artist is capable of working within more than just one sonic realm, it also frequently results in an unfocused end product. Some producers come close, but fall just short of perfecting that delicate balance, lacking the kind of important, subtle changes that keep listeners listening. But then there's DJ Signify, a New York-based producer whose debut album is a singularly dark, instrumental clinic which manages to maintain its unique identity while shifting styles within similar contexts. As with any master beatsmith, DJ Signify counts subtlety among his greatest strengths, using his backdrops to lend depth and color to his stories. Throughout the album, his drumwork is staggeringly confident, in some cases creating counter-melodies around his samples, while halting for emphasis in others: After Buck 65 drops his verse on ""Winters Going"", the drums detach from the guitar loop, a vocal sample enters briefly, and a different set of more prominent beats suddenly enter to dominate the soundscape. A less patient producer might have run that vocal sample into the ground, but Signify wisely employs it just once, at the end of the track, to hit his point home. But while he may seem to have an affinity for an approach based on the purest elements of the art, Signify exhibits many styles throughout Sleep No More. Whether he's using sinister carnival funk and 60s bell tones on ""Peekaboo Part 1"", vulnerable icy keys and heavy drums on ""Where Did She Go?"", or a processed yet organic pulse and stuttered synth stomps on ""Peekaboo Part 3"", Signify manages to make even unlikely sounds feel like they belong. The big selling point for many will be the involvement of two of the underground's biggest magnates, Sage Francis and Buck 65. Francis' contributions are all slightly tilted to themes of unfulfilling adulthood and relationships (""At night, I'm more than certain, she hurts inside from all this shit/ Drawing a curtain, blurring the line before crossing it"") that wouldn't have been out of place on his Personal Journals, while Buck 65 strings together a David Lynch-esque story-in-reverse. And while it may seem like a bad idea to pair two loosely affiliated Anticon rappers with vaguely Anticon-esque beats, the emcees never stilt the continuity of the album, and in fact, leave you wanting more. Buck 65, whose key strength lies not in his flow or delivery, but in his lyrics and storytelling, delivers the standout performance on ""Stranded"". Dictating to a mindblowing beat backed by a glitchy metronome drumline, fuzzy synth, subtle chimes, and even a saxophone solo, Buck 65 uses his incredible power of description to put the listener inside his story. Here, he introduces us to a hotel owner that ""looked like Peter Fonda and smelled like Jack Daniels"" and a room with ""a sign above the toilet that said 'Don't flush your needles,'"" closing with the memorable couplet, ""Unable to speak, our thoughts were in brackets/ We called it a night and slept in our jackets."" Opening with concurrent waves of distortion, the strongest individual beat comes with the Nick Drake-referencing ""Five Leaves Left (For Lauren)"". Though initially framed by monarchial fanfare with scratches and a classic boom-bap, the sequence quickly shifts to a chopped choir, invoking the work of both Sixtoo (who engineered Sleep No More) and Non Prophets producer Joe Beats. Of course, like most records, Sleep No More isn't without its share of misses: The jarring sound experiment ""Shatter and Splatter"" disrupts the album's flow three-quarters in, while the six-minute closer, ""Breathe"", doesn't offer enough variety to justify its lengthy scratch solo. Nonetheless, two misses out of 17 makes for a pretty solid ratio, and all told, Sleep No More's brilliant journey into sample-based experimentation easily places DJ Signify in a league with the genre's best-known producers.","Too many hip-hop records these days fail to offer a stable atmosphere.

The Summer of Mars,Vera Cruise,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a999c0084474cd0c1076/1:1/w_160/3d5c0946.gif,2004-04-19 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8530-the-summer-of-mars/,Loose,"Vera Cruise aren't tearing down any musical boundaries. Yet another British band appropriating the amateurish DIY clatter and plaid-shirted heartache of the American Midwest, the group echoes the sounds of mid-1990s U.S. rock, artists reared on the commercial juggernaut of grunge who coupled the distorted dynamics of Nirvana to the more sensitive, roots-tinged sound of The Replacements, Pavement, and Uncle Tupelo. To that end, Summer of Mars seems a good decade out of date, but this Scottish act's second full-length is still a pleasant bit of nostalgia trading. Of course, that's not an impression one would get from its god-awful opening title track. With a bone-headed bass riff and frontman Paul Smith's innocuous, say-nothing vocals, the band initially seems to be timidly trying to tag themselves onto the tail end of the current garage revival fixation. Not only does it offer a ghastly first impression, it's also incredibly unrepresentative of the album's overall sound. The rest of Summer of Mars is mostly acoustic fare peppered with occasional shards of amp-shredding noise. And since Vera Cruise are neither great nor particularly inventive, they wisely rely on their ability to deliver their songs on an emotive level: The slow strum of ""Glaciers""-- dressed in slide guitars and close harmonies, with Smith's laconic voice dwelling on past failures (""I know I did the wrong thing just to be here by your side"")-- is reminiscent of Being There-era Wilco. It's this sweet-natured, shirtsleeve-tugging honesty that stands as the record's finest quality. On the whole, this angle works pretty well. ""This Is a Fuse"" litters lyrics like, ""This is my heart; don't fuck around,"" above tight, Replacements-style guitar chords and furious drumming, while ""The Pact"" slowly evolves from sparse and tactless piano chords into a pretty, full-bodied country ballad. Of course, it's hardly a remarkable piece of work, but in the face of tiresome sub-grunge dirges like ""Step Right Up and Meet the Lame"", with its shifts from charmless distortion to weak-limbed jangle, and a handful of unremarkable, workman-like offerings, it fares reasonably well. Judged against a music scene of thrilling, Technicolor diversity, The Summer of Mars simply skulks in the shadows. There are no new ideas, and much of the material here can be sourced back to a few great bands that did it with much more skill, passion, and urgency. Nonetheless, when judged on their own terms, Vera Cruise have produced a good collection of songs full of sunken hope and stained dreams, which manage to swell with empathy and emotion in spite of their trad leanings.","Vera Cruise aren't tearing down any musical boundaries.

Bad Thriller,Abstrackt Keal Agram,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a195ea9e61561daa4832/1:1/w_160/b4397489.gif,2004-04-18 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/435-bad-thriller/,Gooom,"Despite being the butt of many a joke during its salad days, the ""bad thriller"" has become a topic of serious scholarly debate. Dissertations and books have been devoted to the potential feministic undertones of movies like Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Carol Clover's Men, Women and Chainsaws (1993)-- one of the premiere works on the subject-- posited the notion of a so-called Final Girl in slashers as a bastion of feminine righteousness. According to Clover, while all the other tramps are getting hacked during or following a casual sexual encounter, Final Girl abstains from illicit behavior, and ultimately avoids death. Our heroine is cloistered, bookish, and androgynous-- in short, a shameless feminist stereotype. But well-intentioned or not, slasher films are often crass and inelegant-- and, as the adage goes, it's not what you say; it's how you say it. Fortunately, Bad Thriller-- the third album from French synth-hop daemons Abstrackt Keal Agram-- possesses more urbanity and verve than almost anything in the slasher canon. One thing Bad Thriller shares with its namesake film genre is a homespun, low-budget aesthetic. And the three-note acoustic guitar arpeggio and conjoining synth melody at the beginning of its title track sound hauntingly like a prelude to a gory murder-- but that's where the similarities end. While Abstrackt Keal Agram's previous full-length, Cluster Ville, dwelt in dour monotony, Bad Thriller is a sufficiently more upbeat affair, featuring a handful of radiant melodies (case in point: M83's remix of AKA's song titled for Grandaddy's frontman, ""Jason Lytle""). And while songs like ""Street Lamp Confessions (Ghost Version)"" and ""Yo, Rap!"" affirm Abstrackt Keal Agram's penchant for angular beats and turntable stylings, the group's addition of fragile acoustic guitars to their craggy synthscapes, adoption of a more diverse approach to songwriting, and tendency to sing (in often hushed vocals) as often as they rap make this album more well-rounded than its predecessor. ""Delta Force"", in particular, shows the sophistication and hopefulness missing from Cluster Ville: After a gloomy, disjointed opening section-- over which guest vocalist Poor Boy slurs double-tracked vocals like, ""When you wake up, you feel so tired/ Destroyed by the rules of time""-- the song performs a sly turnabout with gorgeous synth glides augmenting a subtly mutating guitar harmony. This song, like most of the LP's others, features discernable parts and complex evolutions, rather than just cascading instrumentation atop a stagnant rhythmic loop. Bad Thriller's liner notes feature Abstrackt Keal Agram's name graffiti'd on a trucker hat, but their music is a novel reconciliation of old-school beatmaking and modern synth-pop in refulgent 32-bit color. Although the album packs an overwhelming number of ideas into a scant 36 minutes-- and occasionally feels thematically and stylistically disjointed-- Abstrackt Keal Agram have vastly improved upon their prior outings. And the fact that these songs were all written and recorded late last year-- immediately following the release of Cluster Ville-- means the improvements came quickly. In my Pitchfork review of Cluster Ville, I tagged Abstrackt Keal Agram ""the hyperkinetic little brothers of the Gooom Disques roster."" Here, their undying enthusiasm has served them well-- and every indication is that they'll only get better.","Despite being the butt of many a joke during its salad days, the ""bad thriller"" has become a topic of ...

Indestructible Object EP,They Might Be Giants,by: Stephen M.

Hard to believe it's been that long. Across more than two decades, the duo-- Johns Flansburgh and Linnell-- have parlayed their silly sense of whimsy into a surprisingly bankable commodity, stretching what could have been merely a novelty act into an enviable career marked by consistent output and a highly loyal fanbase. Furthermore, they've quietly challenged the way pop music is created and disseminated through their Dial-a-Song project, their soundtrack to the 7th issue of the literary magazine McSweeney's, and their collaboration with Marcel Dzama on the children's book Bed Bed Bed. Even more impressive than this array of media, however, is the range of genres they've mastered and the ease with which they can flip through their musical Rolodex, find an interesting style, and introduce it into a song without seeming like dilettantes or stuntmen. Indestructible Object is no great departure for the Giants, but it does provide a fitting illustration of their all-over-the-map approach to making music. The lead-off track, ""Am I Awake?"", with its logic-problem lyrics (""The coffee's cold/ Did I forget to drink it yet?""), floats by in a haze of drum loops that suggest a mildly existential Postal Service nodding off at work. ""Memo to Human Resources"" backs away from the laptop production even as it explores a similar theme of work- and world-weariness: ""I'm busy taking stock of all the things I've forgot/ And making mental notes of just exactly where I lost the plot."" If these first two songs sound a little darker than the Giants' recent fare, then ""Au Contraire"" and ""Ant"" set things back in place. The former namedrops David Bowie (bonus points for calling him ""Dave""), Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jodie Foster, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Mahatma Gandhi. After a groovy flute solo by Doug Wieselman, it ends in a hearty round of ""right on""'s straight out of a 1950s Beat club. ""Ant"" begins like a children's song, with soft vocals and cartoonish lyrics about an ant crawling up your back and nestling in your ear while you're asleep. A tuba joins in on the second verse, oompah-ing a simple bassline. This, however, quickly morphs into a brass band playing ""Hail to the Chief"", then into the house band for Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, and the song explodes into a brass-versus-synths freakout. As the horns run amok, the lyrics grow gradually more political, while the ant becomes president and sends men to ""ransack your house in the nighttime."" The conclusion is grim and somewhat accusatory-- ""But you think that's okay while you're sleeping""-- but political dissent rarely sounds like so much fun. Coming after the mayhem of ""Ant"", the Giants' faithful cover of the Beach Boys' ""Caroline, No"" sounds too staid and inconsequential. Brian Wilson's lament seems to rein in the very qualities that make the rest of Indestructible Object so charming and memorable: the play of musical ideas that mask, but never obscure, deep discontent, and the buried emotions that give shape to the musical experimentation. When allowed to wreak havoc, these tendencies continue to steer the band away from short-lived novelty and give their music meaning beyond the formal exercises.

Jesus Songs,Broken Family Band,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4525e6ef95969320848/1:1/w_160/e1a7b943.gif,2004-04-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1107-jesus-songs/,Track & Field,"There's a part of me that doesn't even want to address the religious overtones that coat this record, not because of any silly aversion to religiously themed music or a discussion of faith, but because talking at length about them seems to force deeper meaning upon them than they seem intended to carry. Copious mentions of Jesus and Mary in both the titles and lyrics on this EP aside, Cambridge, England's Broken Family Band aren't playing devotionals here, nor are they offering any particular critique of Christianity or religion in general; rather, Jesus appears to be just another vehicle for the quartet's Appalachiophiliac explorations of love and loss, and the effects of alcohol on one's senses of balance and abdominal fortitude. So basically, what you have is a four-piece British Americana band who aren't afraid to have a little fun with the #1 Son, and is that really so wrong? Well, when the music is this ingratiating, it certainly is not. Even at their nadir, their puzzlingly straight cover of Neutral Milk Hotel's ""King of Carrot Flowers, Pts. 2 & 3"", these guys display an infectious energy and beery exuberance that marks them as nothing if not endearing. Plus, they had the decency to ask Jeff Mangum if they could kill his song before they went and did it, and you have to respect that. Oddly, wonderfully, The Broken Family Band actually call to mind the captivating weirdness of Neutral Milk Hotel more on a couple of their originals than they do on their cover. Vocalist Steven Adams' tumbling syllables on ""Mother o' Beauty"" nod to Mangum's ""Song Against Sex"", and the jumble of pep and melancholy in the music are in aesthetic harmony with In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. Still, it's not a mere knockoff: The lyrics function as a letter from home, running off a litany of boring family trivia like ""Dave got a cold/ And Sally got married,"" but the choice of phrases reflecting longing and distance turns it profound, the way Ray Davies used to be able to turn domestic dreariness into epiphany. The backbone of the EP is the ""Walking Back to Jesus"" trilogy, three distinct songs that use the title as a hook in completely different contexts. The first opens the disc with a pensive, one-chord skulk, building to a distortion-soaked climax like none other in the band's catalog-- it's the only hint here that bassist Gavin Johnson was once a member of tragically short-lived post-rockers Gwei-Lo, and it's a suitably ass-kicking opener. The acoustic guitar and banjo of the middle installment have a decidedly different tone, and Adams' easy delivery belies his pained soul-searching, flowing swiftly into the refrain of ""I am not your only son, but I am equal to whichever one you compare me to."" ""Part Three"" is the strangest, a slow bob over accordion and Mick Roman's two-stepping drums joined near the fade by a Welsh male voice choir. Jesus Songs is The Broken Family Band's third major release, after a full-length and an EP, and it proves their mettle as transatlantic style-hoppers, as well as fine songsmiths. People looking for some sort of religious experience, either musical or lyrical, aren't going to find them here, and by the same token, folks who cringe at the merest whiff of Christian Coalition evangelizing have nothing to fear from these guys. What listeners will find is some solid Anglicized country and a band to keep an eye on.","There's a part of me that doesn't even want to address the religious overtones that coat this record ...

Lost Light,Old Time Relijun,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bcc0084474cd0c269d/1:1/w_160/4b24590c.jpg,2004-04-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5972-lost-light/,K,"When I saw Old Time Relijun at Tonic a few months ago, guitarist and vocalist Arrington de Dionyso wore no beard to obscure his baby face. Without his ragged mountain-man facade, de Dionyso's distinctive voice lacked its familiar context; instead of an unhinged woodsman chopping demons, a bespeckled indie-rock geek spat possessed tongues, hillbilly ire, and the gurgling howl of a vampiric Jon Spencer. To confuse things further, this end-times preacher was swaddled in a red sweatsuit emblazoned with ""Oriental is the world famous country"" and accompanied by a picture of Italy. I really love these disjunctions: Ted Bundy didn't resemble a killer, pre-makeover Clay Aiken was an unlikely pop star, I can't believe it's not butter. As I saw it that night, this figure somehow swallowed a maniacal banshee who flooded the club with its angry presence whenever this sorcerer opened his mouth. Perhaps due in part to my confused expectations, Old Time Relijun was unstoppable that night-- an endless well of Beefheart goodness. ""Cold Water"", from Lost Light, was especially propulsive, constructed with an extended build-up and an eventual shout-along of the song's title by new double bassist Aaron Hartman and drummer Rives Elliot (the latter replacing The Microphones' Phil Elvrum) before de Dionyso ended the set with an extended jaw harp solo. There are no jaw harp or solo excursions on Old Time Relijun's fifth album-- it's all about teamwork (well, that and storytelling). An intense 30 minutes, Lost Light features the band's catchiest, most filled-out songs to date-- a sure-footed treat after the unevenness of 2003's rarities collection, Varieties of Religious Experience, whose lack of narrative pull was its primary weakness; as if Old Time Relijun are responding Roxanne-style to my prodding, Lost Light is a goddamn concept album. At first glance, Lost Light's song cycle seems to document an estrangement from innocence (or Eden). Complicating this otherwise easy read is an Olympic-sized pool of water imagery-- amniotic fluid, rivers, rain-- as well as an endless quest, oral sex as ablution, Blakean naturalism, the gnashing of teeth, and addictive poison (I'm thinking Bel Biv DeVoe). Upon closer inspection-- and with the help of ""Dark of the Male, Light of the Female"" from 2001's Witchcraft Rebellion for imagistic explanation-- it's more about old-fashioned love. That's an interpretation that's backed by de Dionyso himself, who told me via e-mail: ""My songs use the language of alchemy and dreams to find new (and ancient) ways of talking about love-- the entire process of having, losing, finding, rejecting, coming to terms with, being in love. Lost Light tells the classic story of the Shaman's Soul Retrieval."" Amidst that dense tale, Old Time Relijun twist and shake the three-minute pop song. Banged together with Thinking Fellers Union Local #282's angular and unhinged guitarissimo, album opener ""The Door I Came Through Has Been Closed (But I Keep Trying)"" mutates as it swivels, swings, and saves. It also announces de Dionyso's Proclaimers-like intentions: ""I walk the streets of the city/ I walk alone in the city/ I keep trying to/ Find you."" The previously mentioned, ""Cold Water"" is a swift eight minutes: De Dionyso tracks a vision quest, water, and himself through trees, roots, mud, rock, soil and sand. The instrumental ""Music of the Spheres"" chimes with the confusion of a flood-zone and ""Cold Water, Deep Underwater"" is a chill-out sans vocals with wrangler gee-tar and precisely constant water torture drumming. ""The Rising Water, The Blinding Light""-- with lines such as, ""Devil and the angels making eyes at each other/ They wanna be inside of each other""-- feels like Flannery O'Connor damnation as sexual come-on, a crazed monological call-and-response of dizzying spells invoking Nick Cave. The album even ends with a reference to rock's most-famous lovers, John and Yoko, via the ""put down your sword"" of the joyful ""War Is Over"". Critics mention a musician's parent's occupation when it adds to or helps create a mythology. With that shop secret in mind, de Dionyso was raised in Arkansas and Spokane, WA as the son of Methodist ministers. And Lost Light is his most confident, explosive sermon. When a band this manic attempts concision while still working within its raging form, the ideal result is a super-tight documentation of howling at the moon. Lost Light has that swagger. As the poem inside the album suggests (""I'm the kind of king that likes the night/ Ashes and dust are my glittering crown/ I found my queen/ I go down/ For my underground queen""), this is a cracked, art-rock Odyssey, a collection of warped hillbilly booty jams for folks who've misplaced something and want like hell to find it.","When I saw Old Time Relijun at Tonic a few months ago, guitarist and vocalist Arrington de Dionyso wore no ...

Doodle Loot Doodle a Doo,Bing Ji Ling,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4509d034d5c69bf3036/1:1/w_160/da711c8c.jpg,2004-04-15 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1106-doodle-loot-doodle-a-doo/,Kreme Kool,"So you heard about Bing Ji Ling's smirking soul cover of AC/DC's ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" on Ubiquity's Rewind Vol. 3? Here's the scoop: Bing Ji Ling is a guy's name. Bing Ji Ling also translates to ""ice cream"" in Mandarin. Bing Ji, the man, wants you to believe ice cream is an aphrodisiac. Bing Ji, the band, appears in concert with the dudes from No Doubt-- drummer Adrian Young and guitarist Tom Dumont-- dressed in 1950s Good Humor Man outfits. Bing Ji Ling also employs former pro skater Tommy Guerrero on bass, but on his debut album, Doodle Loot Doodle a Doo, he plays just about every instrument by himself; crisp, Cool Whip production is provided by the very interrogative Merkley???. Bing Ji Ling is actually S.F. white boy/soul man/sundae fanatic Quinn Luke, and Bing is funkier than Fudgie the Whale with a blunt in his blowhole. If Sly was a one-man family or if Beck and Prince took a double dip, it would taste something like this. All good humor aside, Luke and Merkley??? clearly understand that the fundamentals of funk come down to hooks, texture and innuendo, and there are good 'n"" plenty of all three here. The album starts off with the filtered wah-wah guitar and Casiotone percussion of ""Do What I Gotta Do"". A party-starting screamer, the song climaxes with a looped one-man choir delivering quivering background vocals alongside swaggering horn splashes that erupt in an orgiastic P-Funky eargasm. The song sets the bar damn high in terms of production quality and giddy, goony charm, and though there's diversity throughout the rest of the album's 46 minutes, the cookie never crumbles. ""Put Your Hand in Mine' is a midtempo organ grind as Luke wails like his Rhodes, ""I've been through some sticky clover/ But now my picking is over."" The robotic handclaps on ""Can't Say Much"" crack over the layered, pitch-shifted vocals, while ""So Natural"" brings Steely Dan together with Prince in a cokeheads 'n' cream wet dream. Weighing in at the halfway mark is the anthemic ""Money in the Meter"". Up to this point, lyrically speaking, there's a common theme of go-for-broke, wet-sheets sexual abandon, and ""Meter"" follows suit. No Doubt's Young makes his only album appearance here, keeping a real time beat snapping under a rubbery guitar lick and the chant-worthy chorus. It's easy to imagine this song killing it live, as it offers not only the repeated lyrics (""Put your money in the meter/ Stay for a while"") but a scathingly sexy, shimmering melodic swing. After these six minutes of unfettered flirtatiousness there's no way you won't go back to Doodle Loot for at least a second lick. From the rambunctious ""Meter"", the album smoothes into denouement with a blissful post-coital melt. Despite the focus on sugary melody, these last five songs are about unanswered booty calls; somehow, after all his carousing, Luke (or rather, alter-ego Bing Ji Ling) hits a rocky road with the ladies and can't find the right flavor. ""Where Is Your Love"" is a bittersweet psychedelic soul ballad buttered by ambient synths and lush vocals, and the almost-acoustic ""You"" is a doo-wop lament of lost love and failed reconciliation skipping along over a chunky funk-hop rhythm. It all comes to a surprisingly tender finale with ""Time to Breathe"", as Luke/Ling woos, ""Time to breathe has taught me/ I can never get enough of your love."" When the music comes to a swooning stop, check out the ridiculously clever CD packaging: the inside features five separate makeout scenes-- a pint of empty ""Bing Ji Ling Ice Cream"" in the foreground of each-- while the outside is a five-panel spread of a long-locked, custom-airbrush-suited Luke doing the disco at his favorite scoop shop. Mixing Ben & Jerry's instrumental density with snow-cone sweet lyrics, Doodle Loot balances the chocolate with the vanilla and makes for one delicious swirl.","So you heard about Bing Ji Ling's smirking soul cover of AC/DC's ""You Shook Me All Night ...

Licensed to Ill,Beastie Boys,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2439d034d5c69bf2b65/1:1/w_160/3483e009.gif,2004-04-15 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/607-licensed-to-ill/,Def JamDef Jam,"""Look, I don't know why, but George Wagoner is going to kick my ass today.

""Shut up, bitch, I'm telling you I can't wait for the bus because they know where I catch it. You have to try to get Mr. Davis to drive around to the side like he sometimes does for Chris. I'm gonna go out the back, from the cafeteria. And I already talked to Nick, but he just said he didn't know if he could do anything.

""Yeah, fool, that's the one who I told about skins. That's what I was talking about."" ""Yeah, she's crafty and she's just Dom's type. Hahahaha!!!"" ""She is a crafty bitch."" Poltergeists and Licensed to Ill: Some things only make sense to kids. Too many years removed from junior high, they tend only to reveal themselves in annoying bursts of violence, confusion and rhymes like Abe Vigoda. And it's not even because their appeal is particularly juvenile, but rather that they operate in a realm only comprehensible to the innocent; those untouched by the brutal reality of the real world, where everyday injustice skews our perception to the point that what might have been common sense to us as adolescents now seems mystifying. To little Carol Anne, Ad-Rock simply is another child. New York brats-cum-activists Beastie Boys have gone to great pains to explain the error of their 80s ways. This is not to say they've been apologetic, but only too keen to emphasize the arcs of their characters over the years. Licensed to Ill, like Cooky Puss and the underrated Rock Hard EP before it, were indeed both impressively ahead of their time, and rudimentary to the extreme. How a city that already had ESG felt it needed the Beastie Boys in the mid-80s is a question that confounds the ages; yet, Ad-Rock, MCA and Mike D could hardly have predicted the slacker generation better if they'd tried (which they didn't). Chalk it up to NYC eclecticism, perhaps. Chalk it up to Run-DMC and Madonna, who helped showcase them to the most economically and culturally powerful generation of kids since the boomers. Chalk it up to Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin. And MTV. Most of all, remember that at their worst, these guys got thrown out of White Castle for being too loud. Licensed to Ill is given a lot of credit for predating the whole rap-rock thing of the 90s. Bad news for the Beasties: History appears to contradict that assessment. First of all, their cornball Cali cousins the Red Hot Chili Peppers had already graced the earth with two LPs prior to Ill, not to mention beating them to the 70s funk revival by working with George Clinton. Secondly, contrary to most rock writers' beliefs, white guys + guitars do not necessarily = rock. Had they released Ill even four years later, it would have been a novelty record. It's dated remarkably badly, while Rick Rubin's skill with the mixer (and drum machine) is entirely questionable. The rhymes... well... ""I got franks and pork and beans/ Always bust the new routines."" ""Spent some bank, I got a high powered jumbo/ Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo."" ""I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious/ Fly around the world but it makes me nauseous."" ""Get ready/ 'Cause this ain't funny/ My name's Mike D and I'm about to get money."" Okay, so it isn't the music or all the rhymes that translate beyond the scene of the crime. What, then? Probably just that the Beasties didn't give a fuck-- AND AMERICA DESPERATELY NEEDED TO BE SHOWN HOW NOT TO GIVE A FUCK. And it sort of still does. Licensed to Ill demonstrated that you could be ""groundbreaking"" and ""important,"" and still have no goals beyond getting drunk before 6th period. Think about that. It meant that you could live life as one giant inside joke, speaking in tongues and making hilarious references to Chef Boyardee with no one outside your circle of jerks the wiser. Sorry ma, forgot to take out the trash, but that's okay because I drink Brass Monkey and I rock well. ""What?"" ""Nothing."" In light of this information, it almost seems pointless to recap the highlights. Does anyone really care that ""Rhymin' and Stealin"""" witnessed Rubin's genius for exposing the sample-ability of Led Zeppelin? No, because, ""My pistol is loaded, I shot Betty Crocker/ Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker"" is awesome, and if you don't get it then what-the-fuck-ever. Does it matter that ""Fight for Your Right"" actually does kind of invent rap-rock? No, because everyone has their best porno mag, and these guys are just telling it like it is, and rap is the CNN of rock. Do you know what ""I did it with my whiffleball bat"" means? Has anyone ever even been to Brooklyn? Who in their right mind is sampling Creedence? Is ""I should have probably guessed her gay"" the best line ever, or is it when they brag about having more rhymes than Phyllis Diller? Despite its seeming defiance of respectable society, there is no shortage of folks who would canonize Licensed to Ill-- hence this new edition, replete with commemorative DVD. For Miller's sake, it's the Beastie Boys' worst record. (Even though we all secretly know it's their best.) Yet, there's something impressive about tapping into the secret language of the immature and terminally slack. All these years later, with every listen, it becomes clearer to me that you can never really outrun your inner idiot.","""Look, I don't know why, but George Wagoner is going to kick my ass today.

Peppered with Spastic Magic,Two Lone Swordsmen,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a856ea9e61561daa57d1/1:1/w_160/86e59034.jpg,2004-04-15 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8226-peppered-with-spastic-magic/,Rotters Golf Club,"Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. That's an old maxim in which Two Lone Swordsmen's Andrew Weatherall and Keith Tenniswood are clearly well-versed, because for eight years, they've been generating solid remixes from even the most paltry of source material. Fortunately, the dependable East London duo has also been invited to tinker with some well-oiled engines in their day. These sonic alchemists have reprogrammed a wealth of original music by everyone from Paul Weller to David Holmes-- pausing along the way to craft some of Warp Records' most consistently satisfying work. If only for convenience's sake, the new remix collection Peppered With Spastic Magic is an essential selection, one that should please even the likes of unlikely collaborators Starsailor, who, right about now, should probably be looking to the abundance of TLS collectivists to balance their own fading sales. The more likely TLS allies in Slam have a pretty good hold on effective dance floor mechanics, and Weatherall and Tenniswood capitalize on that expertise with a riotous yet faithful vocal mix of ""Visions"". Although that track is a fairly recognizable regurgitation, it's nestled among an album's worth of wayward hijackings. Covering nearly a decade's worth of tracks, the album acts as a cross-section of TLS's history. ""Put Your Arms Around Me (Electric for Bird Mix)"" consumes Texas in a constellation of delicate eeriness and techno deconstruction that was the hallmark of TLS's 2000 release Tiny Reminders. Howie B's ""Angels Go Bald Too"" is fed through the same strange machinery that imbued 1998's Stay Down with quirky melancholia-- as darkly alien as it is irrepressibly seductive. Long time Weatherall favorites Lali Puna are given room to breathe within an intensely warm and reflective rendering of ""Nin-Com-Pop"", revealing a resilient tenderness scattered throughout its chilly beats. It's a shame that only 13 tracks were selected to represent Two Lone Swordsmen's rich remix legacy-- particularly when only half of them are of high quality. For instance, a relatively weak and dated Stereo MCs rehash is included at the expense of any number of better works could have been chosen instead to rub shoulders with the elating electro treatment of Primal Scream's ""Stuka"". Still, there is a staggeringly high level of quality that infests just about everything TLS touch. Their sound is as synonymous with technical prowess as it is with instinctive innovation, and Peppered with Spastic Magic retains a contemporaneous air despite its timeline, one which is an eon in terms of modern electronic music. And if TLS's imminent From the Double Gone Chapel is as mold-breaking and transitional as it's rumored to be, Peppered will be a worthy summary of Messrs. Weatherall and Tenniswood Mk. I, the moment before they turn their revisionist talents to rewriting their own legacy.","Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. That's an old maxim in which Two ...

Reel to Real Cacophony / Empires and Dance,Simple Minds,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66413d1975652139191/1:1/w_160/6c0ebbf8.jpg,2004-04-15 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11840-reel-to-real-cacophony-empires-and-dance/,Virgin,"""Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out"" Oh yeah, Simple Minds. They're that Breakfast Club band, with the ""(Don't You) Forget About Me"" song, right? Well, yes. But years before that, they were just one more upstart band toiling in the post-punk swamp of the late-70s UK, cutting tangled avant-dance records for the clubs in Orwell's Oceania. And after years of letting them languish Stateside as U2 clones from the decade of hairspray and coke, Virgin has now gone and given their early catalog the remaster/reissue treatment for a new, more danceable decade. What a time to be alive. I'm not going to set any Simple Minds LP up as a masterpiece, because I'd be lying if I did, but they nevertheless made a few excellent albums, and they're certainly worth a look and a listen for folks who just can't get enough of that wonderful post-punk. Although Virgin has reissued 12 Simple Minds albums-- nearly their entire oeuvre-- I've chosen to focus on two of their most wonderfully strange records, 1979's Reel to Real Cacophony and 1980's Empires and Dance, the band's sophomore and junior albums, respectively. These two albums feature Simple Minds pulling themselves together musically and finding their direction. Here, the band is moving away from its disorganized debut, Life in a Day (to say it was padded with filler is pretty charitable) and toward the expansive, reverb-soaked anthems that characterized its greatest achievement, 1982's New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84), and their eventual string of U.S. hits. Reel to Real is the wildest ride the Simple Minds ever went on, foraying into soundscape weirdness (check the bugged-out bass riff that lends contour to the ambient squiggle of ""Veldt""), as well as spiky mirror-ball rock and gothic motorik. Jim Kerr's vocals wouldn't yet attain their full Bonoesque bombast for a few years-- here, he instead falls somewhere between Bryan Ferry and Colin Newman, at once spastic and strangely reserved. ""Reel to Real"" opens the album at a crawl, with the band banging out a cockeyed rhythm and Kerr snaking through it wraithlike. The album's peaks include the wickedly loopy ""Carnival (Shelter in a Suitcase)"", which veers between Can of Bees psych verses and crazy circus synth parts over percolating bass, and ""Changeling"", a bristling dance track led by a nasty, fuzzed-out synth. ""Changeling"" pairs nicely with ""Premonition"", which-- with its insistent bass and Kerr's bombastic chorus-- is the album's best predicator of the band's future. The approach is more refined on Empires and Dance, but at that time, Simple Minds still hadn't completely reined in their experimental tendencies. ""Twist/Run/Repulsion"" shows the band's Roxy Music influence more clearly than any of their other songs. Not only do Kerr's motormouth vocals sound like Ferry, but the dissonant horn blasts, syncopated bassline, and recording of a female announcer speaking French over an intercom kick it quite a bit further into leftfield than it initially seems willing to go. The album is much slower than its predecessor, but is nevertheless dominated by a triumvirate of propulsive songs that break up the medium pacing. Opener ""I Travel"" whips along on machine-gun synth, bumping bass, and big keyboards. ""This Fear of Gods"" is a harrowing seven-minute epic of collapsing reverb and buoyant rhythm. The Teutonic synthesizer and choppy beat of ""Thirty Frames a Second"" make a strange mix, but work nicely under Kerr's twitchy shouting. Whether you should approach Simple Minds' earliest material depends on your appetite for the open-ended aesthetics of the post-punk era. The band's early albums nestle nicely next to Wire's 154, The Sound's Propaganda, Shriekback's Care, and Neu!'s 75. Each of these two Simple Minds records has its share of inessential material, but that is greatly outweighed by the good stuff. A thoughtfully chosen highlight reel from the band's first six albums would really be an ideal introduction but, as none exists, either of these albums would be a good doorway to an oft-neglected band.","

Vetiver,Vetiver,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9979d034d5c69bf3c9a/1:1/w_160/1ce22b5e.jpg,2004-04-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8528-vetiver/,Dicristina,"As unlikely as it sounds, the fairy tale might be the very next epicenter of indie inspiration: the intersection between underground music and storybook musings has never been so curiously explicit, with contemporary bands starting to mine, unapologetically, the willfully suspended disbelief that goes along with bedtime stories and ancient cautionary fables. Psych-folk warblers Vetiver (with Andy Cabic, Devendra Banhart, Alissa Anderson, and Jim Gaylord) have opted to cluster, hold hands, and skip the line between deviously surreal and lullingly pleasant, leading us all very, very deep into the forest, leaving no trail of breadcrumbs in sight. Vetiver could very well be the blurry soundtrack to a delirious fever dream: The band's self-titled debut is a dizzyingly euphoric tangle of freaked-out folk and scratchy strings, all twisted sheets and sweaty brows, upside-down trees and wicked flowers. Anchored by Cabic's tousled vocals and Banhart's amber guitar strums, Vetiver is swampy and sublime, a compelling mix of sweet, candlelit laments and jagged hymns. A sizable clump of guest-players help out here-- Joanna Newsom tickles a harp (""Amerile""), Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval offers backing coos (""Angels' Share""), and former My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm O'Ciosoig putters stoically at his kit (""Luna Sea"", ""On a Nerve""). But it's Devendra Banhart who ultimately infuses Cabic's soft, fraying songs with wooly layers of warmth. Banhart's semi-infamous transcontinental loping (see substantial stints in Paris and Venezuela, and a handful of years logged as a roaming mistral, squatting, playing, and recording songs on a friend's answering machine) tend to pump his solo records full of whimsy, and unsurprisingly, Banhart's nomadic tendencies lend Vetiver the same kind of strange, rambling diversity. ""Amour Fou"", one of two songs Banhart co-wrote with Cabic, is so charmingly bizarre that listening feels a little bit like pedaling through the French countryside on a three-seat bicycle: precarious, exuberant, and inexcusably weird. Scratchy banjo, acoustic guitar, and a bit of bass tumble together girlishly, while Banhart and Cabic enthusiastically bellow, ""Love-love-love-love-crazy love/ Amour fou-ooooh!"" Curl your fingers around the handlebars and let the purple streamers fly: No matter how hard you try, Vetiver is too blissfully strange for your sofa alone. Cabic's delicate voice (as previously heard in the Simple Machines band The Raymond Brake) can swing from salty to sweet within a single syllable, and is anchored here only by his gingerly picked guitar and yawning swells of violin-- like a gentler Tom Waits (or a throatier Donovan), Cabic is happy to marry the familiar and the strange, warbling quietly (and occasionally in romance languages) over plucky layers of instrumentation. ""Without a Song"" bashfully mixes high and low noisemaking, with impeccable cello and violin lines rubbing up against prehistoric foot-tapping-as-percussion, while opener ""Oh Papa"" swirls contentedly, strings and guitar finding easy communion. Blame Thom Monahan's naked production, or the band's presumably ancient instruments, but something about Vetiver feels entirely anachronistic, impossibly devoid of 21st century stamps. Still, while Vetiver have successfully eschewed contemporary gloss in favor of following weird, primeval whims, their neo-psych musings are always tender and accessible, as quirky and warm as a well-worn Nick Drake tape. Somehow, all lyric abstractions and structural foibles seem perfectly reasonable in context, each ancient folksong gloriously comprehensible, despite incompatibility of time and place. Thus, when Cabic howls about ""the shape of things to come"" (on closing epic ""On a Nerve""), it somehow seems like far more than just a thinly veiled Ornette Coleman reference, or a vague prediction-- it sounds like a promise for the future.","As unlikely as it sounds, the fairy tale might be the very next epicenter of indie inspiration: the intersection between ...

Baby Blue,Mary Lou Lord,by: Stephen M.

At least not lately. Back in the early 1990s, she was an alt-pin-up girl with a throwback hairstyle, breathy voice, and smart, stripped-down songs-- mostly other people's, but who really cared? She released a few seven-inch singles and two EPs (one of which contained the fabulous fanboy rebuke ""His Indie World"") before finally signing with then-Sony subsidiary The Work Group. On a cold day in January 1998, she released Got No Shadow, a charming collection of covers (Freedy Johnston, Elizabeth Cotton) and impressive originals (""Western Union Desperate""). And then she promptly disappeared, rumored to be battling a drug addiction, with only a live album and a split single with Sean Na Na to hold fans over. Six years later, Got No Shadow still charms, but Lord has lost most, if not all, of her indie relevance, despite returning to an indie label-- pal Nick Salmon's Rubric Records-- for her new album, Baby Blue. The move away from the majors coincides with a shift from the precise, pristine pop of Got No Shadow to a looser, janglier sound that, unfortunately, recalls early Shawn Colvin. For a singer who idolizes ""my Joni, my Nick, Neil, and Bob,"" this is not an unexpected move, but neither is it a successful one. As on all of her previous releases, Lord believed above all else in the power of the well-written song, in its commanding ability to convey intimate emotions and complex ideas equally well. But her stalwart devotion proves both a strength and a liability on Baby Blue. For one thing, she has strong material that makes for memorable tracks like ""43"", in which she questions her relationship with either a young lover or her young fans: ""Seventeen/ Wonder what you see in me/ I'm going on 43."" Tracks like ""The Wind Blew All Around Me"" and ""Farming It Out"" reveal Lord's insecurities, mostly about her career, with surprising candor, while ""Ron"" is a tearjerker about a single mother waiting for her daughter's father to return. But too often, Lord's approach to her lyrics is overly reverent, to the detriment of the music itself. Especially in the album's midsection, her backing band churns out country-rock rhythms so bland they seem designed specifically not to distract from the words. But it's not always the best package for the lyrics-- the effect is much like wrapping sparkling jewelry in dull newsprint. On songs like ""Because He's Leaving"" and ""The Inhibition Twist"", the music either sounds completely disconnected from her vocals or completely drowns them out. ""Stars Burn Out"" slows down until it almost stops completely, and Lord's cover of Pink Floyd's ""Fearless"" is a showcase more for the reined-in band than for her vocals, resulting in an attention-straining five-minute anticlimax. Fortunately, Baby Blue ends not with ""Fearless"", but with ""Old Tin Tray"", a modest little jingle reminiscent of Got No Shadow's ""Shake Sugaree"". In its simplicity and unpretentious directness it recalls Lord's early work, which is appropriate: Baby Blue sounds like the work of a much younger, less confident artist-- one who's closer to 17 than 43. More than a decade into her unpredictable career, Lord seems like she's still grasping for a comfortable mix of guitar and vocals, not quite sure what works best with her unique voice.","Mary Lou Lord doesn't fit into your indie world.

Dumb Loud Hollow Twang [Deluxe Edition],Bambi Molesters,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a204c0084474cd0bff54/1:1/w_160/2884d57e.gif,2004-04-14 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/539-dumb-loud-hollow-twang-deluxe-edition/,Dancing Bear,"So imagine you're a band trying to find studio time. No problem, right? You scrape some cash together and hit the beat. Make a few phone calls, get some comparative hourly rates, and determine which you can most afford. Maybe you've even got a label willing to pay for all that studio time. Even simpler, then. But. Say your country is still recovering from a brutal ethno-religious conflict that decimated its neighboring country and ravaged much of the countryside. You're an unsigned surf band in the middle of Eastern Europe-- Croatia, to be exact-- and you want to cut a record. Not so easy now. This is the daunting situation that faced The Bambi Molesters, the Balkans' finest purveyors of good, old-fashioned surf-rock, when they set out in the late 90s to put to tape some of their ultra-reverent, unironic paeans to The Ventures, Duane Eddy, and Dick Dale. When they finally loaned some space from an acquaintance, they had precious little time to record the album, and as a result, they wound up blasting it out in a span of just a few hours, one take per song. The sound was muddy, the cymbals bled into every microphone, and the label owner they finally got to distribute it-- Igor Banjanin of Dirty Old Town Records-- had to hit up loan sharks to get it distributed. That was seven years ago. In the interim, the Molesters have cultivated ties to R.E.M. and The Minus 5 (they toured together in Europe), managed to get an album out in the U.S. (2002's fantastic Sonic Bullets, on which both Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey guested), and watched as Croatia stabilized and put its war behind it. As the generous liners to this re-recording of that shaky start attest, they were never happy with the sound of their debut. So, with their newfound stability, they decided to try it again, and even threw in a few extra songs to boot. The material they were writing out of the gate demonstrates a remarkably deep understanding of what made original surf music work so well, from the Spanish and Greek influences in the melodies to the snapping spring reverb that enveloped the guitars of Dick Dale and Link Wray. This stuff sounds so real, so honest, it could only have been made by people unaware of its relative kitsch value in the U.S. Modern American surf bands like Man... or Astroman?, The Aquabats and The Surfers operate fully aware of Beach Blanket Bingo and Quentin Tarantino's employment of ""Misirlou"" in Pulp Fiction, and it inevitably colors the way they approach the music; Man... or Astroman?, in particular, compound the kitsch factor by pouring on samples of Japanese monster movies and old drag-race flicks. Though a few of these songs fail to fully demonstrate the compositional brilliance that characterized Sonic Bullets, most of these early Molesters tunes can hang ten with anything just below ""Rabble Rouser"" and ""Walk Don't Run"" in the surf pantheon, with the one-two punch of ""Wanganui"" and ""Hot Water Pool"", opening things with a wave of huge, twangy melody and tremolo'd chords. ""Hot Water Pool"" now has the added benefit of a rock-solid horn arrangement, which punches the energy level up even further. The sound this time out is clear and cavernous, as it should be, and band sounds utterly confident with the material. One of the remarkable things about The Bambi Molesters is how much of their own original material they play, as a lot of surf bands lean heavily on standards for a lot of their material. However, a few old chestnuts-- like The Surftones' ""Cecilia Ann"" (best known today as the lead track on the Pixies' Bossa Nova) and ""Margaya""-- do crop up, each attacked with enthusiastic passion. Dumb Loud Hollow Twang isn't the best place to meet The Bambi Molesters; with its more advanced compositions and perfect sound, Sonic Bullets is really the best of both worlds. Still, it's nice that it's been made available in the States, and anyone into surf will definitely want to check it out. It's always refreshing to hear a solid, untainted take on a well-worn American genre.",,7.2,
The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash,Jason Forrest,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be89ea9e61561daa78ec/1:1/w_160/9d36a312.jpg,2004-04-14 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3290-the-unrelenting-songs-of-the-1979-post-disco-crash/,Sonig,"When Pitchfork electronic music guru Mark Richardson notes that there's been a ""perceptible dip in interest in experimental electronic music in recent years""-- as he recently did in his review of Fennesz's exceptional Venice-- I'm inclined to trust his judgment. What's always reluctantly been called IDM does seem less compelling by the day, victimized by both process music that makes for a better backstory than listening experience and a roughly three-year flood of experimental electronic refuges seeking shelter in the more rewarding and head-turning world of tech-house. The rise of tech-house-- and its annexation of the best work of former Clicks & Cuts-style producers such as Vladislav Delay, Hakan Libdo, Reinhard Voigt, and Jan Jelinek-- may seem like a very large nail in IDM's potential pine box, but it also pointed a way forward for electronic head music. The message: Shave your beard. Loosen up. Have fun. Since then, several artists have pulled off the trick by re-engaging with clubland, making music that-- while compelling in any environment-- often works best in a dancefloor context. Jason Forrest doesn't make dance music, but unlike most IDM producers he doesn't shy away from the vitality and immediacy of it, either. Forrest is still probably best known as Donna Summer, former host of WFMU's ""Advanced D&D;"" radio program and leader of the impish breakcore collective Cock Rock Disco. That tag is essentially what The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash sounds like: brash and big, furious and frantic, and best enjoyed loud. And it's performed with a sly wink and nods to everyone from Prefuse 73 to dj/Rupture, while drawing samples from sources as diverse as Talking Heads, Elton John, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and The Who. Forrest isn't much for minimalism. Perhaps a lesson learned from his WFMU days, he offers his listeners instant gratification-- which is a good thing, as these days, our fingers twitch just as impatiently over the iPod dial as they do the radio tuner. So, like The Avalanches' Since I Left You or Basement Jaxx's Kish Kash, this is a maximalist record. Sounds and ideas come quickly, make their points, and never outstay their welcome. In that sense, The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash is also inclusive, a post-mashup dragnet that sweeps metal, drill-n-bass, gabba, disco, and familiar FM rock staples into a single pie and then slices it with precision. For about 40 seconds, album opener ""Spectacle to Refute All Judgments"" seems like another example of music-making that struggles to make the leap from idea to execution, as Forrest applies to disco the slice-and-dice aesthetic that Scott Herren has used on hip-hop. Then comes the first guitar solo. And the big glam stomp. And the second guitar solo. And the drum solo. And... well, it quickly becomes clear that Forrest has a lot of cards up his sleeve, and little interest in holding any of them close to his chest for any length of time. Which works beautifully: ""Satan Cries Again"" tears through CCR's jungle, pausing only for a motorik pep rally; ""An Event (helicopter.passing.(edit).251001.mp3)"" is solemn and hypnotic from a distance before being swept up in the winds of a clusterfuck of organ sounds; and ""180 Mar Ton"" sounds like the Amen break crossing the river Styx. The liberal sampling of classic rock on what is at heart a disco-cum-noise record shouldn't be much of a hurdle for potential fans to jump: The arena-ready guitars serve the same sort of capacity as breakbeats do in Big Beat records-- as patient, friendly guides for those who don't normally listen to electronic music-- while the sensual futurism of ""Ceci N'est Pas du Disco"" or deep house tribalism of ""INKhUK"" is far too infectious to be ignored, even by the biggest guitar-phobics. Forrest does, however, have The Who to thank for his show-stopping album closer, ""10 Amazing Years"". The record's most ferocious and Unrelenting track, it's also oddly the most patient and straightforward, eschewing most of the ADD tendencies of the rest of the album. Except for a heavily reprogrammed Ringo Starr drum solo and an extra kick of guitar at the end, it's essentially filter disco meets classic rock. It's The Who in their prime covering ""Da Funk"", with a half-dozen or so bare and, yes, fairly minimal elements drifting in and out of the track at different times before they all come crashing together for one glorious finale. Were it at the start of the record, it would cast a long shadow over the rest of it. As it is, it just makes you want to dive in and hear the whole thing over again.","When Pitchfork electronic music guru Mark Richardson notes that there's been a ""perceptible dip in interest in experimental electronic ...

"Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2",Various Artists,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81c13d197565213959a/1:1/w_160/454dc032.gif,2004-04-13 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2042-gooom-tracks-vol-2/,Gooom,"Gooom Disques knows what it's working with. The parvenu French label's brand of electronic music is sleek, stylish, and occasionally flashy, but never tawdry. Its artists are young and highly accessible, and their music eschews radicalism and experimentation in favor of a more direct, melodic approach. The result is musically fashionable as only the French could make it: complex, and yet somehow pedestrian. Take, for instance, the artwork on the label's new sampler, Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2: All white text on black background, sans-serif font embellished by strokes of sparse graffiti. It's strikingly sophisticated, yet may well have been slapped together in MS Paint-- perfect for this album of bedroom symphonies from enthusiastic tweens. Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2 features remixes of original works by 16 artists spanning the entire Gooom roster. The theme yields generally interesting and occasionally breathtaking results, albeit working within a far less stringent set of guidelines than many undie electronic mixtapes. Gooom Tracks is more of a sampler squared, purposely packed to the hilt with as many artists as possible. Of course, while it's certainly a colorful and unbridled showcase of over two dozens talents, the format may not be the best or most germane representation of the Gooom roster. But many of these tracks do show prodigious ability and a fluent chemistry that's rare among so large a label. Kicking things off is an acoustic version of Cyann & Ben's ""Buick to the Moon"", a somber, slightly soporific number that shows the group's folk-tinged electronic songwriting at its most elemental. Backed by mournful organs moving at a funereal pace, the Buick might as well be a hearse, but the song is short enough not to stifle the album's energy before it even gets going. Next is ""Wounded Knee Creek"", a collaboration between Purple Confusion and Bartuf which works well in two respects: Not only does the song, a driving neo-shoegaze romp that smacks as much of M83 as it does of power-pop, propel the album with enough energy to sustain the subsequent few tracks, it also segues perfectly into the pitch-shifted squeals that introduce Mils' heady remix of Atoms Family's ""High on Life"". That track, though built upon fairly straightforward verse-exchange, is pulled to shreds by wanton electronics and reassembled as breakcore. Listening to it is akin to nose-breathing underwater. From there, Gooom Tracks loses nary a step throughout its rousing first half. KG's airy, Rhodes-driven ""S.P.E.C.T.R.E.2"" offers a refreshing counterpoint to the aggressive Mils track, and is anchored by just enough melancholia to keep the lithe instrumentation from blowing away. Featuring an intoxicating vocal melody courtesy of Computer Pink, this deceptively complex track is easily the album's most affecting moment. Similarly effective, though not quite to the same degree, are songs by Steve & Rob, Erich Zahn (ft. Moughqual), and follow-up appearances by Purple Confusion and Cyann & Ben. Even The Atoms Family's ham-fisted, unmolested verses on Abstrackt Keal Agram's ""Street Lamp Confession"" fail to disrupt to the album's structure. Unlike most samplers, Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2 is sectioned into two distinct sides, and begs for vinyl bifurcation. Its diffuse first side delves into various styles, but remains strong, track-for-track. The cloistered strumming, Gregorian harmonizing, and sucrose electronics of Mils' ""Mardi"", as performed by Cyann & Ben, offers an ideal bookend to side one, and sheds entirely new light on Mils after their ambiguous earlier appearance. Until this point, Gooom Tracks is impressively solid by any measure, and downright spectacular by mixtape standards. The album is holistically disjointed, roundabout in sequence, yet uniquely adherent. Unfortunately, young labels are in many ways like young artists, and their early samplers often resemble debut albums. Gooom Tracks is thus typically frontloaded, and though ""side two"" has its share of promising moments, it seldom approaches the great heights of its opening half. The first misstep is the inclusion of Es La Guerilla's interpretation of Cosmodrome's ""E-Mail Diamant"". As soon as the wistful embers of ""Mardi"" have fully vaporized, part deux is reigned in by a impudent onslaught of nu-metal guitars that confuses more than it offends. If nothing else, the song proves Gooom jack of all niches, but is otherwise a somewhat awkward fit, and a harbinger of strange things to come. The remainder of Gooom Tracks is a markedly subdued affair, as if the people who put together the compilation felt the entire second side was needed to shake the hangover from Es La Guerilla's jarring assault. Curiously, the album's biggest names are reserved for its dusky tail end: M83, the stargazing stalwarts that first garnered Gooom attention in the States, are here remixed by Múm. ""Violet Tree (Violent Tree Mix)"" is a brooding, minimalist dirge of atmospheric synths, crackling noise, and sporadic rhythmic punctuation that hints at the darker direction Múm have taken with their music. Capping the record is a high-profile collaboration between Dorine Muraille and Prefuse 73 (in found sound effigy). The song's title, ""When Someone Dies, His Card Is Demagnetized"", is a grim, postmodern epithet, and appropriately, the track is a bleak process piece that ends Gooom Tracks on a pensive off-note. For all its eclecticism, this album is surprisingly cohesive for a work of its kind. Gooom Tracks plays like more of a soundtrack than a sampler, and would probably be received warmly in goodie bags at the upcoming Cannes festival. But the label's doctrines are still truer to teens spinning records in their bedrooms than to the world of high culture. Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2 occasionally awes, but more important is the feeling it gives that anyone could do this, and these songs are surely more than enough impetus for a new crop of laptop maestros to start.","Gooom Disques knows what it's working with.

Homesongs,Adem,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9af13d197565213aeee/1:1/w_160/f346a36d.jpg,2004-04-13 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4171-homesongs/,Domino,"The first thing you'll notice is the silence: the stretches of soundless beauty that sit between each impassioned whisper; the soft hum of ringing strings as they pause for breath. Too many musicians shy away from these voids. Scared that each empty moment will expose their songs as half-formed, half-felt mock-ups of emotion, they fill each space with needless guitar lines, cloying strings, or overcooked vocal cadences. Perhaps the reason Homesongs revels in such silences-- with its slowly shifting dynamics and effortless drops from towering intensity to breath-baiting sighs-- lies in its conception. Written and recorded in the ex-Fridge guitarist's London home, Adem Ilhan's debut consists of songs culled from quiet evenings of epiphany and contemplation and of simple chords plucked in a bedroom and embroidered with the barest of adornments. From the first hesitant strums of autoharp on ""Pillow"" to the pleading proposition, ""Could this be my home for tonight?"", the more sparse, lethargic moments on Homesongs sound as though Ilhan sat alone, puncturing the stillness of his surroundings, each of his notes a tiny tremor. On ""Long Drive Home"", the worn acoustics that accompany Adem's cracked, lived-in voice are furnished with descending glockenspiel and modest organ parts, serving to accent his swollen-throated tale of a trampled-on lover. But Homesongs is not simply a procession of trembling troubadour tunes. For each turn of boxwood fragility, there's also one of bold and confident songwriting. While many of the melodies on the album are too abstracted to pigeonhole Adem as alt-folk, the lilting grace, rolling acoustics, and undertow of wheezing harmonium on the wonderful ""Everything You Need"" sits comfortably alongside the low-rent Scottish folk propelled by the likes of Domino labelmates James Yorkston and ex-Beta Band member Lone Pigeon. Similarly, the sprawling six-minute strum ""These Are Your Friends"" gradually abandons its wistful narrative and gentle arrangements, building a fevered intensity around the mantra, ""Everybody needs some help sometimes,"" before Adem cuts the chord, allowing his voice and a gentle wind to fade into the ether. Though the album's home recording and quaint assembly of second-hand accompaniment may suggest a kitsch, lo-fi aspect, the reality is very different: These songs are well-produced. Although Adem does not approach the instrumentation with the same disregard for convention you would expect from a member of a post-rock outfit like Fridge, the album's narrow array of sounds rarely restricts the effectiveness of its songs. Take ""One in a Million"": Adem sets the steel twang of banjo and guitar against a soft carpet of harmonium and a melody that flutters from half-spoken to impassioned falsetto, creating something both beautiful and understated. Gentle yet never whimsical, intimate yet never insular, Adem's debut captures the often-unrealized potential of bedroom recording. Avoiding crass emotioneering, it plays as a collection of late-night soliloquies. These are outward-looking songs of hope and hurt, wrapped in the warmth and familiarity that can only be replicated in the place one calls home.","The first thing you'll notice is the silence: the stretches of soundless beauty that sit between each impassioned whisper ...

Knightboat EP,Kat Cosm,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc31eb335119a49ecbe3/1:1/w_160/ff8c542f.gif,2004-04-13 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4575-knightboat-ep/,Staubgold,"When I think of twee laptop pop, I remember an interview where Richard James talked about taking his computer to bed with him, and finding pleasure in the way it warmed his sheets. I suppose it's taking the idea of the bedroom musician to its logical conclusion. I realize that there's too much of this music floating around for some people, but I like the idea of light, quiet indie pop made with computers. It seems such a natural fit. Berlin's Kat Cosm is a boy/girl duo (Sebastian Skalei and Jana Plewa) that combines guitar, piano, and yes, computer processing, and Knightboat is their second record, a long EP with three remixes of the title track added. The opening title track immediately presents Kat Cosm's modus operandi, with out-of-tune electric guitar providing texture against acoustic strumming, bits of Rhodes keyboard, and crunchy Cornelius-style drum programming. Enormously inviting as it builds over its six minutes, the song winds from a lengthy intro through Skalei's hushed verses, until it finishes with a big, heartswollen chorus which finds Plewa chiming, ""We can't go on like this."" It's a nakedly romantic, corny, whitebread thrill-- which is exactly what this sort of music is supposed to be. ""My Letter of Fate I Write for You Tonight"" is Plewa's showcase, opening with just her voice and piano, and then folding in bits of melodica and electronic keyboards. She carries the tune well, recalling old folkie Rickie Lee Jones, but ultimately, the piece is a bit too short, and as a result seems simply like a sketch of what could have become a standout track. The instrumental ""Hotgirl"" is pleasant enough, relying mainly on acoustic guitar, but would better serve as an interlude on a longer album than as a fully realized EP cut. ""Circle/A Little Wetsan"", meanwhile, is a damn good tune, finding Skalei at the piano, crooning like Bacharach as slide guitar and some odd noises flit about the background. The three remixes of ""Knightboat"" show the song to be remarkably pliable. Planet \xB5's Leafcutter John finds the light and airy core at the song's center, adding fluttering percussion and successfully looping a particularly appealing melodic nugget. TenEcke plays up the melancholy, foregrounding the chorus and draining the tune's rhythmic bed before adding a perfect blast of overdriven guitar. The closing mix by Mondomarc is all about beats and remains connected to the original only subliminally. ""Knightboat"" really is a fantastic pop song, and it sounds good pulled apart and reassembled into these configurations, but the rest of the EP is a tad patchy. Somehow, though, in spite of virtually being a maxi-single with three B-sides, Knightboat makes for a decent listen straight through. Kat Cosm: from their bedroom to yours.","When I think of twee laptop pop, I remember an interview where Richard James talked about taking his\n\ computer ...

Stevie,Yesterdays New Quintet,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b013d197565213aef1/1:1/w_160/a7976453.jpg,2004-04-13 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4178-stevie/,Stones Throw,"You don't have to be a jazz elitist to be suspicious of a collection of soul standards reinterpreted by a self-taught drummer/loop digger. But in the case of the official release of the Madlib-helmed Yesterday's New Quintet's fabled Stevie: An Instrumental Tribute to Stevie Wonder, no such trepidation is necessary. The Stevie story goes: Madlib forms fictitious group, recreates classic sounds, deems it unsuitable for release, tosses it in as a promo to love-starved journalists. Journalists get addicted and play it at parties, record gets heavily bootlegged, Madlib rethinks decision, re-sequences and remasters record, adds a song, and puts it up for sale. But are the additions and alterations worth the price of admission? Undeniably, yes. The remastered cuts pop louder and with more presence than the ones on the promo, but some of the mixing could have better emphasized certain elements-- particularly in the case of the keyboards, which are too deep in the mix. In a few cases, I also would've preferred louder drum work from Madlib. This is not to say that the sound is disappointing. On this record-- which blends the live explosiveness of jazz with hip-hop's spirit of inventiveness-- the music works as both background ambience and the forefront of any party. Madlib selected a relatively upbeat group of Wonder tracks, and focuses more on a constant low end and meandering grooves rather than the sound collages more associated with his hip-hop production. From the throbbing Cuban bounce and addictive synth keys of ""Visions"" to the understated bass groove and swift snare hits of ""Rocket Love Pt. 1"", Yesterday's New Quintet reconstructs tracks from several periods of Wonder's career without losing continuity or wandering beyond a song's parameters. I definitely would've enjoyed Madlib's take on some of my personal favorites (""Living for the City"", ""Big Brother', ""I Was Made to Love Her"") but this is clearly a project with an agenda, however loose it may seem. And yes, the new song (""This Girl"") is good. It has a rugged bass loop and clapping snare that's falls closer to Jay Dee than Quincy Jones, while its light synth flourishes pleasantly accompany the ever-present keys on a sequence that's both guttural in tone and displays mesmerizing technique. Still, the record isn't bulletproof: The song choice could've been more varied across Wonder's catalog, the instruments emphasized in its mix could've been selected a little more appropriately, and the album could stand to be a little longer. But all things considered, Stevie not only reinforces YNQ's commercial clout within the independent music scene, but it's also another strong 2004 release from the Stones Throw camp.","You don't have to be a jazz elitist to be suspicious of a collection of soul standards reinterpreted by ...

Summer Make Good,Múm,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4105e6ef95969323991/1:1/w_160/11559ef9.gif,2004-04-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5506-summer-make-good/,Fat Cat,"An open question for whoever had to put together the press kit for the Icelandic quartet Múm's third album, Summer Make Good: What could you possibly have said nice about the vocals here? How many times did you want to just say to this band, ""I'm sorry, I can't do this,"" hang up your press kit-writing jeff cap, and just spend the rest of your life banging your face against a sheet of nails? Let me explain. For starters, Summer Make Good departs further from the group's 2000 debut, Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is OK and settles almost entirely on instrument- and song-based compositions. Change is good, and I can dig a group experimenting with its sound and redefining its goals and so on, but let me be perfectly clear about Múm's song-aspiring arch: It's a fucking terrible idea, and they should stop it immediately. In his review of 2002's Finally We Are No One, Mark Richardson remarked quite accurately that ""Múm is not bestowed with the gift of melody""-- as it turns out, they aren't terribly great instrumentalists, either. The songs on Summer Make Good are similarly flimsy, low on ideas, and, as lo-fi compositions, terribly unambitious. The clear loser of this outing, however, is singer Kristín Anna Valt\xFDsdótti, whose grating, Fran Drescher-as-a-seven-year-old vocals rival the unspeakably awful, kitschy croons of fellow Scandinavian Anton Maiden. It's not that Múm have broken a barrier to make their first entirely unpleasant record-- the addition of drums and trumpet do make for some compelling instrumental moments-- but there simply aren't enough exciting or even vaguely interesting moments in each song, and between this scarcity and, Jesus, that voice, Summer Make Good seems an unfortunate addition to 2004's disappointments. It's frustrating how little there is to say about these songs. ""Weeping Rock, Rock"", ""The Ghosts You Draw On My Back"", ""Sing Me Out the Window"", ""Oh, How the Boat Drifts"", and ""Will the Summer Make Good for All of Our Sins"" are of an obnoxiously homogenous ""dark"" and ""brooding"" sentiment; the songs ride roughly the same tempos and formulas, where stripped-down acoustic ambience leads unalarmingly into a tepid chorus, then usually trails off into more electronic terrain, as if in a nod to the band's Yesterday Was Dramatic past. If Múm plans to stick with this sound, then ""The Island of Children's Children"" and ""Nightly Cares"" seem probably the best direction in which they could continue-- the two songs definite highlights of Summer Make Good. Formally, the songs benefit from much more careful consideration than was given to the album's other tracks, both covering considerable melodic ground while also bearing witness to the band's former strengths as electronic artists. I do respect what Múm have attempted here-- it's great to see a band challenge itself. It's just a shame that it had to come at the expense of what made them so exciting in the first place.","An open question for whoever had to put together the press kit for the Icelandic quartet M\xFAm's third ...

A Foreign Sound,Caetano Veloso,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9315e6ef9596932138d/1:1/w_160/12c01994.jpg,2004-04-12 05:00:05,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8429-a-foreign-sound/,Nonesuch,"Whenever a non-English-speaking musician makes his or her English-language debut, there's always a suggestion that it's a commercially motivated attempt to reach a larger audience. More importantly, if that record is a cover album of American standards, the endeavor unavoidably becomes a political statement-- especially at this particular moment in time. Whether or not Brazilian vocalist Caetano Veloso intended this covers album of American standards-- his first full-length performed entirely in English-- to be overtly political is debatable. But in his liner notes, he writes somewhat apologetically: ""People all over the world would like to find a way of thanking American popular music for having made their lives and their music richer and more beautiful. Many try. So do I."" On one level, A Foreign Sound is an act of appropriation, a kind of reverse musical imperialism, much like Cornershop covering ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" in Punjabi. In addition to American chestnuts by Cole Porter and Rodgers & Hart, Veloso covers songs by artists who have borrowed from Brazilian traditions, including the Talking Heads and Arto Lindsay. Even on songs that have no musical ties to Brazil, Veloso exerts his elegant phrasing and supple voice to make them sound new. For example, Nirvana's ""Come As You Are"" becomes a low-key groove, its signature guitar line rendered as a mysterious, burbling funk, as Veloso emphasizes Cobain's pronunciation of the word memory as ""memoria,"" a move that here takes on special linguistic significance. On another level, at a time when U.S.-bashing is a popular global pastime, A Foreign Sound plays like an eloquent defense of American cultural imperialism. In that regard, the album's most impressive aspect is the generous scope of Veloso's vision: He is just as interested in more recent fare like ""Come As You Are"" and Stevie Wonder's ""If It's Magic"" as he is in standards such as George and Ira Gershwin's ""The Man I Love"" and Irving Berlin's ""Blue Skies"". Despite the lack of any American country music or blues, the breadth of Veloso's overview of American music-- as well as his acknowledgement that phrasing and melody contribute just as much to a song's national character as its lyrics-- elevates A Foreign Sound well above the standard standards dreck dispensed obligatorily by twilight has-beens like Rod Stewart or Cyndi Lauper. But A Foreign Sound is more impressive as a musical statement than as a political one. Veloso aims to reinterpret these songs, to make them sound new and foreign to American ears. And for the most part he succeeds. His nearly a cappella version of Cole Porter's ""Love for Sale"" draws out the gutter pathos in the original's over-polished lyrics, and Berlin's ""Blue Skies""-- which closes the album-- hasn't sounded this good since Willie Nelson covered it on Stardust. On the other hand, Veloso's version of Bob Dylan's ""It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)""-- perhaps chosen for the relevance of its message-- is a lamentable misstep, as is his precious reading of the Civil War ballad-turned-Elvis Presley hit ""Love Me Tender"". But these flaws are perhaps merely the result of the length of the album (22 tracks) and are easily forgivable; after all, who else could make ""Feelings"" sound fresh and unironic? Translating these songs with wit, grace, and intelligence, Veloso reinvigorates them in what could be considered an act of diplomacy. A Foreign Sound demonstrates how nations can meld the best of their cultures and traditions in a mutual give-and-take, a feat which makes the album a triumph both musically and politically.","Whenever a non-English-speaking musician makes his or her English-language debut, there's always a suggestion that it's a commercially ...

Beautiful: Boonghee Music 2,Hu Vibrational,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1585e6ef959693236b5/1:1/w_160/041f905b.jpg,2004-04-12 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3980-beautiful-boonghee-music-2/,Soul Jazz,"Eclecticism is a great luxury. When America exited World War II and entered the most comfortable era in its existence, national insecurity largely seemed obsolete-- at least to the privileged few who didn't need to worry about civil or sexual discrepancies. Consequently, anyone who was anyone figured out that real passion was in music, sex, drugs, and crass, florescent wallpaper. Of course, artists, musicians and poets were the first to realize just how open the American landscape had become, but eventually, even your grandparents were growing sideburns and listening to Les Baxter go all Bora Bora. Somehow a ""counter culture"" embraced the tip of an iceberg of buzzwords that helped define modern America: Diversity, Equality, Understanding. Eclecticism is more attainable when you don't have to sweat the basic shit. This explains why you don't find many abstract IDM artistes or jazz hipsters in Tibet. It's not that there isn't a wealth of worthy artistic muse in Tibet (or any other land); I imagine life is generally more interesting elsewhere. Perhaps there is little point in celebrating the world's diversity when daily, local life presents more than enough on which one can concentrate. It must have seemed exotic to listen to Asian gongs and Tahitian rhythms filtered through the corniest big band imaginable to our grandparents. It must have seemed really deep to paste throat-singing monks over Moog patterns to our parents. And I suppose it's a nifty thing to hear African drums put to use as undie hip-hop backing tracks today. None of this is inherently bad, and much of it is curiously comforting. Yet, it's also necessarily superficial; all part of the price we pay for having a decent national infrastructure and oceans on both sides. Chicago's Hu Vibrational is Adam Rudolph (Pharoah Sanders, Yusef Lateef) and celebrated modern jazz drummer Hamid Drake, and Beautiful: Boonghee Music 2 is their second release. Their first, Boonghee Music, was an EP for Prefuse 73 mastermind Scott Herren's Eastern Developments label. Rudolph and Drake perform music on more ethnic percussion than you can shake a rain stick at: kalimba, Cajon, Udu drum, qarqarba, slit drum, gimbre, Dusu'ngoni, talking drum, surdo and even bamboo flutes. Yet, this is no jungle meeting of the new-age crystal shaman priests; rather, it's a neo-easy listening funk party. Where Martin Denny would have lulled you into a Utopian tropical paradise, Hu Vibrational want to chill you out with James Brown beats and trip-hop moves played on instruments otherwise best suited for indigenous ritual ceremonies or tribal war dances. If it didn't all go down so smoothly, I might say it was ""wild"" and ""free."" Beautiful is a low-key exercise in world-music templates applied to hypnotic, almost minimalist groove. The two percussionists perform short etudes using their array of strange sounding devices, constructing contemporary propulsion from ancient skin and blocks of wood. ""On the Now (for Big Black)"" (no, not that Big Black; it's the alias of Afro-Cuban jazz percussionist Danny Ray) comes on like a tropical slow jam, shakers providing the pulse for the bellowing on-the-one of talking drum (which sounds very much like a tabla). Carlos Niño (aka DJ and producer Ammon Contact) gets credit for producing this album, and he might well have contributed to the no-nonsense, uninterrupted beat play of this track and much of the rest of Beautiful. ""Joyful Road"" offers a steadily busy trap kit beat from Drake under which Rudolph heads to the South Pacific via mallets and tuned wood yet never strays too far from good, old-fashioned boogaloo funk. Eclectic, indeed. IDM artist-cum-hip-hop producer Daedelus guests on two tracks, but rather than provide samples off archaic LPs, he plays guitar. ""Feet on a Beautiful Planet"" uses more talking drum and kalimba (something like an African xylophone) to provide color, as guitar lends the track a Brazilian flair in places. In comparison, ""Sunkissed"" sounds much more like a ""song,"" as Drake supplies the uptempo funk pulse, and Daedelus' chord progression suggests introspection while still lending a little structure to an otherwise open-ended jam. In fact, it's the freer moments on this album that offer the most lasting impressions: ""In the Here"" has a steady pulse, but an understated solo performance throughout from Rudolph on talking drum. Its handclaps lend the piece a spontaneous feel, even if its basic outline is efficiency in the extreme. Likewise, ""Friends and Gardens (for Don Cherry)"" is a small celebration of bell-like sounds, buoyant Island funk and Rudolph's persistent whisper vocal. At its best, Hu Vibrational's concise improvisation is contagiously alluring. I might have wished master musicians such as Drake and Rudolph would have performed something a little more weighty than the short, beat-driven tracks on Beautiful, but then, the album falls right in line with a legacy of exotica best heard on evenings or afternoons with a glass of wine and suitably sophisticated company. This stuff might ultimately be background music, but it's a been a while since that was synonymous with saying it's bad-- far be it from me to deny its charms. Eclecticism doesn't always work in art (or perhaps in life), but it certainly has its luxurious moments. If you can stand the florescent wallpaper, there's a lot to enjoy.","Eclecticism is a great luxury. When America exited World War II and entered the most comfortable era in\n\ its ...

Misery Is a Butterfly,Blonde Redhead,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a310b1335d7bf1698637/1:1/w_160/c6461545.jpg,2004-04-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/807-misery-is-a-butterfly/,4AD,"Blonde Redhead have long been maligned as self-consciously artsy, drawing facile comparisons to Sonic Youth and a host of No-Wave acts-- references that owe as much to their bandname's tribute to a DNA song as to Blonde Redhead's often discordant noise-rock. That rhetoric, of course, should've been shelved after the release of Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons. I only felt I should mention it again because, apparently, many of their party-line detractors never got the memo. By Melody, much of Blonde Redhead's feedback-laced art-rock had given way to brittle pop and arm's-length romanticism, yet somehow they still caught flak for the sound they had already largely outgrown. Just saying, is all: What used to be true is now tired, and, with the release of Misery Is a Butterfly, such knee-jerk dismissals can finally be considered irrelevant. On Melody, the band's artistic growing pains had already become evident, most notably in the wide-eyed, fairytale pining of ""This Is Not"", a vibrant synth-ballad that-- like the first protuberance of wing from a cocoon-- threatened to split the seams of their style-damaged rock wide open. That's not just flowery critic-speak, either-- Kazu Makino and the Pace twins (Amadeo and Simone) split from Touch & Go Records and financed their latest recording themselves, because, according to Simone, they ""didn't want to have any kind of limits with what [they] wanted to do as far as expenses; with Touch & Go, sometimes things were a little tight."" The confidence that led them to strike out on their own-- even before 4AD expressed interest in the album-- is impressive. But more striking is how clearly that confidence has translated to their music. Freed from all constraints, Blonde Redhead are beautifully reborn on Misery Is a Butterfly. True, feelings of loss, insecurity, and outright alienation do factor heavily into the record's thematic vision (this butterfly isn't called ""Misery"" for nothing), but the band's sense of assuredness surrounds the album's themes of vulnerability. Misery Is a Butterfly was recorded before being shopped to a label, but judging by the sound of the album, its eventual release on 4AD seems to have been an inevitability. From track one, the record is lacy and moody, perfectly suited to the one-time home of the Cocteau Twins and This Mortal Coil. The word ""lush"" doesn't quite capture the fluttering whirls of strings, keyboards, and delicately plucked guitar that open ""Elephant Woman""; I'd go so far as to label such enveloping richness of instrumentation ""baroque,"" perhaps even ""rococo."" For Blonde Redhead's latest incarnation, the softer production simply serves as polish for tarnished, tired guitar, drums and keyboards. Here, the bristling energy that once held would-be sympathizers at bay has been turned inward, resulting in an unprecedented illusion of warmth. ""Anticipation"", for example, ventures into completely foreign territory for the band; it's vulnerable, yet remains emotionally available, and is breathtaking even in comparison to the band's most typically pretty compositions. Never before have Makino's gentle whispers seemed so genuine or close at hand. The psychedelia-inflected title track and the fractured desolation of ""Falling Man"" also offer inviting hints of the underlying humanity Blonde Redhead had, until now, been so reluctant to display. Of course, even now, that humanity may be little more than an apparition. Their tales of heartache and desperation have cast Makino and Amadeo Pace-- the emotional heart of the band-- as tragically misunderstood, tortured poets who pin misery on their sleeves, never conceding that anyone else could be capable of understanding their pain. And despite the more inviting nature of Misery's music and production, they remain insular and distant here, as well. Only on ""Anticipation"" are Makino's vocals as beckoning as their musical surroundings; elsewhere, Blonde Redhead remain as they've always been: beautiful and vacant. But they excel at being just that. It bears repeating that Misery Is a Butterfly is a gorgeous achievement. Parrying the double-edged sword of pathos in music-- the ""emo"" trap, if you will-- Blonde Redhead have perfected their own unusual strain of perceived insincerity. They said it themselves, and it still rings true: ""Fake can be just as good."" Though this album's lustrous ornamentation is often placed at odds with its halting vocals, Blonde Redhead are wise enough to embrace their own imperfections. They once espoused the merits of loving another despite our faults, and it shouldn't be hard for fans to seize on that sage advice. Misery Is a Butterfly makes it easy.

"The Bootleg Series, Vol. 6: Live 1964: Concert at Philharmonic Hall",Bob Dylan,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba47ea9e61561daa71b7/1:1/w_160/61c85226.jpg,2004-04-12 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2500-the-bootleg-series-vol-6-live-1964-concert-at-philharmonic-hall/,Sony,"A nubile, dark-haired woman, sporting lingerie and white feathered wings, prances coquettishly. Bob Dylan's battered face appears, quickly and suddenly, augmented by an erstwhile tangle of black hair, a creepy pencil-mustache, and gently-swiped eyeliner. Dylan freezes and squints, expressionless, save a fleeting bit of blue eye-twitch, wherein it momentarily seems possible that he's about to start snickering out of his nose. A remix of 1997's ""Love Sick"" blares. The clip cuts back to the model, now glaring confrontationally, quasi-seductively arching her back. A logo appears. It might be 2004's strangest 30 seconds of television broadcast. My favorite thing about Bob Dylan's Victoria's Secret commercial is the (not so farfetched) possibility that there are viewers in America who won't recognize Dylan's smarmy mug, and, incapable of sketching a line from his figure to the song playing in the background, must contend with an otherwise preposterous cameo, a wrinkled, peculiar-looking man nonsensically interrupting the provocative struts of an underwear model selling prepackaged titillation. Without the proper context, it's impossible to know that the weathered face peering awkwardly at the camera once hocked his very own brand of shockingly alluring taboos, as furtive and dangerous as pink satin bras and lace-edged panties. Despite the fact that Bob Dylan has been steadily burrowing deeper and deeper into the studied Americana canon, he was once the voice of the counterculture, slouching shoulder-to-shoulder with Allen Ginsberg and the radical left. That Dylan was previously embraced by the anti-establishment seems perfectly apropos-- liking Bob Dylan in 2004 is, as it was nearly 40 years ago, an entirely counterintuitive move. His voice, nasal and impossibly garbled, is one of the pitchiest and most uncompromising in the history of American popular music. He's generally cranky, a seething and cantankerous figure in interviews. He has been touring forever, playing bad venues for stupidly high ticket prices, occasionally forgetting the lyrics to his own songs and puttering around onstage, distracted and annoyed. Live 1964, recorded on Halloween night at New York's Philharmonic Hall, is Bob Dylan's first all-acoustic live record, and is most noteworthy for its gooey formative circumstances: This is pre-Dylan Dylan, an impeccably recorded portrait of the guitar-toting folk singer, the giggling, sheepish heir to Woody Guthrie's dusty proletariat throne, a Dylan who had yet to wail electric at Newport, convert to Christianity, or write and star in Masked and Anonymous. Charming and curiously personable, Dylan seems deliriously comfortable on stage, engaging an appreciative audience (no hollers of ""Judas!""), even enlisting their help with the first verse of ""I Don't Believe You"", asking, after a bungled opening, ""Does anyone know the first verse of this song?"" Featuring only longtime-cohort Joan Baez (who appears on four tracks) and his own harmonica and guitar, Live 1964 is a spare, earnest portrayal of neo-Dylan-in-training, a man who, having long mastered one form, is just a few years away from revolutionizing another. October 1964 was a tumultuous time in America, both politically and socially: American presence in Vietnam was gradually swelling, Communist China had successfully detonated its first atomic bomb, and, with civil rights battles still raging strong, racial tensions made for profoundly tense streets. The presumed anti-politics of Another Side of Bob Dylan, released just three months earlier, had already earned Dylan a slap on the wrist from the more radical folk factions, who resented Dylan's irresponsible dip into personal whimsy. But a couple listens to Live 1964 promptly reveals the post-Another Side Dylan as the same defiantly stubborn protest singer, as staunchly concerned with the fate of his country as he was with his own heart. The sixth installment in Dylan's Bootleg Series, Live 1964 includes the infamous ""Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues"", which inspired Dylan to stroll off the set of The Ed Sullivan Show earlier that year (unsurprisingly, network officials wouldn't let him play it on-air) and didn't earn official release until 1991. ""Talkin'"" sees Dylan caustically mocking McCarthyism and mumbling, ""It's a fictitious story,"" before jovially belting about his induction into the John Birch society, wherein he scours his sofa, rose bush, chimney, and toilet bowl for ""commies,"" and finally indicts both himself and Betsy Ross (who mistakenly included red stripes in the American flag). Dylan's comedic timing was at its apex in '64, growling perfect punchlines (""I heard some footsteps by the front porch door/ So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor/ I snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss, saying hands up, you communist!/ It was the mailman/ He punched me out"") every single time. Even Dylan's muttered introduction to ""Who Killed Davey Moore?,"" a wordy indictment of the media-fueled death of boxer Davey Moore, is caustically hilarious: ""This is a song about a boxer. It's got nothing to do with boxing, it's a song about a boxer. And it's not even having to do with the boxer, really... This has been taken out of the newspapers, and nothing has been changed. Except the words."" Over the course of two sets, Dylan enthusiastically strums his way through now-classics ""The Times They Are A-Changin"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", but some of his lesser-known wonders are the most impressive: ""Mama, You Been on My Mind"" (later covered by Johnny Cash on 1965's Orange Blossom Special) sees Baez diva-howling before turning expectedly to Bob, who grumbles, ""I don't do that."" Both Baez and Dylan seem to be perpetually swallowing laughs, bellowing together in a weird, perfect harmony. Live 1964 isn't Dylan at his most explosive, or most innovative, but it does capture a Bob Dylan just starting to shed his folkist skin, folding in bizarre bits and signs of what would later become a full-on folk apocalypse. As primetime television so eagerly attests, a lot has changed since Bob Dylan first played New York on Halloween. But he remains fiercely anachronistic, a little out of place, and always on the verge of a big, snarky chortle. And that self-satisfied air of mystery might just be sexy enough to sell some underwear.","A nubile, dark-haired woman, sporting lingerie and white feathered wings, prances coquettishly.

Virgin Ubiquity: Unreleased Recordings 1976-1981,Roy Ayers,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1939d034d5c69bf29c1/1:1/w_160/2948cb67.jpg,2004-04-12 05:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/434-virgin-ubiquity-unreleased-recordings-1976-1981/,Rapster!K7,"After three weeks of hard freeze, of slipping on mutt-stained patches of frost and iced Brooklyn gutters, with December's cigarette butts still suspended in February's frozen amber puddles, the cold snap finally snapped, and thermometers inched above zero degrees. Just to feel the sun cut through the blustery wind promised the approach of spring, and it was then that I relied on vibraphonist Roy Ayers to help soundtrack and celebrate warm weather's imminent return. Best known for ""Everybody Loves the Sunshine"", Ayers and his vibes are like those same solar rays on your skin; for me, this batch of grooves was a salve for staving off seasonal depression. Not quite on par with, say, James Brown uncovering hours of tape from his on-the-one prime, the promise of prodigious unreleased songs from the peak of Ayers' powers is reason to take notice nonetheless. Since his 1963 debut, Ayers has worked with everyone from Herbie Mann and Guru to Fela Kuti and Erykah Badu, and his shimmering sound has foreshadowed acid jazz and fueled hip-hop, as well as gracing contemporary R&B.; Though Virgin Ubiquity is billed as a collection of thirteen never-before-released tracks, it's far more than a mere scrap heap of outtakes, as each of its ""from the vault"" cuts luxuriate on the comfortable musical bed that Ayers mastered from '76 through '81. Originally of the hard bop school, Ayers embraced the strains of black music coming from the radio, incorporating more R&B; smoothness and disco push into his jazz-based playing. That so-slick sound of joy reverberates through titles like ""What's the T?"" and ""Green and Gold"", proving the vibed tinges of his loving funk to be almost ageless. The only suggestion of dating comes from the revolving cast of ladybirds, who imitate the leather-lunged female vocal style of the day, piercing through the brass and bass in the manner of disco-divas like Patti LaBelle and Minnie Riperton. The wailing of both Merry Clayton and Sylvia Cox counteracts the otherwise mellow bump of ""Brand New Feeling"", as they match the analog sine waves with some dog-whistling of their own. But when both ladies lay off the caterwauling, the vibraslap and horn lines recline like a cat napping in a patch of warm light. More soothing is Carla Vaughn, who would go on to sing with Earth, Wind & Fire. Here, she flutters on suave yet tricky tracks like ""Mystic Voyage (Version)"" and ""Boogie Down"" (wherein she urges her lover with the undeniable order ""pour yourself on me""). ""I Am Your Mind', the final track, is the most driving of the 13 presented here, its hard, snapping bass underpinning the multi-tracked whispers, which are a curious bit of what could only be considered ""solipsistic funk."" Knowing that the head keeps the body from unleashing the freedom that resides within, Ayers, on this unearthed set, echoes the paradigm of another long-lived head-funker: Free your mind and your ass will follow.","After three weeks of hard freeze, of slipping on mutt-stained patches of frost and iced Brooklyn gutters, with December's ...

Youth City Fire EP,The Narrator,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96b13d197565213ae54/1:1/w_160/b4e7a2ef.jpg,2004-04-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5895-youth-city-fire-ep/,Flameshovel,"The most dangerous concert I've ever been to-- and possibly the best-- was put on by The Narrator in New Haven last November. The band played in the backyard of a Yale co-op, on the second floor of a run-down barn that housed everything from pirate ship blueprints, to snubbed cubist attempts, to what I think might've been a '57 Chevy. The wood and nails that held the barn together had been loosened by repeated ivy league fetes of women, cocaine, and horse racing, to the point that when the 80 people in attendance began jumping around during the band's mid-set performance of ""The Electric Slide"", the floor collapsed: Skulls and bones started breaking, and we all had this awesome band to thank for our hospital bills and a perfectly unrequited night. I was supposed to buy The Narrator's seven-inch after the show but couldn't because of the unpleasantness, so it was with death-defying anticipation that I cracked open the Youth City Fire EP, the Chicago quartet's Flameshovel debut. It's uneven, and the vocals range from painfully melodramatic to sadly insecure, but there are bright glimmers of that D.C.-informed punk rock energy that quite literally brought down the house. The warp-speed crowd-noise montage that kick-starts ""Culture/Counts"" finally gives way to PiL-dirty guitar slashes and thick drumming that, though not the crispest, rivals pretty much anything on Dischord in terms of sheer energy. There's a similar crash-and-burn aesthetic to ""All Are Assassins"", which, at under two minutes, manages some potent contrasts and a climactic breakdown/handclap-buildup that flat-out kills in a live setting. As instrumentalists, The Narrator are tighter than one might expect from a band that's only been around a year and a half; as songwriters, they're burying really slick riffs deep into their mix-- it's the vocals that hold the Youth City Fire EP back. Producer Greg Norman (who's recorded Guided by Voices and 90 Day Men, among others) desperately tries to keep the vocals from being overly exposed, but all too often, it's to no avail-- the energy's there, but the tonality and confidence are not, which is especially dangerous when The Narrator aren't at breakneck speed, such as on the ersatz Sonic Youth noodlander ""We Call Police"" or the confusing emo waltz ""Horse with Blinders"". Those two songs are dangerous slip-ups on an already short EP, which is why the stunning first two minutes of closer ""The Electric Slide"" are so critical for this young band. This may be the most bad-ass opening of a rock song I've heard so far this year: the call of quiet single-line guitar intervals, snare rim tapping, and a bitter chorus of ""Fight! Fight! The Winners! The Winners!"" beget increasingly monstrous responses and some fantastic bass work towards the end of movement. It's glorious-- until The Narrator drops the old ""can you feel the cancer spread inside me"" line, but fine, whatever. Youth City Fire, for all its shortcomings, harbors some seriously potent rock moments. Let's hope the band can manage some self-censorship on future releases without sacrificing the energy that makes them so compelling live.","The most dangerous concert I've ever been to-- and possibly the best-- was put on by The Narrator in ...

"If You Can't Beat 'Em, Bite 'Em",Weird War,by: Jedediah Gilchrist,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9f49d034d5c69bf3d4e/1:1/w_160/76989cbc.jpg,2004-04-11 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8618-if-you-cant-beat-em-bite-em/,Drag City,"It seems a shame that, for all of Ian Svenonius' creative endeavors and the lasting effect his bands have had on the face of indie rock (Hives, I'm looking in your direction), one can hardly find an article on the man that doesn't in some way mention his early 90s stint as Sassy magazine's ""Sassiest Boy in America."" Ironic as the title might have been, it has somehow followed him through the years and managed to undermine his sincerity, as if the hilarity of the award is more a commentary on his credibility than on that of the now-defunct teen magazine. As if in reaction to Sassy's dubious distinction, or perhaps in an effort to heal his bruised cred, each of Svenonius' post-Nation of Ulysses efforts have been increasingly quirky in sound and approach. The Make-Up drew inspiration from 60s-era psych-rock and emerged complete with an anti-establishment ethos and manifesto; Scene Creamers drenched its whimsical pop simplicity in sex and politics; and Weird War, on their self-titled debut, funneled a mélange of influences-- from Motown to prog-rock to 60s garage-- into an intense, reverb-heavy stew. Since that first Weird War record, original member Neil Michael Hagerty (ex-Royal Trux) decided to leave the band in pursuit of the ever-elusive solo career, and Svenonius' Scene Creamers came under fire for allegedly choosing the same name as a group of French graffiti artists. So with a founding member missing from one band and another bandname tied up in a legal dispute, what's a man to do? The solution was surprisingly simple, and in what amounted to independent music's answer to corporate restructuring, Scene Creamers became Weird War for the release of If You Can't Beat 'Em, Bite 'Em. And all was well. But in spite of the band's convoluted pedigree, off-kilter image, and critic-ready, retro-garage-funk sound, the fact remains that If You Can't Beat 'Em, Bite 'Em is just not as interesting as it could be. For all its experimental bluster and lyrical imagery, the end result is paradoxically both unique and mediocre, like a band merely treading water when it should be filling the pool with gasoline. Style reigns supreme over substance here, and the whole album is bathed in a coat of 70s garage funk, with distorted percussion and buzzing guitars. But while there's much to be said for a solid groove, something's just not right when a track goes flat before the two-minute mark: ""Store Bought Pot"" opens promisingly with a rhythm section straight out of any 70s sitcoms, but lacks variation and quickly beats itself into the ground under Svenonius' rap-like musings. Unfortunately, the song's underdeveloped, monotonous groove typifies the project's shortcomings, as many of its songs are half-baked and needlessly stretched out minutes beyond their prime. But then there are tracks like ""Grand Fraud"", whose fuzzy, MC5-esque rhythm section underpins its energetic, staccato vocals. When the growling chorus kicks in here, the rhythm falls straight in line, stoking the fire as Svenonius snarls, ""There was a village with a witch and they decided to burn that bitch."" Even the spoken word psych freakout ""One by One"", and the socially critical honky rap and falsetto chorus of ""AK-47"" manage to keep just this side of ludicrous, lending more charm than dissonance or absurdity. These are, however, exceptions to the rule, and sadly, If You Can't Beat 'Em's moments of retro-chic accessibility are grossly outweighed by its general repetitiveness. Most folks likely won't even make it past the lascivious intro, ""Music for Masturbation"". But then, perhaps that what Svenonius intended. Sassy, indeed.","It seems a shame that, for all of Ian Svenonius' creative endeavors and the lasting effect his bands have\n ...

Morehappyness,Aluminium Group,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06aea9e61561daa4571/1:1/w_160/2d9451de.gif,2004-04-11 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/142-morehappyness/,Wishing Tree,"It sometimes seems as if we demand too much from The Aluminum Group. After all, between their attachments to the Chicago arts scene, their chic appropriation of 1960s pop, and their attachment to co-conspirators Jim O'Rourke and John McEntire, the expectations for the band can sometimes seem unreachable. This, of course, doesn't mean that the duo of Frank and John Navin haven't bent over backward trying to match those expectations. Ever since their third album, 1999's Pedals, was criticized for drowning its lilting Burt Bacharach-esque melodies in O'Rourke's over-elaborate production, they've taken a more simple, scaled-back approach to their arrangements. On Morehappyness, their sixth album, the band has binned the saccharine orchestration of their early work to instead adopt an electronic finery similar to the neon-tinted new wave of the 1980s or The Magnetic Fields' early incursions into synthetic thrift-store pop. The trouble is, on this second installment of their planned Happyness trilogy, the Navin brothers still struggle to sound more than the sum of their parts. Much of why this record fails to catch fire lies in how-- compared to previous records Pelo and Happyness-- the songs seem melodically indistinct. By ditching their baroque leanings, the Navins' songwriting has become more abstract, oblique, and in line with fellow Chicago pop experimentalists The Sea and Cake. Yet while that band's tunes shuffle and meander their way into your consciousness, much of Morehappyness simply seems slight and unremarkable. On ""Snowflake"", synths murmur, a deep bassline shudders and McEntire's drumming doles out a near-disco rhythm, but this otherwise competent backing is made redundant by the way John Navin's voice ineffectively grazes above the music. The Navins' over-reliance on electronics is also somewhat restrictive: Their repeated use of similar-sounding, smooth keyboard lines is tiresome, and a greater variation in sound and structure would have been preferred. Because of this, the tracks which produce a greater impact tend to be those that incorporate organic elements. When John Navin's faint, graceful flutter of a voice blends with the faintly flicked guitar on ""Colored Town"", the result is a sparse, pillow-soft splendor. Likewise, the penultimate ""Wheat and Tare"" is an indelibly beautiful fusion of slow piano and a subtle electronic undertow, featuring a divine middle-eight that could have been written for Dionne Warwick in the 1960s. Morehappyness, then, is a slow stretch of still-motion reverie and contemplation, augmented by attractive, understated melodies and arrangements, but The Aluminum Group's failing lies in their inability to replicate the splendid melodrama of their Bacharach-imbued early work within the confines of a new sound. Unfortunately, this shortcoming leaves both the songs and their presentation sounding a bit slender and a little too powerless.","It sometimes seems as if we demand too much from The Aluminum Group.

On the Culture Industry,Ahleuchatistas,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a190c0084474cd0bfe26/1:1/w_160/349c114c.gif,2004-04-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/431-on-the-culture-industry/,Angura Sound,"It's okay if you don't get the name right the first time-- it takes a couple of run-throughs before it becomes easily pronounceable. A combination of Charlie Parker's ""Ah-Leu-Ch"" and ""Zapatista,"" the name is meant to suggest both the instrumental band's politics in lieu of lyrics (the long-short: they align themselves with the oppressed and marginalized) and their approach to music. No, they don't play anything you could even remotely call ""bop,"" but the improvisational élan that Bird and his contemporaries brought to music is definitely the order of the day. Ahleuchatistas do their version of bop in a manner more reminiscent of mid-70s King Crimson or the on-and-off Laswell/Frith/Hayward project Massacre and-- although this is just their first album-- they pull it off surprisingly well. The trio hails from Asheville, North Carolina, a picturesque town in the Appalachians I previously knew only from a quick news bit about a pickled frog being found at a local fast food joint. Which makes some sense: the band's sound is definitely more pickled frog than it is bucolic mountain scenery. The interplay ranges from ridiculously tight, turn-on-a-pinhead careening to barely controlled chaos, and all points between. Just when you think they've lost the plot completely, they hit you with a fistful of razor blades and march lockstep over your corpse with odd-metered, pants-soiling grooves. Seriously, recording a nearly hour-long album with nothing but a guitar, bass and drums-- there's nary a guest vocal or even a sample to lean on-- without boring you, me, and both of our mothers half to death is tricky stuff, but I dare say Ahleuchatistas have done it. Guitarist Shane Perlowin is apparently allergic to all effects aside from reverb, but bassist Derek Poteat makes up for that with varying shades of scuzzbucket fuzz and tastefully employed chorus and octave pedals. Drummer Sean Dail keeps his kit stripped and makes the most of just a few basic sounds. His hi-hat control is especially impressive, and it essentially makes a couple of these songs all on its own. The AK-47s and apocalyptic gore that bristle from the album artwork don't take long to materialize, rising in a methodical swell on the cacophonous ""Intro"" and blazing in full glory on ""The Machines Became Cognizant"". On that track, Perlowin's clean-tone clusters buzz like an angry hive of bees as the drums scatter and the bass stretches out into a percolating pattern. ""Lacerate"" is all odd meters and dynamic interplay, the band flipping between ballet shoes and combat boots, while Dail's hi-hat pushes the final charge at breakneck speed. ""A Thought Like a Hammer"" steps it up further still, with guitar figures that you could even call catchy and pummeling bursts of violent riffage. Ahleuchatistas take a break from the bloodsport on ""I Don't Remember Falling Asleep Here"", an elegiac meditation of sparse guitar and growling, pitch-shifted bass. And they save two of the nastiest tracks for last: ""Empath/Every"" starts with a lulling melodic passage and weird counterrhythmic guitar runs, but builds naturally to a punishing head with distorted bass, boiling guitar, and flagellant drumming. Meanwhile, ""Lament for Bhopal"" (the title of which references a 1984 Methyl Isocyanate leak at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India that killed thousands and still causes birth defects in the region) opens with a dark descent into entropic noisemaking and moves between quiet menace and brutal assault with frightening purpose. This all makes for a record that will surely be exhausting for people who aren't into instrumental confrontation. For those who are, however, it's supremely rewarding. Listening to this record reminded me of having my mind blown by the first Massacre album, and though it's not quite up to that standard, it's certainly close. The real test for Ahleuchatistas will be to see if they can improve on this their next time out, but for now, On the Culture Industry is one hell of a starting place-- and worthy of all the pretension their bandname implies.","It's okay if you don't get the name right the first time-- it takes a couple of run-throughs ...

To All We Stretch the Open Arm,MirahBlack Cat Orchestra,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c355c0084474cd0c3448/1:1/w_160/296d7646.gif,2004-04-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5331-to-all-we-stretch-the-open-arm/,YoYo,"Mirah is an anomaly in the K Records stable. Over the years, the label has cultivated a uniform aesthetic, with many of its artists seeming like overdone, mock-innocent caricatures. Though there are exceptions to the rule, Mirah stands out as a genuine persona, and rarely, if ever, does she stoop to the sort of corduroy foppery that characterizes many of her labelmates. On a label of self-styled misfits and singing eremites, Mirah is perhaps the only true enigma. Her tenuously confident voice revels and never wallows in its shyness, and though she has her share of precious moments (see ""La Familia""), her songs are neither understated nor overbearing. The Microphones' Phil Elvrum might be a real-life hermit, but his mysterious personality is impertinent to his talent; Mirah, meanwhile, can dominate a stage in diva-like fashion, and the experience of hearing her sing is all the more moving for the sense that she's doing something that takes a tremendous wealth of talent. On To All We Stretch the Open Arm, Ms. Yom Tov Zeitlyn conspires with Seattle's The Black Cat Orchestra to render a generation-spanning panoply of folk songs from a variety of locales. The album-- Mirah's first for Yoyo Records (but not her last for K)-- is structured around a theme of rebellion and dissent; its dozen tracks consist of covers of songs from periods of war and strife. But while it's about time someone united Bob Dylan with his centennial antecedent, Civil War troubadour Stephen Foster, this album does little justice to the songs and causes it represents, and ultimately feels like a pointless exercise. Perplexingly, Mirah's dexterous voice is subdued throughout much of To All We Stretch. It seems no great pains were taken to mix these recordings; every instrument sounds remarkably flat, as if the band just close-mic'd one of their rehearsals and pressed record. Of course, this four-track technique is hardly revolutionary, but it's nevertheless surprising coming from Mirah, whose albums have always found clever ways to avoid the sterility implicit in most lo-fi pop. Besides being hackneyed, the homespun feel of this recording fundamentally clashes with the populist nature of its material. Revolutions don't happen in Olympia bedrooms, and while many of these songs have grassroots, they were doubtless written with a larger audience in mind. For a message to be of import, the vehicle in which it's delivered needs to feel significant, too, and To All We Stretch the Open Arm is diminutive in stature. Performance-wise, the band is equally flaccid. Rather than give the songs (some of which date to before recording technology) a modern update, the Black Cats render them verbatim, exaggerating their lugubrious tempos. ""Si Me Quieres Escribir"" and ""El Cant Dels Ocells"" sound particularly amateurish, laboring in the saturnine dynamics that come to typify this record. There would seem to be immense potential in rehashing songs that are more than a century old, but Mirah and the Orchestra have failed to find it. The album's strongest numbers are its most modern, including a cover of Dylan's ""Dear Landlord"", which features Mirah's most charming vocal performance on the album. Likewise, two original songs, ""The Light"" and ""How Sweetly Friendship Binds"", show promise, but are ultimately stifled by the band's indifferent performance. Protest songs that are anchored by a very specific place and time are period pieces, and are therefore difficult to execute outside their quaint confines. A song about the Civil War is nothing if not a historical document; trying to resurrect its temporal relevance in lieu of a situation that dovetails less than perfectly with the circumstances under which it was conceived is an ill-fated endeavor. Because of this, To All We Stretch the Open Arm is at an inherent disadvantage, and when coupled with the Black Cat Orchestra's tepid performance, the album packs all the excitement of a Battle of Gettysburg re-enactment.",,5.2,
An Evening with the Sound Providers,Sound Providers,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6639d034d5c69bf3511/1:1/w_160/4ed33293.gif,2004-04-08 05:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7749-an-evening-with-the-sound-providers/,Quarternote,"Among the underground rap landscape's many charms is its state of constant flux, but over the past few years, as the genre's popularity exploded, it's undergone a major transformation, and these days, it's increasingly difficult to identify or label the style of every new low-budget collective. Fortunately, the Sound Providers (aka Soulo and Jason Skills) lay out their agenda immediately: Their debut is an aural retrospective of the mid-90s, as well as a testament to the survival of the jazz-hop format. Spiritually, it distills the magic of Digable Planets and Black Sheep into a modern, less ambitious format. Though far from original, An Evening with the Sound Providers is notable for taking a bat to jazz-hop's dead horse while also paying its just dues. Surprisingly, this unusual production style tends to work more frequently than not, but not without its share of problems: Despite impressively consistent drumwork (a noticeable nod to DJ Premier) and functional samples, the instrumentals fail to offer much variety, and lack the necessary change-ups to command a listener's full attention. The duo also tend to lean toward a Ninja Tune-like background ambience, rather than the bolder sonics preferred by their forbears (Pete Rock, Diamond D, Prince Paul). The few chosen MCs lack personality as well, drawing from the same pool of influences-- usually Guru, A Tribe Called Quest, and Black Thought. Collectively, they seem to play the role of an inverted Slum Village: the jazzy beats remain, but in place of the sex-obsessed, pseudo-commercial dialogue is a series of conscious, anti-commercialist rhyme patterns to balance the scale. Unfortunately, the rappers don't have much interesting to say, content to simply fill time when they appear on tracks. More capable MCs-- J-Live, maybe, or anyone from the Quannum collective-- would have been a much better match for the Sound Providers' production style. There is, however, one untouchable bright flash, when Asheru of Unspoken Heard rises up to steal the show on ""For Old Time's Sake"". Barreling around playful flute loops, light xylophone, upright bass, and harsh percussion, Asheru employs his clear monotone and slightly Posdnous-influenced delivery to take to the typical anti-platinum approach typical of this kind of record. Still, his bile for MTV-friendly rappers is pretty amusing: ""Emcees these days got it all fucked up/ With their incredible quest to gain mad cream/ Rocking fur with the Louis Vutton, 'nuff jewelry on/ I mean, damn, is you a pimp or drag queen?"" Here, Asheru mirrors his producers: Neither are doing anything mind-blowing, but they do it well enough to entertain for at least a short time. Of course, while the Sound Providers' production style and MCs are frequently uninteresting, the West Coast collective does scrape together some consistently solid beats, passable rhymes, and an inviting retro mentality. As a result, An Evening with the Sound Providers proves to be more than listenable, a slight glimmer in the rough of the year's hip-hop releases.","Among the underground rap landscape's many charms is its state of constant flux, but over the past few years ...

On My Way,Ben Kweller,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc18abf31b7dc7155c3e/1:1/w_160/5b74410e.jpg,2004-04-08 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4553-on-my-way/,BMGATO,"Despite a handful of noble efforts, dude-next-door Ben Kweller seems destined to spend the remainder of his career attempting to claw his way out of little brotherdom. Blame his goofy guitar stomps, moppish locks and toothy grin, or the enduring legacy of an infamously anticlimactic high school gig (the heavily hyped, quickly forgotten Radish), but know that Ben Kweller is having a crap of a time escaping our distracted head-pats and condescending smiles. Check standard Kweller-crit protocol: The elders glance and chortle, crinkle their noses, dub him ""adorable!"" or ""a wunderkind,"" and then proceed with white-knuckled noogies. Never mind that Kweller's scrappy, Violent Femmes-ish alt-rock is not really all that different from what his aged peers (see Evan Dando, Ben Folds) perpetually crank out, or that he's married, and 23, and two records into a fairly successful recording career. Somehow, it still feels far more appropriate to hide his bicycle in the bushes and play the infuriating Wayne to Kweller's sheepish Kevin Arnold. Maturity, then, is Kweller's shiny-haired Winnie Cooper: elusive, confounding, and perpetually out of reach. Kweller's latest, On My Way, takes a gallant stab at adulthood, toning down the slappy bursts and over-energized slams, and simultaneously erasing all the awkward, bumbling charm (comparing sex to eating spaghetti?) that made us notice him in the first place. Mostly, Kweller's very-well-intentioned efforts have simply led to an unfortunate critical snafu: Record reviewers have long chastised Kweller for his naivete, but those same folks will probably frown when faced with Kweller's loaded, listless shot at the big kids' table. On My Way is a far less goofy effort than 2002's Sha Sha, and suffers remarkably for its comparable lack of inanity-- no longer powered by the youthful glee of his solo debut, Kweller's hooks sag and fade, contrived and loose. Like countless twenty-somethings hovering on the cusp on self-realization, Kweller's grasps at actualization fall just a little bit short, inadvertently positioning his younger flailings as the far more attractive choice. ""Hospital Bed"" sees Kweller returning to the depths of his well-pilfered Beatles collection, channeling the (irritatingly plucky) spirit of Bens cohort Ben Folds, mixing in twinkly piano bits and octave-jumping vocals; it's the closest Kweller comes to recreating Sha Sha's cocky charisma, with hyperactive la-la-la's and pounding electric guitar. Kweller's boyish vocals, which have always felt vaguely unhinged, work best when singing absurd, yelpy love songs to his stuff-- see his tender ode to his cat-filled Brooklyn apartment: ""My apartment/ The home where I hide/ Away from all the darkness outside/ I'm there all the time."" Kweller mixes in some sweet acoustic ballads (the title song is an unassuming acoustic monument to his girl: ""She makes hats with her hands/ She is such an artist/ I'm her biggest fan/ And I'm teaching her to sing""), but his folky promises are still far less convincing than his leg-flailing, adolescent rockers, like ""The Rules"". Ben Kweller is clearly trying hard to do the right thing-- to grow up, brush off, evolve. But On My Way-- as its title so brazenly suggests-- is also unforgivably transitory. Subsequently, the record becomes an oddly limp testament to Kweller's newfound inertia, and listeners are left feeling a little empty-nested.","Despite a handful of noble efforts, dude-next-door Ben Kweller seems destined to spend the remainder of his career attempting to ...

Satanic Panic in the Attic,Of Montreal,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a9ea9e61561daa7030/1:1/w_160/89336ec7.jpg,2004-04-08 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5954-satanic-panic-in-the-attic/,Polyvinyl,"For whatever reason, psych-pop seems more prone to reductive descriptions than most other genres. For critics, it's all too easy: Just state the bandname and album title, discuss the intensity of the lead songwriter's Brian Wilson fixation, and critique him based on the effectiveness with which his band approximates Pet Sounds. For extra points, drop words like ""hallucinogenic"" or ""sun-drenched"" in the review as often as possible, and-- if you're really good-- throw in a well-placed Curt Boettcher reference. There you have it: Band X is another petty homage to 1960s California pop. I often wonder why music fans aren't more resistant to this type of summary delineation; surely there's more to Jeff Magnum's twisted genius than a childish idolization of the Beach Boys, just as Will Cullen Hart's powers don't derive from something abnormal in the water he drank as a kid. I suppose this critical tactic is prevalent because there really are artists who fit this simplistic bill, ones whose records are about as essential to a pop fan as the work of a bad Zeppelin knockoff would be to a metalhead. I've always pegged Of Montreal as one of those inessential bands. The only real adoration I've felt for any of their tracks is for ""Don't Ask Me to Explain"", a simplistic ditty from the band's debut LP that manages to do Weezer better than Weezer themselves. And although Of Montreal haven't released a real dud in the band's eight-year recording life, the most engaging thing about their songs is often their longwinded, quasi-literary titles. Evidently, the band has had trouble keeping the attention of record labels as well, spreading their seven-album yield amongst five different imprints. Two years removed from Aldhils Arboretum, their last studio album of new material, the band has had-- by Of Montreal standards-- a relatively long time to hone their sound and explore a more cohesive approach to songwriting, one less encumbered by oblique concepts. Since 1997, Of Montreal have churned out roughly an LP a year, not to mention untold EPs, B-sides, and an effective collection of singles. The group's longest previous respite between LPs was the two-year hiatus between The Gay Parade and Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse. And while Coquelicot was clearly more ambitious than its predecessor, it wasn't a vast transformation in either quality or style. All told, there was no reason to expect any great strides from this dependably generic quintet this time out, which makes Satanic Panic in the Attic all the more surprising. Satanic Panic displays a considerable maturation in Kevin Barnes' songwriting. Everything, from the Sgt. Pepper's-copping album art to the wontedly verbose lyrics and song titles, would suggest a predictable collection of spindly psych-pop. But when the music actually starts, the differences become apparent. ""Disconnect the Dots"" begins with a Doppler-affected drum sample, before the abrupt appearance of both handclaps and a verifiably indelible guitar riff. Seconds later, Barnes arrives, bearing an invitation: ""Come disconnect the dots with me, poppy,"" he intones, before deliquescing into a blissful mini-chorus. From there, the song shifts effortlessly from section to section, orchestrating a dense but well-balanced array of organ drones, vocal harmonies, astral guitar peals, and interlocking electro-acoustic percussion. And this is all in the album's first 4\xBD minutes. ""Disconnect the Dots"" is more than just an album pacesetter-- it's a mission statement for a band remade, or at least reconsidered. The new Of Montreal grab your attention, not deliberately invite it to wander, as the next track, ""Lysergic Bliss"", makes abundantly clear. The song is perhaps most reminiscent of the band's earlier work, sluicing through multiple time and key changes with operatic grandiosity. On a previous effort, the song's fragments might have either fallen apart from lack of a coherent vision or been mashed together to form a mottled soup of disparate ideas, but here, the track is handled with impressive finesse; even the bridge's extended a cappella harmonies have a natural flow. Elsewhere, Satanic Panic frequently leans closer to Steely Dan than the Beach Boys, which lends a refreshing dose of realism to the implicit reverie of songs like ""My British Tour Diary"". Elsewhere, ""Eros' Entropic Tundra"" and ""Erroneous Escape into Eric Eckles"" are both delicately refined, while still retaining Of Montreal's psychedelic salience. And while the music hits with somewhat of a blunted edge, Barnes' harmonies are always unimpeachably catchy. My naysaying of Of Montreal's earlier work is only meant to underscore the impressive growth displayed here. While albums such as The Gay Parade and Coquelicot often drowned in oppressive amounts of cheerfulness, it's possible to take Satanic Panic seriously while still enjoying even its stickiest melodies. It may lack the raw inventiveness of a potential peer such as Olivia Tremor Control's Dusk at Cubist Castle, but Of Montreal are psych-pop of a different strain. Satanic Panic in the Attic is idiosyncratic without being hokey, and although the band has been stiffed recognition for the consistency of their previous work, this album should make the group much more difficult to ignore.","For whatever reason, psych-pop seems more prone to reductive descriptions than most other genres.

The Disintegration Loops I-IV,William Basinski,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2255e6ef95969320351/1:1/w_160/5e48b7de.jpg,2004-04-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/,2062,"You are slowly being destroyed. It's imperceptible in the scheme of a day or a week or even a year, but you are aging, and your body is degrading. As your cells synthesize the very proteins that allow you to live, they also release free radicals, oxidants that literally perforate your tissue and cause you to grow progressively less able to perform as you did at your peak. By the time you reach 80, you will literally be full of holes, and though you'll never notice a single one of them, you will inevitably feel their collective effect. Aging and degradation are forces of nature, functions of living, and understanding them can be as terrifying as it is gratifying. It's not the kind of thing you can say often, but I think William Basinski's Disintegration Loops are a step toward that understanding-- the music itself is not so much composed as it is this force of nature, this inevitable decay of all things, from memory to physical matter, made manifest in music. During the summer of 2001, Basinski set about transferring a series of 20-year-old tape loops he'd had in storage to a digital file format, and was startled when this act of preservation began to devour the tapes he was saving. As they played, flakes of magnetic material were scraped away by the reader head, wiping out portions of the music and changing the character and sound of the loops as they progressed, the recording process playing an inadvertent witness to the destruction of Basinski's old music. The process may be the hook for this sprawling four-disc set, but the loops themselves are stunning, ethereal studies in sound so fluid that the listener scarcely registers the fact that it's nothing but many hundreds of repetitions of a brief, simple loop that they're hearing. I imagine that life within the womb might sound something akin to these slowly swelling, beauteous snatches of orchestral majesty and memory-haze synthesizer. The pieces are uniformly consonant, embellished with distant whalesong arpeggios and echoing percussion. In essence, Basinski is improvising using nothing so much as the passage of time as his instrument, and the result is the most amazing piece of process music I've ever heard, an encompassing soundworld as lulling as it is apocalyptic. A piece may begin bold, a striking, slow-motion slur of ecstatic drone, and in the first minute, you will notice no change. But as the tape winds on over the capstans, fragments are lost or dulled, and the music becomes a ghost of itself, tiny gasps of full-bodied chords groaning to life amid pits of near-silence. Some decay more quickly and violently than others, surviving barely 15 minutes before being subsumed by silence and warping, while the longest endures for well over an hour, fading into a far-off, barely perceptible glow. There is another, eerier chapter to the story of the Disintegration Loops-- that Basinski was listening to the playbacks of his transfers as the attacks of September 11th unfolded, and that they became a sort of soundtrack to the horror that he and his friends witnessed from his rooftop in New York that day, a poignant theme for the cataclysmic editing of one of the world's most recognizable skylines. Removed from the context of that disaster and transposed into the mundane world we live in every day, The Disintegration Loops still wield an uncanny, affirming power. It's the kind of music that makes you believe there is a Heaven, and that this is what it must sound like.","You are slowly being destroyed.

The idea that the blue movies of the 70s had even marginally interesting soundtracks is, if you think about it, a rather odd bit of received wisdom. How many people have actually seen enough of these films to say? Perhaps it's just that 70s porn soundtracks and the now-classic music of the blaxploitation genre have become tangled up in people's minds somehow. In 1975, Swedish songwriter and renaissance man Tom Zacharias recorded two concept albums so funky, so nasty, and in such overall bad taste, that counterpart skin flicks would've been mere redundancies. These records, titled Belinda and Belinda's Döttir, featured elastic rhythms, acid guitars, and catchy pop songs about kinky sex of the most extreme varieties. Sold primarily in porn shops, both were hits throughout Sweden. In an attempt to cross over to the American market, Zacharias recruited singers to add English vocals to a handful of the tunes and advertised the finished product via classifieds in the back pages of Hustler and Screw magazines. There were few takers, however, and Belinda never arrived in America. This CD reissue collects the Belinda songs re-recorded in English; also aboard are the Swedish originals. The sound of this disc is immediately appealing. Zacharias had access to a good studio and used top-drawer session musicians; every last instrument and piece of gear used here would undoubtedly fetch top dollar in today's vintage market. The grizzled guitar filth is so very right, and the drums pop and reverberate with joy-- a joy the 80s might've destroyed forever. When Zacharias' band is at its funkiest, it makes the kind of sound The Beastie Boys longed so desperately to capture on their Check Your Head-era instrumentals. At the purely sonic level, Belinda is a major treat. The songs themselves, though, present a mixed bag. I greatly prefer the Swedish versions because, in English, the lyrics are graphic and shocking in the most juvenile manner possible, distracting the listener from all other concerns. ""Please Daddy"" is sung from the perspective of a girl who wants to lay her father, and she's willing to allow Mom to join in. ""Last Christmas,"" she sings, ""I blew Santa Claus/ And the family that screws together grooves together."" Another lyric offhandedly mentions sex with a 10-year-old. It's all theatrical and tongue-in-cheek, of course, but it's hard not to feel like an asshole listening to it. But skip to the Swedish half of the album, and the groove goes guiltless in comparison. With the meaning of the words masked, Belinda becomes an enjoyable series of libidinous 70s pop tunes with tough beats. ""Savinnan"" sounds almost like Can, with a driving bass throb that the rubbery drummer clings to like a life preserver. ""Gay Club"" is acoustic and quieter but still danceable, stemming from some strain of music-hall tradition. Melodies seem drawn more from Northern European folk songs than the Western pop tradition, which lends an added degree of strangeness. This is not a great record by any means, but stick with Belinda's Swedish versions and you've got a pretty decent record for a rather indecent party.","When critics strain to pigeonhole a piece of music that's vaguely funky in that sleazy 70s way, the words ...

Interface,Heldon,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c15713d197565213bbac/1:1/w_160/b5475cb0.jpeg,2004-04-07 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3979-interface/,CobraCobra,"We take it for granted today, but not too long ago, integrating electronics into a rock setting was something exotic and strange. Before Kraftwerk, and certainly ages before all manner of modern digitally powered pop, hip-hop and experimental music, the only people interested enough in electronics to apply them in anything approaching rock were mad-scientists like Raymond Scott, Bruce Haack and David Vorhaus. These people were as much engineers as they were musicians, and history has granted them more technological props than musical ones. However, as the futuristic daydreams of the 50s and 60s graduated into the wide-eyed discovery by thousands of young, fearless kids in the 70s, the ideal of electronic interaction with guitars and drums seemed less an abstract, distant concept than a viable alternate reality. One of the earliest bands to exploit this marriage to its fullest potential was the French outfit Heldon, led by guitarist Richard Pinhas. Pinhas was heavily influenced by King Crimson leader Robert Fripp-- particularly his searing, sustained tone, coming on like an intensely focused acid-rock laser beam-- and a love of epic-length compositions. Pinhas was also very much enthralled by the idea of using programmed synthesizers in his work. His first records with Heldon are direct precursors to the industrial clang of bands like Throbbing Gristle, and later, Einstürzende Neubauten and Ministry, in their uses of menacing synth clusters performing seemingly endless patterns of perpetually churning, lysergic fuzz. However, his major impact wasn't felt until he combined his love of King Crimson's avant-progressive dynamics with his fetish for doom-filled, minimalist tech-core. The apexes of this fusion were represented on 1976's Un Reve Sans Consequence Speciale and this album, 1977's Interface. Pinhas worked with two of the finest musicians of his country on Interface: keyboardist Patrick Gauthier (later of Magma), and powerhouse drummer Francois Auger. With this pair, Pinhas was able to construct massive specimens of metronomic terror while still being able to constantly shift the focus of the sound. In concert, they might stretch five-minute patterns into half-hour death races, never deviating from the pre-ordained settings of an army of sequenced synthesizers. The classic Heldon lineup was like an inhuman mix of Tangerine Dream's otherworldly journeys into space and time and the finely tuned brawn of The Mahavishnu Orchestra, not to mention featuring practically orgasmic guitar solos that would make Makoto Kawabata blush. It was excessive to a fault, but then, any music designed to draw out the darkest demons of an acid trip should've been. The first side of the original LP consists of several relatively short pieces, each nonetheless in the immediately identifiable Heldon style. Auger's ""Les Soucoupes Volantes Vertes"" and ""Bal-A-Fou"" both feature synth-ostinatos under which he pounds like Jaki Leibezeit on triple-dosage steroids. The thick rumble of the latter tune almost makes you forget there was no bassist in the band. Pinhas' ""Jet Girl"" is fairly similar to his earlier Heldon efforts in that it forsakes typical rock aggression for bleak, apocalyptic soundscapes more often identified with the industrial music that was inspired, in part, by this band. Nevertheless, Pinhas' distant, raging guitar serves fair warning that this music originates from the same psychedelic heart as many other concurrent night-trippers like Ash Ra Tempel and Hawkwind, even if the execution was completely different. The meat of Interface is its 18-minute title track (also featured in two truncated live versions on this Cuneiform reissue). Beginning with phased, metallic hammering, morphing into a percussive pattern and eventually traveling through a truly intimidating labyrinth of synthesizers, howling guitars and all-around horrific, swirling thunder, ""Interface"" is the definitive avant-prog nightmare. With each passing minute, it seems more detail is layered into the piece, so that before too long, there's so much going on, I can only really make out a single, lurching beast. Rattlesnake electric drums going off on the right, bass-heavy synthlines threatening to throw me off balance, Auger's constantly mutating drum patterns-- but most of all, Pinhas' absolutely unhinged soloing. He starts out merely deranged, bending lines all over the place, like a strung-out Hendrix taking his wrath upon Silicon Valley. His lines eventually transform into almost pure noise, jumping up just long enough for you to notice that your speakers are about to blow from all the commotion below. It really is an obscene mess, but still a gorgeous one. This CD is the same issue that Cuneiform released a few years back, but which had gone out of print almost as soon. Anyone with even a passing interest in electronic/rock hybrid music should check it out, as well as those wanting to hear one of the chief precedents for bands ranging from Lightning Bolt to Neurosis to Squarepusher. To many (including me), Heldon and Richard Pinhas are considered building blocks for whole schools of experimental rock music, and one of the few who rarely fail to deliver on the hype.","We take it for granted today, but not too long ago, integrating electronics into a rock setting was something\n ...

It's All Around You,Tortoise,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e85e6ef959693210b4/1:1/w_160/75aa9019.jpg,2004-04-07 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8117-its-all-around-you/,Thrill Jockey,"Next month, the Japanese toymaker Takara, purveyor of the electronic dog translator Bow-Lingual and the artificial songbirds Breezy Singers, will market The Dream Workshop, or ""Yumemi Kobo."" The device looks like a cheap viewscreen attached to a baby monitor or shower radio. For \xA514,800, users will (theoretically) be able to create and control their dreams. After the sleeper inserts and ogles an image associated with the desired dream, the bedside contraption emits odors, soothing music, and voice recordings during deep REM sleep to steer the brain through the proper nocturnal narrative. Having received a prototype of the toy for an article in Cold Sweat, the magazine of nightmares and nightmare culture, I decided to kill two birds with one stone and review The Dream Workshop and fifth Tortoise album, It's All Around You, together. I followed the instructions, drank a bottle of wine, inserted the smooth atmospheric rambling of Tortoise into the sound drives, and went to bed. In my dream, I threw a stone which ricocheted off the head of a Blue Jay, and into the soft breast plate of an American Goldfinch. (One should not use the Breezy Singers songbird simulators with The Dream Workshop.) On the second try, I scanned the fantastic artwork of It's All Around You into the Workshop's monitor and stared intently into the image. Looking at the cover, I hoped to take a dip in the waterfall, cross the bridge by the rainbow, or wander down into the L.A. grid that glows like bioluminescent deep sea creatures. Oliver Wasow's surreal, technicolor images of social decay, natural awe, and disaster begged to be experienced in a state of lucid dreaming. In fact, even Tortoise themselves seem so overwhelmed by the majesty of the images that these 10 songs sound more influenced by the digitally enhanced landscapes than some collective subconscious muse. Clearly, the seasoned Chicago ambient jamband hopes to whisk listeners through these beautiful, unreal vistas. Unfortunately, they just end up emulating the hi-glossed cardboard the scenes are printed on. As I lay in bed, the album's opening title track gracefully lifted off with John McEntire's skittering helicopter-blade percussion and Doug McCombs' lightly turbulent bass. Jeff Parker, Tortoise's most significant member, pointed to bushes and dawn-illuminated mist with his languid, soloing guitar, setting the mood for ""The Lithium Stiffs"". Here, Kelly Hogan's vocals-- little more than Calgon ahh's processed through a keyboard-- perfectly emulated the state of relaxed awe. It's the most emotional piece of music Tortoise have yet created, working the numbing psychotropia of the title against the joyous exaltations of Hogan's vertiginous sighs. The bass deepened dramatically, mimicking the throb of an eardrum pulse cupped against a pillow. But much as Hogan's vocals beckoned and hinted at audio bliss, they sadly dissipated, leaving the brain little to focus on but percussion, chimes and vibraphone, like your amplified heartbeat, or a dripping showerhead in the dead black night of your home. ""Stretch (You Are All Right)"" naggingly fought The Dream Workshop for my attention in such a manner. Here, after a promising start, Tortoise stubbornly began to adhere to their tested formula of studio-perfect skittering and vibraphone. (Is there a more monotonous sounding instrument than vibraphones? Even at their best they sound like florid doorbells.) Finally, my brain gave in fully to slumber out of bored frustration. It's All Around You, too, settled into REM sleep at that point. Even the band's busy percussion on ""Dot/Eyes"", electronic glitch on ""By Dawn"", and, uh, more skittering percussion and glitch and vibraphone on ""Unknown"" and ""Five Too Many"" seemed as instinctual and unnoticeable as fluttering eyelids, letting the subconscious spend more valuable time in dreams or the decayed island city depicted inside of the digipak. The titles alone struck me as profoundly insightful. ""By Dawn""? If I was lucky. ""Five Too Many?"" Indeed. Finally, by the concluding ""Salt the Skies"", Tortoise and The Dream Workshop synched up with effect, taking me into the rusty, charred landscape of the inset photograph. Clouds gathered. John McEntire quickened his drum hammering. Oil lines exploded in flames. Jeff Parker let feedback spill from his guitar. And as the final chime ebbed with the darkness, I awoke. The beginning of a dream, and its climax, always stick most to memory. Tortoise, too, lure you in with nifty production tricks and winding melodies at the start of the album, and build to closing climaxes, just as they've done in the past on ""TNT"", ""Seneca"", and ""Speakeasy."" It's the middling middles that have always bogged their albums. More frustrating, however, is that, after the scrappy Standards, where Parker spiked the mix with sparks and grime, Tortoise have pressed their music back into Scandinavian furniture. Cold Ikea percussion frames hold downy white duvets of keyboards, the music sterile and functional. Looks lovely in the storefront window, but isn't quite comfortable for heavy petting or watching baseball. Like Japanese toys-- The Dream Workshop, and the Furby and Tamagochi before it-- Tortoise obviously spend hours in the lab honing the science, but the finished product comes with a one-time novelty factor. The most insipid reviews of instrumental music inevitably refer to the music as ""soundtracks to the best film never made!"" Sadly, Tortoise have been outdone by the still photographs accompanying their music.","Next month, the Japanese toymaker Takara, purveyor of the electronic dog translator Bow-Lingual and the\n\ artificial songbirds Breezy Singers ...

The People at Large,Amps for Christ,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08d5e6ef9596931ff9b/1:1/w_160/3320fa3d.jpg,2004-04-07 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/174-the-people-at-large/,5RC,"In the early 90s, I sublet half a freezing room to the world's most earnest Man Is the Bastard fan. Since I didn't want his money, we set up a barter system: Every couple of weeks he handed over heavy bags of vegetables and various tofu products from the organic grocer where he worked. It functioned well for both of us: He got the food for cost and I ate at home instead of walking to the sketchy Chinese restaurant down the street. Moreover, we used his payment for meals that the entire household prepared together. In retrospect, our method of reimbursement fit well with the politics of Man Is the Bastard, the sludgy Southern California noise-core band to which he so frequently stirred the pasta. And though a cramped NYC apartment makes me wary of reintroducing these idyllic arrangements into my current living situation, if he did wander back looking for some floor-space and a mattress, perhaps we could listen to The People at Large while we pureed our rosemary and chickpeas. Now presenting mellower fare, Henry Barnes, the voluminously bearded mystic behind Claremont, California's Amps for Christ, played guitar and prepared organ in Man Is the Bastard before founding AFC in 1997. On his seventh album, the violence has been replaced with a few pinches of feedback and a whole lot of pretty sitar, wiry Fahey-esque plucking, gentle folk strums, ballads layered with crumbling distortion, and one instance of boom-box screamo. Behind the stylistic maturation, though, the political grumbles remain. Despite the misleading tones of his gentle whispers, Barnes takes Bush to task for the war in Iraq, critiques America's soulless greed, and offers a less than idealized version of 9/11. Like any good punk, he also scrawls political manifestos-cum-poetry throughout the CD's liner notes: ""Don't look now George but a big snake's got you by the toe/ This time it's Muhammad sayin let my people go."" And because Barnes is unabashedly passionate about his Christianity, these ""holy war"" disses offer an extra resonance. Despite some proselytizing, like Sufjan Stevens or The Danielson Famile, Barnes doesn't come off pushy or self-righteous; rather, he just seems really confident and calm. Wisely escaping the overwroughtness of a ham-fisted Propaghandi screamathon, Amps for Christ let the music do most of the pontificating. While ""AFC Tower Song"" is fairly explicit in its subject matter, when Tara Tikitavi sings ""Prince Charlie Stuart,"" a traditional Scottish ballad popularized by Steeleye Span, there's a less obvious sense of the political couched in her anachronistic harmonizing of the Bonnie Prince's exile in Spain. Placing interpretation squarely in the hands of the listener, the apocalyptic ""Firecube"" pumps out chirpy KK Null noise, while the blissful ""Freddie the Mockingbird"" is just chirpy. Perhaps mirroring the vast populism of its title, The People at Large has the charm of an overstuffed antique jukebox stuck between 45s: I hear Iran fronting the Sun City Girls, Captain Beefheart collaborating with Merzbow, the old Shrimper band Goosewind trying some Appalachia. The laid-back spoken poetry of ""Bug"" hits like the ""fast and bulbous"" intro to ""Pachuco Cadaver"" on Trout Mask Replica. ""Banjo Hymn"" breaks hearts with its lovely sustain and eventual hoedown. The stately minuet ""Midianite Prelude"" reminds me of the opening to an episode of Masterpiece Theater, though I've never actually watched the show. This breadth is impressive (the record's twenty-three songs equals the track count of 2002's The Oak in the Ashes), but the continual shift between styles also highlights weaknesses. For instance, the overstated ""Memmorial Immemorial (Revisited)"" and its ponderous soloing, left me yearning for the clean lines of an endless sitar, hinted at wonderfully on ""Tarsit"" and ""Claremont Raga"". Still, Barnes continues to forge an engaging hodgepodge of musical/political/spiritual obsessions, and whatever the eventual pitfalls of this patchy eclecticism, finding a form within these shambles is an enjoyable task.","In the early 90s, I sublet half a freezing room to the world's most earnest Man Is the Bastard ...

Tinnitus Vu,OrganumZ'EV,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3b13d197565213b02a/1:1/w_160/58235be7.gif,2004-04-07 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6094-tinnitus-vu/,Touch,"There are few artists more elusive than David Jackman. The only interview of his I've ever read was in ND Magazine, featuring a photograph of a little shrew in lieu of a portrait of Jackman. Active in modern music since the early 1960s, Jackman took part in British composer Cornelius Cardew's crucial Scratch Orchestra, which at various times has featured luminaries such as granddaddies of noise AMM, composers Howard Skempton and Gavin Bryars, and the legendary Brian Eno. Since then-- either under his own name or under the more recognized moniker, Organum-- Jackman has released countless records that exist on the peripheral edges of industrial and experimental music. Whether on cassette, LP, or single, these transmissions are usually cooked up in editions so miniscule that within weeks of their release their average eBay price is greater than the number of extant copies. As private as Jackman is, his list of collaborators reads like a who's who of experimental heavyweights: Jim O'Rourke, Nurse with Wound's Steve Stapleton, Current 93's David Tibet, Main, Eddie Prevost, The Haters, The New Blockaders, and Christoph Heemann have all had roles in his ongoing Organum project. This new release stems from a 1999 dinner date between mutual acquaintances, at which Jackman handed tapes over to prototypical sound pounder, Z'EV. It's an apt pairing considering that Z'EV's ear-bleeding early work laid the I-beams for folks like Einstürzende Neubauten and Test Dept. (He also kept the klangbeat on ""anvil"" for an early Glenn Branca symphony.) Despite both men's love of muscular and metallic drones, natural sound decay, and endless mechanistic churning (Jackman has released singles of machine gun fire and tank engines), this new alliance leans more towards Organum's propensity toward maddening brevity. As a result, Tinnitus Vu is four tracks long and clocks in just at 16 minutes. Named after a garden lunch discussion they had about each other's loss of hearing, initiate listeners might not quite understand what they're hearing, either: In Jackman's oeuvre, sound sources are impossible to approximate. A resounding piano chord-- stretched and morphed beyond recognition-- introduces each shift in the drone. Even with all the manipulations, these suspended strings carry through the buzzing din. The record's sleeve art, which features an x-rayed boxspring on its cover and stretched-out coils strung along a snow-coated fence in the countryside on its back, suggests these too could be the source of the drone. As always with Organum, that metal-scratched drone is dangerous, hypnotic, brutal, and beatific. ""II"" creaks like a squeaky bed and a wind-blasted ghost ship, while ""III"" glowers with menacing Vader-esque breathing until the ringing piano returns. Tinnitus Vu is more widely available than most of Jackman's intriguing and defining work, much of which has been released on smaller imprints such as Germany's Die Stadt, the U.S.'s Robot Records, the UK's Matchless, and Japan's Siren Records. But even if it's impossible to completely capture or collect all of Jackman's output-- even the ones that feature his best work-- each of his droning soundsc(r)apes is still a treat.",,6.9,
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,Various Artists,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fcea9e61561daa54b7/1:1/w_160/5f2d372b.jpg,2004-04-06 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7890-eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind/,Hollywood,"If you haven't yet, go see this (great) film. In a paragraph or two, I may spoil the hell out of it. Given its subject matter, Michel Gondry's new film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, has a particularly visual agenda, which makes great use of the medium's most important quality: its ability to collapse the distinction between linear and synchronic plot development. Charlie Kaufman has essentially written a film's film, which is fine-- wonderful, in fact-- but what storytelling role does Eternal Sunshine leave, then, for its soundtrack? The answer here is not much of one. Jon Brion has written a perfectly ambient score: It's undistracting, yet contains interesting sounds and ideas for those who choose to be distracted by it. But with this balance comes a powerful dependence on Eternal Sunshine's visual elements. The value of listening to Brion's score by itself-- with the exception of his thematically tongue-in-cheek ""Strings That Tie to You""-- is situated in the potency of its corresponding visual nostalgia. This seems to be the logical fate of most film scores, but in the case of Eternal Sunshine, Brion's insistence on certain themes popping in and out of his textures seems particularly appropriate, as the soundtrack's fluid matrix performatizes the cinematography's mind/body collapse: In the film, Brion's organi-synthgaze postlude ""Phone Calls"" plays after Joel decides not to try and save his first memory of Clementine, but just to enjoy it. Here, Brion's score meets Eternal Sunshine's oculophilia halfway, and fittingly comprises one of the film's most potent scenes. By now I trust you've seen the trailers for Eternal Sunshine, and yes, the song that backs it (Electric Light Orchestra's ""Mr. Blue Sky"") is present here, despite not finding time in the film itself. The Polyphonic Spree also contribute two heavy doses of equally sugary pop (""Light and Day"" and ""It's the Sun""), while Anaheim garage trio The Willowz offer two shameless, anonymous, but ultimately tolerable White Stripes rip-offs. Also present is Lata Mangeshkar's Indian spook ""Wada Na Tod"", which plays from the kitchen radio in Clementine's apartment in a moment of comic self-indictment: Clementine works at Barnes & Noble, which these days seems to pride itself on its peddling of ""world"" music releases. The song title means ""Don't break your promise,"" and subtly hints at Clementine's final request of Joel-- that he meet her again. And then there's the Beck track, a cover of The Korgis' ""Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime"". Scott Plagenhoef panned this track in a recent We Are The World review, but I think Beck did a really fine job reworking the original, and here's why: The song appears at three critical junctures in Eternal Sunshine when Joel feels trapped by the bitterly ironic circumstances of his memory erasure. Beck's cover logically cannot encompass ""love's multiple dimensions"" in the same way as the original version, as it would make for an odd juxtaposition: From Joel's perspective, love has only one side, its unrequitedness and devastation. In these moments, love is hardly ""a journey always worth taking."" Fittingly, Beck revoices all the chords to be decidedly less bright and colorful, and with this move, he changes the tone of the song's repetitive lyrics from their originally bittersweet positivity to a perfectly contradictory melancholy. When Beck sings, ""Change your heart,"" we know very well that Joel does not have the power to change his own. This is the song's beautiful ironic tension, which is used to fantastic effect in the movie's final scene: Joel and Clementine's mutual emotional attraction ultimately gives way to reason. It's triumph of reason over human emotion, summed up perfectly by their laughter-- Gondry's final nod to Nietzsche, who said (roughly) that laughter signifies the death of an emotion. Beck's song starts here again: Joel and Clementine have finally learned, and what they've learned comprises the film's disarmingly icy pessimism.","If you haven't yet, go see this (great) film.

Miles of Smiles EP,Black Dice,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d8ea9e61561daa4b43/1:1/w_160/238a4179.jpg,2004-04-06 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/750-miles-of-smiles-ep/,DFA,"Last year-- slumped over a table at a bar that could pass as the center of Brooklyn's music community-- I asked Black Dice vocalist-turned-knobtwister Eric Copeland what he thought of his band's place in modern noise's renaissance, as well as its knowledge of that genre's past. ""I feel like there is an underground that is really aware of this stuff,"" he said. ""We're a little bit behind-- like we're catching up-- but it's kinda nice being ignorant of it. When we approach these ideas, they always feel new to us, even if they may not always sound new."" Ignorance is bliss: Just ask the roomful of monkeys at typewriters getting to the ear-poisoning monologue of Hamlet. Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive to simply say that Miles of Smiles-- Black Dice's contribution to a Tokyo gallery's Poetry of Sex installation, and the A-side to the band's latest 12-inch-- accidentally re-creates the ""Music Promenade"" section of French composer Luc Ferrari's 30-year-old landmark tape composition, Presque Rien. Both pieces utilize the field-recorded rhythms of a marching band's celebratory processional to swim between worlds alternately mundane and nightmarish-- the aural hallucinations running hot and cold-- but that's where the synchronicity ends. A blanket of bugs chirps at the start of the track and echoes throughout, and an egg rattle continually pans about as if stolen from Ragnar Grippe's minimal classic, Sand. Along with quoting records they've probably never heard, Black Dice flash a heavy amount of Krautrock tape foolery, taking cues from the meth/'luude interludes of Neu! 2 and echoing the mix of handheld percussion and endless reverberation of Can's kooky ""Ethnological Forgery Series"". Not content to just dissolve all this history into an ambient puddle, the track's frantic marching band brass section stomps double time for its giddy finale. The second half of the EP, ""Trip Dude Delay"", is a final postcard from the edges of Black Dice's familiar, expansive Beaches and Canyons sound. Having parted ways with drummer Hisham Bharoocha, Black Dice will no longer have his thunderous toms, crashing cymbals, and tribal rhythms to tether their drifts. ""Trip Dude Delay"" has opened Black Dice's live set for roughly two years, and it sounds as if Bjorn Copeland's guitar is a thousand twanging instruments. Sometimes the vocals sound ready to shuffle off this mortal coil, as if the Beach Boys' ""Our Prayer"" had been cut at Lee Perry's Black Ark. All are subsumed by Bharoocha's malleted cymbal, swelling into a nasty tempest. The captured cymbal frequencies scald at white-noise temperatures and the sub-woofers seep out lava, but it all retains a fine quintessence of dust and pumice. As oceanic as the middle section is-- overwhelming the senses in its unbridled noise-- its enormous natural forces and minute details remain intact, each droplet discerned in the tidal wave. As it cools, it reveals an isle full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not. It lounges like Martin Denny's tiki hut, a place where tropical thumb pianos coo with the washed-out vocal harmonies, serenely slurping back out to sea after nearly 15 minutes out of joint. Less musique concrète than a chunk of asphalt, Miles of Smiles moves in a delirious stagger. Eyes heavy lidded, flaunting ragged edges and torn cuffs, it revels in brave new worlds, even if those worlds are only new to them.","Last year-- slumped over a table at a bar that could pass as the center of Brooklyn's music community-- ...

Music by Cavelight,Blockhead,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44ec0084474cd0c0475/1:1/w_160/573ea46e.jpg,2004-04-06 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1104-music-by-cavelight/,Ninja Tune,"When an artist becomes attached to a particular producer, the partnership sometimes tends to put a strain on the beatmaker's personality. In the case of Blockhead and Def Jux emcee Aesop Rock, their names were seemingly attached to each other's achievements almost immediately. But it was inevitable, considering Aesop's affinity for production, that Blockhead would take a stab at the instrumental game with his debut album for Ninja Tune, Music by Cavelight. Far from experimental, Blockhead is a new breed of hard-edge traditionalist with few frills and a serious ear for samples. His rhyme-ready work is high-strung and bombastic, but, as is the custom with most indie producers, his instrumental work is darker and more placid by comparison. The album is rife with a variety of harrowing loops, as evidenced by the addictive, cleverly chopped guitar and layered strings of ""Road Rage Breakdown"" and the ebbing waves of bass, emotional piano, and orchestral arrangements on the stomping ""Insomniac Olympics"". One thing you'll notice, though, is a lack of pacing within each composition, as well as a general dearth of tonal variance throughout the span of the record. Anyone who has followed Blockhead's career would most likely attest to, one major factor of production as his Achilles' heel: the drums. And while it is true that some of his earlier work (and the odd track on this album) was prone to a seriously poor choice of drum set, nothing bothers me more in his beats than the bass. The basslines themselves aren't bad at all, but the sounds associated with them are incredibly distracting in the full scheme of things. Couple that with the fact that his use of pitchshifted vocal samples (a la Kanye West or Just Blaze) is awkwardly jarring, and you begin to see a lot of missed potential. But in the case of ""You've Got Maelstrom"", the sound works for the better. Opening with harmlessly faint keys and bongos, this track leaves the listener ill-prepared for its onslaught of scratches, a seemingly Elizabethan xylophone melody, and a sharp synthline. Soon, a saxophone is introduced, followed by a splash of flute that gets cut by timely vocal samples and crushed by Miami bass drums, horns, and tortured yelps. It doesn't have the emotional resonance harnessed by more time-tested instrumental compilers in the underground, but it's incredibly listenable nonetheless. All around, Blockhead's first foray into solo sound collage is far from bad, but it rarely steals the show the way his rapper-associated work tends to. Then again, maybe this was his intention: to release a nuanced, traditional production clinic that has more in common with trip-hop and chillout than pure hip-hop grandiosity. Either way, even without the experimentation of Rjd2 or the upbeat nature of his better known work, there is definitely a place for the calm tones of Blockhead's debut.","When an artist becomes attached to a particular producer, the partnership sometimes tends to put a strain on the beatmaker ...

Old Paint,Freakwater,by: Philip Shelley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1dabf31b7dc71560cb/1:1/w_160/82943fa9.gif,2004-04-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3184-old-paint/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"Originally formed as a cover band/side-project by longtime friends (and Louisville punk scene veterans) Catherine Ann Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean, Freakwater was renowned for its strict adherence to bare-bones Appalachian musical forms. Their first couple of releases helped jumpstart the alt-country movement in the early 90s, boasting little more than the cheaply recorded acoustic guitars and vocal harmonies of the two frontwomen, augmented by sparing use of stand-up bass, pedal steel, dobro, and other stylistically appropriate instruments. But this stark, almost severe attention to form was not merely an academic exercise. There was a bucket-load of heart-wrenching humanity there, too. A lot of that is due to Irwin herself. Other performers have mined this uber-authentic vein from a certain distance, gingerly handling traditional themes (salvation, drunkenness, poverty) and song-structures like sacred library texts to be presented as if under glass. By contrast, Irwin comes across as the genuine article-- a musically homely, inexpert oddball, the updated embodiment of the tragic eccentrics that have always populated this kind of musical landscape. It never sounds like she had to study how to sing or write this way. Her songs and her singing sound convincingly lived-in. Also contributing to the human factor is the car-wreck compelling, between-the-lines story that is related solely through the interplay of the two women's voices. Countless other long-standing vocal duos have rung the harmony bell with more crystalline clarity, but few have wrestled so explicitly to define a real-world relationship in song. This subtext allows Bean and Irwin to transcend their vocal limitations and gives the music an emotional, in-the-room immediacy that is simply not available to more accomplished practitioners. Old Paint, originally released in 1996, was Freakwater's high-water mark as a going concern. For the second time, it paired them with madwoman-in-the-attic production specialist Brad Wood, who was still basking in the afterglow of his work with Liz Phair. Bassist Dave Gay was now permanently on board as the third band member, and steel player Bob Egan, who would later spend some time in Jeff Tweedy's revolving door, was on hand to provide the color commentary. Bean and Irwin were more than ready, with an album's worth of supremely evocative original songs-- for the first time, the few, well-chosen covers on a Freakwater album were there to lend context to the original songs, and not the other way around. The first lines of Old Paint's opening ""Gravity"" announce Freakwater's worldview quite clearly: ""I wasn't drinking to forget/ I was drinking to remember/ How I once might have looked through the eyes of a stranger."" A couple of songs later, on ""Gone to Stay"", things have only gotten worse, as Irwin sings, mournful but clear-eyed, ""There's nothing so sure as a razor blade above your wrist."" By ""Hero/Heroine"", the situation is downright hopeless, with some nasty Stones-ish slide work and bleary observations like, ""Everyone who gets drunk will not write a good book."" There are some moments of redemption as well, from the jet-black humor that propels the buoyant ""Waitress Song"" to the heavenly cello that levitates the haunting cover of Loudon Wainwright's ""Out of This World"". So much discussion about bands like Freakwater hinges on questions of authenticity. As Old Paint demonstrates, that's pretty much missing the point. Specific styles of music are important, of course, because they carry certain traditions across generational lines. But on a personal level, they're really just empty vehicles. No musician can get anything of substance from a particular musical style-- it's what the musicians bring of themselves that matters. On Old Paint, Bean and Irwin gave so generously of themselves that style and substance became virtually indistinguishable, and that's an achievement worth drinking to remember.","Originally formed as a cover band/side-project by longtime friends (and Louisville punk scene veterans) Catherine Ann Irwin and Janet ...

That he describes himself as a combination of Lee Perry, Stockhausen, and contemporary drum-n-bass pioneer Squarepusher-- all subject to ""gasoline enemas""-- may seem both egocentric and anally preoccupied enough to encourage further Freudian character analysis. But however (un)justified you judge his self-opinion to be, Funk is currently producing some of the most challenging compositions on electronica veteran Mike ""\xB5-Ziq"" Paradinas' Planet Mu label. His frantic production schedule has seen him messily hemorrhaging at least two full-lengths of chaotic, genre-devouring work each year-- with the emphasis often on shock and sensation. And this year's The Chocolate Wheelchair Album won't likely disappoint his audience, containing variations on the crazy-paving soundscapes with which Funk has become synonymous. But: Does it suggest enough of a progression to substantiate Funk's lofty allusions to the pioneers mentioned above? Rumor has it that Funk's original title for this album was The Stupid Chocolate Wheelchair Album, an idea quashed by a disapproving Paradinas. That didn't stop Funk taking a black marker to pre-release copies distributed at promotional gigs last year and ""correcting"" the tamed album title. You see, Funk does whatever the hell he wants-- a philosophy that thrives unchecked in the studio. Ever since the gorgeous fusion of opera, eruptive break beats, and a cappella melodic phrasing on ""Dance Like You're Selling Nails"" (from 2002's Higgins Ultra Low Track Glue Funk Hits 1972-2006), Venetian Snares has deserved some indulgence of his attention-seeking musical tendencies. And if this album fails to capture the originality of his best work, it at least captures a similar spirit. ""Einstein-Rosen Bridge"" vibrates with funky guitars channeled into revisionist techno mockery set to trademark hectic beats. The overall effect is surging and rampant; Funk camps it up with throwaway vocal samples and something akin to game-show style orchestral hits. This track obliterates the immediately forgettable glitch noodling of ""Langside"", a piece made obsolete by Funk's own superior past efforts in this area. ""Handthrow"" starts out, worryingly enough, like an early jungle track, merely accelerated and panned about with nothing resembling innovation; its distortion-happy, shoot-'em-up descent into monotonous snare button-hammering isn't much better, either. Despite The Chocolate Wheelchair Album's intriguingly perverse wackiness, a weakness begins to emerge as it plays. Funk has always flitted between styles, making each track a microcosm of multiple genres. The riotous pastiche that has served Funk so well in the past here threatens to deaden one's senses to the individual moments of inspiration. When psychotic mood swings and jaw-dropping reversals are this ubiquitous, they lose their ability to shock, and, criminally, they almost lull. Funk packs so much processed pandemonium into each song that you can't help thinking that a dozen or more of those rapid-fire ideas could have been set aside and nurtured over their own four minutes. Still, even within this dense barrage of skewered noise, there lies a handful of intriguing moments to snap listeners to attention: Standout tracks ""Herbie Goes Ballistic"" and ""Marty's Tardis""-- the latter featuring an affectionate reworking of the Doctor Who theme-- see ideas and form presented in equal measure. And if nothing else, the record is more accessible than 2001's boisterous Songs About My Cat. Of course, none of this changes that notion that Funk is suffering the plight of many an electronic composer-- a limitless availability of sonic tools and the fetishistic desire to push each one to the limit. Like an electronic magpie, Funk surrounds himself with all that glisters. Thankfully, half the time he produces gold.","Aaron Funk (aka Venetian Snares) claims his first musical experience was attending an in utero Mike Oldfield\n\ session courtesy ...

A Name Writ in Water,The One AM Radio,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba39ea9e61561daa7196/1:1/w_160/f402559b.jpg,2004-04-05 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6093-a-name-writ-in-water/,Level Plane,"The easiest critical dart to toss at an electronic musician is to suggest that his/her music doesn't boast the same kind of greasy, crooked fingerprints that lend other, non-computerized genres a sense of humanity. But Hrishikesh Hirway, the lone face behind the electric-bedroom swansongs of The One AM Radio, is perfectly poised to prove the opposite true, twisting and pulling his beats and effects until they burn like fingernails. Folding soft, singer/songwriter laments into fuzzy washes of constructed sound, A Name Writ in Water, The One AM Radio's second full-length, is a collection of swooning folk songs, just sweet and compelling enough to make your well-worn Nick Drake tapes feel curiously obsolete. And while they may not be as gory as a seven-minute guitar solo, Hirway's tracks still dripping with loads of gooey heart. Since teaming with violinist Jane Yakowitz in 1999, Hirway has gradually delved deeper and deeper into folktronica nuance, rolling out subtle, beat-tinged poems and spare, instrumental elegies. Most of A Name Writ in Water trades in blurry transitions: The stunning opener, ""What You Gave Away"", starts with gently shaken percussion as Hirway's soft vocals give way to a fleeting violin wail and quivering maracas falling into puttering beats. Hirway's coos slip into computerized warbles, and a plaintive trumpet finally overtakes the melody, ending in a haze of sharp, sad yowls. Standout ""Shivers"" opens with glitchy drones and woozy violins, its emotional narrative only stronger for its lack of vocals. ""Buried Below"", though, is defiantly straightforward, its light acoustic strums and nervous drums backing Hirway's multi-tracked, melancholic pledges. Hirway's lyrics can occasionally seem convoluted (""Streetlights spark to life as we pass by/ Caught in panes of warehouse windows and reflecting in your eyes/ Lying on your lawn on our sides/ We'll stay outside""), and are generally preoccupied with standard issues of movement, life, death, loss and love. But Hirway's prose is also peppered with imagistic bits of landscape, all grass and dust and summer sunsets. Coupled with his breathy, organic whispers, much of A Name Writ in Water invites big, natural metaphors, somehow only easily comparable to snow-capped mountain ranges or towering, Sigur Rós-ian icecaps. His compositions simply feel colossal. Unsurprisingly, A Name Writ in Water is stubbornly unassuming in its prettiness, inadvertently figuring songs as portraits, melodies as promises. While not nearly as pert or quirky as The Postal Service's like-minded debut, The One AM Radio is just as addictive-- but Hirway's version of America is less concerned with enigmatically assassinated presidents, and more interested in charting the gray spots between highways and oceans, between guitars and laptops. The maps he draws are beautiful.","The easiest critical dart to toss at an electronic musician is to suggest that his/her music doesn't boast ...

Get Away from Me,Nellie McKay,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45b5e6ef95969323a37/1:1/w_160/269c2189.jpg,2004-04-05 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5582-get-away-from-me/,Sony,"Nellie McKay is awful because she's cute-- gratingly cute, the cutest drama chick in high school, just 19 years old and already writing sharper tunes than, well, most girls her age who write pop songs. Then there's that 1950s-era kitsch cover photo of McKay wearing an adorable red coat that matches her lipstick, and orchestral arrangements that circle her piano with sweet pippy strings and flute tweets. She swoons, she yells, and she even raps, though that's not as bad as when she cops an accent like Astrud Gilberto's. And when the lyrics get political and she tut-tuts George W. Bush... man, this record's annoying. But McKay is also great because she's cute. She sings about her kitty and she even acts like one herself, baring her claws because she can pretend she doesn't know how to use them. Every potentially annoying turn of phrase is like a secret ingredient that drives her songs into your skull. For example, she doesn't sing about a clone-- it's a clonie. And how retro is it to use a fizzy sound effect when she sings about pouring a drink? McKay's the latest in the recent wave of NPR-friendly young women who like to sing with their clothes on. If you consider Norah Jones to be the leader of this pack and Joss Stone the one who just plain works the hardest, then that makes McKay the maverick. Clever enough to flit across a broad pastiche instead of coasting by on jazz ballads, McKay can also be just edgy enough-- she swears but she's no sailor-- and she throws out barbs more to disrupt herself than her audience. Take the lyrics, which are both shallow and unfathomable. When other teens are singing about boys, McKay only seems to know men in their 40s, ones who spend more time lecturing her about jazz than breaking her heart. McKay also has plenty of bile for the ladies, making fun of suburban housewives even while she acts scared that she'll become one. Either way, a line like, "" I want to get married/ That's why I was born,"" is the kind of teenage smarm that you get from people who are too young to make those mistakes. ""Won't U Please B Nice"" is a flawless satire of a money-hungry wife-cum-femme-fatale-- until the bridge makes a distracting (and outdated) N'Sync joke. And in case you were lulled by the closing ballad, ""Really"", she breaks the mood with a snap about a ""yuppie fuck."" The only time it sounds like something is at stake is when she finally turns the bile on herself, like the self-doubt in ""Sari""-- on which she's spitting mad at herself and the world-- or ""Change the World"", where she's honest about how trivial life's big questions sound when they're filtered through teenage white guilt. When she sings, ""Am I hetero or queer?"", it isn't t.A.T.u.-like tantalization, but idle speculation. If McKay can't make up her mind about herself, that also suits the music, which is a mess of jazz, pop, and easy listening. At their most obvious, the arrangements sound like a 1970s variety show, and you can picture a fiddler on a hoe-down set for ""It's a Pose"", or a cardboard NYC skyline wheeled out for ""Manhattan Avenue"". But under all of that, McKay brings the goods. Her graceful melodies, barbed hooks, and confident voice take command on the itchingly catchy ""Ding Dong"" and ""The Suitcase Song"", on which she proves how smoothly she can tickle the ivory, what a warm massage her vocals can become, and how seductive she might someday sound. With better lyrics and a longer attention span, McKay would be a jaw-dropping songwriter, but it's difficult to get sucked into a song if you don't connect with the singer. McKay can't decide whether she'll grow up to be Dorothy Parker or Holly Golightly, and by splitting the difference, she only catches the funny parts of either. Next time she'll need to give us more depth, to sustain us when the cute wears off.","Nellie McKay is awful because she's cute-- gratingly cute, the cutest drama chick in high school, just 19 years ...

Tough Luv,Young Gunz,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab19ea9e61561daa5cdc/1:1/w_160/93cf04a2.jpg,2004-04-05 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8907-tough-luv/,Def JamRoc-A-Fella,"Jay-Z sensed skepticism in the furrowed brows of the Def Jam bigwigs, but he came prepared. His only hobbies of late-- basketball and high-stakes poker-- had left him time to think, and he felt confident that his latest project, Operation: Female Demographic, would bring in the easy cheddar: Russell Simmons: So, you finally came to announce the signing of Common and Mos Def, right? It took you long enough but I'm glad you... Jay-Z: Naw, Russell, ain't nothin' like that. This is better. Lyor Cohen: Tell me he's white! Jay-Z: Sorry, pal. Two guys from Philly. Simmons: Okay, what they got? Jay-Z: Well... let's say they're the latest in Rocafella technology: We've combined the repetition of Beanie Sigel, the exaggerated cadence of Freeway, the incredibly boring street lyrics of Memphis Bleek, and the completely nonsensical constant-rhyme style of Cam'ron. Cam'ron: I also have my own cologne. Simmons: What's your marketing plan? How you gonna sell this? Jay-Z: Surely, it sells itself! I mean, come on, they sound like all of my proteges combined and-- get this-- they are young! Simmons: You've made me far too much money to say no to you. Whatever. Later, at Baseline Studios, Jay assists his boys in cutting their first record. Even early on, the Philly duo thought the plan seemed a bit strange... Young Chris: So why exactly is the album called Tough Luv? I mean, first off, I'm a very non-violent individual and I feel as if love is something that is only experienced once. On the real, Dr. Phil said... Jay-Z: Nigga, fuck Dr. Phil! Your motivation on this record is as follows: You want to fuck every girl that you see and you are murderous. Basically, just sound like someone a dad wouldn't want to see his little girl out with. Young Chris: This'll truly be an adventure! I haven't worked in a musical in months! Dissention comes between the group during a discussion about the record's progress around the midway point... Neef: I don't care who this Juelz guy is. When he says, ""I been laying the pipe in every lady, I liked up in the 80s/ My life is really crazy, I been like this since the 80s,"" it doesn't make any fucking sense! He's only 19! Does that mean he was a four-year-old pimp, with a gold-plated high seat and a three-wheeler with 24-inch rims? Young Chris: Kids is growin' up faster every generation. Neef: And dude, you've been sleepwalkin' through this album. Come on, ""Baby, it's the Roc/ I'm the baby from the Roc,"" is detrimental to the violent image we need to portray. ""They're lacking heat like Bermuda?"" And, ""Your pigeons ain't risin', man/ It's like you're lactose tolerant,"" I mean, I know what you were going for, but... seriously, man, you have a pretty nice flow, but I feel like you're not even trying sometimes! Young Chris: Listen, you got problems, too: ""In order to fuck mine, you gotta suck me off first""? Do you know what you're saying half the time? Besides, don't matter what we're saying, our fans are gonna be bored with this album in like two weeks anyway. Every guest emcee makes us look like assholes. Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel and Freeway are way too good to be on songs with us. Shit, Cam'ron says ""Stolen cable, still got the chip in box/ Still got the clip and glock, FEEL LIKE THE CHICKEN POX"" and still manages to steal that song from us. Damon Dash: Don't forget about Chingy on the ""Can't Stop Won't Stop"" remix! That's some gold on there. But Neef, you don't seem too happy about your paycheck! It's fine, you'll be easily replaced. I think I hear a dice game down the block... Neef: Whoa, hold up, boss. I don't mean to disrespect or nothin', but have you heard these beats? This ""Take It How U Want It"" song sounds like ""Braveheart Party"". That shit was so bad, it got taken off Stillmatic! We're supposed to be the answer to Nas, you know? And ""That's Right"" has that awful, high-pitched piano roll. Sounds like Andrew W.K. playing the Halloween song. I don't even know who Chad Hamilton is! To be honest, I'm feelin' that ""$$$ Girls"" song with the Halls & Oates sample, but I mean, if I had my way, I'd just have the shit done by Just Bl... Damon Dash: Bitch, you ain't got your way. Keep making those hits, baby! [does signature dance while holding bottle] On the set of the ""No Better Love"" video, the director gives the boys some helpful hints... Director: Hey you! Shorter one! When I say ""Walk Like a Panther"" I don't mean walk like a pussy! And other one, you don't like you could take 14 Shots to the Dome, I'd even say you were far from Bad! Why are your shirts on?! Young Chris: [sighs] I can't even believe this is how I'm paying my way through the dance institute. I should've never came to the blunt spot with you that night, Neef. Neef: Whatever, hug that girl tighter. I gotta look warm and inviting, yet intimidating. The video is released. Enter two young girls... Katie: What do you think of Young Gunz?

Good News for People Who Love Bad News,Modest Mouse,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37a69fc7814a47cd65c/1:1/w_160/c2dad375.jpg,2004-04-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5363-good-news-for-people-who-love-bad-news/,Epic,"Early in their career, Modest Mouse accomplished what may be the ultimate goal of any band: to forge a unique and recognizable sound from the most basic elements of rock music. By the time they'd released their second album, The Lonesome Crowded West, the band was working with a distinct but manipulable set of characteristic traits-- Isaac Brock's throaty, lisping vocals, Eric Judy's rolling, fluid basslines, and the rigid, muscular drumming of Jeremiah Green. 2000's The Moon & Antarctica crafted these traits into an epic studio masterpiece-- an ambitious, affecting, moody album that built upon the band's musical strengths rather than obfuscating them. But in the wake of that record, the band's future seemed dubious. Under the pressure of following their defining LP, the band lost their drummer and regained original guitarist Dan Gallucci, a substantial lineup shift that seemed to constitute a threat to the very core of Modest Mouse's characteristic sound. In the wake of all this uncertainty, it comes as no small relief that Good News for People Who Love Bad News is just the kind of Modest Mouse record we've come to expect from the band. As suggested by the familiar starburst pattern on the CD, now stained a pharmaceutical pink, Good News is less a product of the ambitious experimentation of The Moon & Antarctica than it is the young, violent Modest Mouse on anti-depressants. Opener ""The World at Large"" is classic Modest Mouse in composition-- Isaac Brock singing a melody of thirds over subtle chord changes and clean, delay-soaked electric guitar. But the overall tone of the song is disarmingly anesthetic: The jabbing guitars and insistent drumming of early Modest Mouse are ostensibly absent, replaced with subtle e-bowed guitars and distant ""bop bop bop's."" Certainly, ""The World at Large"" is more resigned in tone and content than any Modest Mouse song to date, but what makes it truly striking is that its resignation never seems fully convincing -- the frantic anxiety of early Modest Mouse still lurks just below the surface. ""The World at Large"" is followed by the first single from Good News, the awe-inspiring ""Float On"". Like The Moon & Antarctica's ""Paper Thin Walls"", this song seems fundamentally different from almost everything Modest Mouse has released to date. In the past, even the band's upbeat songs have essentially been sped-up dirges, due in no small part to former drummer Jeremiah Green's restless, serpentine drum patterns. On ""Float On"", new drummer Benjamin Weikel more than pulls his weight, his simple but inventive playing affording the song an anthemic character never before realized by the band. This anthemic side of ""Float On"" reaches its apex in the song's fist-pumping finale, as numerous voices join in to sing/speak the chorus. Like every other Modest Mouse full-length, Good News remains tremendously strong for its first five or six tracks. ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" is slightly darker than ""Float On"", but remains uncharacteristically upbeat. Here, Weikel's drumming proves particularly indispensable, his tight, regular playing adding extra emphasis to the song's powerful dynamics changes. Lyrically, as with most resignation-themed albums by philosophically minded bands, Good News concerns itself largely with death and the afterlife. At times, Brock's lyrics threaten to approach cliché, but ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" redeems itself with its strong vocal melodies and convincing delivery. ""Bury Me With It"", the record's most blistering, forceful track, is an energetic high point, putting Brock's signature sing-screaming to great use. With ""Dance Hall"", however, Good News begins to slip. Along with ""The Devil's Workday"" and a few others, the song comes across as half-hearted Tom Waits pastiche, overlooking all of the band's strengths and ultimately undermining the album's cohesiveness. It's a shame that so many of the album's darker tracks, which could have provided a poignant emotional counterpart to the more resigned and optimistic tone of the record as a whole, come across as so overdetermined and musically lacking. Fortunately, Good News bounces back fast with the laidback, literate ""Bukowski"". Here, as with ""The World at Large"", Brock steps out of his well-cultivated gas station savant pose to prove that, yes, he can read. Indeed, Good News is a much more lyrically casual and upfront album than any past Modest Mouse record, substituting more conversational and direct observations for Brock's usual wide-eyed, poetic revelations. Similarly, songs like ""Bukowski"" are much more musically unassuming, relying upon simple but well-structured banjo figures and rhythmic vocal patterns. The latter part of Good News is host to some remarkable moments, as well. ""Blame It on the Tetons"" splits the difference between ""Bukowski"" and ""The World at Large"", offering one of the album's most memorable melodies. On ""Black Cadillacs"", Modest Mouse wind up sounding uncannily like The Clash, Brock's chorus of ""we were done, done, done with all the fuck, fuck, fucking around"" echoed by angular stabs of guitar, bass, and drums. Yet, for all its transcendent moments, Good News ultimately fails to hold together all that well as an album. The middle sections of The Moon & Antarctica, often criticized for being aimless and overproduced, worked tremendously well towards reinforcing the desolate, paranoid tone of the record as a whole. Indeed, The Moon & Antarctica was an album where moment-to-moment action was often, and wisely, sacrificed for album-unifying ambience. On Good News, however, the lulls are simply lulls. Still, it's remarkable that, after four long full-lengths, an album's worth of singles, and a couple of EPs, Modest Mouse are still finding ways to invigorate their sound while retaining a sense of definiteness and sincerity. While Good News is neither a unilateral return to the scruffier Modest Mouse of yore, or an even more experimental expansion of The Moon & Antarctica, it is host to more than its share of great-- and, perhaps more importantly, distinctively great-- moments. In spite of a substantial line-up change and the daunting spectre of their previous full-length, Modest Mouse have issued yet another record that uniquely explores what the band does best; being Modest Mouse.","Early in their career, Modest Mouse accomplished what may be the ultimate goal of any band: to forge a...

Domestiques,The Delgados,by: Stephen M.

The band wasn't just promoting the label that their core songwriting duo, Emma Pollock and Alun Woodward, started in the early 90s; they were also giving props to the then-nascent Scottish scene, which included Chemikal signees Arab Strap, Bis, and Mogwai, and which peaked during the latter part of that decade. Of the acts on Chemikal Underground, The Delgados weren't always the most popular or critically acclaimed-- in fact, it wasn't until the turn of the current decade that they rose from the ranks with their Dave Fridmann-produced albums, The Great Eastern and Hate-- but The Delgados were always able to compete with any of the bands they signed and promoted, as handily proved by this reissue of Domestiques, which is not remastered (and doesn't need to be) but includes five bonus tracks, improved artwork, and two videos. It seems odd to compare these early songs to the band's more recent work, as they could belong to another band entirely. Despite the presence of Pollack and Woodward's familiar vocals, the approach and the sound are completely different: Instead of the well-polished cacophony of their last two albums, Domestiques has a much rawer, looser sound, almost punk in the songs' straightforward structures and simple energy. But the album contains the seeds of its successors. Woodward's acoustic meditations on ""One More Question"" and ""Smaller Mammals"" prefigure Peloton, while tracks like ""Strathcona Slung"" and ""Akumulator"" showcase the same kind of singalong, hoist-your-pint choruses the band has since perfected. Like fellow Brits like Mojave 3, The Delgados alternate male and female vocals, occasionally playing them off each other. But it wasn't always this way: Domestiques is undeniably Pollock's album. The songs that prominently feature her vocals, such as ""Big Business in Europe"" and ""Sucrose"", are by far the record's best and most dynamic. Woodward, on the other hand, shows an inclination for meandering structures and half-developed ideas, and the concentration of his songs toward the end of Domestiques makes for a disappointing anticlimax. The five bonus tracks reveal the range of sound and songwriting the band was willing to explore. ""Monica Webster"" and ""Een Telf"" are blistering, bratty punk, while ""Bear Cub"" allows Woodward to indulge his Pavement fixation. An early recording of ""Thirteen Gliding Principles"" makes an interesting contrast to the Dave Fridmann version on The Great Eastern, suggesting The Delgados were at least experimenting with sounds and time signatures as early as 1997, though it still sounds like a demo. Domestiques makes a fine point of origin for the three albums and handful of singles that followed it, but it's more than just a curio for fans: At its best, the album exposes the roots of a scene that produced one generation of bands and influenced another, and showcases a young band trying to claim its own territory in both music and business. Still, its flaws reveal they had a long road ahead of them before they'd finally arrive.","""Tempered; Not Tamed"" off The Delgados' 1997 debut album, Domestiques, begins with a French-language shoutout to Chemikal Underground Records.

HoboSapiens,John Cale,by: Philip Shelley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d113d1975652138dd2/1:1/w_160/abc7ed83.jpg,2004-04-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1227-hobosapiens/,EMI,"HoboSapiens answers the ""whatever happened to"" questions of both dorm room denizens peeling the banana for the first time and John Cale lifers who finally threw in the towel for good with the release of 1996's bloated, overproduced ""pop"" album, Walking on Locusts. Cale's been biding his time, of course, obsessively studying the umbrella-strawed, shaved-ice recordings coming out of the current London dance-music scene, and gearing up for his own grand re-entrance into the 21st Century. Produced by Lemon Jelly's Nick Franglen (Björk, Primal Scream, Pulp), HoboSapiens finds Cale, at 61, back in the major leagues (on EMI) and undeniably re-energized by his newfound musical palette, marrying his down-and-dirgey muse to music that's buzzy, dense and eclectic. On his own website, Cale talks about his recent appreciation for Beck and The Beta Band, and the influence of the latter, presumably, is evident on the sexy, summertime acoustic pop track ""Things"", by far the album's catchiest song. Of course, the lyrics remain as dour and abstruse as ever, but, for better or worse, this time he's not weeping them out alone at the piano. The opening lines of the first song, ""Zen"", a grim manifesto delivered de facto in Cale's ageless and immutable brood, offer a thematic crib sheet for the entire record: ""It's midnight/ And our silver-tongued obsessions come at us out of the dark."" Pretty sonic landscapes whiz by as you cruise through the album: strangely out-of-tune bells, sumptuous string sections, lachrymose violas, impossibly resonant keyboards, treated voices, whole choirs. Odd drum samples and stray bits of post-industrial electronic noise provide the pervasive background radiation which adds an air of doom-and-gloom to even the most airy, melodic songs. About half of it works reasonably well, though the end result is somehow closer to Low-era Bowie or Eno's Taking Tiger Mountain than anything truly contemporary or avant-garde. There really is only one cringe-worthy track, ""Twilight Zone"", which finds Cale yowling and haranguing over ""beats"" so ostentatiously ""trip-hoppy"" that you feel embarrassed to listen, like your dad had wandered drunkenly into your karaoke party and insisted on taking a turn at the mic. (And that's overlooking the dog-tiredness of the song's title conceit.) If your trendometer has jumped into the red, that's not a malfunction. But Cale's perverse and singular worldview, and the effortless authority with which he dispenses his overwhelming musicality, spare him from the worst-case scenarios one may associate with aging rock legends who seek to revitalize their careers by hooking up with younger hotshot producers. The good news is, it still sounds like a John Cale album. But the full-on return-to-form that some critics have been trumpeting is mostly just wishful thinking: they're simply overjoyed to have Cale awake and fully alert again. And if nothing else, it's a step in the right direction. Just for fun, I'll lay down a few dollars that say his next album's the one they've been waiting for.","HoboSapiens answers the ""whatever happened to"" questions of both dorm room denizens peeling the\n\ banana for the first time ...

And that's it. Search though you might, you'll never find a tracklist or any kind of information about the people involved in crafting this record. The music inside this purposefully enigmatic enclosure isn't quite as obtuse as its packaging might suggest.

A bit of research reveals that the packaging convention is actually just the standard for Shinkoyo Records, and that Skeletons are really just one Skeleton: a guy by the name of Matt Mehlan who brings in supporting musicians as necessary, but operates for the most part on his own. Mehlan is obviously interested in the construction of a distinct sound, and he's well on his way to having one, a burbling conglomeration of ambient electronic debris, programmed and live drums, his own multitracked harmonies and a wall of keyboards and guitars. His dark roomsound production gives the record a feel akin to Home Is Where It Hurts-era Hood with less emphasis on the low-end, blending the timbres into each other like watercolors. Mehlan is a sharp melodist, and when he brings his full arsenal to bear on a simple melody, the effect is magnificent. Track 3 sways in on a clipped beat over a bed of ringing keys and piano, and thin lines of hovering guitar. Mehlan's massed harmonies are weirdly smeared here, the background voices rising in the wake of the foreground vocals for a strange seasick effect. (Incidentally, this is the only track given a title on the band's website: ""My Friend Drowned in His Own Vomit"".) His harmonized falsetto refrain of, ""If you gave me the chance I'd like to/ Fuck away your memory/ Fuck away mistakes I've made"" on track 4 is the kind of thing you could have stuck in your head for days, nudged into your memory by chiming keys and brisk programming. The album's unquestionable highlight, though, is track 7. A slow, dark crawl led by violin and viola, the song slinks in on inky cymbals, building to a disorienting verse that ends with Mehlan proclaiming, ""I looked up and saw an angel,"" whereupon the song slips into a bizarre interlude, Mehlan battling to rise above a morass of electronic gurgles. The strings finally force their way back into the picture and the song rides out on fuzz-addled guitar and bass, closing with a meditative guitar ostinato. For its breathtaking peaks, though, Life and the Afterbirth has a few unfortunate holes, most notably tracks 6 and 8, the former being a low, ambient hum and the latter a far too deep forest of fluttering static and bell tones. Still, for his first label release (he has one self-released album, 2002's Everybody Dance with Your Steering Wheel), Mehlan has crafted a unique and largely successful album of art-stained pop.","It's a mysterious package, this album: Just a black envelope with a red profile of a revolver glued to ...

Synthstatic,Skywave,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a662ea9e61561daa5362/1:1/w_160/a970a486.jpeg,2004-04-04 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7748-synthstatic/,Alison,"At least Skywave are honest. One need only take a cursory glance at the Fredericksburg, Virginia-based trio's latest album, Synthstatic, and its hallucinogenic pink and blue artwork, or pull up the band's website at killerrockandroll.com to infer what their music sounds like and where they get their kicks. Like many of the best rock bands around today, Skywave have hardly an original lick in them. But anyone who listens to The Strokes for their inventiveness or risk-taking is missing the point. Synthstatic is indebted to two bands in particular-- My Bloody Valentine and The Jesus & Mary Chain-- and Skywave aren't afraid to filch textbook riffs and techniques from either group. The 14 songs here are shamelessly and often overwhelmingly derivative, and dare you to do something about it. Of course, what Synthstatic lacks in originality it makes up for in songwriting formidability: Paul Baker (guitars), Oliver Ackerman (bass), and John Fedowitz (drums) are equally adroit composers who manage to maintain stylistic consistency throughout this album. Even the harshest, most grating guitars on ""Wear This Dress"" fail to suppress an irrepressible melody that recalls The Wedding Present, and interestingly, owes more to jangle-pop than shoegaze. ""Nothing Left to Say"", Synthstatic's longest track, relaxes upon a quavering repetition of zonked-out, detuned guitars to deliver the album's most touching moment. This atonal dirge, in particular, is indebted to Loveless' grimy ballads, imbued with just enough moments of unmitigated beauty to sustain its six downtempo minutes. Opening track ""Tsunami"", meanwhile, lives up to its title with monstrous walls of washed-out guitars and driving, machine-like drums. Duly impressive is the shear magnitude of Skywave's sound. At live shows, the band is known for soundchecking at half-volume, then cranking it all the way up at curtain time for an unsuspecting soundman. Bassist Oliver Ackerman designs his own effects pedals, including the Supersonic Fuzz Gun and a series called Total Sonic Annihilations, which Skywave employ to help achieve their massive sound. His clientele includes Keith Fullerton Whitman, who used FX-pedal-augmented, laptop-produced guitar tones to construct 2002's beautiful Playthroughs. Synthstatic is similarly experimental in its delicate treatment of extreme noise, and its oscillating high-volume dynamics more than live up to the band's promising URL. The record even sounds potent on laptop speakers. If only for its formalism is it impossible to call Synthstatic a great album. Bands following similar formulas in different genres might be pilloried, and Skywave will doubtless endure their own share of derision. But some forms of rock, given an occasional tightening of the bolts, never seem to grow stale. Had it been released 15 years ago, a work of this songwriting caliber would likely have been wildly acclaimed. As it is, Synthstatic lacks any shred of originality, but is probably the best of all possible end-results from a monument built completely out of scrap material, a shoegazing ""Junkyard Workshop"" that, like any successful tribute, enforces the significance of its forebears while managing to hold its own ground.","At least Skywave are honest.

Final Straw,Snow Patrol,by: Stephen M.

""Grazed Knees"" contains the banal couplet, ""Your breakfast will get cold/ I really have to go."" And ""Spitting Games"" veers dangerously close to high school poetry: ""My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes/ As blue as oceans and as pure as skies."" But taken together, these not-too-quotable lines add up to a surprising whole: an album as argument, wherein Lightbody pleads with lovers to consider his side of the story (""How to Be Dead""), or to give him another chance (""Grazed Knees""), or simply to notice him (""Spitting Games""). Rather than dwelling the dissolved romances of his past, Lightbody dwells in the here-and-now, speaking not to his audience but to his lovers, and candidly reveals a centrifuge of conflicting emotions and awkward confessions. Writing in plainspoken lyrics that sound like the kind of speech you rehearse in your head for days, Lightbody has carved himself a niche among confessional singer/songwriters by documenting the gradual accumulation of grievances and recriminations that creates a rift between two people who ostensibly love each other. The problems he describes usually aren't as tangible or as black-and-white as, say, cheating, but Lightbody still manages to make these small predicaments dramatic and compelling. If the lyrics carry the feelings, then the music itself is restrained: tastefully plaintive vocals and churning guitars generate rigid, unwavering tempos that approximate dance music. It's a more sophisticated sound than that of the band's previous albums, or of Lightbody's side project, The Reindeer Section. In addition to adding guitarist Nathan Connolly, Snow Patrol have brought in producer Garret ""Jacknife"" Lee (formerly of the band Compulsion), who gathers elements from the Pixies and My Bloody Valentine, as well as from more obvious sources like Radiohead, into a straightforward, polished sound that works well for the first half of Final Straw. The pristine quality of Snow Patrol's music and Garret Lee's production, however, belies the rawness of Lightbody's words, and too often, the songs suffer from the contrast. It's not that there aren't bursts of noisy feedback or filtered vocals or the occasional programmed beats; it's that each one sounds perfectly placed, too tidy, so overthought and foreordained that the songs sound staid and stolid. This is especially noticeable in the middle of Final Straw, when Snow Patrol indulge in some Coldplay moments. ""Run"" exists solely for its uplifting, if oddly fatalistic, chorus (""Light up, light up/ As if you have a choice""), which will surely have concertgoers raising their lighters during the inevitable second-encore singalong. Actually, the song is unapologetically anthemic, until Lee throws in some schmaltzy strings at the climax that practically cry out to score the big smooch in some teen-friendly romantic comedy. Deploying more upbeat tempos and pop harmonies, ""Ways and Means"" and ""Tiny Little Fractures"" try to regain the momentum of the album's first half. But ""Somewhere a Clock Is Ticking"" crawls along at a slow pace, its gloomy atmosphere not quite enough to sustain it, and ""Same"" attempts a grand finale that only sounds redundant after ""Run"". As such, despite the surprising cohesion of its modest lyrics, Final Straw remains less than the sum of its parts.","Taken line by line, Gary Lightbody's lyrics on Snow Patrol's third album, Final Straw, don't say\n ...

Forcefields and Constellations,Black Forest/Black Sea,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a434c0084474cd0c0439/1:1/w_160/4fd09591.jpg,2004-04-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1082-forcefields-and-constellations/,BlueSanct,"Kathy Acker wrote, ""At night in every city I live in I walk down the streets to look for something that will mean something to me."" At times, you can locate an inevitability by staying in one spot. To aid in the quest, Black Forest/Black Sea are making music for the roof and fire escape, helping you detail your view of the neighbor's tacky kitchen and your own obstructed portion of any already obstructed sky. Forcefields and Constellations, the Rhode Island duo's second dose of interstellar gazing, sets adrift with the dreamy ""Orion"", a milky moon-drop instrumental featuring the guitarwork of guest performer Christina Carter (Charalambides). Here, Carter's guitar lobs tremolo darts at the nighttime, too busy to notice the melancholic swarm of voices that flit around her. Despite lasting under four minutes, the song creates an air of languid eternity. This protracted time/space collusion is a constant on Jeffrey Alexander and Miriam Goldberg's follow-up to last year's eponymous (and now out-of-print) debut as Black Forest/Black Sea, and by patiently dismantling the chamber-folk that made that record such a treat, they've initiated a whirlybird gale that blows compositional constraints wide open. Chilly abstraction is an assured move for a sophomore record, but Alexander and Goldberg are seasoned psych-folk players: Alongside lyricist and multi-instrumentalist Carin Wagner, Alexander comprised the slowcore renaissance duo The Iditarod. Goldberg, though not a core member of that band, toured with them, and contributed cello, piano, and guitar to a number of their studio recordings. Packing this pedigree and collaborative dynamic into 13 tracks, Forcefields and Constellations creates a steely, diaphanous and fragile mass of delicate and complex instrumentation. Using voice sparingly, the focus falls on improvisation (or at least, something that sounds like improvisation). The duo also employs guest musicians-- including the aforementioned, freaked-out guitarwork of Christina Carter, and bouzouki from Jewelled Antler impresario Glenn Donaldson-- and samples the work of drone artists Fürsaxa, as well as Black Forest/Black Sea's own past performances, which turns this album into something of a large-scale, open-door collaboration. As with most successful recordings in this genre, it might seem dodgy to remove individual tracks from their context within the album-- after all, the shifts in gradation are half the fun-- but here, it makes sense, because a few numbers do stand out. ""...with a dead man I've never met"" is, like the album's opener, a heady instrumental featuring modulated cello and plucked banjo. But where ""Orion"" coasts on a gentle wave, this track takes a darker turn halfway through, becoming a churning noise squall (though it does retain the banjo's soft undertow). ""These Things"" follows a less dramatic pace: Goldberg's wonderfully raw and ethereal voice-- backed by tone delays, ringing chimes, and buzzing flourishes-- creates a lo-fi, 4AD-esque transition into the reverberations of ""Kyy Plays Perpetual Change"", which swings along a snippet of Finnish psych-rocker Kemialliset Ystävät's song, ""Lammikko"", evoking a dewy forest populated by tiny glitches and sine waves. Violin, staccato cello, a malfunctioning player piano, and distorted bells drive ""Hung Far Lowish"", with strings keeping pace beneath. It ends with a drizzle of moody machines, a lone green kite amid the subtle deterioration of weather. Per psych's prescription, Forcefields and Constellations signs off with an even lengthier freakout, ""Jamestown"", which serves as a slow-built run-through of the band's strengths: Here, notes climb and shake and sustain themselves admirably, and Carter returns to add layers to the song's drift. Discordant air pockets and dyadic tone rings appear on occasion, but throughout its nine-minute run, the piece never commits to any one direction, ultimately flitting away as unprocessed as it arrived. Black Forest/Black Sea take their time telling a story, and they avoid definitive conclusions; rather, this album's strengths lie in its fragmented, molasses trajectory and overall expansiveness. But there's much more here for patient listeners-- those who allow the connections to emerge or build tiny bridges themselves. If you're into song-based atmospherics and fractured folk, Forcefields and Constellations should prove a gratifying jigsaw. Just sit still a while.","Kathy Acker wrote, ""At night in every city I live in I walk down the streets to look for something ...

Grown Backwards,David Byrne,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4209d034d5c69bf2fb6/1:1/w_160/1fd0238b.jpg,2004-04-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1063-grown-backwards/,Nonesuch,"Though rock has been pronounced dead countless times, it's still a reasonably young artform. Virgin territory is still being forged, as the public continues to observe how artists develop as they wrinkle, grey, and atrophy in popularity. The notion of respectable longevity has mostly been bulldozed with Wings and Steel Wheels, but its main culprits have been cocaine, cash, and circuitry, not backaches and orthopedic pillows. The notion of septuagenarian rockers wets the lips of Leno's writers, but blues musicians-- the Tigris and Euphrates river valley to Mick Jagger's Royal Dutch Shell-- can play to their death, thanks to the genre's acceptance of the stool. The Buena Vista Social Club are older than Arizona, yet their records uniformly win critical raves and record sales. Really, there's no justifiable reason to write off musicians who blow out over 40 candles a year. Music is an artform, right? Painters, writers, architects, driftwood sculptors, and dog groomers can all produce masterworks in late age, so why not rock musicians? Again, the format has not existed long enough to develop patterns and cycles demonstrative of artists' complete lifetimes. But there has been new hope of late. David Bowie, The Stooges, Robert Plant, Joe Strummer, Wire, Kraftwerk, and The Zombies all contributed vital releases to their discography in the last few years. Naturally, as one ages, the appeal of music written about aging by aging artists becomes vastly more appealing. Even flawed recordings and miscalculated experimentation can charm, as they mirror our own missteps and ability to laugh at our own mistakes. Grown Backwards, as the title suggests, skips whistling into maturity, and employs this concept as its thematic core. Here, endearing for his joyous, occasionally wrong-footed style-hopping, David Byrne gleefully releases himself to fate, both critical and existential, like a man who's breathed in the dust of ceiling tile, cinder, faxes, and bone. He even wears Oshkosh overalls on the back. (Perhaps. They could be Miu Miu.) If you hold the cover of Grown Backwards before your face at the precise angle, twisting your head to the right slightly, the mirrored finish of its packaging superimposes your visage over David Byrne's remarkably unchanged face. Put the CD down and your fingerprints blemish the gloss with human grease. Intended or not, the album physically reflects and inserts the listener. With its themes centered on the amusing and tragic nuances of seemingly mundane human behavior, Byrne has crafted a personal album for all, confronting us with our greatest fears and flaws-- mainly mortality. The album's sequencing even parallels a lifecycle: The opening is exciting, naively romantic, and carefree. Like adolescence, tracks four through seven strive awkwardly to follow trends and fit in. Regal trumpet blasts herald a diatribe on American imperialism on the unfittingly political ""Empire"". And finally, ""The Other Side of Life"" arrives at adulthood, with arms wide before a Broadway melody. With signature wide-eyed sincerity, Byrne sings, ""I don't have any more problems/ All of my worries are gone/ Beautiful angels appear at my side/ And corporate sponsors will act as my guide,"" dispensing of any sarcasm these lyrics might imply. ""Glad"" revels in a laundry list of flaws: ""I'm glad I got lost/ I'm glad I'm confused/ I'm glad when the sex is not that great/ I'm glad I know how my life will end/ I'm glad I'm a mess,"" again, with ambiguously sincere delivery. Whether Byrne is mocking the shortcomings of the average man or rejoicing in his own averageness is unclear, but either way, it works. As the dream journal-like interior package design suggests, Grown Backwards floats in a metropolitan ether, hitting the ears like sensory blasts encountered while walking Manhattan at daybreak. The style shifts seem intentionally influenced by random urban experience, not wanton experimentalism. Opera, hip-hop, the funk of ""Dialog Box"", the Pacific island breeziness of ""Astronaut"", the French café gestures of ""Civilization"", and club grooves come and go like scents, smells, and sights on a cosmopolitan excursion. The album's clean, organic production-- much like the roomy environments recorded by Nick Gold for Byrne's new labelmates Buena Vista and Orchestra Baobab-- help to make possibly jarring style shifts seamless and timeless. Like the Neverland of J.M. Barrie, alluded to on ""Pirates"", Grown Backwards sounds like a subconscious composite of Byrne's loves, fears, influences, and fantasies. Demonstrative of the breadth and strength of Byrne's compositions, the album's two masterful high-points, ""Au Fond du Temple Saint"" and ""Lazy"", sit on polar opposites. The former, a rendition of Bizet's lusciously melodic duet from The Pearl Fishers, is covered with aplomb alongside Rufus Wainwright, and devastates with juicy beauty. Bizet, who wrote the piece at 24, tells the story of two men who turn their back on a promise from youth with typically sacrificial results, and Byrne fits the brick into his album's Legowork with sophistication. He sings opera, a music now typically reserved for silver aristocrats who subscribe to Smithsonian, but chooses an immortal ode to youth struck dumb by Brahmin beauty, written by an inexperienced composer. While invigorating a dying music with modern zeal, his limitations as a Comique tenor matter little. ""Lazy"", on the other hand, reworks a dance collaboration with X-Press 2 with awesomely melodramatic strings from the Tosca ensemble, who color the entire album with playful accents, and electric guitar and keyboard from Byrne, which absolutely shames whatever New York newcomers who attempt such styles. It's Morodor disco and CBGB punk, not some cheap hybrid. The song's self-deprecating lyrics, in hindsight, sound like the thematic font for this entire project. Though David Byrne may sing the part of Bizet's Nadir, this album is anything but. It fits alongside the best of his career and adds another solid release to a solo catalog which will hopefully become more cherished in time. In 20 years, as we straighten our faces with botulism, braces, and stem cells, the album will stand up. ""On my high school folder/ I drew a big gorilla/ Something familiar yet something far, far away,"" Byrne sings. With that last phrase, he could mean the gorilla or youth. As Grown Backwards proves, records need not rely on either for thrills.","Though rock has been pronounced dead countless times, it's still a reasonably young artform. Virgin\n\ territory is still ...

Over the Sun,Shannon Wright,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa779d034d5c69bf3e55/1:1/w_160/997bcb3f.jpg,2004-04-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8745-over-the-sun/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"As contradictory as their respective subcultures might seem, punk rock and folk music share an awful lot of common ground. It might be unbearably weird to imagine lanky, bearded tea-drinkers communing with pogo-ready mohawkers, but both sonic traditions wholeheartedly embrace DIY, music-for-the-folks ideology. Both arm themselves with mailing lists, grassroots promotions, and homemade CDs. Both hock silk-screened, handcrafted wares from heavily stickered cardboard boxes. And both fight hard (usually with bumper stickers) for political, cultural, and social acceptance. Somehow, sadcore heroine Shannon Wright has managed, over the course of five solo records, to confidently plant one foot in each of these genres, skipping from muted, earnest troubadour to raucous, pissed-off squealer. Yet, rather than sounding like a neo-DiFranco, Wright ends up forging her own self-expressive format, churning out sparse, plucky bits of dissonant guitar rock. Over the Sun, Wright's fifth effort since splitting from indie-poppers Crowsdell, is a sprawling collage of distraught lyrics, buzzing guitar, mellotron echo, and Wright's incomparable wheeze. With a voice that seems lodged in perpetual despair, Wright whisper-yowls her way through nine tortured tracks, and each of her tiny exhalations seems borne of some kind of gruesome emotional or physical ailment, strained, fiery, and sometimes oddly quiet. Opener ""With Closed Eyes"" starts with fuzzy mellotron, before promptly descending into a spare guitar-and-drums assault. Wright chants her poetry heroically, spitting declarations in perfect time. While Wright's songwriting is well-honed, it's almost impossible to move past her wounded vocals and into the meat of her compositions; highlight ""You'll Be the Death"", despite its ""wretch like me"" admissions, comes closest to showcasing Wright's other skills, with a distant drumbeat and some gentle guitar picking backing up a haunting, spectral vocal melody. ""Plea"" serves to solidify Wright's moody introspection, as disjointed piano bits pop up uneasily between dim proclamations (""No say in this/ No say in this/ Why must we try?""). The only problem is that Over the Sun is a remarkably pained record, and its built-in malcontent taxes listeners, shamelessly demanding our empathy, attention, and stamina, tugging on our arms, filling up our living rooms, leaving a trail of desperate, coughing voicemails. It's not that Wright's dissatisfaction isn't compelling or convincing, but that her unhappiness is impossibly unrelenting: Blood spurts from every clenched gasp and vacant guitar strike, tears tumble out of lonesome drum beats and stray piano notes. What the record lacks is a logical sense of perspective: Wright's pain is a straight line, unwavering and stoic, with no peaks, recessions, or hops. Consequently, listening becomes an exercise in endurance, a long, extended attempt to justify Wright's untempered sonic frustration. While Wright's songwriting is admirable, the tonality of Over the Sun is entirely unbearable: Check 3,000 shades of black, with absolutely no sun in sight.","As contradictory as their respective subcultures might seem, punk rock and folk music share an awful lot of common ground ...

99 Cents,Chicks on Speed,by: Dan Lett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b513d1975652139007/1:1/w_160/e755beb9.jpg,2004-03-31 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1442-99-cents/,Chicks on Speed,"After its 2000 release, I quickly and knee-jerkingly dismissed Chicks on Speed Will Save Us All as cheap pop until a more enlightened friend of mine pointed out that they were supposed to sound like that. Since then, Chicks on Speed have continued to produce clever, knowingly trashy anti-pop that coaxes nonchalant head nods from irony imbibers. The ex-art school collective has fed fashion, feminism and photo-ops through the lowest of lo-fi fuzzboxes, kindergarten two-step beats, and tape recorder-quality disco-- all in the guise of an arch riposte to modern pop culture. Three years later, 99 Cents-- the third full-length from the Berlin-based trio of American Melissa Logan, German Kiki Moorse, and Australian Alex Murray-Leslie-- indicates that my original synopsis is as inaccurate as ever, albeit for significantly different reasons. 99 Cents still sees Chicks on Speed in the familiarly playful, reveling-in-the-throwaway mood that has characterized their career, but replaces the cheap sounds of their earlier records with more traditional sonics, which leave the often-clever lyrics feeling like an afterthought. The Chicks' inevitable collaboration with Peaches (the standout track ""We Don't Play Guitars"") is a gutsy, rambunctious melee that puts mantra before message. An impressive reproduction of the Tom Tom Club's ""Wordy Rappinghood"" continues the girls' tradition of fantastic covers, seamlessly pairing solid, dance-friendly programming with live playing and featuring both eccentric vocals and slick synth work. The stuttering R&B; of ""Coventry"" seems unintentionally candid, considering that genre's recent shift toward self-reference and pastiche (see: ""Slow Jamz"", for one). ""Sell-Out"", however, seems a bit obvious, and not a little lazy, especially compared to the sexier, more adventurous ""Shick Shaving"", which showcases chants from the sublime Miss Kittin, and sounds like The Postal Service with decaying optimism and too many drinks. Based in Germany, Chicks on Speed have always shared a cynicism toward capitalism and commodification-- best revealed here by the blunt ""Universal Pussy""-- with their erstwhile compatriots from the Frankfurt School of cultural criticism. Imagine Adorno in a plastic mini-skirt and smeared lipstick and you have some idea of their since-derailed mission statement. Perhaps Chicks on Speed think it's clever or post-whatever to embrace a more contemporary production ethos or swap counter culture for something much closer to over-the-counter culture, but you can't pull off sounding bored and indifferent when you're clearly working this hard. If this album is an easily digestible Trojan horse to carry their cynicism into the unsuspecting mainstream, Chicks on Speed are in danger of letting their spunky satire devolve into mere chirpy sarcasm.","After its 2000 release, I quickly and knee-jerkingly dismissed Chicks on Speed Will Save Us All as cheap pop until ...

If We Can't Trust the Doctors,Blanche,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44d5e6ef9596932083d/1:1/w_160/5b879f50.jpg,2004-03-31 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1103-if-we-cant-trust-the-doctors/,Vinyl Junkie,"It's a record for drama queens. Though his songs may have swapped bleeding hearts for bloodied corpses, indiscretion for mortal sin, and lovesickness for whatever fatal disease is doing the rounds, Dan John Miller uses such moments of misery as metaphors for his own state of mind. From the lurching paranoia of ""Superstition"" to the smashed-glass attack on vanity in ""Garbage Picker"", the amount of melodrama and woe-is-me fatalism displayed through the lyrics paints the image of a man out of place; unable to bear with the brutal pace of modern life. Of course, this could all just be tailored to fit the band's sound. Sharing the same ground as fellow mudslingers Giant Sand, The Handsome Family and Violent Femmes, the debut album by Detroit doomsayers Blanche trains the weeping slide guitars, brash banjo and twanged Appalachian melodies of trad-country into yet another imitation of the much-abused ""Southern Gothic"" sound. But while it's an admirable attempt at capturing the threadbare line between contentment and catastrophe, these twelve barbed fits of fear and hate don't quite hit the mark. Perhaps the problem lies in the band's adherence to such a tired formula. On the mid-pace duet ""Do You Trust Me?,"" the same three-chord strum, swinging-pendulum bassline and straight-laced, derivative melody fail to make Blanche any more distinctive than the raft of alt. acts that thieve the traditions and folklore of Americana to give their sound some kind of perceived ""edge."" It doesn't help that the song's moral of jealousy and trust revolves around a tiresome indecision that's punctuated by Miller's rampant paranoia. The production, tackled mostly by His Name Is Alive's Warren Defever, also sounds largely unimpressive. In his recordings, Defever concentrates on capturing Miller's voice at its most possessed; ignoring an underlying tenderness in his affected southern drawl. At the same time, he leaves the guitars sounding thrashed, brittle and smothered in sandpaper. When Brendan Benson and David Feeny take the reigns on ""Who's to Say"" and ""So Long Cruel World"", the band's sound is subtler, allowing each instrument the breathing space to make its contribution, rather than relying on coarse production. Their work also makes the most of Miller's voice, as it teeters from deranged and demon-like on ""Cruel World"", to handsome and sincere on the likes of ""Bluebird"". There are other moments to admire in this record. The closing ""Someday"" is split into two sketches of roughly recorded bluegrass; one a fevered, flushed strum of strained vocals, and the latter a transistor-radio lullaby filtered through an effects device to sound like a lost 50s country record. A point where Warn Defever's production does succeed is on the jumble of lumbered rhythm and squealing slide guitar of ""Jack on Fire"", as Tracee Miller's promise to ""fuck you until you die, bury you in kisses"" tramples the line between romance and masochism to chilling effect. While Blanche are not yet at the stage where they can craft a challenging and consistent record, their mastery of the country music form, their emotional complexity and their lyrical intelligence are all signposts to suggest that it's within them. All they need to do is become less tied down to conventions, strip back on the drama, and refocus their themes on something that's more real. After all, that's where the true drama lies.","It's a record for drama queens. Though his songs may have swapped bleeding hearts for bloodied corpses, indiscretion for ...

This scrawny kid was stumbling around the place by himself, preaching to the choir about the dark genius of Foetus mastermind Jim Thirlwell. He went on about how Thirlwell's piercing, syncopated beats, primitive tape loops and misanthropic persona laid the foundation for industrial music and were the spare parts Trent Reznor used to build his pretty hate machine. While listening to Maryland Mansions (the title is a nod to both a certain NIN protege and Kidwell's home state), I realized that this wide-eyed fanboy could have been Rjyan Kidwell, aka Cex. Okay, so it probably wasn't him, but the slow, pounding rhythm and paranoid rant on Maryland Mansions' ""Kill Me"" sounds as if it could be either a remix of a mid-80s Foetus epic or a Nine Inch Nails outtake. On this track, Kidwell has Thirlwell's brutal white-boy snarl down pat, spitting: ""I want you to find me, but I don't want you to touch me/ It seems so disgusting to be handled like a doll."" Nothing throughout Cex's prolific recording career hinted at the bleak, nihilistic tone of the eight-track, 25-minute Maryland Mansions, a self-assured and, yes, mature work from a guy who sounds as if he's sick of being dismissed as a snotty kid with musical ADD. Cex released Role Model at the age of 19, and it promptly established him as a force in the IDM world even as he simultaneously railed against that sound's constraints and sneered at its scenesters. Cex then tweaked the electro-pop idiom with 2001's Oops, I Did It Again!, and he paid tribute to old-school hip-hop with Tall, Dark & Handcuffed the following year. As a result, critics and fans would be forgiven for not knowing what to make of this skinny, charismatic man-child given to getting naked on stage. I always pegged him somewhere between Kid606 and Paul Barman-- a mix of electro-freak and hyper-aware mugging MC. Maryland Mansions offers an unnerving picture of Kidwell as a friendless loner-- one who's most comfortable in his bedroom studio with his headphones blocking out the world. On ""My Head"", over a slow beat and hypnotic strings, he comes to grips with the fact that the only thing that can save him from a life of stifling banality is music. But because he's not confident in his talents, it's a confession that gives him little comfort and only serves to reveal his insecurity and hopefulness. By the end of the song, he makes it clear that he wants to save himself through music and, in the process, save music itself. Lofty goals from a guy who two years ago was writing tracks like ""Destination: Sexy"". And what if he wasn't a musician? What would Rjyan Kidwell do if he allowed himself to be sucked into the suffocating straight life? Cex answers that question on ""The Strong Suit"", a straight-up hip-hop track on which he imagines himself eking out a living as a traveling salesman: Call him MC Willie Loman. ""The Strong Suit"" is both funny and brooding, and its his head-spinning lyrics would make Rakim smile. Especially rewarding is the bit where Cex fantasizes about breaking out of the nine-to-five grind by ""leaving my cells in your sisters and daughters/ Trying to escape, disguised as my own kid."" That kind of playful wordsmithery also enlivens ""Stillnaut Rjyan"", on which Cex applies some over-the-top N.E.R.D.-style production elements to screeching beats and a rapid-fire call-and-response chorus. The track is a weird, intergalactic fantasy about an extraterrestrial mission gone awry, like Kool Keith covering ""Space Oddity"". So perhaps it's about time that we stop calling Cex a wunderkind: He may be barely 25 but with the introspective yet exuberant Maryland Mansions, he's officially grown up, establishing himself as a performer to be taken-- yikes!-- seriously.","At a Foetus show a few years ago, my friends and I became trapped in a conversation with an overeager ...

VCR EP,VCR,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a996b1335d7bf16994f7/1:1/w_160/5054b2fb.gif,2004-03-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8527-vcr-ep/,Popfaction,"I remember the day my family got its first VCR, in 1984. My parents left my brother and me at my grandparents' house while they went out to revolutionize our home with the purchase of not just the VCR, but also a microwave (both appliances, incidentally, are still in service). I remember my dad programming the clock and then taping an episode of Masterpiece Theater so he could watch it later, even though we were home when it aired. Despite its shortcomings-- lousy tracking was always a problem-- the VCR really did change things for us, and I still have tapes that we made in the waning days of Reaganomics, including an entirely uncensored version of Animal House that we apparently taped off of network television in the middle of the night. Don't tell Michael Powell. If the VCR brings back fond memories of the 80s, then VCR, a quintet from Richmond, Virginia, might reasonably be expected to do the same. The font on their debut EP's cover seems to imply that they will, but this turns out not to be the case. There are plenty of people who'll try to lump this disc in with the recent 80s revivalist wave on account of the bandname, the artwork and the synthesizers, and I suppose it's of a piece with the post-post-punk that's dominated the five boroughs and year-end lists lately, but it frankly doesn't sound at all like that decade. The buzz of the synths hints at it, but there's at least as much Dischord abrasion and punk gallop in this stuff as there is Human League dancefloor pyrotechnics. Despite the ragged edges they display, though, VCR are first and foremost a party band, and in case you couldn't figure it out from the hip-pumping rhythms and triple keyboard assault of the first five tracks, they spell it out for you on closer ""We Are VCR"", easily the record's weakest track. The song is decently catchy and marginally ass-shaking, but it's hard to hear the rallying call as they shout their association with an obsolete home entertainment appliance. They also claim to be the future of dance music, but as far as I can tell, they're simply the right-now of dance music, caught on what seems to be the ebbing end of indiedom's fling with dancefloor sweat. Still, this doesn't negate the fact that the other five tracks are immense fun. Opener ""Rad"" spills over with saw-toothed keyboard hooks, and the rhythms are potent enough to get a few people out of their chairs. Vocalist/keyboardist Christian Newby's slurred bark (think halfway between Isaac Brock and J. Robbins) isn't an optimal melodic vehicle, but he manages well, often ceding the hooks to the keys or backing vocalist/keyboardist Mya Anitai. They share the lead on the EP's best track, ""King and Queen of Winter"", a song that charges in hard with smacking drums and scattershot vocals, only to pull back for the band's most strongly melodic vocal parts, gradually letting the rhythm creep back in and bringing the song back around to a full-on thump, where it remains. ""Bratcore"" mashes up Polysics keyboard histrionics and Faint gloom-and-doom with aplomb, whipping up a great dance number. VCR may not be dance-rock's greatest hope, as they claim to be, but they've constructed some tight songs for their debut EP, and as it blows by in 18 minutes, it's surefire ear candy. At the very least, they live up to their name by warranting multiple playbacks, and for music that revels in passing frivolity, that's something.","I remember the day my family got its first VCR, in 1984.

Venice,Fennesz,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7c13d197565213b55a/1:1/w_160/25777f0a.jpg,2004-03-31 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3036-venice/,Touch,"In an interview with The Wire last year, Kid606 let slip that, like many electronic producers in his sphere, he could create an album in one night. He asserts that the software has gotten so good that making tracks is just that easy: Talent is kinda nice-- and probably adds something to the equation-- but it's not really required. There's no question that the perceptible dip in interest in experimental electronic music in recent years has something to do with the fact that there are so many labels, artists, and, above all, records that don't sound different enough from one another to warrant special attention. But then there's Christian Fennesz. When it comes to recording under his own name, Fennesz works slowly: Venice is only his fourth full-length studio album in seven years, and his first since 2001's groundbreaking Endless Summer, which altered the perception of experimental electronic music with pop leanings. Fennesz has remained busy by remixing, collaborating, touring (both on his own and with FennO'Berg), and re-releasing his back catalog, but-- considering Kid606's admission-- three years is a long time between albums for an artist such as Fennesz. With every album, Fennesz's music has become prettier and more accessible yet still retains his distinctive style-- and Venice is no exception. That's fortunate for the uninitiated because as Fennesz's reputation has grown, each new offering has served as the perfect introduction to his work. ""Rivers of Sand"" opens Venice with deep bass pedals working against pinched swoons of feedback. It's completely electronic, but this piece would also sound fantastic in an arrangement for strings. ""Château Rouge"" is in the vein of the bent instrumental pop of Endless Summer, with what sounds like an organ melody (simple, just a few notes) beset by synth gurgles and pinstripe bands of white noise. Its ""middle-eight"" is vertical howls of machine noise, but its purpose is the same as the bridge of any pop song-- to offer a variation on the themes presented earlier. ""The Other Face"" also feels as if Fennesz were taking some of the ideas from Endless Summer and pushing them in a different direction, here adding ethereal vocal samples to the buzzing mix. The short track ""Onsra"" serves as an intro to Venice's centerpiece, ""Circassian"", which was written and performed with fellow avant guitarist Burkhard Stangl (who has previously worked with Fennesz as a member of Polwechsel). When people talk about Fennesz's Kevin Shields fixation they're thinking of tracks like this. ""Circassian"" drowns in loud, slightly out-of-tune power chords, each of which leads a long and happy life after the initial strum. The string reverberations multiply and mutate endlessly, making it possible to imagine cathedrals, a jet airplane passing through billowy clouds at 500mph, or the volatile racket of a tropical storm. Markus Schmickler gave it a shot, but no one does neo-shoegaze laprock as well as Fennesz. On Venice, Fennesz also continues to dabble with pop. Last year, he collaborated with David Sylvian on the former Japan singer's Blemish, and that partnership continues here with ""Transit"". When a record contains only a single vocal track, the tendency is to place too much focus on it. That anomalous track always seems destined to summarize or ""explain"" the record somehow, yet the particular concerns voiced by Sylvian on ""Transit"" don't blend easily with its abstract aesthetic joys. Still, as a song, it works well and would have made a nice non-album single. Fennesz has demonstrated a sympathetic yet adventurous ear when supporting vocalists. On ""Transit"", a low organ sound anchors the tune but all sorts of strange explosions do the real work, simultaneously marking the changes and shifts in the song and reinforcing its structure. Fennesz flirts with a different kind of conventionality with ""Laguna"", a guitar duet with Stangl with a serious Morricone vibe. Venice's quality extends beyond its sound. Touch proprietor Jon Wozencroft-- through his breathtaking design and photography-- continues to fight the good fight against records-as-pure-data by making the CD a value-added prospect. More importantly, the music is of a high standard. One thing that is made clear by Venice is that Fennesz is a composer who spends as much or more time crafting melodies and chords as he does searching for the perfect texture. He works regularly with improvisers, but his records under his own name could not be more orderly, with discrete sections carefully structured to maximize their emotional impact. (The symphonic nature of last year's Live in Japan is strongly present here.) Thanks in part to that emotional heft, I have a feeling that long after many of the experimental electronic records from the past ten years disappear, we'll continue to reach for the works of Fennesz.","In an interview with The Wire last year, Kid606 let slip that, like many electronic producers in\n\ his sphere ...

Ballroom,Trapist,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a878ea9e61561daa581c/1:1/w_160/15d5c359.jpg,2004-03-30 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8256-ballroom/,Thrill Jockey,"People seem to think that for all the surplus and prosperity of the 21st century, time is a fair trade off. Hence, utilitarian inventions like the cellphone, which has turned walking, or riding peacefully aboard a train, into a productive activity. Space followed a similar injunction when we decided to industrialize two centuries ago. Now any so-called wasting of either commodity is considered a sin among those who seek to be ""winners"" in this world. Well, pardon me if this isn't exactly the most trenchant observation, but, what is it all for? Of all our needs and desires that seem to manifest in material goods, I believe what we really want, above all else, is our time and our space back. Vienna-based trio Trapist share my feelings. On their second full-length, Ballroom, the band make the musical assertion that it's impossible to waste time or space, unless, perhaps, you overstuff it with useless filler. Though the group composes primarily through improvisation, both electronic and acoustic, every note on Ballroom feels spectacularly preordained, as if under the mystical spell of a world as it should be. Unfortunately, that world is all too foreign to even the most pedantically existential of us, and it may take a complete sacrifice of one's school- or job-mandated priorities to gain an appreciation for this record. But the reward is more than just musical; what Trapist have created here is more of philosophical dissertation as spoken through the ineffable poetry of music. And their thesis, if not entirely original, is brilliantly put. Trapist are sure to draw comparisons to composers like Morton Feldman and latter-day improv acts like The Necks, whose work attempts to propel the inherently static by transcending the time constraints of conventional music. Pieces like Feldman's For Samuel Beckett fixate on subtly repeating constructs and protract them to Zen-noise-like levels. Ballroom doesn't experiment with time so much as make exquisite use of it as an artistic element. While some of Feldman's pieces would make Trapist seem like verifiable A.D.D. cases, what this band does with modern forms of music is selfsame in spirit as Feldman's exploration of classical composition. But while the group have their loyalties, the fragments of acoustic guitar that scatter the opening section of ""Time Axis Manipulation, Pt. 1"" (no coincidence there) make it abundantly clear that Trapist are capable of radiant beauty. That avowal is supported by the gradual introduction of a gently undulating organic drone, which underscores the sparse instrumental setting and forms the melodic crux of the song. The result is something akin to Keith Fullerton Whitman with a backing band. Furthermore, the synth melody that emerges at the two-minute mark of ""Time Axis Manipulation, Pt. 2""-- Ballroom's most confrontational moment to this point-- is blissfully sophisticated. The ensuing 90 seconds feel too sublime to endure the remaining five minutes, and they don't: The song gradually devolves into a crackling abyss of feedback reminiscent of Fennesz's Endless Summer or Sonic Youth's renascent noise saga, ""Karen Revisited"". On ""Observations Took Place"", the group's penchant for beauty returns, in infinitely more staggering form, as deliquescent synths build atop a looming bass-and-drums vamp, before meeting to form a dazzling sustained chord that carries the song out. Equally essential to the makeup of Ballroom is the improvised playing of bassist Joe Williamson, guitarist Martin Stiewart, and drummer Martin Brandlmayr. Brandlmayr, in particular, has an exceptional ability of evincing complex soundscapes from his kit. With the augment of minimal electronics, his parts sound like multi-musician efforts, and provide a lush rhythmic bedding on which Williamson and Stiewart gladly trample. Similarly, Williamson's bass parts are mysterious and lulling, adding additional melodic depth to Trapist's formidable electronic palette. Like the best music, Ballroom is satisfying both intellectually and aesthetically, and while the record errs a bit more on the side of the former, its best moments are among the most gorgeous found in any genre. If you aren't up for a potential overhaul of your philosophical worldview, chances are you'll consider Ballroom a waste of time. I admit, in struggling to consume it in time to meet a deadline weeks ago, the record was lost on me. Then I realized that I wasn't giving it the time or attention it demands. This album is best consumed on headphones, or at a reasonably loud volume, in order to take in every nuance. Missing a hushed analog swirl here is like missing the guitar riff that opens the body section of ""Teenage Riot"". Ballroom is a perfect record for a drear Saturday morning, with nothing on the agenda and no will to slate something in for later on. But then, Trapist aren't about any specific time; they embrace all hours, and dominate any one in which this disc spins.","People seem to think that for all the surplus and prosperity of the 21st century, time is a fair trade ...

Dear You [Expanded Edition],Jawbreaker,by: Christopher Sebela,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d3ea9e61561daa70a2/1:1/w_160/fdea2c6f.gif,2004-03-30 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4215-dear-you-expanded-edition/,GeffenGeffen,"Listening to the newly expanded and finally-back-in-print edition of Jawbreaker's Dear You felt like discovering that once upon a time I was a giant asshole. Somewhere between teendom and quasi-adulthood, Dear You had been my jam of choice, a big slab of music as irrationally depressed and eager to rock as I was. After listening to it for days and nights and weeks, I began to work backward through the band's catalog. As these albums took prominence, Dear You dropped out of rotation, and eventually wound up on some nameless secondhand store's shelf to inflict its half-life of misery on someone else. Coming off the yelping enthusiasm of Unfun, Bivouac, and the stellar 24 Hour Revenge Therapy-- whose songs argued the politics of being a legitimate punk-- Jawbreaker disappointed their indie-thrall fanbase by signing to Geffen for a one-million-dollar, three-album contract, and far worse, selling out their music: Dear You was a slick symphony of guitar and singer Blake Schwarzenbach's soft, post-surgical vocals. Dear You is emo in denial; a tight-sweatered cry of loneliness, heartbreak, and wallowing in sadness that apes the band's punk roots. ""Sluttering"" and ""Fireman"" are love-as-revenge songs in the key of Sylvia Plath. ""Jet Black"", a paean to alienation, opens and closes with Christopher Walken's car crash monologue from Annie Hall, converting the clip's original surrealistic humor into more grist for the whiny mill. And while these songs admittedly held fast to Jawbreaker's melodic chops, it's clear the band had dulled their edge to appeal to the radio-friendly commercial punk explosion that dominated the mid-90s airwaves. The problem with Dear You wasn't Jawbreaker's decision to renege on their long-standing anti-major-label policy, but that the album, plainly, is a dramatic step down in quality from Revenge Therapy, despite the fact that it took much longer to record. Songs often wander too long, and their lyrics strain for depth in pursuit of the album's overall sad-sack mood. Unlike Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, whose fatalistic tone ends at a cul-de-sac into rebirth, or Lou Reed's unapologetically despairing Berlin, Dear You waffles between manic and depressive, unsure of which it wants to be. Tracks like ""Chemistry"", ""Save Your Generation"" and ""Bad Scene, Everyone's Fault"" do manage to inject a small dose of joy into the proceedings, but are obscured by the frantically waving arms of a drowning band. Even ""Basilica"", a seemingly redemptive number with a more positive outlook, meanders, droning and repeating its vaguely threatening request, ""I'm asking you on a date for the rest of your life."" That Dear You killed Jawbreaker is no surprise, given how little it sold by major-league standards, and how divisively fans reacted to it. The question is: What happened to the band that merged ragged perfectionism with lyrics that read like fiction? This expanded edition offers no answers. No new ground is covered here for fans of the original release, though the inclusion of ""Sister"" and the Psychedelic Furs cover ""Into You Like a Train"" are quick and dirty little gems. The eventually tiresome ""Friendly Fire"" is as close to a transition between Revenge Therapy and Dear You as you're likely to find, but are also available on the band's somewhat more worthwhile Etc. collection. Only the throwaway ""Shirt"" has been previously unissued, and it, along with a baffling, unnecessary remake of ""Boxcar"", illustrates that the disintegration of Jawbreaker was not worth mourning, especially with so many bands gladly assuming their former position in the underground.","Listening to the newly expanded and finally-back-in-print edition of Jawbreaker's Dear You felt like discovering that once upon a ...

Dirty South Classics,Goodie Mob,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfefeb335119a49ed2e3/1:1/w_160/e45893d8.jpg,2004-03-30 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3635-dirty-south-classics/,AristaLa Face,"During the 90s, Outkast and Goodie Mob were Hotlanta contemporaries, hip-hop mavericks who formed the crunked-up cornerstone of the Dirty South. The trailblazing Organized Noize production unit rolled out a gritty, organic sound with blaring horns and live bass, and lyrically, both Outkast and the Mob added heart and soul to the bling and booty equation. Their complex musical arrangements, gospel harmonies, and confessional lyrics upset the East Coast/West Coast bipolar disorder, and both groups quickly gained massive underground cred and critical accolades. Outlasting Master P's murda music for regional bragging rights, Outkast went on to achieve megastar status. But after three cult-fave albums, creative differences and the pressures of success dissolved Goodie Mob in 2000. That the four members of Goodie Mob-- Cee-Lo, Big Gipp, Khujo, and T-Mo-- could reach a unified vision of empowerment within their dark, urban melodrama raises them above your average radio rappers. The sense of urgency conveyed through tales of petty violence and street corner hustling transforms several tracks on this greatest hits collection from battle hymns to ghetto anthems. Goodie Mob (the name's an acrostic: Good Die Mostly Over Bullshit) lead rough, conflicted lives occasionally peppered by block parties and one-night stands, and their lessons and losses often rise through the music. ""Black Ice"", featuring Outkast's Big Boi and Andre 3000, is a sparse, psychedelic warning against the perils of dealing near your neighbor. The sultry ""Soul Food"" brings brothers together over chicken wings, grits, and a greasy beat as Cee-Lo rhymes, ""If I hadda went and took the easy way/ Wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today/ Everythang that I did/ Different thangs I was told/ Just ended up being food for my soul."" Cee-Lo's cartoonish Scatman Crothers rasp carries the most memorable verses here; on the album's only day-glo party starter, ""Get Rich to This"", his exaggerated, sing-song meter bounces on regal horn samples like a balloon. On a few lesser numbers, Organized Noize's dense, steamy production tramples the vocals, mostly the result of underwhelming flow from the Mob. The Stax/Volt guitar and bass on ""Fly Away"" takes off with a funky lift, Gipp and Khujo just can't stand up to the bump, despite their solid wordplay. Surprisingly and sadly absent from this collection is ""The Dip"", the haunting strings-n-bass epic from World Clique, Goodie Mob's final album. That track shows the group at its best, delivering significant rhymes in perfect synch with a lushly orchestrated background. With only a handful of true Dirty South Classics, most spotlighting Outkast or Cee-Lo's incomparable timbre, this comp falls short of essential. No doubt it's an important retrospective in the development of some currently flourishing artists-- Cee-Lo Green and Pat ""Sleepy"" Brown (co-founder of Organized Noize)-- but like most compilations of this nature, a few imperfections hold it back. Skip this album and fire up Cee-Lo's Soul Machine instead, and you'll see why he's the only Mob-ster to achieve solo success after the group's collapse: Like Andre 3000, his artistic ambitions transcend the Dirty South pigeonhole and fly off into their own uncharted post-millennial funk realms.","During the 90s, Outkast and Goodie Mob were Hotlanta contemporaries, hip-hop mavericks who formed the crunked-up cornerstone of the Dirty ...

Live at the Apollo [Expanded Edition],James Brown,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c25e6ef959693206f6/1:1/w_160/a38ce6d3.gif,2004-03-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/976-live-at-the-apollo-expanded-edition/,KingKing,"Syd Nathan never wanted this record made. The King Records founder had a long history of working with black performers, ever since the late 40s when he decided to get into ""the race business"" after initially only concentrating on ""hillbilly accounts."" This is a man who had not only started his own independent label, but also bankrolled his own recording studios, pressing plant and distribution network. He was keenly aware of talent, using A&R; reps (who would later be his scapegoats when pressed by the FCC during the payola hearings of the 50s) to snatch up big band singers and bandleaders, in the hopes of transforming them into viable sensations for what would one day be called ""crossover"" appeal. He tried country, blues, doo-wop and R&B--; he might not have capitalized on every opportunity (most notably letting The Platters go to Mercury in 1953, only to witness them become the most successful vocal group of the decade), but he was certainly willing to try. Nathan signed Macon, Georgia performer James Brown in 1956 to his King subsidiary, Federal, despite a less than favorable view of the ""Please, Please, Please"" demo (in short, ""That's the worst piece of crap I've heard in my life""). Brown and his band, The Famous Flames, had already toured the South when he was signed for $200 to Federal, but he had yet to convince Nathan and Federal to allow him to record with the band. It wouldn't happen until Brown and the Flames scored a hit called ""Mashed Potatoes"" under the pseudonym Nat Kendrick & The Swans for another label. After Brown hit regionally with ""Please, Please, Please"" in 1956 for Federal, Nathan's original appraisal appeared to have been off the mark. That is, until Brown's next nine singles in a row flopped. Badly. Brown and the Flames finally scored a national hit with their eleventh single for Federal, ""Try Me"", which granted him further stay on the label. Nathan was rewarded, too, as over the next four years, the band earned its reputation as the best in the biz, performing as The James Brown Revue (""Star Time""), and saddling its frontman with several well-applied titles: ""The Hardest Working Man in Show Business,"" ""Mr. Dynamite"" and ultimately, ""The Godfather of Soul."" By 1962, Brown intended to showcase his act with a live album, especially after seeing Ray Charles hit with In Person in 1959. He'd played Harlem's Apollo Theater several times, but when Nathan refused to pay for a live recording on the basis that he wouldn't have a single to promote it, Mr. Dynamite had to take matters into his own hands. Brown personally funded the recording of his Wednesday night show at The Apollo on October 24th, 1962. He and the Flames had been there all week already, and Brown was counting on the raucous crowds who showed for amateur night to give him the kind of support he knew Nathan couldn't ignore. For his part, Nathan had reluctantly sent one of his people to supervise the recording, but could hardly have expected it to result in this album. It's more than a little strange to think King had originally issued Live at the Apollo with canned applause and screams because not only were the Apollo faithful in full ""support"" of Brown's revue, that night has gone down in rock and soul history as arguably the finest live performance ever captured on record. Not bad for a guy who'd been one flop away from failure only a few years earlier. Live at the Apollo was issued in 1963 and became an instant hit. Not only did it satisfy Brown's small legion of diehard fans-- to the tune of being played in its entirety during the evenings on some R&B; radio stations-- for the first time, it brought the undeniably intense celebration of his live show to young audiences throughout the country. This might not have been very important in another era, but just as Live at the Apollo can be seen as a symbolic transformation of R&B; into Soul, for a myriad of events, 1963 marked the dawn of a decade when sharing experiences and points of view across an entire culture meant more than just crossover success. It was the true beginning of the 60s, and Brown's half-hour Wednesday night set figures no less prominently than Dylan bringing protest music to the masses or The Beatles arriving in America the following year as musical signposts for A New Day. Emcee Fats Gonder's introduction to the show is as fine a setup as a performer could ask for: ""So now, ladies and gentlemen, it is Star Time. Are you ready for Star Time?!"" The Flames give hits upon each Brown hit that Gonder lists, and the eager crowd responds with due enthusiasm (i.e., screams, lots and lots of screams). The band then drops a cutting version of Brown's ""The Scratch"" to urge the Man onstage. And what do you think Brown should announce as soon as he arrives? Two years before ""I Got You"", and he lets us have it: ""You know, I feel alright!"" The band launches ""I'll Go Crazy"" with the slash of Les Buie's guitar and the sting of horns. ""If you leave me, I'll go crazy,"" sings the leader, and the audience can already barely stand themselves. Horn punches accentuate the message Brown has taken with him to this day: ""You gotta live for yourself, and nobody else."" Just as soon as he's delivered the advice, Brown pleas to ""Try Me! SCREAM! Try Me!"" His trio of background singers, Bobby Byrd, Bobby Bennett and ""Baby"" Lloyd Stallworth, echo the sentiments, while the band locks the bluesy shuffle in tighter than the tension on Clay Fillyau's snare head. And again, before you can catch your breath, the band is already into the post-jump intro to ""Think"". Star Time was a lesson in speed, endurance and shared inspiration: If you gave the band everything you had, they'd return the favor tenfold. Then, things get really good with a dit-dit-dit-DOOO and the ultra-cool, slow burning blues seduction of ""I Don't Mind"". With each beat, falling just behind where you expect it to land, Brown and his angelic backing choir deliver a fatal blow to any woman within earshot: ""I don't mind, and I know you're gonna miss me."" Jesus. Just in case you didn't think he was serious, good luck surviving ""Lost Someone"", ten minutes of gospel-tinged balladry somehow slower and lower than the preceding number. The Flames horns (led by trumpeter Lewis Hamlin) maintain a faint bond to Count Basie while at the same time handing Brown the razor-sharp precision he demanded. Between each declaration of passion, the horns serve an upturned figure, just enough to hold the audience in their place lest they faint from what must by then have been a steamy auditorium. And can I get a medic to those two girls JB was singing to at the end? The Flames were masters of pacing, and roll out a six-minute medley of their hits to keep the show rolling, including ""Please, Please, Please"" (twice!), ""You've Got the Power"" and ""Why Do You Do Me"". The audience doesn't miss a beat, of course, and the only thing more powerful than Fillyau's bass drum kicks are their shrieks. And then things get REALLY REALLY good: ""All aboard!"" ""Yeah!"" ""All aboard!"" ""Yeah!"" ""For NIGHT TRAIN!"" Brown ends the show with his then latest hit, running down a list of cities in which he was quickly becoming a household name. He even gets his band excited when name checking New York City. ""Night Train"" is full of complex polyrhythms and demands total precision from the musicians, but you can hardly blame them for getting swept up in this show. The original Live at the Apollo ended after ""Night Train"", but the newly expanded and remastered version contains four mono single-edits of songs from the show that Brown issued to tide over fans unable to catch one of his 300 yearly shows. 40 years later, the few remaining folks either unaware or somehow unconvinced of the power of the record have little excuse not to put down the bucks for this budget-priced edition. Beyond its significance in rock and soul history, and for Brown as an artist, this music translates so far beyond barriers of style or taste, it's one of the few albums that could accurately be described as essential.

Mayhem Mystics,AzeemVariable Unit,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18f13d1975652138674/1:1/w_160/a0f58ec9.gif,2004-03-30 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/430-mayhem-mystics/,Wide Hive,"Illbient, broken beat, downtempo, trip-hop, yadda yadda yadda. Let's cut to the chase, okay? If there's improvisation with actual instruments, it's jazz; if there are rhymes, it's hip-hop. Both elements, however, blend into a tech-noir soundscape that's equally sensual and gripping on this 13-track debut from longtime San Francisco collaborators Azeem and Variable Unit. Instrumental hip-hop has made great advances in the past couple years, but Azeem's lyrical surrealism and V.U.'s subdued atmospherics smolder with an urgency that's far more experimental, and powerful, than most. Mainly responsible for the album's post-millennial tension are dual DJs Quest and Zeph, both fixtures of the West Coast turntablist community. These two lay shifting foundations of indeterminable effects that settle just long enough to anchor Variable Unit's expansive, moody grooves. Keyboardist Jacob Aginsky blows a future-funk breeze through each tune, his Hammond and synth flights simultaneously anachronistic and progressive in tone. Matt Montgomery's bass is a fluid pulse, deftly strutting alongside Thomas McCree's laidback drumming to form a head-nodding rhythm section that's appropriately understated and utterly hypnotic. Backed by Blackalicious vocalist Omega's sultry croon and occasional full-flavored horn flourishes, Variable Unit alternate between eerie minimalism and rubbery bounce that produces an innovative, deeply soulful slant. Some of Azeem's previous work with V.U. has come off as overly political and heavy-handed. A seriously conscientious and articulate MC, his fire-and-brimstone rants can numb impatient ears eager for catchy hooks and booty bragging. On Mayhem Mystics, he waxes metaphysical, leading the band with easygoing, conversational rhymes and spiritual stream-of-consciousness poetry. Were the mic in another MC's hands, ""Break It on Down"" might be an upbeat party starter; here, instead of the beat, Azeem breaks down our faltering society: ""War is inviting/ Peace is in hiding/ Factions uniting/ Lands are dividing/ Birds are migrating/ And pigs are now flying/ Everything's breaking on down."" On ""Sound Field"", above Zeph's palette of electronic animal noises, Azeem spins scenes of new beginnings after an unavoidable apocalypse. He's intriguingly abstract: ""My heartbeat gives the tone of the jungle/ You alone the forest of light/ What lays beneath/ The creeping things/ The birds that fly/ The fish that swim/ Run along the river ."" The unbridled funk of ""What Is It?"" yields the album's most accessible track, as Azeem, putting a hand out to the initiated, chants, ""Put your wings on, tilt your halo to the side/ Strap on your time machine, let's go for a ride."" Several of Mayhem Mystic's tracks run over five minutes, their length hinting at the groups' open, exploratory spirit, but at more than seven minutes, ""The Music Is the Medicine, So Let It In"" is easily the most ambitious. Featuring The Flecktones' Paul Hanson on bassoon and saxophone, the tune is a sprawling breakbeat journey that will leave listeners simultaneously unsettled and sedated, as Azeem intones, ""Crawling out of the TV, turning your forehead into a gray lens, experimenting. Beware the Illuminati, they are even watching you now/ The Patriot Actors, the Patriot Actors."" His dose of creepy, Wu-addled conspiracy is jarring, but the Middle Eastern vocals that float through the track carry it into dark, ambient terrain. The song captures the album's essence, hitting like a drug you've never tried-- blissfully hallucinatory in feel and startlingly vivid in imagery.",,7.9,
Atlas,Kinky,by: Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc30ea9e61561daa7405/1:1/w_160/83772c24.jpg,2004-03-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4574-atlas/,Nettwerk,"""You paint everything in colors instead of black and white,"" taunts Gil Cereso on the first track of Kinky's sophomore effort, Atlas. The song, titled ""El Presidente"", is meant as a jab at Mexican president Vicente Fox's noncommittal politics, but could easily apply to the band as well. Kinky refuse to define themselves by genre, generation, or nationality; with rash splashes of funk, electronica, batucada, and good, old-fashioned guitar rock, they throw a Technicolor tantrum that shows the up side of globalization. As the name implies, Kinky's swing isn't rough trade or edgy fetishism: Simply put, this five-piece out of Monterey-- Mexico's gritty, thriving industrial center-- make dancefloor ear candy balanced by a refreshingly giddy naivete and sophisticated, hip-shaking rhythmic approach. Though Atlas doesn't bring the same sexed-up potency as their self-titled debut, its No World Border pastiche pushes the band a step further on the international stage and proves these guys are serious about their fun. Where their first album featured dense, sequenced keyboard textures, Atlas finds Kinky making electronic music that genuinely rocks, and like French house-funk outfit RixF4çérôse, they take up guitars as their weapon of choice. Producer Chris Allison (Beta Band, Coldplay) plays a major role in icing down the band's sound, never sapping the life from these snappy, crystal-clean barnburners. Lead guitarist Carlos Chaires gets substantial facetime on tracks like ""Do U Like It?"", a blazing instrumental propelled by timbale breakbeats, and ""Salta-Lenin-El-Atlas"", with its wicked Brazilian rhythm, vocoded chorus, and Cesar Pliego's fuzzy, distorted bass. Cake vocalist John McCrea makes an appearance as ""The Headphonist"", his straight-faced narrative backed by bright horn samples, swollen organ, and percussionist Omar Gongora's incessant cumbia beat. Suffice to say, Cake's funk-pop sensibility and ironic intellectual bent clearly rubbed off on Kinky during 2002's Unlimited Sunshine tour. Opening with a radio rock riff and bouncy bass, ""Airport Feelings"" gets a trumpet treatment as Cereso croons, ""Now your skin is my runway/ I'm ready for a landing."" It's on these English-language songs that the band's youthful, wide-eyed charm renders some rather poetic concepts somewhat goofy and cloying. ""My God Is So Quiet,"" goes one song, ""that sometimes I can't hear him when he speaks loud."" ""Not Afraid"" strings together stoneriffic musings like, ""They say that rugs are just floor with overgrown hair/ And the broom is the comb/ The vacuum is the blow dryer."" Cute and clever, if shallow, these lyrics might better be rendered in Spanish-- Cereso is far more articulate in his native tongue. The two tracks with the sharpest melodic focus are standouts for both their uniqueness within the album's context and as truly memorable, progressive pop compositions: ""Minotauro"" bumps Far East tabla up against South-of-the-border rocanrol with humming synthlines, a hard-rock bridge, and a sunny, blissed-out chorus. Meanwhile, the album's closer, ""Semillas De Menta"", plays like a bossa nova lullaby, a total departure from the dancefloor dynamite which it follows. A band with incredible talent and potential for mass appeal, Kinky is too infatuated with their multi-culti influences and all-inclusive musical ethic to pull together the cohesive, definitive opus they may be capable of. The relentless touring and explosive, sweat-drenched live shows they're known for should continue to refine their sound. Hopefully, it won't drain their machismo.","""You paint everything in colors instead of black and white,"" taunts Gil Cereso on the first track of Kinky's ...

Bataclan 72,John CaleNicoLou Reed,by: Philip Shelley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a243b1335d7bf169845c/1:1/w_160/73e276ff.gif,2004-03-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6737-bataclan-72/,Pilot,"In January of 1972, before any of them had established themselves as solo performers, the three semi-estranged principles of the disbanded Velvet Underground found themselves in Europe at the same time and played a legendary one-off ""unplugged"" concert at a thousand-seat venue in Paris called Le Bataclan. The set they played that night has long been available on poor-quality bootlegs, and though I've never heard any of those bootlegs, I cannot imagine how the sound quality could be any worse than on this official release. Sometimes it actually sounds as if the tape were slowing down, and various instruments have that weird, warbly sound that one associates with old cassette tapes well along the way to becoming spaghetti. Still, the novelty of hearing these by-now overly familiar songs in these lo-fi, round-robin, coffee-house renditions has a certain charm that is at times both poignant and illuminating. And the stage banter, always a key selling point with any live Velvets album, is suitably deadpan and entertaining. ""Waiting for My Man"" opens the set. The traditional, scene-setting Moe Tucker drum kick-in being unavailable, Cale opts for traipsing in with an almost comically earnest school-recital piano figure. Reed, the star pupil, seems to be concentrating on his Sinatra-esque phrasing at the expense of his strumming, but he's in rare form with the quips. Before ""Berlin"", he tells the French people, ""This is my Barbra Streisand song."" Before ""Wild Child"", he explains, ""This is about a wild child, funnily enough."" The mandatory ""Heroin"" is given a decent read, Cale sawing away on his viola, and ""Black Angel's Death Song"", arranged for viola and acoustic guitar, turns out to be laugh-out-loud funny. Cale takes center stage after some extended tuning, and some frustratingly inaudible off-mike conferencing with Reed (this is often better than the stage banter), before running through a song off Vintage Violence, and two previously unreleased numbers: ""The Biggest, Loudest, Hairiest Group of All"", which sounds like one of those old Peter, Paul & Mary sing-along children's songs, and ""Empty Bottles"", a stately love song he originally wrote for Jennifer Warnes. This last song is the first genuinely moving moment of the entire set. Of course, Lou pipes up: ""Anybody got a straw?"" The boys kick in with ""Femme Fatale"" soon after, without Nico, as if they didn't trust her to talk on-mike, but they have to stop as she misses her cue. You can hear her sigh audibly and give a little embarrassed laugh before the song restarts. Her singing is so careful, it's clear that she's terrified. She doesn't have Reed's above-it-all snottiness, or Cale's formal detachment to hide behind. Her gift, such as it is, is pure human sadness unadulterated by irony. The song ends, the crowd finally goes nuts, and rightfully so. She is the evening's entrée. She does three of her own songs next, ending with a literally gut-wrenching version of ""Janitor of Lunacy"": She erupts in a fit of coughing for almost a full-minute after the song ends. Then, Reed, as if he didn't deign to speak directly to Nico, instructs Cale, ""Uh, John, have Nico tell them this is the last song."" More coughing, then finally Nico recovers and is back at the mike. The crowd cheers her on. ""I want to sing the last song now. If I can,"" she says in her halting English, ""I try my best."" After a beat, she feels compelled to add, ""I don't smoke cigarettes."" ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" is the song. Nico's voice is wrecked, the sound is crummy, but somehow, with Reed and Cale propping her up with two-part harmonies, and finally wrenching substantial sounds from their acoustics, it's an incredibly affecting, heroic rendition. The encore (""All Tomorrow's Parties"") can't touch it, but gives the audience a chance to exhale. If you collect fine-art photography, you probably won't care much for this record. It's under-rehearsed, poorly recorded, and the uneven performances range from the sublime to the incoherent. But if you appreciate the fleeting revelations to be found in snapshots, then this may be just the bit of quicksilver for you, a unique moment in musical history just before these three erstwhile Jekylls became forever Hydes.",,7.6,
Storm Hymnal: Gems from the Vault of Grant Lee Buffalo,Grant Lee Buffalo,by: Stephen M.

These three words are perfectly suited to the band's music, which finds inspiration in what Greil Marcus called ""the old weird America,"" a country of dark corners and decaying glory. In the mid-90s, when all ears seemed directed toward Seattle, the trio of Grant-Lee Phillips, Paul Kimble, and Joey Peters were doing their own thing, making music-- especially on their first two albums, Fuzzy and Mighty Joe Moon-- that evoked a strange Americana, like an ivy-encrusted mansion with water-stained wallpaper, flaking paint, and shutters hanging askew. It was a haven for fans whose tweed was wearing thin at the elbows, who wore their trousers rolled. But a decade later, the foundation of that house has weakened, the wiring has short-fused, and the pipes have rusted through. Storm Hymnal: Gems from the Vault of Grant Lee Buffalo, originally released in Britain in 2001, gathers 16 tracks from their four albums on one disc called Takes and 14 rarities and acoustic versions on a second disc entitled Double Takes. The collection reveals a band whose moment has passed and whose songs have aged in wildly varying degrees. Tracks like ""Fuzzy"", ""The Shining Hour"", and ""Truly, Truly"" hold up well enough, and the lovely melodies of ""Arousing Thunder"" and ""Mockingbirds"" never get old. Other songs have taken on new and deeper meanings in the intervening years. ""Stars 'n' Stripes"", for instance, sounds creepily prescient, its chorus a portent of the current fascination with reality TV: ""Got you on my handycam/ Fits in my hand."" What was originally a reference to the old superstition that cameras could steal souls has become a kind of twisted come-on, a promise wrapped in a threat. But for all their loaded imagery, many of the songs are surprisingly only vaguely political. During Grant Lee Buffalo's heyday, Phillips viewed America's ills-- same as now: militias, religious zealotry, industrial rampage, etc.-- as deeply rooted in history and in a strange national psychosis. But he was never a Woody Guthrie, a Bob Dylan, or a Bruce Springsteen: His approach tends to supercede his politics and even his music, such that his political agenda is usually muddled or overly obvious, as in ""Bethlehem Steel"", when he describes the light of a welder's torch guiding industrial tycoons like magi to Pennsylvania. It doesn't help that the band's production today sounds so cumbersome, its mountaintop guitars weighing down the melodies and instruments (especially on Copperopolis) and often forestalling any spontaneity. Maybe that's why the Double Takes disc is livelier and more engaging for both the band and the listener. Songs like ""We're Coming Down"" and especially the three alternate acoustic tracks from Fuzzy sound more off-the-cuff and personal, unbowed by too much production. They're imperfect, but in these flaws lies the charm missing on some of the band's more single-worthy songs. In a sense, it's ironic that any band's outtakes should overshadow its most popular music. On the other hand, Grant Lee Buffalo were interested in America's secret history, so it seems only natural that the band's own secret history be more interesting than its public one, and that its neglected, dusty corners bear more treasure than its well-trod footpaths.","The name Grant Lee Buffalo calls up images of national violence and extinction-- two Civil War generals and a bovine ...

The Moon & Antarctica [Expanded Edition],Modest Mouse,by: Stephen M.

When Brent DiCrescenzo reviewed The Moon & Antarctica for Pitchfork in 2000, he awarded it a 9.8, nearly the highest rating possible and one that I second with only quibbling reservations. Four years later, Epic Records has re-released the album in an ""expanded and remastered edition"" that begs the question: Why? More ambitious in sound, if not in theme, than any of its predecessors, The Moon & Antarctica revealed frontman Isaac Brock's emotional and existential doubts to be as desolate and tundraic as its two title geographies. Simultaneously far-out abstract and achingly personal, it was a complex, inquisitive record, yet for every question Brock asked, he discovered a confounding infinity of even more questions. From all these conundrums he fashioned a bleak, angry philosophy about God, life, death, and his own and others' dwindling self-worth. Nothing has happened since the album's release to alter that view very dramatically, but in light of the 2000 election, September 11th, the ""war"" on terror, and The Passion of The Christ, The Moon & Antarctica has only deepened in meaning and relevance. It may be mere hindsight, but these 15 songs seem charged with vaguely political undercurrents of anti-corporate discomfort and antiglobalist isolation, particularly in songs like ""A Different City"", ""Paper Thin Walls"", and ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"". How do you secure your own identity, Brock wonders, when everything you buy, watch, listen to, or experience already defines you to others? How do you find a space that hasn't already been branded with a logo? Or, in his own words: ""Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?"" The moon and Antarctica appear to be the last pure, untouched places within reach that can offer genuine isolation-- even though there's been an American flag planted on lunar soil for about 35 years now. In light of this new relevance, the band's decision to license ""Gravity Rides Everything"" to a Nissan Quest commercial seems like a case of can't-beat-'em-join-'em. Perhaps it's an act of infiltration (do lyrics like, ""As fruit drops, flesh it sags,"" and, ""When we die, some sink and some lay"" really sell minivans?). Or maybe the band just needed the money to pay the rent. Does it really matter? Only in the sense that this commercial is most likely the impetus behind this reissue. But why re-release a new version of an album that's only four years old? Has it been remastered and expanded enough to warrant the $12 price tag? Well, for starters, the artwork is different. The reissue has a new arctic-blue and orange motif highlighted with machine blueprints (reminiscent of 1999's Building Nothing Out of Something), satellite photography, and a cover image that resembles a corroded hipbone. While I applaud the band for jettisoning the original shaking-hands cover art, which was silly in an early-80s Pink Floyd way, the new packaging-- the design of which was again overseen by Mary Maurer-- looks too abstract, muted, and minimalist, with no new liner notes, documentary photographs, or much of anything to bolster the product. More important than the new visuals, the sound of The Moon & Antarctica has been reworked, and while I doubt there have been any great strides in audio technology that would render the original primitive, there is a noticeable difference between the two versions. The new one puts more texture in Brock's guitars, more layers in his vocals; Jeremiah Green's drums are a little higher in the mix, with a lot more high-hat ride. Overall, the sound is sharper and much more dynamic-- The Moon & Antarctica is now a headphones album. And finally, there are the four bonus tracks-- a curious move, as the last thing this 15-strong LP needed was more material. Regardless, the set gives us BBC radio 1 session versions of three album cuts and an instrumental version of a track from 1996's This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About. The live-in-the-studio approach doesn't add much to ""3rd Planet"", more or less a note-for-note re-creation of the original (save the bleeped-out ""f--kin' people over""), but ""Perfect Disguise"" adds a watery effect to Brock's vocals and turns the song into a darker, if less lonely-sounding, dirge. Only ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" sounds markedly different, and that's mostly due to Brock forgetting the words and laughing into his microphone. But why such paltry offerings? Why not a second disc of outtakes, remixes, demos, and live tracks? Certainly, there's a wealth of material floating around from these sessions: the Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks EP contains seven non-album tracks (including the beautiful ""Night on the Sun"") and an extended ""I Came as a Rat"". Or why not include the upcoming tour-only bootleg Baron von Bullshit Rides Again? On the surface, this near-deluxe edition of a still-mindblowing album should be a godsend to Modest Mouse fans, but no one was really asking for it, and there's simply not enough here to justify the expense or even a rating as high as the original. Truly, the fact that this edition raises so many uneasy questions is the sort of cosmic joke that Brock and his bandmates can really appreciate.","In some ways this review has a foregone conclusion.

Whips,The Wind-Up Bird,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa90ea9e61561daa5bf0/1:1/w_160/d2a07010.jpg,2004-03-29 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8771-whips/,Music Fellowship,"The Breakup is arguably the dominant artistic subject of our self-obsessed times, replacing the endless portrayals of crucifixions and weeping Marys one finds in any museum. The rise to auto-complete ubiquity of the term ""emo"" underscores this point, not so much in regards to the term reflecting any sort of new stylistic genre (it doesn't), but through the word's usefulness as a shorthand for artists taking the easy route to publicly bleed out their pain. Given the traffic jam of acoustic-strumming songweepers striving to make their exes feel guilty, it's amazing that there remain a few creative ways of expressing the universal pain of heartbreak without succumbing to easy clichés like ""the universal pain of heartbreak."" Recent months have served up two dandies from that latter group, in Michel Gondry's film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and The Wind-Up Bird's ornate, searing album Whips. Despite extensively different approaches-- one being Charlie Kaufman's latest gambit to sneak sci-fi past the hipsters, the other being a 40-minute slab of instrumental post-rock via laptop-- both trace strikingly similar paths through the seven-step recovery wilderness of The Breakup. I'll try not to give anything of substance away herein, but suffice to say they're so thematically and structurally aligned, you could probably play Whips underneath the movie like The Dark Side of Oz. That a vocal-less album can keep pace with a two-hour soundie is quite the accomplishment, though the Murakami-inspired duo that makes up The Wind-Up Bird cheat a bit with the tracklist, constructing the eight song titles from the eleven-word Dear John voicemail that sets the record's tone. It's a pretension play that should send emophobes into paroxysms, but such a tissue-grabber move reflects the duo's catharsis-by-immersion goals, right down to the gritty move of interweaving the actual phone message into the central track. The sound may be closest to ambient, but this record is far from easy listening. Musically, Joseph Grimm and Jeff Smith spend most of their time slowly approaching and drifting away from crescendo points, stirring up brews of mournful violin, somber trumpet, plucked guitar, and Powerbook shimmers. Peaceful, gauzy moments like the chiming loops of ""Become"" come laced with foreboding undercurrents, while discordant, disquieting hard drive noise (as on ""You"") yields to resigned and exhausted string and keyboard epilogues. You don't need an English Lit background to see through the symbolism; The Wind-Up Bird is translating the ebb and flow of romance into musical notes, and despite the idea's on-paper corniness (and perhaps because of its wordless nature), it succeeds against all odds. Track most likely to recreate that punched-in-the-gut feeling you had the week you spent curled up in an afghan on the floor of your bedroom? ""This"", wherein Grimm and Smith initially present the ex-girlfriend's sobbing send-off message straight, before slowly alchemizing it into jagged white noise. The track is one of the more effective transmutations of emotion into music I've heard, a musical representation of all the scariest parts of The Breakup's aftermath: the self-mutilation phase, the tearing up the old photos and letters phase, the restraining order phase. That ""Monster"", the peaceful resolution immediately following, sort of resembles ""Theme from Frodo and Sam Sharing a Tender Moment in the Wilderness"" does little to undercut the fierce reflux pain of this brutal climax. Both of Whips' uninterrupted LP-side-long ""movements"" follow this same path, with the first, five-track one more memorable due to the presence of ""This"". By excruciatingly painting both the light and dark tones of a relationship's spectrum, the album's message dovetails nicely with that of Eternal Sunshine, both concluding that the good times and bad times of love are mutually essential, the emotional equivalent of a pop song's loud/soft dynamics. That such a message seems Hallmark-obvious in words is beside the point; that each person has to go through their own pain and joy-filled journey to learn it is something that Grimm, Smith, Gondry, and Kaufmann understand, and translate masterfully to their respective media for all us current and former sad sacks.","The Breakup is arguably the dominant artistic subject of our self-obsessed times, replacing the endless\n\ portrayals of crucifixions and ...

Convict Pool EP,Calexico,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d7c0084474cd0c05a2/1:1/w_160/14f57078.jpg,2004-03-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1233-convict-pool-ep/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"It's so nice to hear Joey Burns realizing that he can sing. It's been a slow process of discovery for him, as seven years of steadily improving and diversifying output from Calexico strikingly illustrates. On the band's 1997 debut, Spoke, he seemed almost afraid to rise above a whisper, as though he wasn't sure he wanted to be a frontman. And maybe he wasn't. At that point, Calexico were still a side project for Burns and John Convertino, who made their day jobs as Giant Sand's rhythm section, as well as in-demand indie session men. But as the band has slowly come to outshine everything else Burns and Convertino have done, they seem to have gained a good deal of self-confidence-- by the time they released last year's astounding Feast of Wire, they didn't seem to be limiting themselves at all. Though their core sound still remains the aural embodiment of the nexus between the American Southwest and northern Mexico, they now deviate into simmering jazz, falsetto pop, dub, ambient electronics, and anything else that comes to mind more or less at will, and it's resulted in a fascinating and unpredictable discography. Lately, Burns retreats to his old whisper only for the effect it creates, and on the band's new Convict Pool EP, he spends more time in full croon than ever before. In relation to Feast of Wire, this EP is pretty musically conservative, spending most of its time exploring variations on the band's Tex-Mex roots through three originals and three well-chosen covers. Love's ""Alone Again Or"" is really a no-brainer for a band like Calexico to cover, with its baroque Sonoran horn parts and Spanish guitars, and the band has been playing it live for some time now. This is the first time it's made it out of the studio onto a disc in the U.S., and frankly, it's the only disappointing track here. They've trucked in Swedish singer/songwriter Nicolai Dunger to sing what amounts to a lead vocal, and while it's not a desecration of a classic or anything, it comes off a little flat. The other two covers are more inspired: French singer Francoiz Breut's ""Si tu Disais"" gets a languid, waltzing read, with mariachi horns and pedal steel trading off the instrumental hook. D. Boon's ""Corona"", meanwhile, from the Minutemen masterpiece Double Nickels on the Dime, gets the full borderline treatment it so richly deserves, his original guitar riffs transposed to the horns and violins. It's the originals, though, that ultimately bring it all home for the fan, and the three here find the band's songwriting in strong, if not peak, form. ""Praskovia"" is a twirling, equilibrium-challenged Eastern European wedding march for circus freaks, opening with a pretty accordion refrain before spilling over Convertino's rolling drums with swooping horns and wild accordion runs. ""Sirena"" is another of the band's charging spaghetti Western mariachi tunes, this time with a female backing chorus and twanging Morricone guitars. The title track takes a second to get going, but it's Burns' best vocal showcase, as he lets himself really emote and follow the melody where it wants to take him on the chorus, while Convertino rolls on the mallets beneath him. As a layover between albums, Convict Pool is just about everything a devotee might want, a brief appetizer that tugs lightly at the edges of the band's sound and tosses out a couple of decent covers for good measure. It's place for the uninitiated to start-- that's Feast of Wire, or the Even My Sure Things Fall Through EP-- but it's a healthy reminder that Calexico are capable of making some fantastic music, even at their most casual.","It's so nice to hear Joey Burns realizing that he can sing.

It's just too damn stifling, the premise goes, for citizens to be productive. But imagine what the people of Gabon, Maldives and Kiribati could accomplish if given whatever drugs are powering the sweaty but prolific Josh Homme, who runs his empire of rock from the sun-scorched sands of Palm Desert, California. Homme has barely taken a breath since he left the corpse of the mighty, lumbering Kyuss rotting in the desert in 1997, casting a shadow over the entire, stupidly named riff-heavy sub-genre, stoner rock. Since then, in only three albums' time, he's taken Queens of the Stone Age from dive club misfits in thrift store threads to internationally acclaimed rock stars who wear shiny shirts and win Q magazine readers' polls. Homme has lent his vocal, guitar, percussion and production talents to acts as varied as the shamefully underrated melodic blues-rockers Masters of Reality, and ambient electro-Brits UNKLE. In 2002, he contributed music to Jodie Foster's coming-of-age, death-by-cougar film Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys. Last year, he became a full-on impresario, inevitably founding his own label, RekordsRekords. And most recently, Homme has performed a reverse Grohl, jumping from frontman to drummer with his new band Eagles of Death Metal. Of course, in his rare downtime, Homme invites friends over for slumber parties, packs the bong, and rolls the tape. The result is the charmingly loose Desert Sessions series, now up to volumes 9 and 10. This latest installment was recorded out in Joshua Tree over eight days, and features, among others, PJ Harvey, Dean Ween, Twiggy Ramirez, Mark Lanegan, and Alain Johannes. The 14 songs sound as all over the map as you might expect with a group so diverse, and that's exactly the point. Sure, it's self-indulgent and ill-advised at times, but that's what the spirit of pure experimentation will get you. For example, the throwaway ""Sheperds Pie"" is a loony-- and irritating-- a cappella hoedown, an ode to the British delicacy that sounds like it was recorded in the throes of cabin fever. Mostly, though, the project hits all the right notes; you can tell it was a hell of a lot of fun to record, which helps you to forgive the rough patches and go along for the ride. Homme puts his resin-stained fingerprint on the proceedings from the get-go, playing and/or singing on almost every track. The first one, ""Dead in Love"", kicks off with a riff shamelessly stolen from Alice Cooper's ""School's Out"", but, with its eventual wash of dreamy, layered vocals, the song would sound at home on any Queens record. The same could be said for a couple other numbers, particularly ""Holey Dime"" and ""In My Head. Or Something"", two examples of the kind of tight, dramatic guitar rock the Queens have always had a knack for. But it's PJ Harvey, not surprisingly, who dominates here, adding an air of mystery and danger. Her haunting vocal couples perfectly with Homme's theatrical falsetto, and on ""Crawl Home"", the pair duet over an impossibly low guitar rumble. A solo PJ track, ""There Will Never Be a Better Time"", was only ""performed once"", if you believe the liner notes, and it's a powerful snapshot of the immediacy of some of the sessions. Polly's at a peak here, crooning mournfully through a haze of reverb over a spare guitar line. But while these PJ-fronted songs are clear standouts, the disc hits an apex with the soulfully horny Mark Lanegan number, ""I Wanna Make It Wit Chu"". With rolling piano and some tasteful guitar licks courtesy of the great Dean Ween, the former Screaming Tree works his whiskey-seeped croak to the hilt. Lanegan spits lines like: ""These mysteries of life just ain't my thing/ If I told you I knew about the sun and the moon, I'd be untrue/ The only thing I know for sure is what I wanna do/ I wanna make it wit chu."" Like Ween, the two are tweaking a genre (bedroom soul), while also paying it homage. Not surprisingly, Dean Ween, who seems to know no musical barriers, figures heavily on some of the more out-there tracks. He contributes what the liners call ""chickin' pickin'"" to the (almost) funky low-end instrumental workout ""Subcutaneous Phat"" and adds ""bizarre guitar"" to Johannes' ""weird guitar"" on the ancient-sounding ""Creosote"". The latter, with its staticky edges and trashcan drum sound, could be a Library of Congress field recording from early last century-- proof that our forebears took mescaline and made music in the shadows of the cacti, too. It must be rewarding for Homme to put out the call and see so many great musicians arrive at his doorstep to participate in his ongoing musical experiment. Of course, it could be slightly more rewarding for the listener. Even so, this is Desert Sessions strongest volume yet. As Homme's star grows, so does his Rolodex-- I look forward to seeing who's invited next time.","There's an odd theory of political science that says one of the reasons equatorial countries and some other very ...

I Need You,Ill Lit,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1baabf31b7dc715667f/1:1/w_160/25b46ec8.jpg,2004-03-28 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4076-i-need-you/,Badman,"Ever since the soft-focus singer/songwriter boom of the late 70s, our critical and conversational lexicons have stretched to include a bucketful of lame euphemisms for ""nice""-- check the ever-ubiquitous ""soothing,"" the half-assed ""sweet,"" or the just-barely-a-compliment ""effortless."" Much like scoffing at the Pernice Brothers' super-syrupy pop, it's awfully easy to unconsciously deride the Brooklyn-by-way-of-L.A. folk collective Ill Lit for being stupidly comforting, particularly given their tendency to reassure in geeky, predictable ways-- with gentle acoustic guitars, quivering strings, and soft, honeyed warbles. In ""The Passing Lights"", vocalist/songwriter Daniel Ahearn hungrily indicts a lost lover as ""too cute to be trusted,"" and it's impossible not to wonder if Ahearn's felt the brunt of that sentiment himself, instantly dismissed for his band's sometimes overwhelming palatability. Being called earnest may no longer seem like very much of a compliment, but Ill Lit are still a defiantly compelling band, with generous, lilting melodies, evocative lyrics, and low, salty guitars, all sunsets and cacti, highways and road soda. Like country/folk/electronic brethren the Fruit Bats and Holopaw, Ill Lit attempt to temper their twang with bits of synth and stray 808 beats, building toward a vaguely more accurate version of Americana, with technology and human hands quietly colliding and pushing toward an agreeable medium. Although I Need You is significantly less synthetic than its predecessor, 2002's blip-heavy WACMusic, the communion of steel strings and hardware feels more serendipitous this time, with rickety Moog lines petering in and out, drum machines fading into actual kits, and songwriting superseding gimmickry. Opener ""Mid-City"" introduces Ahearn's lonesome croon, billowing out in generally striking (if unpredictable) ways, over a loose base of drums, spare beats, electric guitar and keyboards, ending in the perfectly perplexing assertion, ""I'm almost out of space here/ Cannot tell the girls from the wait staff."" ""Spring Chicken"" is a pop-perfect bit of alt-country, beset by a frail, ethereal synth whisper, like a ghost shooting through the farm, blowing up stalks of hay before finally crashing face-first into a wall. ""Broken Open Fence"" starts in a fleeting haze of feedback, drifting into acoustic guitar and doubled, broken vocals, wisps of drone kicking up and then politely receding. I Need You is an unmistakably self-serious record, painstakingly composed and gracefully executed; on paper, Ill Lit's deliberate compositions may seem capable of eliciting groans from even the most forgiving listeners, who still can't help but wiggle away from the band's imposing sincerity. But clench your fists and try for a second: If you can just swallow your knee-jerk smirk, there are things here to grin about.","Ever since the soft-focus singer/songwriter boom of the late 70s, our critical and conversational lexicons have stretched to include ...

Our Endless Numbered Days,Iron & Wine,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b985eb335119a49ec7ce/1:1/w_160/5ad53fa8.jpg,2004-03-28 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4127-our-endless-numbered-days/,Sub Pop,"There's an intimacy to Sam Beam's voice that makes it shamefully easy to imagine him curled up in the corner of your futon, slurping tea from a chipped mug, absent-mindedly fiddling with an old acoustic guitar and scribbling words into a coverless notebook. He is always chewing on a pencil, and when he talks, his words come slow. Shake it off. While the idea of Sam Beam tugging at your afghan might seem perfectly inviting, it's actually just dangerous: the traditions and artists of the American south have long been fetishized and vilified with equal fervor, and, perhaps appropriately, both the region and its inhabitants are starting to assume near-cartoonish proportions in print and onscreen. Unsurprisingly, Iron and Wine's grubby campfire hymns are subject to the very same kind of blind, moonlight-heavy romanticizing-- which might make swallowing a new, gently-buffed Iron and Wine album doubly difficult. Picture crisp, fuzz-free vocals and gently brushed snares shooting like darts, incisive and stinging, each chiseled tip dipped in hot studio poison: This is not the Iron and Wine of yesteryear. When The Creek Drank the Cradle puttered quietly out of Sub Pop's warehouse in 2002, it was stupidly easy to be tugged into the quasi-escapist, heavily idealized portrait of Beam-as-basement-troubadour-- a bearded, southern, ""down home"" father of two with a cardboard box full of shitty equipment and an unassuming shoulder shrug. The whimsical inadvertence of Beam's debut-- and the vague sense that the composition and realization of Creek were just as profound and accidental as the record's eventual distribution-- lent Beam's work a dangerous edge of serendipity. Listening to The Creek Drank the Cradle felt like accidentally digging up a diamond, clutching it briefly in a soil-streaked palm, and then shoving it deep into your front pocket, eyes shooting around suspiciously. Nobody who found it ever wanted to give it up. Last year's The Sea and the Rhythm EP, which featured five previously unreleased Creek tracks, saw Iron and Wine maintaining his four-track sigh, bringing his hissing home-studio work to a glorious, satisfying end. For Our Endless Numbered Days, Beam darted out of his basement and into Chicago's Engine Studios, and the resulting record sees Beam taking a satisfying break from air-conditioner-as-rhythm-section: Producer Brian Deck (Califone, Fruit Bats, Holopaw) folds in twittering percussive bits, while sister Sarah Beam coos sweet harmonies and bandmates Jonathan Bradley, EJ Holowicki, Jeff McGriff, and Patrick McKinney provide ample backing. Our Endless Numbered Days is cleaner, more diverse, and generally sparser than its predecessor, and, given the apparent limits of Beam's former setup, it's also an astoundingly progressive record: Beam has successfully transgressed his cultural pigeonhole without sacrificing any of his dusty allure. Opener ""On Your Wings"" mixes Beam's pert guitar picks with rolling slide; scraps of percussion gradually fold in, vocals fall off, and the band somersaults into a comparably raucous mini-jam. In ""Naked as We Came"", Beam nods to the album's enigmatic title, softly lamenting mortality (""One of us will die inside these arms/ Eyes wide open, naked as we came/ One of us will spread our ashes around the yard"") over Creek-ish acoustic strums, while Sarah whispers along, her barely audible murmurs more haunting for their delicacy. ""Each Coming Night"" is instantly moving, perfectly hinged on a bubblegum melody, while ""Sodom, South Georgia"" nails gothic disquiet both on and off the page (""All dead white boys say, 'God is good'/ White tongues hang out, 'God is good'""). Studio tweaking aside, there's another, more subtle tonal flip here: Beam's lyrics, once dribbling over with issues of faith and fidelity, are distinctly more guarded, a switch which seems inextricably linked to the relative (and unexpected) ubiquity of his debut. Creek was full of gently whispered secrets, each tiny, grinning confession or perverse admission only adding to the record's furtive charms. A sizable audience might not have been part of Beam's songwriting equation before, but it is now-- and while Our Endless Numbered Days' lacquered cuts might seem slightly more transparent at first, their lyrics are infinitely more obscured, heavy with their own predestined publicity. Now, Beam juggles bits of dialogue (over half of these tracks feature extra speakers; ""Naked as We Came"" and ""Each Coming Night"" both focus almost exclusively on clips of conversation), painstakingly easing himself out of the narrator's chair, and voicing what would otherwise be some wincingly maudlin bits (see ""I want your flowers like babies want God's love""). Obviously, none of this makes Beam any less of a poet; if anything, Beam's freshly veiled lyrics have simply pushed Iron and Wine toward more subversive levels of storytelling. The song-as-poem critical course has been applied to Beam before, but the accuracy of the analogy never wanes: Beam and Deck toy with syntax and meter, using shaky bits of percussion, volume shifts, and tempo changes to mimic the twitchy movement of the best epic poetry. In the past, Beam's lyrics have proved his linguistic prowess, but it's the eerie lyricism of the instrumentation that ultimately pushes Our Endless Numbered Days deep into the canon of American verse. Slavic poet Charles Simic talks about poetry as ""a table on which one places interesting things one has found on one's walks: a pebble, a rusty nail, a strangely shaped root, the corner of a torn photograph."" And it's in this sense that Beam is, above all else, a poet: His tabletops are littered with gritty little snapshots of life well-lived, strewn with tender acoustic strums, pictures of the ocean, shaken maracas, mothers, fathers, arms. It's a beautiful display.","There's an intimacy to Sam Beam's voice that makes it shamefully easy to imagine him curled up in ...

Semi Peterson,Sluta Leta,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65f13d1975652139185/1:1/w_160/304bc401.jpg,2004-03-28 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7745-semi-peterson/,Mego,"Tonight, on a very special episode of Pitchfork Roundtable, a discussion about Austrian electronic label, Mego. Sitting in for Dick York is Dick Sargent, for Valerie Harper is Sandy Duncan, and for everyone else, Mister Ted McGinley. Ted: Thanks for reading the bottom review, folks. Let's get things started with the topic which must be on everybody's mind: As they near the ten year mark, when exactly did Mego stop putting out stimulating, quality computer music that showcased international artists and set their ideas in the best light? Starting with the man introduced in television series Bewitched with little or no explanation, Dick Sargent. Dick, when did Mego jump the shark? Dick: Well, Ted, I'm going to go with the highly ambitious but ultimately impenetrable and boring Farmers Manual RLA DVD set, compiling nearly four days worth of audience fuckery audio files, all live. Christ, there were MP3s on that over three hours long! What were they thinking? Didn't they realize what this technology would mean to Phish-heads? Sandy Duncan: Well, any label that releases a Jim O'Rourke CD is sending a warning sign. Creatively, it screams, ""We are grasping at straws."" Ted: Excellent point, Sandy. Incidentally, Sandy Duncan heads up the new season of the recently renamed hit show, The Hogan Family, on NBC this fall. Now, Mego's most recent release is Semi Peterson by the Swedish group Sluta Leta. Or at least, they were Swedish until this release, when all the original members were replaced by Mego employees General Magic and Gerhard Potuznik. Dick: This is a bad sign right off the bat. While General Magic put out an endearing, whimsical title early in the Mego label's storied catalog, their follow-up, Rechenkönig, was just not fun. And Potuznik's CD on the label was held back for years, an obvious stinker right out of the gate. Sandy: The 12-inches Sluta Leta put out on Mego, Cheap, and Chocolate Industries were lively, but I don't know if I should be commending the Swedes or the Austrians. Either way, this time, the record is named after a Swedish race car driver from the 70s, Ronnie Peterson. Ted: That's right, Sandy, they called him ""The King of Drift"" back in the day. Similarly, this disc is all over the place, causing horrendous accidents left and right. It starts with those damned digital skips that have become so routine, neither brutal enough to become the point nor long enough to be anything more than something left on the hard drive floor. That is, given that hard drive's don't have floors, per se... Dick: ""Forests of the Moon"" can't figure out what to do with its boom-tick, opting for faceless new-wave voice-overs, while ""Smakfull Basmusik"" can only muster up the most inane of stuttering canned beats, which it vomits up over and over and over again. It's too bad, as most of drummer DD Kern's peppy beats could power the thing alone. ""Yea Song"" is fun for its two-minute drive time, but that's before they decide to return to the gimpy glitches with ""Flash"". There's no hope of the disc getting steady after that. Ted: The noises themselves show that they're just not trying. That rubberband bass sound they resurrect on ""Vissna Bort"", while invoking all that is unholy, isn't as awful as the karaoke crooning that accompanies it. Sandy: The guest vocals are truly abysmal, be they by the Austrians or their friends. Remember, when you have guests on, or any special episodes, or you adopt a new child-character, that's a definite ""red flag"" for far deeper problems. ""Super Swede"" falls asleep on its digital accordion and programmed bongos while guest vocalist Catriona Shaw crawls through the mess. She makes it up on the backing vocals to ""Förjaga"", but by then it's much too late. Ted: Agreed. Maybe it's the writing by committee or something, but no one can figure out a direction, much less finish a track. Nothing is abrasive or abstract enough to work on those terms, and what intends to be danceable gets undercut by its own mischievous production. Sluta Leta, wherever they may be from, can't decide on a decent set of vocals or an ability to turn the half-baked beats into actual pop songs with catchy words. Sandy: And the surest sign of doom-- be it for television shows, recording groups, or music publications-- is when the writing goes down the tubes. There's no going back then.","Tonight, on a very special episode of Pitchfork Roundtable, a discussion about Austrian electronic label,\n\ Mego. Sitting in for ...

Fabula,Skyphone,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65e9d034d5c69bf3505/1:1/w_160/e8e3b335.jpg,2004-03-25 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7744-fabula/,Rune Grammofon,"By now, it's common knowledge that only a few laptop artists have the ability to connect with their audiences in a live setting. Thus far, in my experience, most mouse-draggers are unmasked on stage as composing non-visual video games for ""avant-garde"" adults. But there are a handful of electronic acts that fare well in the club, and judging from Fabula, Skyphone might be one of them. On their debut, the Danish laptop-rock trio mesh analog and digital with live and pre-recorded instruments, creating a lovely downtempo hybrid that milks interesting aspects from both approaches. Though this is a debut, the three have been acquainted musically/personally for some time, and have played in a number of rock bands prior to committing to Skyphone in 1999. They mention somewhere being inspired by glitch as well as 80s mood-rock and folk, and the rock interplay certainly establishes an enjoyable dynamic. A number of these 11 tracks share a vibe similar to Tape's recent release, Milieu, but Skyphone usher in a more digitally hermetic, sprawling sound. Sure to be at least generally enjoyed by fans of Boards of Canada, Matmos (especially The West), Four Tet, et. al., the band generally avoids generic laptopisms, managing to locate a sweetly naturalist groove within even the most drag/click tracks. Opener ""Monitor Batik"" mixes sounds by the dozen: Occasional radio hiss (or rain), tone patterns, toy bells (or xylophone), and the triad of delicate notes at song's end stand out clearly, unmarred by the detailed layers. Close listening illuminates abrupt/attenuated percussion, wind chimes, quavery sci-fi satellite tones, maybe even the lapping waves of an ocean. Otherwise, the strongest (and for some reason briefest) tracks flaunt the analog/digital disconnect. ""Cent Gauge""'s fluttery music box pulses, taps, and digital wind opens quietly to drifting folds of gently sunny psych-folk guitar. ""Into Hill Country"" similarly juxtaposes guitar strums with synthesized buzzes and sighs. A longer piece, ""Airtight Golem"", provides a bright patch of sun shadows and a diaphanous exhale layered over water-drop percussion, a quicker techno beat placed so far back in the mix you'll strain to grab its prettiness. Between the glories, though, are the ho-hum doldrums: ""Sinne Gas"" is run-of-the-mill besides the gentle interweaving of acoustic guitar, steel-drum style percussion, and rotating hiss. The pretty but vacant guitar pulses of ""In Our Time"" noodles here, flanges there, but doesn't budge. And in the end, this ability to multi-track ad infinitum makes me nostalgic for the more inventive punk rock splices pioneered by Marinetti, Schwitters, Cage, etc. I don't know, call me a Luddite, but there's something about making music on the same machine that orders your books, types your papers, and downloads your porn that just isn't all that sexy. I'm not necessarily calling for a return to a razor-blade and tape method (though many admirable composers still operate solely in that old-timey realm), but it seems to me that the intermittent use of real-life incisions amongst software-heavy compositions could bring something more to the music. My idealistic desire for naturalism aside, Skyphone certainly know to utilize space. And ultimately, it's Fabula's rich, uncluttered soundscape, as well as its sometimes darkened, brocade corners, that wins me over more often than not to those electro-acoustic charms.","By now, it's common knowledge that only a few laptop artists have the ability to connect with their audiences ...

Really, Pharrell Williams is no way a nerd. Not in the Eddie Deezen mold or the Harry Knowles mold or the Ramones mold. Debating the validity of Pharrell Williams' bandname seems like a contentious trifle, but the dude continuously positions himself as a wide-reaching musicologist. In the press, he seems convinced that merely mentioning the fact his record collection contains Steely Dan, Chick Corea, Stereolab, and EPMD coupled to his role as producer of tracks for the likes of Britney Spears and Philly's Most Wanted makes him a pop prodigy crossover messiah. The name ""N.E.R.D."" arrogantly admits to a higher IQ, while excusing Williams' potentially embarrassing prog-R&B; hybrid as a goofy cult experiment. Sadly, like a tackle-shocked J.O.C.K., Fly or Die is stupid and boring. Publicists limit their vocabulary to the Hall of Fame when thinking up superlative comparisons for their acts. One article alone already compared Fly or Die to Sly Stone, Frank Zappa, Queens of the Stone Age, Curtis Mayfield, The Beatles' Rubber Soul, and De La Soul's Three Feet High and Rising. No shit. Actually, it's not like two of the best albums ever made and three of the most brilliant people to ever record music. (Sorry, Josh Homme. Your band's mention is the 2004 way of saying ""it has loud guitars."") Oddly, Fly or Die finds the safe middle ground between Adam Ant's rumbling Burundi-drummed new-wave pop, Earth, Wind & Fire's digital elevator nightmare Raise!, and Lenny Kravitz's Folgers granule guitars. Pharrell croons, ""Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride,"" in the somehow standout track, ""She Wants to Move"". Let's assume N.E.R.D. are travelling around the Earth in this ass-ship at 299,985 kilometers per second. Inside, Pharrell, Chad Hugo, and the useless guy wear their ""astronaut suits from the BBC"" [""Jump""] and ramble through the entire album in its 44 minute runtime. Back on earth, we observe the ass-ship moving at 99.995% the speed of light broadcasting Fly or Die from speakers fixed into the ""exhaust port"" of the anatomically detailed craft. To the asstronauts inside, the album last 2640 seconds, but to the listeners on earth, that same album seems 3.05 days. And that's just relativity. Einstein never factored in two consecutive tracks on a record featuring whistling or two consecutive tracks growing so bored with themselves that they slip from their own unmelodic pop into introverted moebius jams concerned with fishing stories and sounding like Nile Rogers producing Gentle Giant. For a production team renowned for their bleating, percussive keyboards, the synthesizers here sound milkier than Vangelis. Forgetting the musical shortcomings for a moment, let's shift focus to Pharrell Williams' abysmal lyrics. ""Chariot of Fire"" begins, ""I wrote this song when I was drunk."" True or not, this is a no-win situation, lyrically speaking. Strike ""she,"" ""bad,"" ""ass,"" and George Carlin's 7 words from Pharrell's vocabulary and he's got nothing. There goes the entirety of ""Don't Worry About It"". Other lyrics rarely surpass the expletives of a dad stuck in traffic: ""Shit happens/ just blow it off."" ""Gonna make you feel rage."" ""Fuck 'em up."" ""Breakout/ Push people."" These are entire choruses and hardly fit the writing style of a supposed nerd. To further the point, Pharrell invites Hot Topic cosmetic counter explosion casualties Benji and Joel from Good Charlotte to ""spit"" on ""Jump"". The one that looks like your gay aunt's mascara brush whines, ""Hey, Dad/ Okay, Dad/ That's what you say, Da/ I never could obey Dad/ Punk rock tattoos/ Leather jacket/ Good grades don't come with that package."" Actually, this is the most academic the album gets. Who is that kid fooling? He's more B's and C's than CBGB's. In trying to expand their sound beyond commercial hip-hop, N.E.R.D. has exposed both the shortcomings and silver linings of the genre. Taking the simple chest-beating, booty-humping themes of club hits into overproduced Phish-rock territory merely exposes their offensive banality. Expanding the minimal, percussive rhythms of turntables to florid, multi-layered studio fusion rock only underscores the power of economy. And that's in the ""spartan production"" sense, not the ""Pharrell Williams' presents The Billionaire Boys Club Clothing Line"" sense. Each track is bloated and soft like Morgalis' middle, and waxed clean of texture like Ricardi's back. Though Pharrell Williams poised himself at the center of millions of people's attention, he's spilled his head to show nothing but unsharpened pencils. The last year has seen The Neptunes beat themselves into tired ubiquity. For every ""Milkshake"" or ""Bubble"", there are ten ""Change Clothes"" or ""Frontin'"". Fly or Die was their appropriately titled chance to evolve beyond staccato acoustic guitars, bongos, and robot synths and stake their claim as true personalities in music. Sadly, when left to their own devices they seem more fascinated by the opening clang of ""Purple Haze"", yet technically unable to reproduce any other element of Hendrix's playing, style or impact. They need the pop tarts dropped into their toaster. On their own, N.E.R.D. are the hip-hop Toto. And the nerdiest thing about Pharrell Williams is that he probably takes that as a compliment.","True thirty year-old nerds:

Madvillainy,Madvillain,by: Rollie Pemberton & Nick Sylvester,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c458ea9e61561daa811a/1:1/w_160/0bc6101d.jpg,2004-03-25 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/,Stones Throw,"Madvillainy, one of the most anticipated releases in underground rap history, happens to parallel one of the most anticipated arrivals in comic book history: the short-lived Amalgam Comics label. As the name implied, the Amalgam Universe brought together the two most dominant and popular comic factions-- Marvel and DC-- and all of their respective characters, styles and quirks. The long-awaited collaboration between producer/emcees Madlib and MF Doom, Madvillainy is the Infinity Gauntlet of rap, a tense mainstream-meets-indie, avant-meets-antique melee that, as the opening sample suggests, plays on a ""seminal connection that audiences can relate their experience in life with the villains and their dastardly doings."" ""MADVILLAIN: RETARDED HARD COPY"" In November 2002, Otis Jackson, Jr. (aka Madlib) went south to Brazil on business. For the trip, he compiled two mix CDs of beats and unfinished tracks: one stored his collaborations with Detroit's Jay Dee; the second held work with Brooklyn's Daniel Dumile (aka MF Doom). As a true testament to both fidelity's fragility and the power of file-sharing, both discs leaked a few months later, giving birth to a logical buzz, but more importantly, heightening expectations to impossible heights; these demos were pretty fucking tight. If ""Peeyano Keys"" and ""Powerball #5"" were just rough drafts, what could be expected of the completed project? Undoubtedly, Madlib and Doom felt the pressure. The leak seemed to be a huge kick in the ass, especially for Madlib, who in the past few years has been garnering the reputation of being brilliant and prolific, but distracted: His Blunted in the Bomb Shelter mix (rumored to have been concocted in less than a day), Blue Note-sampling Shades of Blue, and even the Jaylib collaboration are fresh, but sloppy and often unfocused. Madvillainy is anything but: The samples are smart and never played-out, and the production and rhymes reveal a determined sense of cooperation, as Doom spouts off his most brilliant lyrical change-ups and production-conscious playoffs. ""Wild guess, you can say he stay sedated."" One of the noticeable differences between the unauthorized promo and the final burn of the album is a change in vocal tone from Doom, which has shifting from an excited, measured performance to a slower, scratchier and ultimately better-suited delivery, considering Madlib's low-key, bass-oriented production. Some people take the new chilled delivery as somehow inferior to the old incarnation, but taken in context, the album benefits from the re-recording, particularly in cases were Doom re-arranges couplets to optimize his punchlines (""Meat Grinder"") or adds new lines altogether (""Figaro""). ""Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion."" Doom's acknowledgement of Madlib's accordion sample (the same one Daedelus used on 2002's Invention) is the most obvious instance of Madvillainy's lyrics/production integrity, but the album is chock full of them. For a collaboration which the duo has described as something ""like a telepathy thing. There wasn't a lot of talking,"" Madlib and Doom, proponents of two distinctive hip-hop styles, are of one unusually strong mind. ""Mad plays the bass like the race card."" The axis of Madvillainy is Otis Jackson Jr.'s production. While Doom's entire career has been shadowed by consistently strong production efforts, never has such chemistry developed between him and another beatmaker. From the unbelievable Castlevania-meets-Rocky & Bullwinkle piano chase music of ""Supervillain Theme"" to the shifting keyboard jazz suite of ""Great Day"" to the dark chamber bass, timbales and jump-cut ukulele plucks of ""Meat Grinder"", Madlib proves himself as much more than just a loop digger, topping his best work on Quasimoto's The Unseen with an album of consistently incredible beat work. And it isn't just the beats that make the partnership work so well: The character of his vocal samples and the smoothness of his song-to-song segues make this album individual to the styles of both artists-- a difference that puts this pairing far ahead of similarly talented teams like Rjd2 and Blueprint's Soul Position. ""Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in."" Both Doom's and Madlib's myriad aliases make sparkling cameo appearances on Madvillainy, most notably on ""America's Most Blunted"", in which Madlib bickers with alter-ego Quasimoto, and on ""Fancy Clown"", which features Dumile as Viktor Vaughn. Here, Vaughn steams on an ex-girlfriend's unfaithfulness-- but she's cheating with Metalface, another Dumile alias. It's a brilliant conceit, and perhaps makes ""Fancy Clown"" hip-hop's first schizophrenic self-diss track. ""Hey you: Don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it."" Okay, so maybe that's a little harsh. Although the guest appearances from the Stones Throw massive are Jackson Jr.'s take on label-based self-aggrandizement, they never disrupt the album's flow, and never say anything too stupid (Medaphoar even garners a laugh on ""Raid"" with, ""My niggas take 'no' like Kobe""). Still, it helps that these extraneous verses are few and far between; most listeners would likely have preferred an additional Doom cut instead, or at least an appearance from Doom's Monsta Island Czars. ""Spit so many verses, sometimes my jaw twitches/ One thing this party could use is more... booze."" When much of the underground often aspires to Truth and Something Bigger, Madlib and Doom have always seemed content to be quirky through and through, lightly roasting themselves and subverting the genre itself to brilliant effect. Like in the above quote from ""Great Day"": The rhyme's pattern and rap's topical stereotype demands the word ""bitches,"" yet Doom hilariously says ""booze"" instead. Or on ""Money Folder"", in which Doom starts off, ""Don't mind me, I won't just rhyme lightly off of two or three Heinies,"" but flips beers to babes midway: ""And boy was they fine, G: One black, one Spanish, one Chi-nee."" ""The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard."" Madvillainy is inexhaustibly brilliant, with layer-upon-layer of carefully considered yet immediate hip-hop, forward-thinking but always close to its roots. Madlib and Doom are individually at their most refined here, and together, they've created one of the most exciting blockbuster alliances in the underground to date. Good luck finding a better hip-hop album this year, mainstream, undie, or otherwise.

'Merican EP,Descendents,by: Christopher Sebela,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6cabf31b7dc7155aab/1:1/w_160/7d548149.jpg,2004-03-25 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2546-merican-ep/,Fat Wreck Chords,"If you've read any reviews of The Descendents' new EP, 'Merican, you'll likely have encountered a long rundown of dozens of other Descendents songs that these five songs are bound to remind you of. You'll also notice that no one finds this to be a problem, and are more giddy because they can draw stylistic lines back to the band's 80s catalog of awkwardness, alienation and food fetishism. For an industry where originality and an easily charted career transformation are paramount, The Descendents ease under the wire by dint of pure, untarnished love. With albums as flawless as Liveage! and Milo Goes to College, and a mission statement that lacks the words ""reshaping"" and ""new era,"" The Descendents have never made any bones about being desperately teenage, despite the creep of years, family and, in Milo Aukerman's case, an actual career. If their songs aren't dwelling on shitty parenting skills or unrequited affection, they're mocking the customs of the adult world and reveling in juvenilia. So 'Merican might come as a bit of a jab to the hardcore fan who always assumed they could count on at least one punk band to never change. ""Nothing with You"" opens the album as a sigh of contentment over the laziness of true love, only breaking the illusion of a lost 80s master by mention of Mad About You and Seinfeld re-runs. Everything's in place on this song, from Aukerman's pleading vocals to Stephen Egerton's quick and tidy solo, and it resonates as strongly and vividly as anything they've recorded previously. But the following title song is like nothing they've done before. Unfortunately, it is a lot like what Bad Religion's done before: It sounds like that band soft shoeing a typical dismantling of the pretty picture of Americana. To be fair, The Descendents take a softer tone, listing the bad (racism, Joe McCarthy) alongside the good (Mark Twain, Otis Redding) which makes the song more about knowing the country you love before you slide down the steep slope of jingoism. An admirable effort, the song is a bright red flashing signal that the train has left the tracks. The Descendents pick up the torch and tighten the slack with the other side of their love-song coin on the lost/never-had song ""Here with Me"", and they carry the momentum with a kinetic resignation letter in ""I Quit"". As Aukerman laments time not spent with his wife and the encroaching caricature of a Mick Jagger-aged rocker, the band seems to barely take a breath. It's a near-perfect capper on the stalwarts' first statement in seven years, and would that the album was as long as advertised. But then the hidden track, ""Alive"", starts in, chasing out all the fans who stuck through the culture shock of the title track. Being that ""slow"" and ""heavy"" are another two styles The Descendents have never dabbled in, the wall of sound-- complete with thorazine vocals and depressed riffs-- verges on smashing the band's already battered illusion. Like the title track, the closer's message suggests that four guys in their 40s singing hymns to teenage love and caffeinated excess is the sanest choice to make.","If you've read any reviews of The Descendents' new EP, 'Merican, you'll likely have encountered a long rundown ...

Once You Go Blak,Baby Blak,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44cea9e61561daa4e90/1:1/w_160/a5529f09.jpg,2004-03-25 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1102-once-you-go-blak/,Rapster!K7,"The line between commercial and independent rap is drawn in the sand through a complex labyrinth of ideological choices, production styles and conceptual decisions. But in the case of rappers like Cormega, Saigon and Murs, the line is blurred by the conflict of their unapologetically accessible subject matter and the dedicated individuality missing from your average mixtape emcee. Baby Blak is one of the newest rappers to take on this often inconsistent paradigm with his debut Once You Go Blak, a pleasantly atypical mix of common vocal influences. Baby Blak doesn't break much ground on his first record: He raps about ill friendship, catching bad breaks in life, his various sexual partners, and childhood. But considering his more accessible style and his Philadelphia accent, you wouldn't necessarily expect songs about peace and economic structure. Blak's style is understated and subtle, with a constantly shifting flow and a lean towards repetition that seems to be a way of connecting the dots to other Philly artists (Beanie Sigel, Freeway, Black Thought). The only times the album's structure goes to the wayside is when Blak randomly and consistently references his dick or others'. Practically every song has a reference to the third leg with at least two songs containing vivid imagery regarding the subject at hand. Maybe it isn't as noticeable for other people, but I totally lost focus whenever a woodblock sound would follow up the reference, because if that sound is supposed to represent the performance of fellatio, it sounds like someone's doing it wrong. Either way, Baby Blak is impressive on the mic, especially on his anti-materialist anthem, ""Diamonds (Diemon)"". Riding what sounds like a smoothly chopped Final Fantasy sample, Blak details the diamond-processing industry and the crimes committed to gain these emblems of success. He criticizes the distributors of these products (""Jacob don't love us, Tito don't love us"") and attacks the diamond-mining industry (""Made into slaves, in the caves, working all night/ So you can brag on what you paid, rocking your ice"") in a creative stab at conscious lyricism, making for one of a few major standouts on the album. At first listen, Baby Blak comes off as the type of rapper that DJ Premier would gravitate toward. Depending on who you ask, that can be a compliment (Nas, Guru) or an insult (Group Home). Although the production on this record lacks big names or major shifts in style, the beatmakers ultimately keep this album afloat. There's an obvious tilt towards jazzy textures and ethereal chops, ranging from the low-toned Roots-esque bass groove of ""Fallin' Down"", to the echoing organ, bongos and piano stabs of ""Tasters Choice"", to the anthemic orchestral chops of ""Starvin' Artist"". Sure, there's a definite lack of larger sounds and bombastic samples (especially for a rapper who could dominate the mixtape freestyle arena), but the production works to the positive side of the spectrum. Baby Blak has some derivative subject matter, a couple of dry beats and occasionally questionable lines, but overall, he largely defies expectations. For a rapper I'd expected would regularly contradict himself throughout his record, he never really does-- the true victory for any vaguely commercial emcee. For those in the market for an intriguing style of rap with chill beats and memorable lines, Baby Blak is a name to look into.","The line between commercial and independent rap is drawn in the sand through a complex labyrinth of ideological choices, production ...

Almost Killed Me,The Hold Steady,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c153eb335119a49ed546/1:1/w_160/4c2e475e.gif,2004-03-24 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3976-almost-killed-me/,Frenchkiss,"Born from the ashes of Minneapolis' beloved Lifter Puller, The Hold Steady emerge as a bar band far too good for the bars, a spectacular mess of sprawling guitar, ferocious vocals, and well-channeled, raucous irritation. Former Lifter Puller vocalist Craig Finn and bassist Tad Kubler (now on lead guitar) are now ably backed by Galin Polivka and Judd Counsell, and their collective spew is awfully impressive: Earnest without being sentimental, and authentic without sounding contrived, The Hold Steady are one of the most convincing rock bands to emerge in recent years, a can-crushing throwdown of unadulterated aggression and ear-splitting amps. Which is not to say they don't push an intellectual agenda: ""Hold Steady"" is more than a bandname, it's a self-fulfilling mantra, invoked repeatedly for casual assurance in the face of social/societal disgust (""All you sniffling indie kids/ Hold Steady/ All the clustered-up clever kids/ Hold Steady""). Thus: The Hold Steady are the anti-trucker hat, the anti-laptop, the anti-West-Virginia-t-shirt. And they rock without repent. Finn's lyrics and delivery are the crux of The Hold Steady, skewering whole characters and lifestyles with unapologetic aplomb. Boasting all the seething, pent-up fervor of someone who's been talk-singing for nearly a decade, Finn expertly shoots his lyrical barbs like little arrows, knocking down and dismantling everything from recreational drugs and the tech boom to bartenders and jukebox codes, all in a familiar, half-smirking growl. The Hold Steady stand staunchly opposed to youthfully misappropriated irony, and Almost Killed Me contains countless glorious allusions to scenesters being stupid: Check ""Barfruit Blues""' testimonial that the ""Clever kids are killing me/ For one, they ain't that clever.../ This was supposed to be a party,"" or the presumably anti-electroclash dig, ""The 80s almost killed me/ Let's not recall 'em quite so fondly."" Without explicitly finger-pointing to disaffected Brooklynites, or pissing in his own backyard (Finn and Kubler relocated to Brooklyn in 2000), Finn inadvertently derides the kids in plastic bracelets and yellow leather armbands, swinging their arms to fleeting retro jams; obviously, it would be just as easy (if not more so) to counterattack Finn and friends for equally absurd purist-posturing, but The Hold Steady are just so unbearably good at what they do-- and listeners are all inevitably persuaded that the only reasonable thing to do is throw your hair around and chug. Like any decent barstool poet or rock frontman, Finn can sometimes prod your patience (see ""Knuckles""' instantly-tiring holler of ""I been tryin' to get people to call me Sunny D/ 'Cause I got the good stuff kids go for!""), or lock himself into periodic lyrical ruts, relying on exhaustive semiotics (see various permutations of: ""Lots of people call me,"" ""I'm trying to get people to call me,"" ""My name is _________, but people call me _________"") to convey his vague cultural dissociation. But Finn's glib repetitions can be ridiculously fun, given the preposterous amount of genuinely clever bits streaming out of his mouth. And, like any good bar buddy, Finn always buys your next drink. If Finn's snarky words aren't sufficiently indicting for your hipster-hating self, Tad Kubler's riffage is gory enough to disembowel whole synth-pop bands. Spastically invoking a wide array of historically grinding axmen (from Mott the Hoople's Mick Ralphs to perennial favorite Slash), Kubler mercilessly noodles his way around Finn's toothy monologues; there's an instant disconnect between the vocals and the instrumentation that's enormously compelling, with Finn's sprawling dissertations pausing only to let Kubler scream, each element sidestepping the other in service of a common mission. Ultimately, The Hold Steady end up sounding like a bizarre amalgamation of Lifter Puller and Bruce Springsteen & The E-Street Band; when they're done with their assault, there's blood on the stage and everyone pours sweat. Just not from dancing.","Born from the ashes of Minneapolis' beloved Lifter Puller, The Hold Steady emerge as a bar band far too good ...

Give,The Bad Plus,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a42dea9e61561daa4e44/1:1/w_160/4281f685.jpg,2004-03-24 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1075-give/,Columbia,"I first heard The Bad Plus' breakthrough major label debut, These Are the Vistas, before reading Stuart Nicholson's article in Jazz Times, which called the record ""one of the most important... to appear in more than a decade."" I wouldn't encounter those outlandish words until much later, after developing a bulletproof affection for the group, which no underhanded assailment of their big-league marketing histrionics and neo-fakebook verbiage could derail. At that point, I agreed wholeheartedly with Nicholson's sentiments, and consciously chose to ignore their implications. Months earlier, These Are the Vistas had been foisted upon me by my dad, of all people, who brought it to my attention after hearing the Midwestern jazzbos' zippy rendition of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" on NPR. Never mind that the Old Man confused the album title with the bandname, and introduced The Bad Plus to me as ""The Vistas, or something""; I was impressed by his ear for new music. It could have been The Mars Volta he was crushing on for all I cared-- intrepid spirit is a rare attribute among AARP cardholders. Upon giving the disc an inaugural whirl, my feelings morphed from mere family pride into Gollum-like covetousness, and I've guarded our copy ever since, much to my dad's displeasure. Well, Dad, here's payback. This one you can keep. Give, the band's follow-up, suffers from a paucity of original ideas. Even its best moments sound like an amateurish reiteration of These Are the Vistas' quasi-jazz anarchy. Pundits who pilloried that album for failing to situate itself decisively in either jazz or rock might actually have an argument here, as songs like ""1979 Semi-Finalist"" lack the slightest personality. Whereas even Vistas' most ambiguous numbers were sustained on the strength of the group's playing alone, much of Give's material comes off as unprovocative novelty. ""Cheney Piñata"" seeks to redefine the Cha-Cha, but falls flat on David King's galling polyrhythms and Ethan Iverson's cheeky piano melody. Similarly, ""Layin' a Strip for the Higher-Self State"" experiments with the New Orleans blues shuffle by removing the blues, the shuffle, and the rugged sophistication of New Orleans-style playing. Then, of course, there are the covers, a penchant for which earned The Bad Plus ample fame on Vistas. While a good cover will merely testify to the greatness of the original, a great one will invade the memory of its elder and stamp a new identity in the listener's mind. The group's take on Nirvana's mainstream flagship was, without question, a great cover, managing to stand apart from the original as a substantive piece of art. Unfortunately, none of the covers on Give pack the same gusto. Nor, for that matter, do they even match Vistas' lesser interpretations of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" and Aphex Twin's ""Flim"". Here, the underspoken emotionality of the Pixies' ""Velouria"" is asphyxiated by Iverson's grandiose pounding and King's madcap drumming. Conversely, other songs are too consciously delicate, bypassing tasteful and heading straight for stilted. Even Give's most boisterous moments, including a key-hopping take on Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"", are genteel. At times, Iverson's upper-octave twinkling sounds like The Sims' theme music. Other treasured aspects of These Are the Vistas have either been mishandled this time out by Tchad Blake's close-to-the-vest production, or are just missing altogether. On a rendition of Ornette Coleman's ""Street Woman"", Reid Anderson hypnotically recreates token phrases from his spectacular solo on Vistas' ""Keep the Bugs Off Your Glass and the Bears Off Your Ass"", only here, he shares the spotlight with an overzealous King. And unlike on Vistas, the original compositions on Give feel limp and underdeveloped, as if rushed to meet a record company deadline. One of the more commonly lodged complaints about Vistas was simply that it was so vehemently and lucratively backed by a major label. But those of us who managed to get past the superficial reasons to dislike The Bad Plus, and deigned to try something from Columbia, were doubtless glad we did. Unfortunately, Give only serves to validate the band's senseless gadflies. If a requirement for having an album attain ""essential"" status, in any genre, is proving that it wasn't a happy accident, The Bad Plus have put These Are the Vistas at a serious disadvantage.","I first heard The Bad Plus' breakthrough major label debut, These Are the Vistas, before reading\n\ Stuart Nicholson's ...

"Greatest Hits, Vol. 3",Wesley Willis,by: Jedediah Gilchrist,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa9013d1975652139a6e/1:1/w_160/2a4273ad.jpg,2004-03-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8770-greatest-hits-vol-3/,Alternative Tentacles,"At one time, it seemed there were only two ways to digest a Wesley Willis record: as a bizarre, comical farce, or as a chronicle of a man's battle with schizophrenia. I've since found that there's a happy medium between the two, but when I first became acquainted with his music, my appreciation was firmly planted in the former category. It was 1996 when I first came across Willis' Greatest Hits, Vol. 1, and it instantly struck me as among the funniest, most absurd things I'd ever heard. I marveled at the similarity between every song, each clearly run through a bargain-basement Casio with preset melodies. I reveled in Wesley's impromptu rants and sound effects. But most of all, I was struck by the way Wesley chose to end every song with an advertising slogan. Surely, this was the work of a comedic genius. For most, the novelty quickly wore off, but rather than returning to my shelf to be forgotten, the album inched its way into my regular rotation, much as William Shatner's The Transformed Man had the summer before. Intermixed with Pulp, Morphine and Pavement, it was easier to take Wesley's work more as music than comedy. I began to develop a strange appreciation for his twisted stories, and to see that this man, despite his failings, possessed an earnest musical vision, and was determined to foist it upon the world, ready or not. So keep in mind that it's as a fan that I assign this album a 4.6. For those of us who range from casual admirers to Wesleynauts, Greatest Hits, Vol. 3 simply serves up more of the same stuff we've come to oddly enjoy, which is unfortunate given the volume of music he produced in his lifetime. Wesley's songs traditionally fall into a finite number of categories, and the material on Vol. 3, compiled by longtime friend Jello Biafra, offers no real exceptions to the rule. There are odes to popular venues (""Viper Room"", ""Wrigley Field""), tributes to heroes (""Oprah Winfrey"", ""Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers""), and surreal lyrical and sonic experiments (""If"", ""Suck a Polar Bear's Dick""). Some of the latter delve more into the realm of the bizarre than his previous offerings (""Make My Joyplane Crash and Burn"", for instance, features modulated vocals reminiscent of early Ween), while much of the record's second half features lo-fi demos, as well as his varied work with both The Fiasco and The Dragnews. Unfortunately, too many tracks pop up to simply retread old ground. On ""Your Way Right Away"", Wesley rehashes ""Rock 'n' Roll McDonalds"" with Burger King instead, and ""I Whipped Spiderman's Ass"" once again pits Wesley against the superhero du jour. These poor choices undermine what little novelty remains this far into Wesley's career. Like his previous collections, Vol. 3's strongest moments are Wesley's most intimate, when he writes about events in his daily life like an entry from some demented diary. On tracks like ""My Keyboard Got Damaged"" and ""I'm Going on a World Tour"", Wesley's spoken lyrics reveal how disjointed and tortured the life of a schizophrenic can be. ""Verbal Assault"" recounts a number of times during which he's been unintentionally disruptive when riding the bus: ""Just as when I was listening to my rock and roll, a mean schizophrenia voice whipped my ass with profanity... Suddenly, I started to rave at the bus driver, calling him a jerk."" Naturally, these rants can seem absurdly hilarious at first, but with time, one can get past that and recognize the sadness of these stories. As most Pitchfork readers know, Wesley lost his battle with leukemia late last year at the age of 40. In that respect, Greatest Hits, Vol. 3 serves just as well as any of Wesley's previous efforts as a showcase for his unique vision. But for those who've followed his story and music since his Alternative Tentacles debut, there's little new ground here. Surely, some new and interesting sounds could have been culled from his hundreds upon hundreds of recorded songs; instead, we're left with a record that is, for a Wesley Willis album, relatively by the book.","At one time, it seemed there were only two ways to digest a Wesley Willis record: as a bizarre, comical ...

The Troubled Sleep of Piano Magic / Saint Marie EP,Piano Magic,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06ab1335d7bf1697ff3/1:1/w_160/d25f3527.jpg,2004-03-24 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11802-the-troubled-sleep-of-piano-magic-saint-marie-ep/,Green UFOs,"It's a good thing this review isn't a comedy sketch or a joke, because when it comes to timing, it's as far off as it could be: Whoever heard of reviewing a Piano Magic album in the first week of spring, when one would be least likely to listen to the band? The chilly, ghostly sounds of Piano Magic are so suited to crisp, thin air and falling leaves or snow that the group named their exquisite singles compilation Seasonlly Affective. Ironically, then, ""Out of season, out of heart"" is the first line on The Troubled Sleep of Piano Magic, the band's seventh album and first for Spanish label Green UFOs. Of course, frontman Glen Johnson is referring to a rapidly fading summer love, rather than his music, but you can hear his wink and nod. In another sense, however, this album follows the typical springtime arcs of renewal and re-emergence, coming after the most disappointing stretch of Piano Magic's career to date. Among the things that may have kept Piano Magic lying awake at night was a rather fruitless relationship with 4AD. On paper, it made all the sense in the world: Gorgeous, baroque artist meets top purveyors of atmospheric, dreamy pop. However, the results-- Son de Mar, the score to a Bigas Luna film, and career nadir Writers Without Homes-- were mixed, at best. Fortunately, these low-key releases return to both the quality and mood of previous Piano Magic records without sounding like a retreat or a retread. Delicately weaving organic and electronic instruments with spectral, detached vocals from Johnson and others (most notably Klima's Angele David-Guillou), The Troubled Sleep is another collection of spellbinding ruminations on loss and unrequited love. Recorded with a six-piece band, the album is probably the most rock-oriented record Johnson has ever made, carrying tinges of the brooding guitar work of Nick Cave, Low, and The Dirty Three, and its fragility-- plucking acoustic guitars often meet gently throbbing rhythms amidst spacious, almost desolate soundscapes-- belies the emotional disquiet that runs through the best of Johnson's work. The more rock-oriented approach doesn't always play to Johnson's strengths, but it might appeal to a wider audience than his (often far better) musicbox electronics. From the solitary, distant cry to ""Help Me Warm This Frozen Heart"", to the almost Southern gothic desperation of ""Speed the Road, Rush the Lights"", to the haunting (and unexpected) release of ""Luxembourg Gardens"", Johnson escapes his tendency to tempt a listener's mind to wander over the course of a sometimes monolithic record. Despite whispers that The Troubled Sleep would be the final Piano Magic record, the band recently returned to its more typically rewarding format-- the single-- with the 26-minute, six-song Saint Marie EP. Here, the title track is re-recorded with Low's Alan Sparhawk replacing Johnson on vocals with slightly disappointing results. Fortunately, Sparhawk's other guest performance, on the surprisingly menacing ""Wrong Turn"", is much more rewarding. That track is also one of two that has Johnson reunited with folk star Vashti Bunyan, whom he coaxed out of a lengthy retirement to sing on Writers Without Homes. More a return to a traditional Piano Magic sonics than a full band setup, Saint Marie features a trio of instrumentals and additional guest work by Cornershop's Ben Ayres (on tamboura) and Swedish harpist Linnea Malmberg. At turns elegiac and fierce, the EP is a reminder that short sketches play to one of Johnson's greatest strengths: excavating and expressing sentiment and emotion. With these two release, there is, for the first time in a few years, a wealth of Piano Magic material worth mining.","

Greatest Palace Music,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a8c0084474cd0c00bf/1:1/w_160/6096cba1.jpg,2004-03-23 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/702-greatest-palace-music/,Drag City,"The first country record I ever bought was Merle Haggard's 16 Biggest Hits. Splattered into a harrowing dustbowl of depravity, deprivation, and deliverance, I quickly found myself placing it on that hallowed shelf of ""My Ten Favorite Records."" The following year, I played it for some country aficionados who proudly informed me that these were miserably smooth 1994 re-recordings of Haggard's work in the 60s. I sought out a different collection, realized my error, agreed that 16 Biggest Hits was indeed not far from a travesty, and learned that, though my country naiveté, I had deceived myself. I bring this up for a few reasons: Because hopefully those who fell into Will Oldham's recordings solely through his indie rock connections may enjoy this album for its (seemingly) novel production; and perhaps, through it, find their way to someone like Chet Atkins, Faron Young, or Kris Kristofferson. Despite Drag City's lofty press releases or Rolling Stone's perplexed reviews, everyone from Son House to Black Flag has covered themselves under the guise of fresh stylizations and trappings. It was not a crazy idea then, and it is not a crazy idea now. Just a bad one. I wanted to bring some personal nostalgia into this review in order to quell my present discomfort with Greatest Palace Music. Greatest Palace Music is the long-awaited album of sauntering, weightlifting, sugar-coated covers of Will Oldham's work as Palace. The tracklist was selected via fan poll. The cover is a bizarre, expressionist jumble of lakes and lacerated rainbows. The players include such legendary Nashville muscle as Hargus ""Pig"" Robbins and Eddie Bayers. Its renditions are often syrupy, bombastic, truckin'-through-McDonalds, barrel-hoppin' blitzes, delivered in a voice that creaks and secretes sincerity. And it does this even as it seems to revel in mocking, I-can't-believe-you-morons-are-actually-listening-to-this production that mechanically smoothes out any soulful, or even human, perturbations with the slightest chance of sneaking through the sheen. I fancy myself of average intellect and, frankly, the album is entirely bewildering. It's perhaps the most entertaining and thought-provoking album released so far this year. And one of the worst. Thankfully, its allure is easily experienced without ever having to actually listen to it. It's as much of a concept album and process work as any German micro-improv-musique-concrete release in print these days, and it should simply be framed and given a state-sponsored museum tour. The enjoyment it doles out is entirely extramusical, deriving from its packaging, its contributors, Nashville history, Oldham's interviews pertaining to it, its place in his discography, and his intent, whatever that may have been. Greatest Palace Music is almost uniformly tedious, uneventful, dispassionate, and overambitious when it comes to multi-tracking, and underambitious when it comes to arrangements and instrumentation. Except that, at the same time, it never feels anything but essential. Its paradox of earnestness and pranking is relentless, jarring, and (unintentionally?) amusing. And though none of us are in a position to guess Oldham's intent, one hypothesis might be that the album was intended to befuddle, muddle, and generally piss off listeners' expectations; and, therefore, if you indeed detest it (as you probably should), you're actually one of its biggest advocates. Maleficent and resentful hatred should greet this album, and if it does, well, we've got something of a classic on our hands. Unfortunately, through some trick of fate, this mischievous and contradictory art took the form of music (at least superficially), and I am a music critic. The standard procedure now would be to contrast these new versions with the original Palace hits, which might be impossible. Murmurs around my Internet database suggest that ""now we can finally find out if Oldham's songwriting skills stand up without the stark atmospherics."" Well, based on Greatest Palace Music, they absolutely collapse. ""New Partner"", probably the greatest moment on Viva Last Blues, and one of the best recordings of Oldham's career, is sieved through jingoistic guitar that veers to the brink of schmaltz and back again. Elated vocals bounce down a wedding-march keyboard. The background vocals are resigned and remote. And when Oldham sings, ""You're always on my mind,"" his voice is so unconvincingly impermeable and tuneless that it lacks any of its previous resonance. Oldham's delivery doesn't imply his usual trepidation and reluctance before death or love, but rather echoes the way people sound when they're waiting in line. Albums like Days in the Wake or I See a Darkness were propelled by hobbling, fitful marches, and smothered by brazen minor chord blasts. And there are moments on Greatest Palace Music (""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"", ""The Brute Choir"") of stark emotion; gaps and holes occasionally filled with light; a fragmented voice grafted onto the back of Oldham's haggard head; where even the slide solo is condensed and whimpering. But, for the most part, the shambling, stately pallbearer pace is replaced with a bouncing, undeviating, and totally inappropriate luster. ""Gulf Shores"" climbs toward a swarm of overlapping voices in perfect harmony, robotically in sync. On ""Pushkin"", Oldham preaches The Word with a shell-shocked, Appalachian puberty that caricatures itself, and holds its springing slow-jazz drabness in contempt. It's not just polished; it's fabricated, deceitful, condescending, belittling. It's a trick upon the audience and the band itself. Why would anyone inflict these cruel shenanigans upon an unsuspecting audience? How could it possibly affect or motivate its listeners? By making this album, it feels as if Oldham is scorning me, a longtime fan, personally. It's ceaselessly mediocre, and it actually physically hurts me to know that Oldham has backpedaled, knowingly and irrationally, against his own genius. Yet, it's precisely in the listener's painful struggle-- the reaction to the artist's self-annihilation, devastating arrogance, and backstabbing repugnance-- that this record finds its wisdom and radiance.

In the Fishtank 11,The Black Heart ProcessionSolbakken,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e59d034d5c69bf2cd0/1:1/w_160/520d34a5.jpg,2004-03-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/765-in-the-fishtank-11/,Touch and GoKonkurrent,"Somewhere in the great filing cabinet of rock is a bulging manila folder marked ""great ideas,"" and right behind it is a somewhat less bulging file marked ""great outcomes."" Keep searching, and you'll also find a huge, tattered file called ""mixed results,"" and that's where you'll undoubtedly find a cache of documents on Konkurrent's In the Fishtank series. The idea is surely a great one: Grab one or two bands as they tour through the Netherlands, put them in the studio for a couple of days together, give them the run of the place, and release the results on an EP. Those results, however, vary wildly in quality. This is the eleventh In the Fishtank release, and it's become clear as the series has progressed that this process doesn't work for everybody-- Willard Grant Conspiracy & Telefunk, in particular, couldn't get an interesting record together-- but when the bands are roughly of a piece with each other (Low & The Dirty Three, or Motorpsycho & Jaga Jazzist, for instance), it can produce fascinating, even excellent music. I confess that I know very little about Dutch prog trio Solbakken-- I couldn't even lazily look them up on All Music Guide, because they don't have an entry-- but from what I can gather from limited audio samples, they subordinated themselves almost completely to their sparring partners: This procession is decidedly black-hearted in every respect. Black Heart Procession have been riding an upward quality arc ever since their debut, culminating in 2002's masterful expansion on their sound, Amore del Tropico. And while this EP doesn't approach such great peaks, it also proves they're in no mood to revisit the persistently inky American primitive terrain their initial trio of numbered LPs trod upon. That's not to say things are getting all sunshine and lollipops in the Black Hearts camp, but the sound they've settled on here is the most reverberant I've heard from them. This is perhaps one of the biggest values of a series like this-- its casual, off-the-cuff nature shows sides of bands that perhaps even the members themselves didn't realize existed. From minute one to thirty-four, the EP is dominated by the heavy piano of Black Heart Procession's Tobias Nathaniel, who does the most to shape the music's tone and color. Black Heart vocalist Paulo Zappoli (formerly known as Pall Jenkins) hides in towers of reverb, but it's startling how much range he shows here, relative to the average Black Heart Procession album, letting himself employ a gentler delivery than usual on several tracks. Guest vocalist Rachael Rose (she's not in either band) complements him nicely with a spoken French monologue on opener ""Voiture in Rouge"", and amidst the billowing, romantic piano parts, it's criminally sensual. The EP's most impressive achievement, though, is ""Things Go On with Mistakes"", a 10-minute thriller propelled by both bands' drummers. This is the most obviously collaborative composition, building up from a chorused bassline and sparse guitar, and eventually spilling over with piano, organ, guitar and hyperactive percussion. It's songs like this that illustrate the full potential of the Fishtank, and make a case that the project's ""great outcomes"" folder might one day grow larger than the ""great ideas"" one.

Mushi No-ne,No. 9,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96a9d034d5c69bf51fd/1:1/w_160/f37d3ba6.jpg,2004-03-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5894-mushi-no-ne/,Locust,"Before Beck decided on the title of Odelay, he joked with Rolling Stone that he was considering Robot Jazz as a working title, riffing on the record's stiff 1's and 0's swinging between the beats. Gazing at the complex grid of squares, triangles, and parallelograms that interstice the rippling razor grass on the cover of Joe Takayuki's stateside debut, Mushi No-ne (roughly translated: ""sound of insects""), Beck's quip is less a joke and more a reality in this age, thankfully realized by artists like Takayuki who pull off the juxtaposition effortlessly. As rigorous as the discipline of this music appears to have been in the past, a recent spate of releases from Onkyo-based players like Tetuzi Akiyama, Toshimaru Nakamura, and Ami Yoshida suggest that the silence which informs most of the city's music is more a sieve, allowing all sorts of other referential music to sift in, while at the same time keeping the focus squarely on soundspace. As No. 9, Takayuki mixes abstract jazz-- in the tradition of Eric Dolphy, Bobby Hutcherson, and Tony Williams in their Blue Note days-- with field recordings, then reassembles the results into crystalline, mathematical patterns. Flung into a melodic mix, he hyperactively shifts these patterns, provide every track with complex, double-helix turns that reveal previously unglimpsed structures with each listen. Not since Four Tet's Rounds have I heard drum programming as loose with the kit, yet firmly interknit with timekeeping, evoking post-bop drummers more than hip-hop producers. No. 9 released the single ""Where Come From? And Where To?"" last year with remixes from Hrvatski and Bundy K. Brown, and the song re-appears here, a sliver of a Henry Mancini film score gone manic spliced with catchy pieces of scatted gibberish. ""Survive"" seeks to invoke horn man Gato Barbieri (somewhere between his free-skronk days and 1972's Last Tango in Paris), transforming the sax into a sinewave that hovers at a Star Trek tiki bar, while drums blink in infinite Simon patterns on the back panel. Swaggering Lalo Schifrin spy themes swish along with monk-robed Autechre, never letting the complexity override the simple beauty of the sounds. Elsewhere, crickets shine like moonlit ponds and frogs twinkle like galaxies on the blatantly titled ""BUG BEATS"" and ""ECO EGO"", the lines between microscopic and macroscopic lost in the drift. The final portion of Mushi No-one is perfect for night listening. Basslines walk in the peaceful darkness, a perfect balance between stillness and skitter achieved after the knotty jazz charts that appeared earlier. ""Insatiable World"" gurgles and spits up tiny shards that should be familiar to Lithops fans, slowly sinking into evening's ambience. The title track is 17 minutes of crickets, digital buzz, and chopped up metallophones, the natural, digital, and hand-made permutating into one another. Closer ""For Sister"" brings together church bells, flamenco guitar, cello, snares, and snaps (not to mention a cellphone melody at the end) for a lively farewell, proving that Joe can do downtempo as well as no-tempo. Mysterious or humorous, peaceful or bustling, Mushi No-ne remains always in flux.","Before Beck decided on the title of Odelay, he joked with Rolling Stone that he was considering Robot Jazz as ...

Terrorist Threats,Westside Connection,by: Christopher Sebela,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa8fb1335d7bf16996b6/1:1/w_160/a99ddadf.jpg,2004-03-23 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8769-terrorist-threats/,Priority,"There's a strain of nostalgia that Civil War recreationists and classic rock devotees often fall victim to, in which they cling to sugar-coated perceptions of the past in a desperate attempt to stave off the horrible present. The things they froth over are decades and millennia old, lending credence and legitimacy to the subject of their devotion. And then there's Westside Connection, whose second album longs for the halcyon days of 1992, when bitches were bitches, tricks were tricks, and rags and gats were the coin of the realm. Which is odd, really, since Terrorist Threats is an album that also celebrates post-9/11 terminology. Osama bin Laden and the Taliban are name-dropped alongside 911 and Saddam, while members Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC giddily assert themselves as old-school terrorists who pose a bigger threat than al-Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah combined. Opening with a ominous Keith David-esque narration that lets you know you're in for a very serious experience, the album's first song, ""Call 9-1-1"", quickly slips into traditional gangsta-rap fare, with politics running a distant second. On songs like ""Terrorist Threats"" and ""Lights Out"", the trio refer to themselves as ""the young Osama with that al-Qaeda drama,"" and more impressively, ""Saddam, bin Laden and O.J. in a Chevy."" But rather than confronting the endless ammunition of a Patriot Act world, Westside Connection prefer to look backwards. In the world of Terrorist Threats, the drive-bys and color wars of early 90s L.A. are still great fodder, while the more topical 50 Cent and 911 just make for good rhyme schemes and half-hearted stabs at controversy. The soundtrack is perfect for a throwback. With a batch of producers from longtime Cube collaborator Sir Jinx to new darlings Midi Mafia, the album is equal parts G- and P-Funk. Even Nate Dogg shows up to croon on ""Gangsta Nation"", the album's most infectious track. Terrorist Threats delivers on the challenges Westside Connection throws out to the softer new-school, with clever verbal feints and menacing rolls. In fact, most of this record would be great if not for its overarching lack of currency. In the early 90s, the record would have made a nice snapshot of gangsta rap in its prime, but coming out 10 years late, it offers no revelations-- hearing three renowned professionals defy innovation and return to their already well-traveled ground tends to suck the joy out of even this album's most compelling moments. Given that Ice Cube helped change the face of rap music a decade ago with N.W.A. and his first two solo records, his new move from the streets of Compton to the policies of Washington comes as something of a disappointment. Here, his output's gradual decline sadly culminates in what amounts to a retread of his career, ""Bop Gun"" and all. In the years since gangsta's birth, rap has made huge, evolutionary leaps; it's a shame that Westside Connection haven't.","There's a strain of nostalgia that Civil War recreationists and classic rock devotees often fall victim to, in which ...

That Much Further West,Lucero,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc65e6ef95969323124/1:1/w_160/6c365d7e.jpg,2004-03-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4959-that-much-further-west/,Tiger Style,"What a difference a few years makes: When their self-titled debut was released back in 2001, Arkansas-by-way-of-Memphis-based Lucero were labeled alt-country, mainly because Ben Nichols sounded suspiciously like Jay Farrar, and because John Stubblefield's bass was of the upright variety. Just a few years later, though, they've become a solid part of the Southern rock revival that covers almost every state in the Confederacy: scene godfathers Drive-By Truckers from Alabama, Kings of Leon from Tennessee, and the North Mississippi All-Stars from, er, North Mississippi. The Southern rock tag fits Lucero much better, not only because the band members fit the dual criteria of a) being Southern and b) rocking, but because they rock in a way that has little to do with country music, alt- or otherwise. As much as they derive their sound from classic and Southern rock, Lucero also borrow from indie and punk sources like Pixies and The Replacements, taking pop noise from one and pop romanticism from the other. In other words, they're not as out of place on the Tiger Style roster as they might seem. Lucero's third album, That Much Further West, is not only their first for Tiger Style, but also their first to be self-produced (without the help of All-Stars Cody and Luther Dickinson). It was recorded mostly live in their Bluff City practice space, so it sounds less polished than its predecessor, Tennessee, but more melodic and adventurous. The 13 tracks, not counting the instrumental coda, can be easily and handily divided into two categories: songs about romance and songs about manliness. On tracks like ""Hate and Jealousy"" (a satisfyingly cynical play on fellow Memphian Al Green's ""Love and Happiness""), Nichols ponders what it means to be a real Southern man, solid, sturdy, and moral: ""I want nothin' that ain't truly mine."" On the one-minute-plus ""Joining the Army"", he considers enlisting as his only route to Greatest Generation-style manhood: ""Said I wanted to make my grandfather proud/ But he's not around/ Been gone since I was 13/ I'm still worried what he'd think about me."" Much more interesting are the songs about tenuous or doomed relationships. Taken together, songs like the title track, ""Sad and Lonely"", ""Mine Tonight"", and ""Across the River"" form the unifying narrative of That Much Further West: Nichols is out in America somewhere playing shows and dreaming of his best girl, who is probably already ""breakin' my heart to the boys back home."" In these moments, he adheres to a particular brand of rock and roll romanticism-- the self-described ""boy with the most metal heart of all"" calls her his ""best girl"" or ""little girl"" and consoles her with, ""I don't plan on dyin' young""-- which often limits his insight into his own problems. As a result, the songs are not as deftly analytical nor as coldly scrutinizing as, say, the divorce songs on the Drive-By Truckers' Southern rock revival watershed, Decoration Day. On the other hand, few songwriters pull off romantic resignation quite as well as Nichols, who comes off in these songs as masochistically passive-- always the left, never the leaving. At the end of ""Across the River"", he knows that ""when I get back, you're gonna break this heart,"" but accepts it with a shrug and a ""well, alright."" Meanwhile, the rest of Lucero add dramatic punch to these tales of heartbreak. The group sounds rejuvenated by the addition of new guitarist Todd Gill, who replaces band co-founder Brian Venable. Venable's playing always sounded somewhat apologetic; by contrast, Gill asserts himself nicely, adding intuitive guitar lines that sound steeped in cigarette smoke and late-night letdowns. Unfortunately, Gill left the band in January, a development that does not bode particularly well for future releases. Guitarists may come and go, but Lucero's mainstay, besides Nichols, is Roy Berry, the band's inventive and articulate drummer. His intricate rhythms and counter-rhythms pump and pulse like dance beats, invigorating and complicating the band's sound, never stifling its momentum with too much heavy-metal thunder. The instrumental parts on ""Mine Tonight"" move like drum-n-bass tracks, and the constant pounding on ""Hate and Jealousy"" adds bombast to guest John Murry's fiery guitar solo. ""Tears Don't Matter Much"" begins with an evocative guitar intro, before Berry's drums come in about twice as fast as you expect, completely redefining the song and dramatically expanding its possibilities. On the penultimate song, a ballad entitled ""When You Decided to Leave"", Nichols finally realizes that his problems with himself and with women are more or less one and the same, but Berry interrupts his epiphany with blasts of staticky programmed beats. They ruin the song's intimacy but they don't ruin the song; it's less about Berry fucking around with Nichols than about pounding drums upstaging a sensitive ballad, rock and roll defeating settled commitment. If Nichols is the sad-sack journeyman dreaming of home and his best girl, then Berry sounds like the madman driving the tour van further and further west, ensuring that Nichols will have plenty of heartache to write about. Well, alright.","What a difference a few years makes: When their self-titled debut was released back in 2001, Arkansas-by-way-of-Memphis-based Lucero were labeled ...

Wherever I Am I Am What Is Missing,Laika,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc78ea9e61561daa74aa/1:1/w_160/841f9b83.jpg,2004-03-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4642-wherever-i-am-i-am-what-is-missing/,Too Pure,"That album title is lifted from Mark Strand's excellent 1963 poem, ""Keeping Things Whole"", as concise and fitting a meditation on space, waste and transience as there ever was. Laika's album, their fourth, could never hope to be as succinct as a fifty-five word poem, but with only 10 songs and 42 minutes, it tries. Named after the first dog to be slung off the Earth, Laika is the brainchild of Britain's Guy Fixsen and Margaret Fiedler. Wherever I Am I Am What Is Missing marks their first studio album since 2000's Good Looking Blues, but that four year gap is a mirage; Fixsen acknowledges in the bio that the majority of the music for this record was, in fact, recorded in 2001. It's not a cheat, but given that Laika are the type of band that tends to offer relentlessly small variations on one specific theme, it's close. Some bands like that need serious time apart to stay interesting; hell, most need it to get interesting-- time not to marinade, but to grow fissures, to break through the fortress of that one specific theme and chip away at its nature. Still, unless we're counting minute variations (and we're not), Laika's nature hasn't changed much on Whatever I Am. The painting of a snow globe on the cover of 1999's Sounds of the Satellites is a useful image to invoke when describing Laika's music. Consisting of crisp, shuffling grooves, swirling keyboards and Fiedler's icy vocals, there's a specific motion and temperature to what they do. That this is pretty much a constant means their albums are different like snowstorms in Buffalo are different than snowstorms in Reykjavik are different than snowstorms in Prague. With this record, I found myself listening less for Laika's melodies and above-ground ornamentation, and more to their grooves and bottom end. The duo are, contrary to received wisdom, much better with rhythm than they are with melody, and Wherever I Am is passable in this regard. As exemplified by tracks like the kinetic ""Fish for Nails"" and the fidgety ""Falling Down"", the record is punctuated by all sorts of stereo pings and timed delays that make it an interesting textural listen. But ultimately, Laika make pleasant music that's difficult to be passionate about. At best, it succeeds as a low-impact tint, a chilly motorik electronic that swirls around the room for a while before settling and melting away into vapor before you even realize it's vanished.","That album title is lifted from Mark Strand's excellent 1963 poem, ""Keeping Things Whole"", as concise and fitting a ...

Anything Goes,Brad Mehldau,by: Stephen M.

Its improvisatory approach encourages open-minded musicians to tinker with the mechanics of the tune, to subvert traditional structures, to take a song apart and rearrange it in new ways. So it's not especially revolutionary or avant-garde for a jazz musician to cover modern rock. In fact, it's downright nostalgic, recalling a mid-century moment when similar reinterpretations were de rigueur. Too often, however, such coverage can revert to either easy irony (Lounge Against the Machine, which is hardly jazz but rooted therein) or stuntwork (The Bad Plus, who've recorded versions of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Iron Man""). On the other hand, Brad Mehldau, a New York pianist influenced by Bill Evans and Vince Guaraldi, has made the Radiohead jazz cover his personal calling card; he has reinterpreted two Radiohead songs on previous albums: ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" on The Art of the Trio, Vol. 4: Back at the Vanguard and ""Paranoid Android"" on Largo. It's skirting predictability, but it's not schtick: His versions are never ironic or showy, and Mehldau proves resourceful and intuitive in his approach. On Anything Goes, which consists of ten covers, Mehldau tackles ""Everything In Its Right Place"", from 2001's Kid A, which seems to counter the musical philosophy encapsulated in the album title. It might seem a curious choice-- either incredibly daring or incredibly stupid. The original emphasizes Thom Yorke's digitized and mutilated vocals over the melody itself, which doesn't seem to incorporate more than three or four notes in a fairly simple rhythm. But there's something compelling translated into a comparatively bare-bones arrangement. After a bass intro by Larry Grenadier, Mehldau elaborates on the theme thoughtfully, letting the tune spiral out from its center while maintaining the tense tone. What's missing is the original's eerie claustrophobia: In a sense, Mehldau liberates the song from the airless confines of Kid A and takes it for a walk around the park. He makes the song both evocative and cerebral, and it fits perfectly among the nine other reinterpretations. While the rest of the album lacks the hipster cache of ""Everything in Its Right Place"", each track is similarly deeply thought out and deeply felt. Mehldau captures the folksy casualness of Paul Simon's ""Still Crazy After All These Years"" and the intimate ruefulness of Lerner and Loewe's ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"". ""Get Happy"" takes on a near-manic stride as Jorge Rossy spazzes out on drums, while ""Dreamsville"" and Hoagy Carmichael's ""Nearness of You"" flow patiently and pensively, easy and unrushed, as the trio explore their melodies. Mehldau saves his boldest interpretation for the title song, which of all this album's tracks, strays farthest from its source material. The piano redefines the melody in the first verse, then Grenadier hammers the second verse out on bass, before the trio break it open completely. Cole Porter's original had pluck to match its wit; stripped of the lyrics, Mehldau's version is more inward-looking, a statement of artistic intent rather than a movie-house crowd-pleaser. It helps that Mehldau co-produced the album, alongside longtime jazz producer Matt Pierson (Miles Davis, Count Basie, Bill Evans). Largo, his previous album, was helmed by Jon Brion, whose SoCal sheen gave the songs a clunky, busy sound and usually had Mehldau chasing his tail up and down the keyboard. Anything Goes has a much more refined sound: just bass, drums, piano, and no fidgety studio tricks to get in the way. The result is a more focused, but no less resourceful, album that finds a place between invention and interpretation, between its everything-in-its-right-place perfectionism and its anything-goes adventurousness.","Jazz has always been as much an interpretive art as a creative one.

Art Box,Art Bears,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18ec0084474cd0bfe20/1:1/w_160/213976a2.jpg,2004-03-22 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/429-art-box/,Recommended,"For all the renewed interest of rock music from the late 70s and early 80s, one sect gone unheralded are art-damaged and experimental European rock bands. A few have been given decent due: This Heat, Pere Ubu, Suicide, and other NYC bands like DNA were among the most forward-thinking outfits of the day, yet possessed all the immediacy of the greatest punk bands. In England, This Heat weren't only inspired by the same air of change and angry resistance that fueled early punk, but were also well-informed by an already rich history of art-rock through bands like The Residents, Faust and Captain Beefheart. They were certainly aware of the archetypical avant-prog group Henry Cow, as well. Like the aforementioned bands, Henry Cow played music that was mostly unprecedented before their existence, and likewise shared an outsider ideal, even if they weren't ingratiated into the same circles after punk broke. Drummer Chris Cutler and guitarist Fred Frith were core members of Henry Cow, who had collaborated with German singer Dagmar Krause's band, Slapp Happy, on a pair of albums in the mid-70s. Krause brought a highly distinctive vocal presence to the band, one both wildly idiosyncratic (witness her various shrieks, growls and unclassifiable utterances throughout the Art Bears catalog) and schooled in traditional European art songs, particularly those of Kurt Weill and Bertold Brecht. With her voice and phrasing, she managed to single-handedly unify lengthy works that might have otherwise lapsed into typically arch, classically structured Cow pieces. When Krause joined the band on a permanent basis, it was only natural that they should gravitate towards something more like ""songs."" The musicians who would become Art Bears began recording their first album, Hopes and Fears, before the band even formally existed. In January 1978, Cutler, Frith, Krause, Georgie Born, Lindsay Cooper and Tim Hodgkinson went to Switzerland with the intent to cut the fifth Henry Cow album at Etienne Conod's Sunrise Studio. However, when it became apparent that Cutler's shorter songs (along with Krause's vocals) weren't going to result in anything resembling a Henry Cow album, Cutler, Frith and Krause simply decided to rename themselves Art Bears, and with the others, agreed to record different, instrumental pieces for what would become Henry Cow's final album, 1979's Western Culture. And then they decided to disband Henry Cow altogether. In addition to songs initially worked on as Henry Cow, the Art Bears' core trio recorded four songs with electronics and studio whiz David Vorhaus (of White Noise) in London. The band's insistence on trying to push the boundaries of narrative forms and studio technology is typical of their drive to produce ""art music,"" while sharing many attitudes with concurrent punk and post-punk musicians, yet differing completely in their response. Hopes and Fears covers everything from suicide and world politics to witch-hunts and an allegory of the maze-- and that's just the first four songs. Beginning with a cover of Hans Eisler and Brecht's ""On Suicide"", Hopes and Fears makes no secret of its eccentricity. Unlike Henry Cow, group improvisation and lengthy modern-classical asides are de-emphasized at the hands of songs and Cutler's text-delivered messages. ""The Dividing Line"" is a tense, darkly realized piece wherein Krause delivers a plea of, ""O give me the order and I'll cross the border/ I don't want to be where I am,"" in reference to citizens kept under watch by a military state. Cutler's muffled drums pound away in the background while distorted organ and Cooper's oboe play dissonant counterpoint. It might have been ""progressive,"" but it certainly wasn't ""progressive rock."" ""In Two Minds"" does erupt into a Who-like fury at one point, but is for the most part a bleak, understated take on folk balladry about an adolescent committed because her parents deem ""she is clearly not herself."" Else, Hopes and Fears sounds very much of the RIO tradition (such as it was), with angular, intricate woodwind lines and avant-prog textures. ""Terrain"" is an instrumental that could well have fit on Henry Cow's classically tinged Western Culture, though is still clearly a song-based piece. ""Moeris Dancing"" sounds similar to Belgium's Univers Zero in its use of Eastern European folk rhythms and harmonies, but also to latter-70s Magma as Krause doubles the instrumental melody with a wordless, eerily wavering vocal. If this album still holds relatively true to ideas suggested by Henry Cow and their peers, subsequent releases would be singularly unique. At the end of 1978, Art Bears went back to Sunrise Studios to make their second album, Winter Songs. Cutler had a concept for the record, which would be the first recording made from scratch with Art Bears in mind: His words were based on bas-reliefs (three-dimensional figures carved into wood or stone) from the Central Porch of Amiens Cathedral. The LP jacket contained small pictures of the carvings next to their respective songs, though Cutler's texts range from literal translations of the image (""The Bath of Stars"", ""First Things First"") to abstract or political prose (""Gold"", ""Three Figures""). Frith's music, though written only shortly prior to the recording, runs the gamut of styles from abrasive rock (""The Slave"") to folk (""The Hermit"") to impressionist, experimental electronic (""Man and Boy""). However, throughout, the band displays a more focused approach than on Hopes and Fears, and Conod's studio techniques are in magnificent display. ""The Bath of the Stars"" begins with cathedral organ and Krause's declaration, ""He steps from a crucible, held by an angel"" (referring to the boy in the accompanying carving), doubled by her own whisper, and sounding not unlike something Björk might try during a particularly adventurous moment. Frith's piano and organ clusters give the short piece a pastoral quality all but obliterated by ""First Things First"", wherein Krause's odd, reversed vocals are driven by dissonant guitar and eventually overtaken by the sludgy, downcast pound of drums and piano. However, even that doesn't prepare me for the abrasive avant-hardcore of ""Rats and Monkeys"". There, Krause's high-register mantra, ""Rats and monkeys crowd the city as it crumbles into ruin, walls are loosening, true, but gates are blocked!"" pierces like a siren over a battering ram of explosive percussion and chaotic guitar. When the piece literally explodes for a furious coda of all manner of noise and effects, most folks will either squeal with delight or recoil in horror. Winter Songs can be an intimidating experience, but one that's never without a core of compassion and morality. The World As It Is Today, originally released in 1981, is my favorite Art Bears release, and arguably one of the best collections of experimental rock songs ever recorded. Despite having to endure a particularly difficult tour of Eastern Europe after their second album (including a near-riotous gig in Prague), and frustrating difficulty arranging to have Krause sing with the band on a new release, Art Bears reconvened at Conod's studio in Switzerland during the late summer, 1980. This time around, Cutler's texts dealt in much more overtly political reams than on Winter Songs, doubtlessly influenced by his opposition to the onset of Thatcherism in England, and Reagan's America. In Cutler's view, the idealism and creative freedom at an apex during the late 60s was subsumed by survivalist economics and the Age of the Impersonal. His feelings are reflected in song titles like ""Truth"", ""Democracy"", and ""The Song of the Dignity of Labour Under Capital"". Again, Conod's way with the studio lends considerable depth to the songs: The potentially ham-fisted protest of ""The Song of the Martyrs"" (sample lyric: ""Were we martyred to finish with all forms of slavery forever, only to witness our offspring complacent and bought off with scraps?"") begins as a backdrop of cymbals splashing in reverse and ominous rolls of thunder-crescendos over which Krause plays the role of dead idealist questioning the state of the world. Her voice stays mostly in the higher range, where every syllable is as close to crying as it is to singing. On the loping, jagged ""Freedom"", she sings in chorus, ""I saw multitudes forced from the land, cleared for the wool, dispossessed, refugees who were told to be free,"" with such satirical, bitter edge as to make me cringe. And then she really lets you have it: Over a scraping, near-atonal guitar solo from Frith, Krause lets out a shriek that spans almost two-full minutes. Of course, a lot of old prog fans ran for the hills, but let anyone who doubts the passion behind this music be subject to her wail. In addition to the three studio albums, the newly released Art Box contains three discs of remixes, live tracks and unreleased songs. The two-disc Art Bears Revisited set contains remixes by folks like Otomo Yoshihide, John Oswald, The Residents, Bob Drake, Biota, Jon Rose, and Christian Marclay. Fans will be interested in hearing fresh interpretations of the songs, though two discs is probably a bit much to wade through for the uninitiated. Cutler's own Three Bear Rooms piece uses bits of multiple songs and comes out like a beat-heavy experimental trip-hop piece, sort of like This Heat's ""24-Track Loop"" slowed down by half. Jon Leidecker/Wobbly spins ""Winter/War"" and ""Force"" into similarly ""out"" dance music, though also turns a few neat tricks with Krause's vocals. Fans will also want to hear the live tracks on the last disc of the box, especially ""The Song of Investment Capital Overseas"" from 1984, featuring an expanded line-up including Tom Cora and trombonist George Lewis. Beginners may not feel so hot about laying down $70 for a box set of a band they've never heard before, and even longtime fans will probably be more interested in the studio albums than the bonus material. However, this band is well deserving of the deluxe reissue treatment: Art Bears not only spoke for the best of the canon, but their music also sounds almost as ahead of the curve today as it did twenty years ago. Not many others can make such a claim, and those that can (say, Can or Kraftwerk) are rightly revered. Art Bears were that good.","For all the renewed interest of rock music from the late 70s and early 80s, one sect gone unheralded are ...

Night Mute,Ativin,by: Christopher Weber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a130c0084474cd0bfd57/1:1/w_160/5cc3a68c.jpg,2004-03-22 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/336-night-mute/,Secretly Canadian,"Assuming the band signs off on its press materials, Night Mute is Ativin's ""exploration into the themes of death, hopelessness and fear."" Unfortunately, it sounds more like an exploration into an afternoon nap. Which is a shame: Before calling it quits in 1998, the bassless, mostly instrumental trio raised the bar for mysterious post-Slint math-rock, with gorgeous, swirly guitar interplay floating above ratatat drumming. 1996's Pills Vs. Planes EP and the 1999 full-length German Water were brooding, introspective and powerful, even during the whisper-quiet moments. Few bands were better at evoking despair and loneliness through bursts of distortion and mere hints of melody. It was the stuff to fire up philosophy grad students hunkering down for an existentialism all-nighter. And then Ativin abruptly packed it in, their legacy secure, if obscure. When they returned four years later with the overly ambitious Interiors, the indie faithful were confused by its elaborate production. Strings? Electronics? Was that a bass guitar? This wasn't the lean, angular Ativin of old. Guitarists Dan Burton and Chris Carothers seemed to go overboard at the mixing board to compensate for the absence of founding drummer and musical linchpin Rory Leitch. Now, on Night Mute, Ativin attempt to get back to their roots. Once again, the sound is spare and the range dynamic: Elastic guitars alternately duel and caress, transforming from hushed fuzz to explosive blasts and back again, while new drummer Mark Rice holds it all together admirably. Indeed, there's no mistaking it for Ativin. The problem is, I get the sense that their hearts just aren't in it. There's no punch. When Night Mute strives for mystery, it comes out overwrought; when it goes for dreamy, it comes off sleepy. ""Blood"" exemplifies the album's wasted potential, kicking off with an almost doom-metal riff, then softening and repeating itself over the pound of building drums. But just as the dark mood begins to take hold, the song comes to an anticlimactic end. Similarly, ""Endless"" is two minutes of pointless, crackly guitar feedback with no sign of actual melody or effort. There are flashes of pre-split Ativin here, particularly on the somber cover of Love & Rockets' ""The Game"", in which Burton quietly murmurs repetitive lyrics while the guitars work a refreshing quiet/loud/quiet dynamic to the hilt. But oddly enough, the record's best moment comes with its nameless hidden track, an (almost) downright pretty tune, with flowing guitars that flirt with a haunting melody. Unfortunately, nothing here shakes the overwhelming sense that Ativin are just going through the motions these days. The sense of urgency that made their earlier work so strong-- that certain something separating the humdrum from the Holy Crap-- is gone, and in its wake is a band that sounds, in even their best moments, tired, lethargic, and frankly, bored to tears.","Assuming the band signs off on its press materials, Night Mute is Ativin's ""exploration into the themes of death ...

Bastion of Itchy Preeves,Cerberus Shoal,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a577ea9e61561daa5140/1:1/w_160/68599a16.jpg,2004-03-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1386-bastion-of-itchy-preeves/,North East Indie,"Let's say you're literal-minded enough to look for the meaning in everything, that you check the placards next to abstract paintings and you couldn't buy Ulysses without an authoritative guide to explain the references. Who could enjoy Joyce if you can't tell the Biblical references from the Dublin slang for abusing oneself? I'm right there with you, which is why I used to bang my head against Cerberus Shoal's last disc, Chaiming the Knobblesome. Chaiming was a major break from the past for a band that had already changed directions many times since their formation in the mid-90s. Cerberus Shoal have always played unique avant-rock, from the hardcore influence and glorious crescendos of their first albums to the steady pacing and global thrift store arrangements of their mid-career line-up. But Chaiming was their most complex effort yet: Suddenly, they had a torrent of words, in a surreal language. It was too meticulous to be stream-of-consciousness, but too chaotic to reveal any kind of meaning. It never occurred to me that there might not be a right answer, until I drove up the coast to Portland, Maine, to ask the band in person. The change came after they lost three members--- who went back full-time to playing as Tarpigh-- and gained three new ones. Erin Davidson signed up after leaving Red Light City, but the band also brought in two less experienced musicians: Colleen Kinsella, who has drawn their cover art since Homb and sung in a folk duo with Shoal co-founder Chriss Sutherland, and Karl Greenwald, who had never been in a band, and who became their chief lyricist and Dr. Sample operator. Even in avant-rock, a song's words are usually its focus. But that goes against the collaborative nature of Cerberus Shoal's music, where each member gets equal say and the music never centers on a lead voice. So the lyrics that Greenwald and the others write winds through the music like another instrument, and the words don't resolutely dictate a meaning-- except what the other players, and the audience, can find in the mysterious but provocative images. The schism between 2002's Mr. Boy Dog and 2003's Chaiming the Knobblesome makes more sense if you listen to the split EPs they recorded in that time. (""Ding"", on The Vim and Vigour of Alvarius B and Cerberus Shoal, is a definitive track for this line-up.) But Bastion of Itchy Preeves, which was actually recorded before Chaiming, is the most complete document of the band's transition. You can hear the methodical pace of the earlier Shoal on ""Tekel Upharsin"", where Tom Kovacevic returns to play oud. But the exotic instrumentation of the Tarpigh line-up makes way for alarm clocks and noise collages, from the howling scrap metal of ""Grandsire"" to the shimmering wrap-up, ""A Head No Bigger than a Man's Cloud"", where the electronics and bass drip like mercury. And after the occasional vocals of their past few albums, most of this line-up sings. Sutherland's grainy tenor meets graceful wordless choruses on some songs, and eerier ejaculations on others: Kinsella's cackling on ""Train Car Nursery"", or Greenwald muttering and cranking like the troll that lives in your closet. The words on ""Baby Gal"" and ""Train Car Nursery"" have the sinister tone of the Chaiming material, but most of the lyrics slip in gradually. You can hear the excitement in the build-up of ""Bogart the Change"", where Sutherland grasps for words and fragments of lyrics as the music escalates, and when he reaches the climactic line-- ""I know your feathers are wet""-- it bursts out not as cryptic nonsense, but as a near-epiphany of triumphant understanding. Even at its extremes, Bastion has a smoother flow and more consistent palette than either Mr. Boy Dog or Chaiming. For a transitional album, it doesn't show a new band's fits and starts so much as the organic evolution of its voice. This is such a strong lead-in to Chaiming that the people who were surprised by the band's new direction may wish they'd heard this first. Fascinating in its own right, this album also taps your imagination more gently, and it's a smoother introduction to the world that Cerberus Shoal moved into. Either way, the two albums are perfect complements: Chaiming fully realizes this line-up, but Bastion illustrates how they got there.","Let's say you're literal-minded enough to look for the meaning in everything, that you check the placards next ...

Beehives,Broken Social Scene,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ae9d034d5c69bf2ea7/1:1/w_160/daaa0e4f.jpg,2004-03-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/954-beehives/,Arts & Crafts,"For all the inbuilt excitement of seeking out rare cuts by our favorite bands, it's important not to lose sight of the fact that B-sides are B-sides for a reason. Frequently, outtakes simply break from an album's self-determined tenor; other times, they're just undeveloped. Unfortunately, like most compilations of its nature, Broken Social Scene's freshly minted collection of rarities and otherwise unreleased material, Beehives, is plagued by both problems, and suffers from a paucity of ideas. Beehives finds the band indulging in the post-rock noodling of 2001's stuporific Feel Good Lost. Generally, the tracks here are pleasant and well-produced, but are rarely engaging enough to justify their runtimes. This is not the Broken Social Scene of You Forgot It In People, and indeed, it was clearly not intended to be, as the collection describes itself as ""songs for the come down."" But perhaps Beehives comes down a little too much, almost consciously avoiding the band's proven strengths: energy and enthusiasm. Most of these songs could stand to be about a third their length. Tracks like the guitar-sliding shuffle ""Weddings"", ""Ambulance for the Ambience"" with all its blips, bells, and solo synth whistles, and the horny, throaty scream-lullaby ""Time = Cause"" are cavernous and wholly pretty, but stagnate almost instantly. It doesn't help that these meanderings all share the same mid-tempo lilt: When taken in its entirety, this continual sameness gives the album an unbearably flat feel. ""Da Da Dada"", to its own credit, manages to spark some interest at the compilation's midpoint by launching into a brief, hazed reprise of You Forgot It in People's ""Cause = Time"", but before you know it, the song has settled back into the tepid fog of held belltones and noise which it opened with. Ambient music does not mean stagnant music-- in fact, the word itself is derived from a compound of the Latin verb ""to go""-- but all too often on Beehives, this distinction seems to collapse. The most successful of the instrumentals here, ""Hallmark"", succeeds precisely because, as an upbeat, drum-machine driven number, it refuses to stick with one pattern for too long, as its guitar lines and harmonica hums anxiously crisscross one another and grow in complexity. ""Market Fresh"", meanwhile, is as close to a B-side as we might expect from You Forgot It in People-- its midtempo groove situates itself squarely between their two full-lengths in terms of haziness and propensity. Leslie Feist's vocal/piano reworking of ""Lover's Spit"" is temporarily intriguing, but fails to differentiate much from the original LP version. Beehives' only real standout, then, comes with ""Backyards"". Here, Emily Haines' vocals are mixed democratically with the other instruments, and her matte delivery adds further texture to the exceptionally lush accompaniment. Sadly, with this one exception, Beehives remains pretty but formless, and its status as an outtakes and rarities collection confirms that the band, to whatever extent, agrees in this regard. It's a shame that this offering fails to display the kind of passion and intensity Broken Social Scene have displayed in the recent material they've played in concert, but then, most of these tracks are culled from a time before the band hit their stride. It seems we'll just have to wait until their next full-length.","For all the inbuilt excitement of seeking out rare cuts by our favorite bands, it's important not to lose ...

E&A,Eyedea & Abilities,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdbc0084474cd0c2b96/1:1/w_160/37c5a42b.jpg,2004-03-21 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2886-ea/,Epitaph,"The plight of Eyedea has been a long told hip-hop parable on how talent doesn't always produce good music. Both a Scribble Jam champion in 1999, and an HBO Blaze Battle winner a year later, Eyedea wields a variety of styles, ridiculous flow, a penchant for storytelling, and a distinctive nasal vocal. Meanwhile, partner DJ Abilities is a two-time regional DMC champion and arguably one of the underground's best DJs. Unfortunately, their sophomore release, E&A;, brings up the same question prompted by their debut, First Born: With all this talent, how is it that these two can't come up with a solid album? Here, it may easily be chalked up to a kneejerk change of direction. Seemingly taking the negative press surrounding First Born's pretensions as a universal distaste for rap records that display topical depth, Eyedea makes a deliberate move away from heady concept and into the worn realm of the angry b-boy: E&A;'s material here ranges from songs about wack rappers, to rap fans, to the rap industry, and tacks on a song about glass as an afterthought. Sometimes, the approach works-- usually when progressive means are attached to it. ""Reintroducing"" opens the album with a serious bang, with applause and a rigid drum loop bookended by upright bass. But Eyedea's impassioned vocals are what really drive the track home: As Eyedea delivers his lines, DJ Abilities simultaneously scratches them, causing an incredibly weird effect I've never heard before. ""Now"" is tied together by an interesting piano vamp, with Eyedea styling all over the cut, and switching from a slow-motion chant to an impressive staccato flow that's tracked by Abilities' constantly evolving jazz-drummer speed-shifts and drum rolls. Songs like these lean closer to more of a Quannum-style sound, and they open the album, leading to high expectations. The remaining songs, however, follow traditional song structures, their beats and lyrics largely failing to impress or remain with the listener. If anything stands out on E&A;, it's DJ Abilities' turntable talents. He's far from the level of professional awe-inspirers like Q-Bert, Nu-Marc and Cut Chemist, but he comes through shockingly strong on ""Reintroducing"" and ""One Twenty"". Still, his production is off. Fundamentally speaking, his drum work is solid, if ultimately uninventive, and his general aesthetic falls squarely within the tried-and-true boundaries of barebones, mid-90s-styled jazz-hop, a style that's worked well for hundreds of others. The problem lies with his sample choices and lack of creativity in composition: Check his played-out 80s bass nodes, car alarms, and irritating spacy synthline on ""Star Destroyer"", or the cartoonish, accelerated saloon piano and cliched beat programming on ""One Twenty"". Although his ambient approach goes well with the purpose of the album, he tends to make poor choices where beatmaking is concerned. Eyedea's lack of intriguing topical choices is a problem area, too. It's understood that he doesn't want to be labeled ""the borderline Anticon conceptual guy"" but when your most ambitious tracks whine about humankind's domination over nature and rely on estrogenic reflections, there's a problem. You'd think a Scribble Jam battle champion would have some punchlines, right? Then again, you'd probably also think a DMC champion DJ might have some decent samples up his sleeve. Granted, the album does hit in both departments on occasion, from the dark, reflective beats on ""Glass"" and Eyedea's emotive vocal performance on ""One Twenty"", but the duo's retro approach doesn't provide them the proper setting to display their technical prowess. There's no doubting the wealth of talent displayed on E&A;, but until they find a better producer, or at least find a way to better utilize their obvious chemistry, they'll likely be doomed to more identity crises like this one.","The plight of Eyedea has been a long told hip-hop parable on how talent doesn't always produce good music ...

On!Air!Library!,On!Air!Library!,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba389d034d5c69bf53fb/1:1/w_160/3e1fc0ff.jpg,2004-03-21 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6092-onairlibrary/,Arena Rock,"Blanket statement: I don't like realism. Or, to be more specific, I hate the haggard notion that art must always strive for so-called truth. Often, the best literature, film, and music has little or no grounding in actuality, instead constructing elaborate, fantastical worlds that may or may not have some loose allegorical underpinning. Tolkien insisted that Lord of the Rings wasn't about World War II or the Nuclear Age, and I believe him. The Coen Brothers are brilliant precisely because their films are set in vacuous parallel worlds, which, thanks to their freedom from all things real and current, are usually better developed and more palpable than movies that attempt to be relevant. But music, because of its tendency towards abstraction, is perhaps best equipped for escapism. Some of my favorite albums in recent memory used exotic instruments, indecipherable lyrics, and amorphous structures to create a sublime aura of the unreal. If Up in Flames is secretly about politics, I don't want to know. That said, electronics play a somewhat ambivalent role in music: They can either bend reality beyond recognition, or relentlessly exaggerate it. On!Air!Library!'s self-titled debut LP uses synthesizers and other digital affectations largely to the former extent. While the nine songs follow a highly conventional format and feature a bankable triptych of guitar, bass, and drums, the record is engrossing and unique despite its obvious limitations. Finding myself thoroughly absorbed by this album after only a few listens, I was somewhat confused when I noticed that the brooding ballad ""Fell to Earth"" uses sound effects from AOL Instant Messenger. I'd previously written it off as obnoxious background noise from my perennially malfunctioning laptop, but at that moment, administering the crucial headphone test, I couldn't help feeling betrayed. What had until then provided a pleasant 40-minute vacation from essay writing and general neurosis had been encroached upon the harshest of all realities: a reminder of one's inescapable life as a loser. For objectivity's sake, it was the only-- and thus best-- employment of AIM's ubiquitous, creaking digital door that I've heard in indie music. But it nevertheless dampened my enthusiasm, if only nominally, for this svelte pop record. A brief biography of the band at the Arena Rock Recording Company website makes the bold proclamation that ""On!Air!Library! looks not to the past but the future."" This may be true, but On!Air!Library! are then subconsciously well-steeped in a vibrant history of forebears. ""Bread"", with its slack, reverb-laden guitars and lazily unfurling lyrics, drips yolky remnants of Galaxie 500 and My Bloody Valentine, while ""Feb."" packages a panoply of post-punk and new-wave bands via their Interpol incarnation. (Interpol drummer Sam Fogarino even cameos with angular percussion on the opener, ""Faltered Ego"".) Other songs regurgitate their reference points in sufficiently abridged form. ""User 28"" effortlessly slithers through several different guises before fulminating with impassioned vocals and an insurgent drumbeat. The song germinates in a pool of nebulous drones, and then evolves into a loose structure with twangy guitars and a Bill Laswell-inflected bassline, before finally erupting at around the 2\xBD-minute mark. It's easily the zenith of this compact but wonderfully rich album. Sticklers might disparage Alley and Claudia Deheza's vocals for being tonally off somewhat, but compared with another celebrated pair of vocal sisters I recently reviewed for this site (CocoRosie), their style is vastly more honest and engaging. While alternating between derivative and rudimentary, On!Air!Library! is nevertheless well executed in its obviousness. My critiques are mostly caviling, and purposely mentioned lastly, as something of an afterthought; this album's merits far overshadow its occasional moments of banality. It's a billowy pop blanket in which to curl up and forget everything that isn't as sweet. If On!Air!Library! strive for truth and gritty realism, they've captured something from a distant future where, all told, things don't look so bad.","Blanket statement: I don't like realism.

How can a fey indie-kid condemn this collection of cloying twee-pop covers and not seem like some sanctimonious snob, shrieking cries of ""sacrilege!"" at these minor-league indie bands' attempts at hero worship? Surely these bands are our brethren-- wistful, floppy-fringed romantics who fumble through life reciting poetry, being trodden-on and getting caught on unattainable women. Like us, they see the songs of Steven Morrissey as painfully acute in describing their own dysfunction. Why attack them for paying tribute? Maybe because it all seems so heartless. While Romantic and Square Is Hip and Aware is not the first attempt at a tribute to The Smiths (the bored Britpop B-league of The Smiths Is Dead, with its fudged covers from Placebo and Supergrass, bears that backwards honor), but it's certainly the most galling, as its cast of clueless college-rock enthusiasts clumsily recreate Marr/Morrissey's rain-splattered, angst-laced elegies. Frustratingly, the collection begins with promise. Employing backwards guitars and fragile, folkish whispers, female-fronted The Pines provide a soft, autumnal take on ""Ask"". Later, The Lucksmiths-- the only band on this collection whose own material is at all noteworthy-- knock out ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" as the kind of boy/girl duet that Morrissey might have attempted had he ever met many girls. But finding impressive moments on this record is like looking for moments of untainted joy on Meat Is Murder. Take Slipside's straight-laced rendition of ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"". From the sound of it, they've simply snatched the chords from some bookstore songbook and furnished it with a pitch-perfect Morrissey impersonation. You could hear this shit for free in any student bar in the northern hemisphere. Also noteworthy for its cringe-inducing ridiculousness is the Would-Be-Goods' garbling of ""Back to the Old House"", whose weightless wreck of anemic harmonies and cuddlecore-cuteness could inspire Isobel Campbell pick up an electric guitar. Lovejoy's ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" even manages to inject some Johnny Marr-mimicking guitar lines into its pallid, toiling shoegaze, while Pale Sunday's ""I Know It's Over"" is absurd, vocoder-ruined Euro-pop, completely devoid of emotion with impoverished production and cheap keyboard whirls. In an age where mere over-exposure is enough to make people revise their opinions of bands, Romantic and Square does The Smiths no favors. It's a record that succeeds in rendering such classic songs as limp, lifeless and utterly unremarkable, stripping them of the passion, context and camp wit that made them great to begin with.","This review's doomed before you've even begun to read it.

Cluster Ville,Abstrackt Keal Agram,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a195c0084474cd0bfe38/1:1/w_160/aa0881c6.gif,2004-03-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/436-cluster-ville/,Gooom,"It's been more than a year, but the Western Hemisphere has finally caught up with burgeoning French electronic label Gooom Disques. M83, Cyann & Ben, Mils, and Abstrackt Keal Agram comprise the white-hot nucleus of the imprint (and, for that matter, the French electronic scene, at least as far as we <> can ascertain). If Europe has traditionally housed small, prolific pockets of groundbreaking electronic artists, Gooom is the DFA of the labels that sponsor them, sporting an upstart roster of innovative acts and an impressive cache of mixtapes to prove it. Abstrackt Keal Agram are the most hip-hop-oriented of the crop, as witnessed by frequent collaborations with rap duo Atoms Family and a pesky jones for remixing, which resulted in last year's sensational transmogrification of M83's ""Run into Flowers"". Unfortunately, Cluster Ville, the Morlaix, France duo's sophomore album, lags somewhat behind their proven remix skills. The album kicks off on a sterling note with a trio of songs that run neck-and-neck with the bulk of the Gooom repertoire. ""Del"", the incendiary opener, chugs for four minutes on a determined beat while weaving a firm tapestry of no-frills synthesizers. The compositional style recalls nothing so much as instrumental rock bands like Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky, whose songs incorporate a static foundation on which they can perform instrumental variations, forcing the listener to experience every subtlety in order to gain a full appreciation of the music. ""Pièce"" continues in this fashion, as a similar beat drives a gently pulsating array of synthesizers. Meanwhile, a Rhodes piano scatters spare, repetitive dabs of color, suggesting Prefuse 73's sci-fi beatmaking. The aptly titled ""Brouillard"" is a scatterbrained montage of orchestral swells, parsed beats, and hissing found sound. Coupled with spare, monastic murmuring and an austere synth melody, the song sounds like a Hitchcock mystery overture from the 22nd century. Those three inaugural tracks, however, constitute the effervescent summit of Cluster Ville, which means it's gently but steadily downhill from there. When the haze clears, the listener is left with the inexplicable ""Mata Hari"", a dull, mechanical rap that features clunky verses, drooled in the Queen's best English, from Cryptic and Alaska of the Atoms Family. The French stylings of James Delleck and La Caution on ""L'oreille Droite"", Cluster Ville's only other vocal track, are a slightly smoother and more interesting, mainly due to their foreign novelty. Other songs, named for such great minds as ""Nietzsche"" and Grandaddy's ""Jason Lytle"", show promise early on, but are quickly smothered by lachrymose monotony and epic length. Cluster Ville is distinctively hip-hop in flavor, more indebted to Josh Davis and Scott Herren than to other musique electronique artists such as M83 or Air. At times, though, the group seems equally enamored of the American hip-hop aesthetic as they are of its sound. The aforementioned ""Mata Hari"" is littered with irreverent, tough-talking emcee samples and references to, among other things, Apocalypse Now, Elton Brand, and naturally, guns, and while there's nothing wrong with these subjects, the song lacks a context to substantiate their usage. The overwrought solemnity of certain songs is another hindrance. Without the much-needed contrast of sunnier moments, ""A.C.,"" ""Audio Crash"" and ""Petersbourg"", which form the middle section of the album, turn languorous, plodding onward like cogs in Maxime Gorky's factory. Too often, the duo seem to force emotional gravity upon their songs through a reliance on minor key drones and near-industrial beats. The effect is enervating. Abstrackt Keal Agram are the hyperkinetic little brothers of the Gooom Disques roster. They posses the enthusiasm and the talent to create good work, but Cluster Ville lacks the consistency, urbanity, and introspectiveness of recent albums by M83 and Mils. Whereas their labelmates have assimilated technology into their songwriting styles to the point that it's become as elemental as acoustic instrumentation, Abstrackt Keal Agram still seem unduly fascinated by it. If they can trim their eagerness, and lend the same verve to their original songs as they do to their remixes, Gooom might have another winner on their hands. And if they can't, well, the label could still employ them as the resident house mashers.","It's been more than a year, but the Western Hemisphere has finally caught up with burgeoning French\n\ electronic ...

Although longtime fans somewhat mourn the days when he might have spent an entire LP side exorcising demons from his larynx, I welcome the change. Yoshida no longer needs to prove his endurance or facility with piss-take screaming etudes, nor does he need to ram out a hundred more avant-zeuhl tunes to express himself. By the same token, Fujii's collaboration with the drummer seems to have brought out her most concise and aggressive qualities. While her big band releases (Eastern and Western) were admirably open to experimentation and the kind of eclectic sound palette, I've always thought she was at her best in a small group. With Yoshida, her pieces seem to unfold without any hint of rehearsed mannerisms or particular obligation to appease the jazz tradition. Erans is their second release as a duo, and fourth together if you include their work with Fujii Quartet. Judging by the music therein, they're only getting better together. The two performers split writing duties down the middle, and share composer credits on two songs. The first of those is the excellent title track, beginning as impressionistic rumbles from Yoshida's kit and fragmented runs by Fujii. They gradually build up tension with faster and faster statements before Fujii announces the head with a short unison fanfare and the pair nails accents together in a similar fashion as most other Yoshida projects. The difference here is in both the refined precision of the playing (it's certainly the closest to straight jazz Yoshida has come), and in the advanced harmonic ideas Fujii introduces. And although the other writing collaboration, ""Shimesaba"", presents a completely different mood-- imagine modern jazz and speed-disco crossed with the Charleston-- the willingness to compliment and follow one another marks the sign of a mature group, one whose aims betray forward momentum at all costs. Yoshida's ""Feirsttix"" appears twice on the CD, once as an instrumental and later adding vocals. It's the kind of tune that would sound perfectly at home on a Ruins record, but again, Fujii's way with harmonic development and her ease with covering the entire range of her instrument to lend the broadest possible range of sound to this music are what make Erans an invigorating, accommodating listen. Her own pieces, like the ECM-tinged, odd-meter ""Westerlies"" or Ravel-meets-Cecil Taylor vignette ""Iwashi No Uroko"", shine via restrained, relaxed performance and a highly sophisticated use of rhythm that almost always perfectly offsets Yoshida's more brawny style. And somehow, they always manage to lock onto each other during the structured moments, even after spending most of the CD exploring areas far outside the lead sheet. ""Westerlies"", in particular, should be held as an example of how to fuse explosiveness with subtlety in jazz without seeming contrived or convoluted. Fans of either musician should grab hold of Erans, but perhaps better, modern small-group jazz listeners in general will find much to enjoy here. Though ten years ago it would have been crazy to assume that Yoshida might one day find an audience among the bookstore and coffee-table socialites, this record is right at the cusp of being accessible to jazz snobs and noise freaks alike. And the best news is that nobody had to compromise to get to that point; it was merely a matter of finding the right musical partner.",,8.0,
Kenny & Beth's Musakal Boat Rides,King Creosote,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2dabf31b7dc7155c6c/1:1/w_160/2b768633.gif,2004-03-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4573-kenny-beths-musakal-boat-rides/,Domino,"As part of Scotland's loose-knit Fence Collective, Fife-born Kenny Anderson has been careering around the indie circuit for years, producing self-released CD-Rs at the kind of prolific pace that would make Ryan Adams look like a recluse. Now, with his cult status ensured through his affiliation with the little-known Fence Collective and Khartoum Heroes, he gives us Kenny & Beth's Musakal Boat Rides, his first ramshackle release of hard-hearted, sample-addled lo-fi folk. When he gets it right, the results can be quite beautiful. As an accordion weeps with an asthmatic wheeze and a sole guitar plucks in the distance, Anderson slurs through ""Lavender Dream"", detailing some spoilt fantasy, aided and abetted by labelmate James Yorkston's effortless harmonies. With its single lyric, ""You've got rise about the gutter you are inside,"" the sparse acoustics of ""Harper's Dough"" are perversely uplifting, promising hope and redemption from life's great lows. Here, King Creosote seems similar in mood to fellow Scottish miserablists Arab Strap, dispensing bar-room philosophy that treads a thin line between downbeat observation and the faith that something better will come. Some of the record's more uptempo offerings aim for the strange synergy of classic folk and electronics attempted by the likes of The Beta Band, with whom Anderson's brother Gordon (now of Lone Pigeon) co-wrote ""Dry the Rain"". ""Homeboy""'s buoyant marching-band beat and underbelly of samples and looped vocal fragments only enhance the song's bold melodic grandstanding, while ""So Forlorn"" sounds like hip-hop that's been gutted of its gruff machismo and hi-jacked to suit the screwed muse of its author. But for all the blissful torch-songs here, there are certainly elements that frustrate. The lovely ""Counseling"" may be embellished with Anderson's sweet Scottish croon, but it stops dead and undeveloped at just over 90 seconds, as it runs out of things to say. And when the songs don't crash to an abrupt end, they can tend to meander without ever getting started. For example, the number of ideas shown in the labored ""Friday Night in New York"" can't justify it stretching into an eight-minute odyssey of slow-motion strumming. In spite of its faults, King Creosote's debut can still be seen as a charming piece of bashful and embittered troubadouring, and a clutch of touching lamplight laments that manage to outshine its tendency to flit from emotion to idea without always knowing how to connect the two. It may soon be forgotten in the rush to discover the next great songwriter, but for a few late nights in the timid uncertainty of the new year, a few of the songs on Kenny & Beth Musakal Boat Rides may find your soft-spot, and proceed to stroke, push and pester it into submission. Sometimes that's all you can ask.","As part of Scotland's loose-knit Fence Collective, Fife-born Kenny Anderson has been careering around the indie circuit for years ...

The Milk-Eyed Mender,Joanna Newsom,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b968c0084474cd0c25df/1:1/w_160/06beed35.jpg,2004-03-17 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5893-the-milk-eyed-mender/,Drag City,"During an interview at a kitchen table in Soho sometime last month, Will Oldham mentioned Joanna Newsom as one of his favorite storytellers. At the time, I'd only passingly listened to her two self-released EPs, and was more familiar with her keyboard work with San Francisco's The Pleased and harp contributions to the Deerhoof/Hella side project Nervous Cop. But that's changed with the release of her first long player, The Milk-Eyed Mender. Here, the words to her meandering stories-- disarming in their formal purity, but still highly individualized and eccentric-- elaborate on an aesthetic that evokes French coins, dark maroon leaves, shafts of wheat, and ostrich feathers as much as it references them directly. Born in Nevada City and currently residing in San Francisco, Newsom's yarns summon a deep, rustic South. A line in the buoyant ""Bridges and Balloons"" uses e.e. cummings neologisms and Omoo's breezy prosody to impart the tale of a winter's day on a fallible ship: ""The sight of bridge and balloon/ Makes calm canaries irritable/ They caw and claw all afternoon/ 'Catenaries and dirigibles/ Brace and buoy the living room/ A loom of metal, warp-woof-wimble/ And a thimblesworth of milky moon/ Can touch hearts larger than a thimble."" In ""Sadie"", the title character is asked to accept a pinecone and a bone, talismans to ward off death. Really, they're the gentlest tokens that mark the beginning of a relationship, and later reaffirm the love despite an inevitable move towards taciturnity. Newsom's wonderfully detailed romanticism (""Your skin is something that I stir into my tea""), homespun wisdom (""Never get so attached to a poem, you forget truth that lacks lyricism""), idiosyncratic flourishes (""See him fashion a cap from a page of Camus""), and insights into the prosaic (""There are some mornings/ When the sky looks like a road"") infuse each track with the weightiness of an embroidered travel narrative and a private field-recording. She wields a joyful trill reminiscent of Texas Gladden on her ""Devil and the Farmer's Wife"", while her often childlike intonation also recalls Linda Hagood of the early '90s Uncle Wiggly-related trio, Smackdab, saturated with the air of '60s English folkie Vashti Bunyan. Showing an appreciation for Appalachian folk and the experimental composer/folksong scholar Ruth Crawford Seeger, her spare arrangements-- harp, Wurlitzer electronic piano, harpsichord, piano, and slide-guitar on two tracks-- unwind like early Homestead oddity, The Supreme Dicks. Creating avant-garde American music for the back porch, she expands upon tradition without losing authenticity. In this sense, her practice could be linked to Devendra Banhart, a friend and kindred spirit. Both map a pile of eccentricities that tumble together to create something useful, familiar, and nearly sacred. Here's hoping to a duet for the new folk future. Perhaps Kenny-and-Dolly style?","During an interview at a kitchen table in Soho sometime last month, Will Oldham mentioned Joanna Newsom as one of ...

Revelation If it hurts you, be glad of it. Though I was too young at the time to have read James Agee's famous introduction to his pastoral/political tale of the working South, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, the simple statement quoted above never rang more true than in the memory of searching for my grandmother and grandfather beneath the bastard-floral haze of the stagnant tobacco field. Unable to raise above the stalks and fearful of the potentially harmful life-forms that were to be found in the undergrowth, I made my way quickly through the slight paths created by the adults, weary of slaps on my shoulders and thighs from gruesome, sticky plant monsters, begging to be harvested before succumbing to either the heat or the insects. It was with elation that I would finally find one or the other of my grandparents, who, upon seeing me would lift me out of the muck I wallowed in, hoist me over their shoulder, and make their way back to the house in preparation for that evening's celestial exercise-- the local broadcasting of Asheville, NC's radio program, The Long Crescent Baptist Choir Hour. It's with such a background in the Gospel and Old-Time Religion of the Southern Tradition that I approached Dust-to-Digital's recent anthology of sacred songs and sermons, Goodbye, Babylon. Watching Grandma Maxine transform twice weekly before my very eyes, from a curved-back and sturdy farmer's wife into a wailing and praising songstress, I understand all too well the power and majesty that the Protestant liturgical music can invoke in even the humblest of God's creatures. To this end, the compilation-- featuring both world-famous names (Mahalia Jackson, The Carter family, Hank Williams, Sr., Blind Lemon Jefferson and Blind Willie McTell) and obscure ones (North Carolina Cooper Boys, Sister O.M. Terrell, Bela Lam and Blind Mamie Forehand)-- sheds a blinding light on a tradition that up to this point had remained as publicly lackluster and benign as the practice of leaf-tying or cotton-tilling before it. As near as you will ever get, you are inside the music; Unlike other anthologies of so-called ""old-time"" music-- Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music readily comes to mind as a valid choice of comparison-- Babylon strikes a deified note of distinction based upon its unique organization and central theme. Whereas other collections of folk and gospel music may call upon the spirit to simply shine down upon the globe, Goodbye dually keeps one eye at all times on the music and the other toward the sky, never once forgetting that there's both reason beyond reason and sight beyond sight. Organized not by the Elements of the destitute race-- as is Harry Smith's previously mentioned collection-- but into the multivariant portions of a typical sermon, the corpus of the collection lends itself to the more introspective and contemplative thoughts of the typical listener: An introduction encompassing all themes, an illustration of God's justice in the Johnson Family Singers' ""Deliverance Will Come"", the separation of the wheat from the tares in Rev. Sister Mary Nelson's New Testament-tinged glimpse of the Lord's Salvation, ""Judgment"", and a final plea to all those who still remain without true sight in the oddly ironic final disc, Goodbye, Babylon. Add to this the unexpectedly non-preachy sixth disc of early 20th-Century gospel sermons-- with such imaginatively titled works as ""Black Diamond Express to Hell (Pt. I & II)"" by the Rev. A.W. Nix and ""Death Might Be Your Santa Claus"" by the progenitor of the broadcast sermon, Rev. J.M. Gates-- and you have a masterpiece so intimately connected to the dogged human spirit that it's difficult to imagine a time when such a thread was not woven between Man and his God. Not only inside it, you are it; your body is no longer your shape and substance, it is the shape and substance of the music. More astounding than the sheer volume of songs collected within the Babylon box is the breadth of performers and performances that are covered and condensed into such a strongly supported theme. Culled from the catalogue of such former record company giants as Victor, Okeh, Vocalion and more, the disc brazenly tramples outdated notions of segregated ""Race Music"" (mainly blues and gospel) and ""Old Familiar Tunes"" (country, white gospel, and bluegrass) that dominated the commerce of music production at the time. So successful is the set in this amalgamation that it's often difficult to imagine a time when former-""Mole in the Ground"" performer Bascom Lamar Lunsford's ""Dry Bones"" could not be found a stone's throw distance from Skip James' ""Jesus Is a Mighty Good Leader"" or Jimpson's spiritual-like prison round of ""No More, My Lord"". Further evidence of implied ethnic harmony can be heard in the gentle juxtaposition of the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet's impressive and oft-covered ""Rock My Soul"" sliding over the back of an imagined glissando into the markedly less-pigmented ""There's a Light Lit Up in Galilee"" by Ernest V. Stoneman's Dixie Mountaineers. A similar effect can also be heard between the laid-back ""Christ Arose"" by the Sheffield Quartet, and one of the true musical Rosetta Stones of the collection, the blues and gospel-inspired Thomas A. Dorsey achievement ""If You See My Saviour"", a piano-driven number that doesn't pave the road for the later R&B; tinged classics of artists such as Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Little Richard, but most assuredly clears a path. Everything that is is holy. A valid criticism of Goodbye, Babylon lies ultimately in its prodigious claim of comprehensive and empiric inclusion of all the music that may fall under such a description as ""sacred."" To this claim, one might broach the subject of hypothesizing such foreign conceits as ""other religions"" to the stalwart and preoccupied Christian, or perhaps simply focus upon the idea that there is more to the American Christian mindset than what may be found south of the Mason-Dixon Line and east of the Mississippi. Insofar as the anthology does collect moments of the inspired Southern liturgical oratory, though, Dust-To-Digital has the rather novel boon of a true masterwork of sacred music on its hands. Ultimately, to deny that this collection of doleful musings and backwood hollers is anything less than heavenly is to deny whatever higher being in which one may or may not believe. Add to this the fact that the label has created one of possibly five beautiful and lasting works of the digital media as an artifact, and you have a justifiably immortal assortment of both the divine and human condition-- a call that might finally answer the lingering prompt, ""Sing unto the Lord, all the earth; shew forth from day to day His salvation"" (I Chronicles 16:23).","Goodbye, Babylon: An Outline

Rejoicing in the Hands,Devendra Banhart,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20c13d1975652138799/1:1/w_160/608f4694.jpg,2004-03-16 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/548-rejoicing-in-the-hands/,Young God,"You and I listen to more music than anyone in the history of civilization. I don't mean more than your friend or that guy on that message board who seems to know about every buzz-worthy leaked CD before anyone else, but rather, more than any previous generation of active music fans. Think about all our MP3s and CDRs, the stuff we actually buy, and then add in the music we hear once and immediately declare isn't worth the 45 seconds we spent with it. It almost seems ridiculous, because ultimately, few of us would be willing to recommend more than but a few songs (let alone albums) to anyone outside our close-knit music circles. Digital media was supposed to satisfy the audiophiles with better sound and the businessmen with yet another kind of product to convince us we weren't getting everything we could out of music/life. However, its primary effect has been to level music's impact to a similar scale as any other commodity-- outside those few songs we cling to like family, most of it ends up being used as trade-bait, rep maintenance, decoration and garbage. It's easy to blame this on the digital age, but then, it seems to have been going on longer than MP3s and file-sharing. Kids have been comparing and competing with record collections for as long as I can remember-- probably as long as my mom can remember, too-- but there must have been a time when our hallowed few songs were the only ones that mattered at all. Maybe during the days when people were more worried about war or disease or how they were going to eat in the winter; was it ""folk music"" they were hearing and singing? I imagine ""entertainment"" and ""self-expression"" weren't as valuable as functionality and therapeutic relevance in music. Devendra Banhart's second full-length (and first of two planned 2004 releases), Rejoicing in the Hands, harkens back to a time before music had so many cultural roles. It's not necessarily an ""old-fashioned"" record, insofar as his performances or songs are concerned. Banhart's lyrics are as often seemingly nonsensical as they are evocative or descriptive, and his songs defy almost any conventional form you care to introduce. There are references to traditional American folk and blues, as well as hints of British acoustic folk along the lines of Fairport Convention, Bert Jansch and Banhart favorite Vashti Bunyan (who sings on the title track). However, for the most part, Rejoicing in the Hands is a record concerned with the absolute smallest things in life-- which usually end up being the most important-- helping pass the time when time is the only thing going anywhere. It's unconcerned with the past or the future, and is only too ready to supply songs you could sing after dinner or first thing in the morning. It seems valuable to hear something like ""we have a choice, we chose rejoice"" coming from a new CD, as if that was the only kind of value music was ever supposed to have. Unlike Banhart's 2002 debut, Oh Me Oh My, Rejoicing in the Hands was professionally recorded, and a few tracks feature backing musicians (including Angels of Light alums Thor Harris, Joe McGinty and Siobahn Duffy). It's far from slick, though, reeking of rustic, homemade charm. Furthermore, it surpasses Oh Me Oh My in both songwriting and Banhart's singing. His songs no longer veer into bizarro cadences or witchy vocal overdubs; Young God's Michael Gira remarks that he didn't want to pigeonhole Banhart as a lo-fi eccentric, and consequently, the singer's range of expression (and surprising delicacy) is given full justice. Opener ""This Is the Way"" sets forth the unhurried charge, confident in its own idiosyncrasy. Banhart's wordless count-off to his subtly accomplished fingerpicked guitar work betrays a casual ideal, even as couplets like, ""I knew, I knew I could stand tall/ I could lay low,"" seem typically Banhartian in their benign whimsy. Likewise, the short guitar instrumental ""Tit Smoking in the Temple of Artesan Mimicry"" seems strangely familiar in its relaxed, uncomplicated feel, as Banhart's deceptively intricate lines cross one another like dueling minstrels on the road to nowhere. ""Todo Los Dolores"" even stops down as Banhart forgets the lyrics and has to begin again, much to the chagrin and amusement of a studio companion. If nothing else, Rejoicing in the Hands celebrates the informal and comfortable. Other songs seem weightier. ""When the Sun Shone on Vetiver"" features Banhart accompanying his acoustic with angelic slide guitar, and a ghostly violin harmonizing his lead vocal. The midtempo, folky drone underneath his pseudo-psychedelic melodic vocal phrasing contributes to an unearthly ambience. ""Will Is My Friend"" features plaintive piano and double bass accompaniment, and comes off as a midnight country-blues lament for ""Going Back to California"". Closer ""Autumn's Child"" forgoes guitar almost entirely, featuring Banhart's quivering vocal over a soft, minor-chord piano dirge. Lines like, ""She wanted to leave it, but she could not because it was her own child,"" sound melodramatic on the page, but over the course of song, seem almost offhandedly frank. Rejoicing in the Hands establishes Banhart as a major voice in new folk music. Not only does it improve on the promise of his earlier releases; it effortlessly removes the listener from the context of the recording. That is, it doesn't seem like an album so much as a collection of road hymns and journals, and small tributes to smaller pleasures. If some people miss the appeal of this stuff in an attempt to digest it as any other product, all the better knowing Banhart will probably keep on rejoicing until forever.","You and I listen to more music than anyone in the history of civilization.

Seven Swans,Sufjan Stevens,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a573c0084474cd0c0711/1:1/w_160/b6aa2a66.jpg,2004-03-16 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7512-seven-swans/,Sounds Familyre,"While few are responding to The Passion with the same intensity that New York Times columnist Frank Rich did a week ago-- for starters, Rich titled his harangue ""Mel Gibson Forgives Us for His Sins""-- it's fair to say that, recently, the American public finds itself thinking more deeply about the tensions that can surface when religion and art intersect so explosively. Yet, from an art-historical perspective, it's the dissociation of the two, not the intersection, that has always been most curious: Relatively speaking, only recently have religion and high art not been commonly joined at the hip. Religion has always served as an inspiration and benefactor of art, a fact which has made it all the more amusing when people criticize The Passion as an awful film purely because of its religious content-- they might as well pass over, among others, the Laocoon statue, the Sistine Chapel, Bach's St. Matthaus Passion, and practically every Dostoevesky or Joyce novel. That said, skepticism still greets the release of Seven Swans, Sufjan Stevens' sparse and intimate fourth album, in which the Detroit-raised Brooklynite deals with the stories of his Christian faith most directly. Which is not to say that Michigan and its tales of personal grief and acceptance of one's suffering were any less Christian in ethos, just that Seven Swans is so topically concerned with Christianity that a few wrong steps could easily have been a disaster. Religious content, by its very faith-based nature, is passionate and fantastical, and, if not fashioned with a commensurate degree of care and artifice, the emotion exceeds the form, throwing the listener headlong into the realm of melodrama and self-parody (confer all ""Christian rock"" bands). Frank Rich himself talks of The Passion's unbridled over-the-toppity, the film ""constructed like nothing so much as a porn movie."" Where The Passion fails artistically for Rich is not in its highly charged subject matter, but in its crudely considered execution. On similar grounds, Seven Swans partly succeeds for me because Sufjan rarely steps foot in the excess of pedantic preaching, despite the openly Christian nature of his lyrics here. At their melodic cores, the songs on Seven Swans are equally as potent as those on Michigan, though perhaps a little rougher around the edges and generally more sparsely arranged. The raw simplicity, coupled with the stripped-down, banjo-led instrumentation, lends Seven Swans a particularly high degree of sincerity: Even if we're not taken by the subject matter, we're taken by how beautifully and personally Sufjan is taken by it. On songs like ""All the Trees of the Field Will Clap Their Hands"" and ""To Be Alone with You"", Sufjan does well to collapse the distinction between divine- and human-directed affections-- his ""You"" could apply to God and loved one alike. Especially in the former song, which opens Seven Swans, Sufjan showcases his curious ability to change a song's grief-stricken tenor to a hopeful one on the flash. The opening moments prove this eloquently: As Sufjan sings, ""If I am alive this time next year,"" his weary banjo accompaniment slowly imbues the line with convincing optimism, a progression that continues throughout the song with similar effect as Sufjan is joined by a breathy background chorus from Elin and Megan Smith and drummer David Smith's labored tympanics. Because Sufjan commits himself so rigorously to this sparse, acoustic compositions, those few moments when electric instruments are used are particularly powerful. The first comes in ""The Dress Looks Nice on You"", in which tandem plucks and sweeps of guitar and banjo are suddenly contraposed midway against a quirky Casio keyboard breakdown. A second comes during the vaguely alt-country lullaby ""Sister"", which positions a light, nondescript jangle behind a screaming electric guitar that arises from the swell to become even more lively and expansive as the song builds on its repeated anthem. ""Abraham"", ""Seven Swans"" and ""The Transfiguration"" confront religion most directly, and to varying success. In ""Abraham"", Sufjan briefly recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis when Abraham, ordered by God as a test of faith to sacrifice his son Isaac (""Take up on the wood/ Put it on your son""), leads Isaac up a mountain and prepares to kill him as commanded before God sends an angel to intervene. (See also: Leonard Cohen's beautiful ""Story of Isaac"".) Musically, the song marks the lowpoint of Seven Swans: Sufjan's vocal melody is well-delivered but somewhat impotent, and the backup chorus seems incongruous given the subject matter. As the last two songs on the album, ""Seven Swans"" and ""The Transfiguration"" seem to work as a pair. Both are of relatively epic lengths and movement-like constructions, and as equal statements of faith-- the fear-inspiring ""My father burned into coal,"" and the comforting ""Have no fear! We draw near!""-- they dovetail perfectly. First, ""Seven Swans"" is a dark, brooding anticipation of the Apocalypse in which Sufjan begins with a foreboding banjo line, only to be swept up in crashing storms of resonant piano and a terrifying octave-jumping chorus of ""He is the Lord!"", easily one of Seven Swans' most memorable moments. ""The Transfiguration"" follows immediately on the bittersweet note of Jesus' requisite suffering, the song performatively ebbing back and forth from major to minor chords as new melodies and instruments are stuffed into the mix. Given Sufjan's ability to handle such dangerously effusive material as his own religion so well, it's no wonder that he aligns himself with the similarly concerned writer Flannery O'Connor, whose short story, A Good Man Is Hard to Find, is recast here from the perspective of O'Connor's Mephistophelic character, The Misfit. O'Connor, as the late Yale professor Robert Dubbin noted, is unusually capable of masking the Christian mechanisms at work in her stories without cheapening them-- she effectively crafts Christian revelatory experiences into ones of universal enormity and applicability. The same comment could very well apply to Sufjan Stevens on Michigan and Seven Swans alike: A gifted musician to begin with, Sufjan invites not our religious conversions, but our innate human compassion.","While few are responding to The Passion with the same intensity that New York Times columnist Frank Rich did a ...

"Something Borrowed, Something Blue",Deadbeat,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d213d1975652139748/1:1/w_160/e19b0be4.jpg,2004-03-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2221-something-borrowed-something-blue/,~scape,"Montreal's Scott Monteith last checked in solo as Deadbeat with 2002's Wildlife Documentaries. It wasn't a bad album but the overt Pole worship was hard to overlook, especially considering that Stefan Betke himself had by then decided that ghostly digi-dub was tired and decided to move on. Yes, Monteith made some unusual decisions, such as pinching the bass to focus on busier, more detailed midrange, but Wildlife Documentaries would never have happened without the groundbreaking (and still great) Pole 1. Since then, Monteith has teamed with Stephen Beaupré to record micro-sampling minimal house (last year's It's a Crackhaus Thing), and now returns with Something Borrowed, Something Blue. On first listen, it's clear that Something Borrowed, Something Blue was shot with the same film stock as Wildlife Documentaries. Dub again provides the structure and there's plenty of pop. But can this seemingly limited set of variables be combined into a successful record one more time? Well, yes, miraculously. Something Borrowed, Something Blue is a major improvement on Wildlife Documentaries, and it manages to create an intriguing and unfamiliar world from commonplace building blocks. The album was inspired by Monteith's recent marriage (hence the title), and damn if it isn't more direct and emotionally engaging than anything he's done. The short track ""A Brief Explanation"" bleeds seamlessly into ""Head Over Heels"" to open the album, and the two function together as an 8\xBD-minute statement of purpose. I'm reminded of the remix EP that Pole did for the Leaf label with Four Tet, because ""Head Over Heels"" so brilliantly combines a simple, delicate piano flourishes with clusters of throbbing crackle and the suggestion of reggae underneath. I believe sampled crickets make up at least part of the main rhythm element in ""Head Over Heels"", and this churning, high-end pattern becomes a curiously essential feature of the album. It serves as a bridge from one track to next, dropping out occasionally to focus the energy on the bass, and then returning to remind us of what album we're listening to. The percussion echoing away from the center of ""White Out"" might be disappearing into primeval jungle, and ""Requiem"" answers with commanding bass that stretches far beneath anything on this album's intentionally thin precursor. The aptly named ""Joyful Noise (Part 1)"" guides the quaking bottom into more melodic territory, as it provides a loping, sun-ripened tune to complement the endless swarm of double-time shakers. ""Joyful Noise (Part 2)"" finds Deadbeat drifting into noisier territory, as the track swells into a chorus of digital insects and leaves development behind. On the whole, this record is an interesting inversion. Where quintessential glitch describes a world existing on an abstract plane of pure energy, Deadbeat's music manages to be playful, fleshy and surprisingly fresh.","Montreal's Scott Monteith last checked in solo as Deadbeat with 2002's Wildlife Documentaries.

It will be easy to blame modern practitioners like Wilco, Will Oldham, or Calexico for getting me infatuated with that country-rock sound, slightly fried in the sun, yet mellow enough for the most Cuervo and Columbian-shriveled mind, but the biggest culprit will be Ian Matthews. He alone has made that peaceful, easy feeling of loathsome So-Cal sound palatable to my ears by masticating songs that Frey & Co. would one day cop and make more famous on their own. A player on the first two Fairport Convention albums, Matthews saw the similarity between the folk revival in England and the emerging singer/songwriter scene in L.A., and after a few group efforts as Plainsong and Matthews Southern Comfort, he left the UK's clammy chill for good to reside in the eternally sunny clime of California, hooking up with producer Michael Nesmith to record his fifth solo album, Valley Hi. Nesmith, of course, is better known as the lanky, wool-capped Monkee, but his career also took turns into weird film/television projects like Popclips (which would one day morph into the behemoth known as MTV) and Elephant Parts, as well as a modest stake in that gilded-country sound of his solo career (his greatest success still being the pen behind Linda Ronstadt's ""Different Drum""). Fans of Being There or The Royal Tennenbaums soundtrack can imagine a mashing of the two for Ian Matthews' exquisite, swooping country-take of ""These Days"", his reedy voice replacing Nico's morphine drip. As a collector of songs, his ear was excellent, with many of his covers being turned into gold for other MOR artists. Without the help of the songwriter credits, it'd be hard to glean what songs are the traditional folk standards and which are 50s country two-step. Then there's the rare Richard Thompson song and the rare Randy Newman one. Not to mention that Matthews' is an adept writer, too, slipping his originals into the running order. He commingles the disparate strands effortlessly, infusing them with his laidback pacing and quivering, gentle voice until they're all of a piece. His take on Nesmith's concise friendship-into-love song ""Propinquity"" gets delivered with a tender lilt, while his cover of Steve Young's ""7 Bridges Road"" was lifted wholesale by the Eagles in the early 80s. They also made a hit out of Tom Waits' ""Ol' 55"", a song which opens Ian Matthews' sixth album, Some Days You Eat the Bear and Some Days the Bear Eats You, released a year later. Without Nesmith's Texas twang touch behind the board, the album hangs a little more precariously, less cohesive than its predecessor. Matthews' ""Keep on Sailing"" (which opened Valley Hi) gets slowed to a sluggish, sax-stuffed pace. The covers still stun, though. Crazy Horse's heartbreaking ""I Don't Wanna Talk About It"" (Rod Stewart hit with it) and Gene Clark's ""Tried So Hard"" (covered back in his days with Fairport Convention) are delivered with a mastery that stands along with the originals while also sounding refreshed in Matthews' throat. The second side of the album, however, falls off with the Steely Dan and Jesse Winchester covers lost under that ever-increasing smog of adult contemporary radio. Still, for a good part of this two-fer collection of his Elektra solo albums, Matthews' recasts the future hits with effortless grace, reaching into his English past and his American country present to amalgamate something distinct, never once sounding like he's just out riding fences.","

In What Language?,Vijay IyerMike Ladd,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99bc0084474cd0c2650/1:1/w_160/d5ea477b.gif,2004-03-15 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4152-in-what-language/,Pi,"O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, December, 2003 My wife and I are led down a long aisle away from the other passengers and asked to remove our shoes and place them in molded plastic tubs so that they may be x-rayed with our coats and bags. As I step through the metal detector, it says nothing, but I'm still shepherded to an enclosed space where I'm told to spread my arms as a security guard runs his wand over me. Nothing again, but I'm used to this now-- it's been this way for more than two years. The guard places my shoes on a table and looks at them, then glances at my aged OK Computer t-shirt and remarks, ""Hey, that's a pretty good band."" He stares at the floor and distantly mutters, ""Alright, you can go ahead and put your shoes back on now."" For me in my white skin, traveling through airports was never difficult before September 11th, 2001. Even today, any delay I encounter is never more than an inconvenience, a standard set of instructions to follow in the name of an abstract concept called ""national security."" Others aren't always so lucky. In April of 2001, Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was merely passing through New York's JFK International Airport, in transit from a film festival in Hong Kong to another in Buenos Aires, when he was detained by the INS for refusing to be fingerprinted, and kept in a crowded holding cell for ten hours. He was ultimately returned to Hong Kong in handcuffs, famously attempting to explain himself to his fellow passengers: ""I'm not a thief! I'm not a murderer! I am just an Iranian, a filmmaker. But how could I tell this, in what language?"" Indian-American jazz pianist Vijay Iyer and underground hip-hop luminary Mike Ladd have seized upon this incident for both the title and inspiration for this collaboration, a cycle of songs about lives in transit, brown-skinned people from around the world living in unfamiliar places, passing through the world's airports in search of work, home and asylum. It's a world of businessmen, cab drivers, refugees, porn sellers and detainees, each of whom Ladd brings to life with his vivid poetry and spiraling rhymes, several of which he hands off to guest vocalists who inhabit their characters as needed. Ladd himself veers back and forth from the wide-eyed poetic delivery that he perfected on Welcome to the Afterfuture's ""Feb. 4 '99 (For All Those Killed by Cops),"" and his usual, unpredictable flow on his six lead vocal tracks, which he uses to lay out his thoughts on the topic at hand in broad terms. His actors, Allison Easter, Latasha N. Nevada Diggs and Ajay Naidu, are called upon to elaborate on these themes through narrative and dialogue. This kind of setup has plenty of potential for disaster, but Ladd keeps it all together with his wit and expansive knowledge of the subject matter. ""Swipe the coded stripe and my name drops in ones and zeroes/ Somewhere a computer may know/ Ladd is to Pratt as Cawthorne is to Willis is to Pickett and on/ What it won't show are the moments/ Of love or lust that swirl through centuries/ And tan me here/ Making me one more memento/ Of a close-quartered world,"" he reels on the opening, ""Color of My Circumference I"", setting up a journey that is by turns harrowing and humorous. Naidu takes a hilariously acerbic turn as a thick-accented NYC cab driver from Mumbai, blasting through verses like, ""My cab as amusement/ My cab as escape/ My cab is my job/ No tip? Then fuck off/ New York to Bombay/ BJP's Mumbai/ As Bloomberg is to play-pen is to/ I'm too tired/ 1010 WINS Radio/ 94.6/ WIN India's number one station, all hits,"" with liquid fluency, something that must be tough when delivering rhymes you didn't write. Ladd hits everything hard, feeding lines like ""My language a threat as well as my limbs/ My skin a question/ My skin a critique"" to Easter on ""Asylum"", wherein she plays a refugee from Sierra Leone forced to hide under beds from soldiers in sneakers and flip-flops through multiple countries only to be detained in her promised land. Naidu tears it up again on ""Rentals"" as he discusses his adult magazine stand: ""I am a porn walla/ I mop Dahi for thirty dollars a day/ I can police shoplifts in four different languages/ Can they?/ They are cops/ I'm a cop/ A laser eye close-cam brain/ A lust proctor/ And they search me/ Green carded/ Legal as 18, baby."" Indianapolis International Airport, November, 2001 The girl in front of me has syringes. Nine of them, with needles at least an inch long. She sets off the metal detector, but the guard, an old white man who seems to be in charge, ignores this, leaves his wand on the fold-out table and pores over the syringes in their case. The girl tries to explain that they're for her medicine, and that she needs to have them with her on the plane. The second guard, a young black woman perhaps 19 years old, waves me through the metal detector and I set it off. She tells me to stand aside and wait, but the man turns away from the syringes and yells at her: ""Don't tell him to stand over there."" He looks at me and says, ""You can go."" The guy behind me in line, a light-skinned black man who's maybe about 30 in a tie and glasses, has now come through the detector. It hasn't gone off. The guard allows the syringe girl to leave, and directs the man behind me to stand aside and spread his arms, picks up his wand and tells me to go again. I look at the female guard but she's too busy trying to explain that I should be getting wanded to the male guard to notice my glance. I pick up my bag and head into the terminal. Without a compelling backdrop, Ladd's words would still be compelling, but they wouldn't be much to listen to, and Iyer's arrangements range over a broad swath of improvisational and textural ground, flirting with hip-hop, ambient drone and jazz noir. Iyer's piano playing is expressionistic and cloudlike, more Edvard Munch than traditional jazz. He builds those clouds up to thunderheads on the four ""Color of My Circumference"" tracks, and creates a riverlike current for closer ""Plastic Bag"", with cellist Dana Leong floating amidst the eddies and whitecaps. ""Asylum"" is told over trumpets and piano clusters that hang like cobwebs, while drummer Trevor Holder explodes in whip-crack breakbeats on ""TLC"". One thing Iyer doesn't do is concern himself much with thematic development or melody, submitting his compositions solely to the service of Ladd's subject matter. This works surprisingly well, as there's already a lot to take in without the top of the mix getting any busier. The way Ladd constructs his rhymes also hints at melody more than most, so it's not missed. What might make In What Language? truly important, though, is that it's focused intently on probing social issues in meaningful ways. We've all spent time lately lamenting the fact that modern music is so apolitical, and this is a good start for an antidote. If it takes a poet and a jazz pianist to expose some truth in an age where the American dream is being able to watch TV and play video games at the same time, so be it. We can only hope it inspires real discourse and real thought.",,8.3,
Leaving VA,Los Halos,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd5f5e6ef9596932304e/1:1/w_160/60d6950d.jpg,2004-03-15 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4863-leaving-va/,Loveless,"Steve Sax, God, Pavement, Weezer, e.e. cummings, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Dave, DAVE!, Hooters, Bitter Bitter Weeks, Boston, mom and dad, Mr. Show, and all four of Philadelphia's major professional sports franchises (Phillies, Flyers, Sixers, Eagles) are but a tiny sample of the entities and people thanked in the expansive list contained in the booklet that comes with this album. Whether or not the Phillies or Egon Schiele had much to do with bringing this album into this cruel, absurd world I guess is beside the point-- I think people whose primary mental focus in life is something around which a body of knowledge can be built, like, say, music or baseball, are just natural list makers, for whom a written list of stuff means just as much as a detailed essay. In this case, Los Halos frontguy Samezvous seems to be laying out what he thinks made his life what it is, and then sticking it in his album insert whether it will make sense to anyone else or not. And, of course, even though I don't really know where some of the references on the list came from, I still read the whole thing and got something out of it. You can hear some of these things in the music, when you look for them. The Cure, for example, get a mention, and I don't have too much trouble hearing them in opener ""Lioness"", albeit with a sight less melodrama. The album as a whole falls somewhere between the two previous Los Halos albums, the first of which was a noise-laden psychedelic wall of guitar and drum stomp, and the second a 170-degree turn into radiant electro-acoustic folk. On Leaving VA, Samezvous and his attendant assemblage of collaborators shoot for a floating, evenly paced sound, amply widened with reverb and a consistent midtempo. ""Lioness"" really does sound like an especially mellow Cure track, with its nervously hovering rhythm and slowly shifting chords. ""Lo Siento"" is the biggest pleaser in the bunch, stretching space-based guitar over a loose, eight-minute frame of basic organ, percussion and bass. Samezvous' wispy tenor sounds relaxed delivering these confident melodies, with his best showcase coming on the mostly acoustic ""The Back Home"", a song that nicely changes from an almost country opening into a tambourine-driven British Invasion number, with a detour into vintage folk for good measure. Leaving VA closes with its title track, a methodical, measured ballad that doesn't shy from sentimentality, slowly unfurling a story about two young lovers who grow up and get married. Set against the backdrop of world events, it seems lightweight, but it fits well enough with the slow jangle around it, rounding out the album on a positive, optimistic note. Los Halos seem to have discovered the sound that works best for them on Leaving VA, a sound that taps the tension between softness and rough edges for its energy. There are still a few bugs to be worked out (some quicker tempos might be nice, for one thing), but Los Halos have made a quietly ingratiating record here.","Steve Sax, God, Pavement, Weezer, e.e. cummings, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Dave, DAVE!, Hooters, Bitter Bitter Weeks, Boston ...

Murs 3:16 - The 9th Edition,Murs,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4185e6ef959693239a4/1:1/w_160/8952b588.jpg,2004-03-15 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5514-murs-316-the-9th-edition/,Definitive Jux,"In the quest for independent success, gaining your 20,000 sales is attributed to a solid live show and an accessible persona. For an artist like Murs, the underground rap landscape is slightly more difficult to traverse. With a rhyme style that merges both early 90s West Coast tangents (his work invokes both Tupac and Souls of Mischief), Murs seems to get lost in the fold, especially while trying to find his musical identity with progressive rap imprint Definitive Jux. But by taking up a harder edge and striking a deal with one of the hottest producers to come out of the underground in 9th Wonder, Murs may have finally found his formula to success with the unfortunately titled Murs 3:16 - The 9th Edition. No longer rapping about failed kickflips or world domination, Murs has decided to take to a barebones clinic that could easily find as much favor with a Rocafella fan as with the typical Def Jukie. The topical range screams accessibility in favor of experimentation, with cuts about street violence, the negatives of hip-hop culture (""That throwback jersey is a dress/ I remember diamonds used to be a girl's best friend"") and various romantic entanglements. But the variety comes directly out of Murs' personality. He's another emcee in the currently profitable ""everyman"" rapping profile, but with a weird sense of self-deprecating humor and a strange obligation to street credibility. Here's the case of an emcee who claims on one song to be ""more Coldplay than I am Ice T"" in his treatment of ladies, while another song amounts to his take on Jay-Z's ""Girls, Girls, Girls"". Murs himself says it best: ""I'm tryin' to walk that thin line between intelligence and ignorance/ Have a little fun while making music of significance."" And as is the case with most contradictory emcees, it works admirably. ""Walk Like a Man"" is the longest, most involved cut on the record, focusing on the played-out issue of gun drama. The song works specifically due to the variety inherent in the song by 9th's decision on a different beat to match the different mood of each verse. The first verse is Murs questioning his own need for a pistol over blaxploitation stomp (""I never did use it/ What's the point of holding heat if you're never gonna use it, stupid?""); the second verse is drifting angelic voices to frame the death of Murs' friend; the final verse is a barrage of church choir singers and a hydraulic bassline to work with the funeral and the murder of the killer, with the closing chorus looping to the issue of the first verse (""Now I'm haunted with remorse and I wish I hadn't done it""). A song that stands out in its creation of classic gangster moral-telling. 9th Wonder has improved drastically from the days he shopped his Fruity Loops-produced beats on his Soundclick site, with a singular tone that shows more complexity than the work he did on Little Brother's debut and a maturing style that instantly harkens back to the glory days of DJ Premier. ""Bad Man!"" is simultaneously a backdrop with a shockingly original take on the obligatory dub reggae beat and a call-and-response chorus that actually works, making it an major standout. ""The Pain"" is midtempo, chopped soul that tips its hat to the RZA, and ""H-U-S-T-L-E"" is composed of addictive, time-phased vocals shifted into a jagged funk. 9th Wonder not only shows promise here, but fixes up the one constant issue of Murs' career: inconsistent production. It isn't all prosperous for Murs' strongest all-around album. First off, it's too short in today's world of music, where Illmatic length is only acceptable if your album is Illmatic. Secondly, his scenes of graphic sex (including sex with a raver who puts a ""glow stick in her pussy"") and violence sound forced in context with his older, less visceral music. Still, Murs has found the positive side of what I call Aceyalone Syndrome. This time, when the rapper started making music specifically for his friends, it turned out for the best. In what could stand to be a strong year for independent hip-hop, Murs could easily sneak into a few lists with his 9th Edition.","In the quest for independent success, gaining your 20,000 sales is attributed to a solid live show and an ...

Grit,Madrugada,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45069fc7814a47cd863/1:1/w_160/8908b5c7.jpg,2004-03-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5572-grit/,VirginVirgin,"Garage-rock inhabits a narrow geography. It's easy to picture modern bands like The Strokes and The Libertines swarming the calcareous canyons of the commercial-industrial complex, but shift to just 15 minutes outside any major metropolis, in the surrounding slums or white collar suburbs, and their swashbuckling riffage doesn't quite pack the same punch. Out in heartland Iowa, or the New Mexico desert, forget it; irrespective of its misleading brand name, garage-rock embodies the spirit of the city, and no place else. This, of course, hasn't prevented songwriters from all over the world from trying to capture the globe with their scuzzy aesthetic. Hailing from the tiny northern Norwegian village of Stokmarknes, 160 miles north of Arctic Circle, Madrugada's swagger is as cocksure as any of their municipal counterparts. Their incubated surroundings allowed them to develop freely, untainted by critical pressure, but the band has since uprooted its humble origins, playing music that's decidedly metropole-minded. When Madrugada finally emerged from their frozen matrix to release 1999's New Depression EP, they were greeted with open arms by both the public and the press: The somber, Cohen-afflicted ""Riverbed"" shot to #2 on the Norwegian charts, and the band was summarily snatched up by Virgin Records. Grit was originally released in 2002-- placing it a hair behind the fore of the revivalist rock movement-- and is now seeing reissue in the U.K. But Madrugada were writing music together while The Strokes were still in private school, and belong to a tight but prolific Scandanavian rock scene that has produced a handful of significant acts in recent years. The 11 songs here move at a furious pace, awash in treble and bombastic drums, rarely stopping to reconnoiter. Naturally, there are references to people crossing the proverbial ""line,"" and a few songs come dangerously close to doing so themselves by spilling into monotony. Madrugada's sound is tight-clenched and frenetic, if ultimately unspectacular, and when the band runs out of killer riffs, and begins to sound overtly and incoherently derivative, the album falters. ""Ready"" is a clumsy MC5 takeoff that would better suit a more simple-minded band like The Mooney Suzuki, while other tracks are content to rehash The Stooges. With numbers like these, it seems like Madrugada are trying to subvert the Norwegian stereotypes of eternal darkness and habitual suicide. By now, it's legend: When Dead, lead vocalist from Norway's premier death metal group, Mayhem, killed himself with a gunshot to the head in 1991, the band's guitarist Euronymous allegedly cooked and ate pieces of his brain. Euronymous was later stabbed to death by bassist Count Grishnackh, who was reportedly jealous of Euronymous's evil reputation. Top that, Cannibal Corpse. That said, this is potentially the most happy and exuberant record you will ever hear from a group of Norwegian musicians. Grit is uplifting even for Madrugada, whose 2001 LP, The Nightly Disease, echoed with the loneliness and despair that is protocol for Norwegian art of any stripe. ""Seven Seconds"" is a rocksteady blues-tinged romp that wastes all Scandinavian conventions, as Madrugada take a cue from their neighboring Swedish rivals, The Hives. On ""Blood Shot Adult Commitment"", vocalist Sivert Hoyem displays his ample talent, curling his lips as he spits searing emotional indictments with a honed elegance. The wistful ""Majesty"", one of Grit's weightiest moments (along with the wrenching ""Hands Up -- I Love You), is particularly affecting, as Hoyem delivers a breathtaking performance reminiscent of Smog's most harrowing tracks. While Madrugada manage to evade sobriety in their sound, Hoyem's lyrics can't seem to avoid digging at a ponderous philosophical underpinning. The band are one of the more literate in rock: The title for Grit was lifted from a passage in a Henry Miller novel, in which workers at a shipyard collected thick black soot on their hands that stayed with them until they died, and then resisted even the embalmer's harshest chemicals. The name Madrugada, Spanish for the hour before sunrise, was bestowed upon the band by a writer friend. Wading in flanged drones evocative of The Jesus & Mary Chain, Hoyem's verses offer telling metaphysical nuggets that help flesh out this straightforward but sophisticated album. One could easily define Madrugada's music in terms of a specific locale, but to do so would be reductive and unfair. With Grit, the band have produced a record that is palpable and full of nuance. This is music that's too intelligent and idiosyncratic to surrender pat answers, and, like the best rock music, it offers accessible routes to its hidden treasures.","Garage-rock inhabits a narrow geography.

Rockstopper,Knifehandchop,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbdf5e6ef95969322d03/1:1/w_160/6c5b0b4f.jpg,2004-03-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4497-rockstopper/,Tigerbeat6,"Knifehandchop is the alias of 22-year old Toronto resident Billy Pollard, who, despite his age, was one of the first kids onboard the laptop mashup barge when it first lumbered off in the late 90s. Trading in chart music, gabba, booty, jungle, dancehall, noise, bling, bleep, Europop-- basically anything with a certain pop cultural quotient-- Pollard's music has always hinged on the act of smirky reappropriation. His breakthrough track, ""Dancemix2000"", released on London's Irritant Records, was an obnoxious but faintly loveable curio that predicted the Boom Selector and Violent Turd bonanza by sellotaping Eminem, Destiny's Child, Pink, and The Vengaboys to a pulsehammering hardcore beat. Although he's already released two other full-length records, Pollard's best known for his string of irony-drizzled sevens and twelves, which have come mainly via Irritant and kid606's Tigerbeat6 imprint. Rockstopper, his first long player for the latter, is comprised of equal parts newer studio material and rehashed vinyl classics, all of which are offered here in remixed forms. As a complete listening experience, the hour-long effort is a bit of a hard slog, if not only because half of its tracks were originally designed to exist on their own terms, as the singular and immovable exclamation points that all good seven inches are. Placed side by side by side by side, and without the benefit of a seamless mix to smooth out the breaks, they tend to run into a jagged, pummeling blur. Since the novelty of Knifehandchop's catalogue can quickly wear you down in this abundant context, it's better to pluck out individual tracks and listen to them sparingly, as sides. ""Not for Tha Ladies"" pistol whips Beenie Man and Redman's ""Love Me Now"" with a fistful of electro and jungle breaks, ""2 Sexxxxy Booty"" lifts a booty lyric (""Bump and then pump that ass, ho/ Pump it fast now pump it slow/ Work that thing like a fulltime job/ Same way you slobbed on his knob"") and loops it over a manic electro break, and the Mecha Knifehandchop remix of ""Bounty Killer Killer"" runs the dancehall MC through a gabber/noise funhouse of thumps, bumps and static. And then there's the chill-out remix of one of Pollard's best-known (and most boneheaded) moments, ""Hooked on Ebonics"". With its strung pastiche of MTV hip-hop buzzwords and Ja Rule samples (all delivered derisively, like a punchline) fighting against a searing electro line, ""Hooked On"" is Knifehandchop's entire aesthetic rolled up into a single track: a tiresomely self-aware exercise made great in the moment thanks to its inspired programming. That's a routine worth enduring in short bursts, for five minutes, maybe ten, but submit for any longer and the whole thing goes sour, the great moments crumble, and you're left wondering why you ever needed a full hour in the first place. Significantly less than the sum of its parts, but entertaining nonetheless.","Knifehandchop is the alias of 22-year old Toronto resident Billy Pollard, who, despite his age, was one of the first ...

Stand with the Stillness of This Day,Elizabeth Anka Vajagic,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a99513d19756521398ba/1:1/w_160/baa6309b.gif,2004-03-14 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8526-stand-with-the-stillness-of-this-day/,Constellation,"What's the color of your favorite album? You've wasted many a midnight hour, slow from cheap wine and a sleeping problem, glaring passively at the projections emitted from your laptop's media player. Tonight it's Music Has the Right to Children, and translucent splashes of blue and green seep into each other as though it's the music that's summoned those images and not some random computer processor. Stand with the Stillness of This Day, the dramatic debut from Montreal songwriter Elizabeth Anka Vajagic, is relentlessly black. Its seven slow, tear-drowned laments paint a dark and unsettling otherworld that you want no part of; a derelict, rat-ridden distopia of neglect and madness which she draws with such vividness that, at times, it seems as though you're already there; strapped in the backseat whilst she gives you the guided tour. Enlisting some of the most recognized hired-hands from the Montreal community, including Sam Shalabi, Godspeed's Efrim Menuck, and Silver Mt. Zion's Beckie Foon, the record works as a suite of paceless, funereal death-dirges built around sparsely strummed guitars, layers of cello and piano, and all the background dissonance and distortion you've begun to expect from a Constellation release. When it works, it all sounds chillingly evocative. On ""With Hopes Lost"", Foon's cello weaves around the space between each slow guitar chord, as Vagajic's voice bellows the bruised refrain, ""Let it go now, before your hopes get lost;"" Efrim Menuck echoes the sentiment on backing vocals, and inserts a sublime jazz-piano line. Maybe it's just Menuck's inclusion in the line-up, but you can't help thinking that this baroque chamber-folk was the sound he was striving for on This Is Our Punk Rock. Certainly, one of the advantages that Stand with the Stillness has over Silver Mt. Zion's last outing is that Vagajic can actually sing. Her voice is a powerfully versatile instrument, capable of mewling a seductive moan similar to Lisa Germano, and then breaking into a lung-bursting bawl with impressive ease. And when combined with Chris Burns' guttural, guitar-driven shrieking on ""Where You Wonder""-- a wailing cortege of Neanderthal drumming and music-box harmonium-- it hits the mark of fear and paranoia that this record's entirety seems to strive toward. However, lyrically, the record is left wanting. As side-splittingly sincere as caterwauled lines like ""How could such happiness end?"" may be, Vajagic is no Leonard Cohen; her words aim for the dull and direct rather than the vague, subtle and oblique. Furthermore, there's little room on the record for variety of form or structure. On the toiling, seven-minute-long ""Iceland"", you sense a certain degree of formula following; a guitar strums without charisma, propped-up by some characteristically sorrowful cello and standard piano flourishes, but because the structure echoes that of every other song on the album, it leaves the listener restless and with a diminishing attention span. Still, this record possesses undeniable promise for Elizabeth Anka Vajagic. Though it's too reliant on a dark and unwieldy texture to be truly affecting, and too stuck on repetition of form and ideas for it to be praised purely on musical terms, Stand with the Stillness of This Day is, at its best, a collection of ragged, haggard and howling post-folk songs that mix acoustic elements with chilling dissonance to conjure a dystopic nightmare that might be closer to the real world than we'd care to admit. She may have spent too long staring into the darkness, but she's making a beautiful shade of black.","What's the color of your favorite album?

It is host to unapologetic MIDI instrumentation, glaringly theatrical vocals, and that ubiquitous but rarely implemented synth preset called ""aah voice."" Much more so than with any other Destroyer album, the aesthetic of Your Blues can be intensely jarring, and will likely annoy the fuck out of many, many people. Ultimately, though, it's the most initially vexing aspects of Your Blues that prove the most endearing, memorable, and surprisingly touching. Like Bejar's 2002 release This Night, Your Blues constitutes a fundamental challenge to deeply ingrained conventions of sincerity and emotional honesty. The record's conceptual brilliance lies largely in Bejar's ability to craft deeply moving passages out of ostensibly artificial and contrived elements, subtly suggesting that all music, if not all human expression, is in effect some sort of artifice. Bejar's critical engagement with codified aesthetic techniques certainly renders Your Blues a less immediately ""accessible"" record, and can at first come off as kitschy or detached. But the album's unique and defiant expression makes this the most holistically accomplished album Bejar has released to date. Though it's a conceptually fascinating record, it would be unfair to write off Your Blues as a ""concept album,"" or to suggest that its atypical aesthetic renders it unlistenable. Without a doubt, it's the songs here, not the conceptual meaning that could be read into them, that constitutes the core of the album's appeal. In fact, Bejar's newfound ability to conjure a plastic orchestra allows many of these songs to achieve a textural and structural richness only hinted at on previous albums. ""The Music Lovers"", previously released as a Sub Pop Singles Club seven-inch, benefits greatly from this treatment, as rising lines of synthesized strings grant the song a terse harmonic complexity absent from its more previous incarnation. ""It's Gonna Take an Airplane"" is an exercise in pure melodic elegance, a sing-songy, cleverly composed construction of bright acoustic guitars, multitracked vocals, and warm, evocative synthesizers. Elsewhere, Bejar's songwriting takes on a more grandiose bent. The album's opening track, ""Notorious Lightning"", finds Bejar sing-speaking his way through a string of vague-yet-striking images, slowly building to a rousing, anthemic finale. Framed by fake tympani, strings, and snare drums, Bejar sings, ""And someone's got to fall before someone goes free,"" his voice carrying an unrestrained, fist-clenched passion never before present in a Destroyer song. ""Notorious Lightning"", like many songs on Your Blues, has a markedly theatrical quality to it, its breathy vocal delivery and artificial orchestral arrangements landing somewhere between Stephin Merritt and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Like Merritt, Bejar explores the emotional momentum that these theatrical forms can evoke, reinforcing this connection with a computerized simulacrum of bombastic arrangements. Lyrically, Bejar is at the top of his game, his words reinforcing his musical play on artifice in lines like, ""Warm yourself by the fiery stage/ Fiery 'cause I lit it,"" and most notably, ""Always the play, never the thing."" The song ""An Actor's Revenge"" borrows its title from a Japanese movie, but replaces the film's visceral and dramatic plot with a more general and pointed discussion of impersonation, sincerity, and frivolity. On ""What Road"", Bejar hijacks a Smiths lyric, whispering, ""There is a light and it goes... out,"" before an ascending swell of synth-strings ushers in a forceful coda, with Bejar hissing, ""Your backlash is right where I wanted you,"" a clever (whether or not intentional) address to his potentially befuddled audience. Oftentimes, Bejar's delivery evokes Thunder Perfect Mind-era Current 93, only more fangy and melodic, and with substantially fewer lyrics about dragons. Certainly, those hoping for a return to the more straightforward Destroyer of yore will initially be put off by Your Blues. But it's hard to see Bejar's refusal to backtrack as a creative hindrance. A full six albums into his career, Daniel Bejar is making a compelling case for self-doubt as a fine art-- not content to rest on the fractured charm of City of Daughters, the formal, classicist brilliance of Streethawk: A Seduction, or the epic, perverted rock-isms of This Night, Bejar has made his bravest and most iconoclastic album to date. Now, finally, the bandname begins to make sense.","Let me get this off my chest right away: Your Blues, the latest album from Vancouver-based singer/songwriter and New ...

Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do EP,Sigur Rós,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3fb13d1975652138be5/1:1/w_160/1b59ee6b.gif,2004-03-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7153-ba-ba-ti-ki-di-do-ep/,Geffen,"Sigur Rós inspire high hopes. In the late-90s, they struck me as a band that might actually deliver some of the gooey-sweet dream music I'd imagined upon reading their hyperbole-ridden reviews and press releases. They seemed young, exotic and bulletproof, as if through karma and luck, they'd finally figured out how to lull us into states of sentimental hypnosis, while at the same time keeping their sleek, metallic veneer intact. Clearly, I'd mistaken them for some kind of meta-compassionate sports car. In 2004, the band has graduated to soundtracks, a fate so fitting it's anti-climactic. Chris Ott exposed Sigur Rós' modest flaw in his review of 2002's ( ): The twelve blank pages of its CD insert said more than enough about the band's second shot at cinematic grandeur, and despite their command of studio-generated atmosphere, they only fleetingly managed to hit upon the supernatural. Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do, featuring music Sigur Rós were commissioned to write for the Merce Cunningham Dance Foundation, is not hard to like. The EP contains three pieces joined at the seams to form a single compact structure of ambience and incidental ping. Like many new electronic mood music artists, Sigur Rós use the music box, presumably to imply delicacy. In any case, ""Ba Ba"" seems delicate to me. It fades in on just a few plucked tones, eventually revealing a synthesizer pattern reminiscent of Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"". This is the music of crystals forming, or the moment water changes from liquid to ice: There are no sudden movements, just a mass gravitation towards an end nearly identical to its beginning, except that time dictates that we're in a different location than where we started. The band uses this phenomenon as both harmonic center and rhythmic loop; it's a clever way of making music. My only complaint is that Sigur Rós don't pull it off as well as some of their peers (cf. Mileece, Lullatone, even Björk). As ""Ba Ba"" ends with smattering of pseudo-infant vocalizations, ""Ti Ki"" ushers in a recap of the opening music box tones. This piece puts the natural ambience of the instrument to better use than the opening track, allowing it to play alone for a couple of minutes before attacking it with software. Along the way, faint crackling sounds sneak in and out, and when the music box is cut up and spit back in reverse, the crackling is more dominantly featured. Unfortunately, Sigur Rós' deconstruction of this sound isn't far from its original form, and ultimately, the EP suffers from its monolithic landscape. ""Di Do"" admirably shakes the flow with a wavering, stereo-panned vocal drone, and stuttering, single-syllable accents (""Ba ba/ Ti ki/ Di do"") that remind me of similar vocal splicing done by Asa-Chang & Junray. It ends with a shriek of feedback, and just as I perk up to see what all the commotion is about, the disc is over. Still, I find reasons to come back. The tightly wound constructions and gradual, unhurried development appeal to the music theorist in me, and the sounds of music box, mutated human voice and analog synth appeal to the closet twee-tronica nerd in me. But I know this is temporary, and that it's only a matter of time before it makes its way onto the shelf, where it will be continually glossed over when I'm looking for something nice to put on. Sigur Rós indeed have found a method of enticing listeners to step inside their world, but have yet to master staying power.","Sigur R\xF3s inspire high hopes.

Camino del Sol,Antena,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18913d1975652138668/1:1/w_160/dd308b69.jpg,2004-03-11 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/426-camino-del-sol/,Factory BeneluxFactory Benelux,"Jacques Brel, the most famous pop culture Belgian who never made a direct-to-video kickboxing feature about clones, sang in his nostalgic, sardonic paean to his Grandparents' romance, ""Bruxelles"": Cétait au temps oú Bruxelles r\xEAvait Cétait au temps du cinéma muet
Cétait au temps oú Bruxelles chantait Cétait au temps oú Bruxelles bruxellait or, It was the time when Brussels dreamed
It was the time of silent film
It was the time when Brussels sang
It was the time when Brussels... bruxellait. Bruxellait. A word that Babelfish and online translation engines fail to process. Brel, unable to better describe his hometown, simply uttered, ""When Brussels was Brussels, when Brussels... brusseled."" Camden hipsters may be more familiar with Belgo, the Chalk Farm eatery where servers in monks' habits serve mussels, frites, and trappist ale in a cold, aluminum, industrial loft, than the Belgian stepsister of Factory Records, Factory Benelux, and its Brussels-based sister label Les Disques du Crepuscule. Though the label served as a continental dumping ground for the tour-support one-offs of major players-- like A Certain Ratio's inaugural ""Shack Up"" seven-inch, and later, New Order's ""Touched by the Hand of God"" and ""Everything's Gone Green"" singles-- it cultivated its own indigenous roster with groups like The Names, Minny Pops, and the massively overlooked Antena. The Names waded in slowed Peter Hook bassline facsimiles and faux-Morrissey moaning on their Swimming LP. Minny Pops ventured into colder electro-Teutonic territory. Antena, however, macheted into theretofore (and heretofore) unexplored territory for post-punk-- namely the oddball psychedelic scene of South America. Recorded with echoing minimalism, Antena's major release, Camino del Sol, evokes dreaming, singing, charmingly off-the-mark sci-fi futurism, and the black-and-white nostalgia of Brel's Brussels. It's as beautifully outdated, yet strikingly mind-boggling and timeless, as the towering Atomium over the Expo '58 grounds. The newly formed vinyl junkie reissue label, Numero, sniffed this truffle, and has released it between more traditional reissues of a rare soul compilation and a power-pop box set. Camino del Sol was originally a five-song twelve-inch from 1980, but was later expanded to a full-length by Crepuscule in 1982 with added singles. This reissue further expands the release with the ""Seaside Weekend"" single, two unreleased tracks (""Frantz"" and ""Ingenuous""), and new artwork. With any justice, it will bring new light to a lost gem, as similar reissues did for Os Mutantes, whose adolescent dementia influences this record's tropicalia songs (""The Boy from Ipanema"", ""Sissexa""), and Shuggie Otis, whose piquantly primitive drum machines propel each track. So much hidden influence lies in these songs. The wonderful opening punch of ""To Climb the Cliff"" and the title track predate Stereolab's Gainsbourg-gone-Kraftwerk by over a decade, and Air's cool, Parisian sex by nearly two. Tortoise directly lifted the syncopated synthetic funk of ""To Climb the Cliff"" on their equally rare seven-inch, ""Madison Ave/Madison Area"". Stuttering kick drums, icicle synths, and robotic bass jerks the listener through ""Spiral Staircase"" with better effect than a handful of contemporary NY revivalists. Limited to the use of the above ingredients and the occasional dry electric guitar, Antena relied on vast amounts of space for haunting texture. Each member sounds isolated in far corners of an airport hangar, allowing coke-bottle percussion, sound effects, and Isabelle Antena's detached, seductive voice to float. The more propulsive tracks are offset by opiated cocktail numbers like ""Silly Things"", ""Bye Bye Papaye"", and ""Noelle A Hawaii"". Yet, the faint echo of Antena's label cousins Joy Division keeps things perversely intoxicating. Only on ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"", a cover of Michel Legrand's theme to the Catherine Deneuve film, do Antena sound positively retro-minded. Even then, the strings and horns seemingly waft from a wormhole. The band fell apart soon after this release, and carried on into goofy plastic jazz before Isabella turned it all into a solo vehicle. These days, Isabelle Antena still rides the stereotypical ""Big in Japan"" wave, touring the country and releasing smooth adult albums in some cruel approximation of Lost in Translation's Sausalito. Yet she'll always have this document of inspired originality in her past, which, with this reissue, could very well make her a rediscovered figure. As this album proves, she was much more akin to Beck and Björk than her dour trend-following contemporaries. So unique perhaps only Jacques Brel found the verb for it.","Jacques Brel, the most famous pop culture Belgian who never made a direct-to-video kickboxing feature about\n\ clones, sang in ...

Carbon Glacier,Laura Veirs,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9935e6ef95969321437/1:1/w_160/239effd4.jpg,2004-03-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8524-carbon-glacier/,Bella Union,"You've spent the day wasting; traipsing through the back alleys and vacant side-streets of the city, peering through the windows of empty thrift stores and boarded-up bookshops. On the route home, you wander through the weekend rush-hour with a disc full of sad songs on your CD-R. You watch the grizzled faces of passers-by, groaning and wincing into their wallets; the sportswear-clad kids making fake male poses to each single girl they see; the dispossessed park-benchers, clutching cheap supermarket booze and silently screaming out, ""Fuck the world."" There's something comforting about surveying such sights with just a solitary voice reverberating through your headphones, siphoning out the sounds of a thousand strangers' voices and focusing upon one woman's restless muse. It's like hearing a voice that's been lost in the crowd, taken and amplified to drown out all that lies in its periphery until on its own, it sounds lonely, strange and fearlessly beautiful. Laura Veirs' first album, Troubled by the Fire, was a beguiling infant of a record; a slow hug of furnace-warmth and lilting grace that reveled in romance and lovestruck simplicity, striding down a similar, country-flecked path to songwriters such as Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams. However, on this follow-up, Veirs treads a vastly different path, producing an album of opaque, wintered laments that evoke the cold, jagged landscape of the Colorado Rockies that formed this Seattle-based songwriter's childhood. The mood is evoked with arresting results. Playing with the same kind of geeky, grad-school persona as Liz Phair on Exile in Guyville, yet with a hauntedness similar to Chan Marshall or Kristin Hersh, songs such as the beat-less outsider blues of ""Chimney Sweeping Man"" stalk with controlled, simmering psychosis (""Maybe you thought I'd be president with my Cheshire grin.../ Well, I'm a lowland forest resident""). With its cross-stitched guitar-line, sprinklings of synthetic ambience and lyrics snatched from stream-of-consciousness journal entries, the opening ""Ether Sings"" is starkly beautiful. Much of this is due to the credible production work of sometime Modest Mouse/Howe Gelb collaborator Tucker Martine; whose bare and simplistic arrangements still bear enough edge and interest so as not to dull the listener into passivity. As Veirs' voice reaches its angel-sweet peak on the chorus to ""Rapture"", a strange, descending vibraphone emerges, conjuring an air of stargazed self-discovery. Veirs' songwriting and Martine's intuitive production reach their combined peak on the wonderfully distant ""Salvage a Smile""-- ironically the album's shortest track. Above a flurry of urgently-plucked, overdriven guitar and Veirs' despondent poetry, experimental stringsman Eyvind Kang creates a wonderful cacophony of human despair and strained dissonance. Unfortunately, where the album surpasses its predecessor in terms of songcraft and musicality, it lacks the same hand-held warmth. This is not simply due to the dour, disaffected subject matter; on ""Icebound Stream"", Veirs sounds so detached and impenetrable that the listener is left without any empathy for the song or its orator. Furthermore, as anyone who's ever tried to write in a free-flowing, stream-of-consciousness style knows, 90% of what comes out is hideous self-indulgence. While much of Carbon Glacier avoids this charge due to strong editing, one can't help but think how Veirs can possibly sing ""Rapture"", with its line, ""Doesn't the tree write great poetry?"", and not want to tie her own face in knots. These flaws come as the result of an ambition that has not yet been fully realized, but cannot detract from the fact that Carbon Glacier is a cold, beautiful and engaging record that translates the bleak, isolated vastness of nature into the bleak, isolated vastness of the modern city-sprawl, leaving one voice to sing in solitude. If only more records sounded this alone.","You've spent the day wasting; traipsing through the back alleys and vacant side-streets of the city, peering through the ...

It's not unusual for iconic bands to lay claim to slabs of otherwise communal land (see Liverpool, Memphis, etc.), and the Beach Boys have long seized control of the Pacific shore, perpetuating unbreakable notions of harmony, jangle, and perfectly sugared sun-melodies. Californian upstarts Dios not only play psychedelic beach-pop, they're also natives of the Beach Boys' hometown of Hawthorne-- a collision of coincidence that would have rendered them annoyingly Californian were they not so independently great. Fusing squeaky electronics with acoustic guitars and soft, breathy vocals, Dios are dry and spacy, as indebted to Neil Young as they are to Brian Wilson. Constantly shifting focus-- from earnest folk-singing to found-sound experimenting to deliquescent indie psych-pop-- Dios are also stubbornly contemporary, a quirky, whimsical bit of California past, present and future. Brothers Joel and Kevin Morales sing and play guitar, and their harmonies are expectedly copasetic, complimentary in the way that only siblings' voices ever are. Backed by keyboardist Jimmy Cabez DeVaca, bassist J.P. Caballero, and drummer Jackie Monzon, Dios occasionally sound like the only proper soundtrack to your local schoolyard: playful, energetic, and sorta bizarre, with more than enough ups-and-downs to power every last see-saw. Opener ""Nobody's Perfect"" eases from aimless synth zaps into a sweet acoustic melody, periodically punctuated by a handful of piano notes and perfectly carried by Morales' able coo; like contemporaries Beachwood Sparks and All Night Radio, Dios playfully fiddle with listener-expectation, flip-flopping between nicely comprehensible pop and fuzzed-out bursts of psychedelic weirdness. ""All Is Said and Done"" has a brassy AM-radio glow, with a chorus of la-la-la-la breaking up already soft, hazy vocals; the jingling ""You'll Get Yours"" is a yawning bit of psych-rock, complete with totally random handclaps. Dios openly admit to an irrational interest in the Beach Boys, reportedly insisting that their international paperwork be inked in the same diner where the Wilsons signed their contracts, and even launching into an exaggerated homage to Pet Sounds' ""You Still Believe in Me"" towards the end of ""50 Cents"". Harmony-heavy tracks like ""The Uncertainty"" point towards their hometown heroes as well, but Dios are far from another mediocre Beach Boys cover band: Without ever attempting to reinvent California, Dios manage to make its pop a little less predictable.","If writers were allowed to draw maps, America would be promptly re-proportioned according to its most prosaic cultural mythology: The ...

Ornette!,Ornette Coleman,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a622ea9e61561daa52d5/1:1/w_160/b1f16da7.gif,2004-03-11 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1545-ornette/,AtlanticAtlantic,"When you wander the streets of New York at night alone, every street urchin and clammy prostitute will eventually sidle up to you and relate some story about that wild year when he or she was an avant-garde jazz luminary. You just have to politely smile, pay for the dope, and explain that playing no music while living in total degradation is not avant-garde. The term ""avant-garde"" itself has slaughtered millions in its lifetime. It means absolutely nothing, and any review that uses it ought to be immediately ignored. Whether you're talking about Frank Zappa or the AACM, allegedly avant-garde music has always pretended to challenge hegemony, structure and foundation. And it's rarely succeeded because true liberation probably doesn't mean dressing like Bleep the Silver Robot or constructing labyrinthine geometrical diagrams to prove your music is as improvisational as you claim it is. I feel bad saying it, but Ornette Coleman is among the handful of true avant-garde artists. He invented the goddamn garde using only an alto sax while everyone else was still in diapers toying around with modality. Though he was deemed a dangerous heretic throughout his career, he never expressly assailed tonality or tradition as some sort of macho athlete or vigilant revolutionary (despite his frequently apocalyptic album titles). He played as he felt. If his music required wading into harmonic or rhythmic conventions, so be it. Art should be about the subtleties and fluctuations of life, not formal constraints or attempts to repeal them. In proving his point, he released six of the greatest jazz albums of all time, starting with 1959's Twins and ending with 1961's Ornette on Tenor. Ornette!, the penultimate album of Coleman's Atlantic era, came after 1960's Free Jazz, which had been the biggest leap in improvisation music since (at least) Kind of Blue and basically restructured the rest of modern music for the next several decades. A tough act to follow. Nevertheless, the attempt is certainly valiant: this permutation of the Quartet retains half of the performers from Free Jazz, with Don Cherry on trumpet, Scott LaFaro on bass, and Ed Blackwell on drums. Split into four cuts, Ornette! doesn't begin as much as it thrusts you in mid-spiral. Coleman's reeling, rasping abrasion is already plaiting Cherry's whinnying lunges and half-drunk two-steps. Blackwell breaks down into simmering cymbals which become progressively more militant, seeming just a few steps removed from kneading funk. LeFaro's bass is anticipatory and ethereal at some points, eerie and alluring at others. His bass might as well be made of clay since every time he touches it, the tones harden and remain imprinted for the rest of the 16\xBD-minute song. By the end, these echoes and traces form elaborate riffs that sprawl below Coleman and Cherry's upper registers. Although it was recorded only months before LeFaro's untimely death, ""C&D;"" features a bowed bass that's equally adept at frantic gypsy dervishes as it is at slumping, slinking subtlety. And even though this is supposed to be almost entirely improvisational music, ""W.R.U.""'s climax is deployed with such vigor that it's hard to believe Coleman wasn't bending the rules a bit: His alto grows increasingly violent and agitated, and then his breathing is restored, paced, elongated, and laced with some sort of orgasmic or epiphanic overtones. Blackwell is typically a bit of an unreliable drummer, but at least on his solo, ""T&T;"", he delivers a meditative, dexterous African rhythm. Coleman and Cherry dangle around a cracked, low tone, smoothly segueing from taut frowns to gaping smiles. Though Blackwell is the most traditional of the four participants, he musters enough intentional awkwardness to leave drawling gaps and drowsy brushes all over the session outtake, ""Proof Readers"". Throughout, Coleman is seductive and charming, sometimes venturing into brief moments that could pass as showtunes. Fortunately, there's always enough skronks to stave off monotony or mawkishness. Tones are preserved, whether fragile or booming, before being called off at the brink of shrillness. It's another impressive, comfortable record by someone who knows that racket extraordinarily well. It may not quite match the audacity and shock value of Free Jazz, but when you've just razed the scaffolds of structured music, it's probably as good as you're going to get.",,8.8,
Candi Staton,Candi Staton,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65a9d034d5c69bf34fa/1:1/w_160/64c8e644.jpg,2004-03-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7741-candi-staton/,Astralwerks,"I'm not sure if I should explicitly blame NAFTA for this, or just chalk it up to yet another case of outsourcing, but the States' fine musical heritage continues to be sold back to us by the more attuned tastemakers in Japan, Germany, Italy, and England. The Brits, with that sterling exchange rate and unequivocal love of-- as one music journal states it-- ""American Negro Music"" continue to kill us with our once-exported music. Late last year, the excellent Country Got Soul comp, which compiled homegrown redneck-soul, swamp-sludged funk, and proto-Outlaw tracks, was released in England, and labels like Kent and Ace (not to mention Soul Jazz) regularly dig through our American R&B; and soul vaults and repackage them for new ears in the digital age. While previous releases on the London-based Honest Jon's label at least looked to their isle's own for tasteful calypso and dancehall sides, they've now turned their attention to the crucial work done down at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, at the end of the 60s' pipe dream and on through the 70s' rough soul-survivalism. Behind only the mighty Stax label and house band in terms of Top 40 success, they churned out gritty Southern soul at a pill and whiskey-fueled pace. The consistency of this powerhouse and stable of artists deserved documentation beyond the Percy Sledge, Etta James, and Aretha Franklin sides continually sold to Big Chillers. Though her record has now been reissued Stateside as well-- on Astralwerks, of all labels-- it was Honest Jon's that first brought attention to this 26-track collection of songs from forgotten vocalist Candi Staton, whose vocal range falls squarely between the Queen of Soul and Marie Queenie Lyons. Reared on church singing and gospel groups, and ironically ignoring her voice to raise a family with an abusive preacher's son, one fateful night out brought her to the attention of singer Clarence Carter and ultimately the owner of Fame Studios, where she would record all of these sides. As love returns as an album-length theme (everyone from Outkast to Superpitcher has recently succumbed to its onus), here it comes in three-minute chunky cuts, world-wise beyond Staton's years. In each of her songs, love is cast as irrational, temporal, and sinful. There are at least four cheating songs, none of them shying away from their awful truths. And then there's love as sweet entanglement, rendered in the South's down-home fetter metaphors of the chain, the prison, the fishhook, and the puppet string. And let's not leave out that love is also without age or legal boundary, as songs like ""I'd Rather Be an Old Man's Sweetheart (Than a Young Man's Fool)"" and ""Another Man's Woman, Another Woman's Man"" lay out explicitly. The earlier tracks are tougher, with muscular bass and snares like rifle shots, as Staton testifies, pleads, and cries until she's hoarse, boasts, or else shouts aloud her tales of love gone bad or love too good to last. I return more to the middle of this set, though, to the country comforts of Candi's interpretations of soul as well as country standards as her voice finds new nuances in the worn words. Her rasp elevates ""That's How Strong My Love Is"" to the same level as Otis Redding and O.V. Wright's own takes. Though I may be more familiar with Patsy Cline's heartbreaking loss on ""He Called Me Baby"", Staton's strength makes known the more redemptive side of the song. With the addition of string sections that come later to the Muscle Shoals sound, ""Stand by Your Man"" is sharper than the syrupy Tammy Wynette original. And Staton's vocal performance on ""In the Ghetto"" even wrought fanmail from Elvis himself. 26 tracks is a bit much to get through in one sitting, but the compilers have mixed it all up nicely, the slow-boiling, gospel-based ballads leading into the more ecstatic brassy blasts and natural funk of the uptempo tracks. And given that even the least-crucial songs feature a tough backing band and a powerful, raspy performance from Candi, that's a lot of soul for your diminished-value U.S. buck.","I'm not sure if I should explicitly blame NAFTA for this, or just chalk it up to yet another ...

How else to explain the lone instrumental track that makes up the entirety of this record, chugging for one hour with no climax and just a handful of variations? Even at its most droning, this isn't a new age record that syncs up your brain waves and cycles you to a cloud-breaking revelation; nor is it straight jazz, as the rhythmic pulse is this record's dominant attribute. Instead, it's an excitingly monotonous long-form work that holds its rewards close to the vest. Drive By is only the trio's latest disc-long piece. Chris Abrahams fronts the band on keyboard, droning organ and a smattering of glass-etchingly resonant piano, but the rhythm section drives this date, with Lloyd Swanton playing a select few different riffs on upright bass and Tony Buck displaying robotic endurance on drums and shakers. And even though The Necks work routinely in the hour-long format, they can still turn it into an event: Drive By ramps up portentously and then plows ahead like an engine, until (spoiler warning:) it wraps up like a puff of air at the finish. The clarity of their playing actually makes the disc something of a hard read. Minimalist music can drown you in tones, until the smallest details poke out like shadings in the instruments' wood; other bands' jams show signs of fatigue or clear arcs and releases, no matter how repetitious the music. But The Necks give up nothing. Any flaws or limits are hidden, and they draw your attention to the music instead of the means: You never get the idea that they're playing for an hour to prove that they can do it, or to showcase a glut of ideas, but simply to give you the pleasure of focusing on music in extreme detail. The music doesn't mesmerize as much as it propels: Either because of the title or because I listen to this on my hour-long highway commute, the piece reminds me of a long drive on a straight road, with only a handful of distractions. Listen to how gradually Abrahams veers from the course to improvise, less like a jazzman leaning in for a solo than a dog leaning its head out a car window; meanwhile, when Swanton revisits an early bass riff it sounds like a major milestone, even though he's absorbed right back into the flow. The biggest events are the flashes of beauty along the way, not arranged narratively so much as dropped intuitively like landmarks-- tapes of crickets, the sound of children, and most of all, the wide-skyed, transcendent primary melody that Abrahams states just a few times, which sounds like a snippet of Joe Jackson's ""Steppin' Out"". It's to their credit that even these touches don't ""pretty up"" the album or force the way you interpret it, and you can take it as transcendent or mindless, ambient or rocking: As the Necks have figured out, you can hear a lot in a piece if you listen long enough.","Sheer bloody-mindedness keeps the band moving.

La Maison de Mon Reve,CocoRosie,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6feea9e61561daa54bd/1:1/w_160/30b360c8.jpg,2004-03-10 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1756-la-maison-de-mon-reve/,Touch and Go,"There's nothing wrong with superficiality. The theatrical arts are all about poses. Office politics in America practically mandate that employees wear a glossy veneer to hide their true, often contemptuous feelings for each other. Heck, even us Pitchfork writers aren't entirely genuine: We don't actually like reviewing music; most of us are just in it for the sex. For musicians with star ambitions, a well-practiced public facade is an evil necessity; it's what divides mainstream from underground. The shortest (if not only) route to pop stardom is to lube-up and fake your way through the capricious and unapologetic record industry gauntlet. Play your public relations cards right, and you may one day earn an outside shot at winning a contract with a major label subdivision. From there, you're at the mercy of American teenagers. And yet, there are those who proudly wear the makeup but manage to smuggle some illegal substance underneath. Björk, Beck, and the Smashing Pumpkins all had at least one great album to their credit in the last decade that were nothing if not MTV-ready. CocoRosie, a Parisian vocal duo comprised of sisters Sierra and Bianca Cassidy, may one day be such a group. Judging by their promotional 8x10s, in which the sisters purse for the camera doused in copious amounts of Cabaret-style rouge and mascara, they've already got the makeup part down pat. Brace yourself for a high school French reprise: CocoRosie have a verifiable case of Francophilia. La Maison de Mon Reve translates literally to ""the house of my dream,"" and the title is just the beginning: The album was recorded in Paris in the springtime, and beams with all the lazy romanticism of an unemployed Upper East-Sider on expat life-delay. But never mind the superficial reasons for disliking the Cassidy sisters; not just any bored globetrotters could pull something this elegant and sonically intriguing out of their trust-funded asses. Musically speaking, La Maison de Mon Reve is an ingratiating album that suffers only from its sometimes overbearing affectation. The familial duo have garnered vast acclaim for their effortless melding of blues and hip-hop, a putatively groundbreaking bridge that CocoRosie are far from the first to cross. Relatively speaking, blues and hip-hop share a lot in common; crooning fragile melodies over boombox beats isn't going to cure cancer, now or ever. In fact, what CocoRosie have done with original source material on La Maison de Mon Reve is essentially what Danger Mouse attempted to do with existing music on his lauded The Grey Album: They've overdubbed two styles of music, generationally removed but deceptively similar, and the result is closer to the mean of its parts than the sum. That doesn't stop the Cassidy sisters from crooning unabashedly within the cozy walls of this cold-water flat. On paper, some of the lyrics are doggone cringe-worthy, but lines like, ""I fell in love with you/ Just because the sky turned from grey to blue,"" and, ""All I want with my life/ Is to be a housewife,"" are delivered passionately enough to slide by unnoticed. The particularly guileless ""By Your Side"" and ""Butterscotch"" are even more impressive for their ability to transcend their shortcomings. Like any truly cosmopolitan city, La Maison de Mon Reve draws from a rich past of diffuse influences while simultaneously seeking to make use of modern resources. That much is apparent from the opening cut, ""Terrible Angels"", a bucolic blues paean that slyly incorporates sporadic synth blips and what sounds like the metallic squeal of a rusted swingset. Delta blues is a prominent influence throughout the album, and the backwater vocals are coolly affected and instantly appealing. Unfortunately, the Cassidys' entreaties wear thin over repeated listens. Both sisters possess the type of coy yet wracked and powerful voice that has vaulted artists like Fiona Apple and Nelly Furtado to stardom, even while the band's roots are planted in the indie loam, right beside their Touch & Go compatriots TV on the Radio. A lot of words have been wasted trying pigeonhole this album into a genre, and the general consensus seems to be that La Maison de Mon Reve is impossible to define outside its own Bohemian splendor. If you're trapped in a Parisian idyll, maybe, but here in suburbia, the album is about as romantic as a clod of freshly mown grass. CocoRosie are transparent and derivative, yet immensely promising. If they can overcome the insular boundaries of their make-believe world, they might one day produced something utterly spectacular. But they're in no hurry; was a woman who thought she was well-dressed ever cold?","There's nothing wrong with superficiality. The theatrical arts are all about poses.

Scissor Sisters,Scissor Sisters,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6599d034d5c69bf34f6/1:1/w_160/55e0c33d.jpg,2004-03-10 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7740-scissor-sisters/,Polydor,"There's something about the kitchen-sink approach to music that makes me suspicious. Excessive genre-hopping or wearing stylistic flexibility as a badge is often considered honorable or even proof of an artist's restless, boundless talent. Yet when this approach is put under a microscope, the choice to aim for a variety of different sounds often seems like a mask for artists unable to do any one thing particularly well. A lot of the initial praise garnered by Scissor Sisters stemmed from their oscillation between what many consider to be disparate styles: To be reductive, those are rollicking early 70s Elton John-esque pop songs and buoyant disco. However, on their self-titled debut, Scissor Sisters not only do quite a few genres justice-- not least of which is witty, irreverent pop songs-- but both their idiosyncratic approach to music and their sensibilities seem to have common roots in glam-era rock or Philly soul. On the face of it, that's an odd blend. Unless you're Ryan Adams, Homer Simpson, or those bearded fellows in Kings of Leon, you aren't likely of the mindset that rock achieved perfection in 1974. But the Sisters embrace the playfulness and panache of that era's artists-- from Sparks and Elton, to 10cc and Mott the Hoople, to The Spinners and, um, Pink Floyd-- and come out smelling like roses. Here, the Sisters skip smartly through glam's linear history, and stray far enough from the beaten path to discover a sound of their own, all while resisting the sacrifice of context for pantomime. With one part arched eyebrows and droll wit, and one part melancholia and sharp social observation, the Sisters' debut is bursting with golden moments. To the disappointment of some, large portions of the Scissor Sisters' highly circulated and heavily dancefloor-leaning demo has been either re-recorded or exorcised from the final cut, but the retail version outstrips the demo by a mile. ""Doctor (I'm Only Seeing Dark)"", ""Backwoods"", and ""Bicycling with the Devil"" in particular are missed, but with their inclusion, the finished product would likely have been a far more schizophrenic affair. Instead, the Sisters' debut hangs together well, despite sounding at times more like a career-spanning singles compilation than a cohesive work. (Although, in this MP3 era, where's the harm in that?) Debut single ""Laura"", with its overflow of rollicking piano and wah-wah guitar, is the hyper-jovial opener. Break-up song ""Better Luck"" and the falsetto-drenched disco cover of ""Comfortably Numb"" (what might have been had Pink Floyd followed their classic rock contemporaries into late 70s disco tourism) are the dancing-with-tears-in-your-eyes tracks. ""Tits on the Radio"" is New York's best protest dance song since !!!, and ""Lovers in the Backseat"" is a gold lamé-draped take on voyeurism. ""Mary"" and ""It Can't Come Quickly Enough"", meanwhile, are the 4 a.m. ballads, contenders for the night's penultimate spin before ""Last Dance"" soundtracks the queue at the coat check. Best of all are ""Take Your Mama"" and ""Return to Oz"". The former is a clever Primal Scream-meets-""Freedom '90"" suggestion to come out to your mother during a night on the town. The latter is a weary, hungover ballad lamenting the influence of crystal meth on the gay nightclub scene (""What once was Emerald City's/ Now a crystal town""). In combination, those two tracks delightfully reveal that under Scissor Sisters' sheen of fabulousness and irresistible hooks beats a heart that breaks as easily as it bursts, and that's a sort of versatility that can't be easily concocted.","There's something about the kitchen-sink approach to music that makes me suspicious.

It's Always 1999,Mindflayer,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c435ea9e61561daa80ce/1:1/w_160/add1e9e0.gif,2004-03-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5544-its-always-1999/,Load,"Really, you only need a couple folks to make a boatload of skree. Seriously, cut the dead weight. Brave? Follow the solitary examples set by Merzbow, Jim O'Rourke, Keiji Haino, Tyondai Braxton, et al, and break eardrums by your high lonesome. And if the rugged solo thing isn't up your alley then consider the toxic chemistry that emerges when two artists decide to stop just short of a trio. At least in the more rambunctious rock section of my record collection, two is often the magic number for the creation of the headiest of discombobulation. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking of couplings like Harry Pussy, Climax Golden Twins, The Hospitals, Orthrelm, Hella, Pink & Brown, and godheadSilo. Most likely, though, the first two-person hardcore noise act to jump into post-Oops! minds is Fort Thunder's premiere export, Lightning Bolt. Over the past couple of years, the Providence, RI twosome has uncharacteristically flirted with the musical ""mainstream,"" first via 2001's Ride the Skies and then through the absolute stunner, Wonderful Rainbow. But whatever the hipster down the streets tells you, these high-profile lads were just the tip of an ever growing iceberg. You needn't travel far from there to consider Mindflayer, another Providence one-plus-one battle ax connected to the aesthetically correct Fort Thunder. Comprised of Lightning Bolt drummer/screamer Brian Chippendale and analog electro-terrorist Matt Brinkmann of Forcefield, the pair offer a less psychedelic sandblast, subsisting on lapidary, alien-abduction blast-offs. The change in dosage is largely due to instrumentation. Mindflayer trades bass for a pile of electronic bursts, which means they often sound like they've buried themselves in a flooded basement, surrounded by bright plastic toys and demolished spiderwebs. Where I often imagine the triumphant Lightning Bolt sending its open-ended blitzkrieg down from an ice-capped mountain, Mindflayer's approach is of the murkiest, damaged swamp-monster depths. The duo's hermetically overstuffed take on tribalism lacks the wiggle room to allow for anything as starkly arresting as Wonderful Rainbow's title track, and Lightning Bolt do make better dance music. Despite the obstacles, though, there's something to be said for music this crackly. Bedecked in Happy Flowers' naive art, It's Always 1999 was originally released at the macrolevel in 2001 by Ooo Mau Mau. Recorded prior to last year's first proper recording, its 21 salvos offer a little peak at an ecstatic earlier offering. (To be fair and accurate, the band's been around since 1996, so even when this was put to tape in 1999, they were hardly newcomers.) Enjoyable for its gusto and ramshackle territorial pissing, most of these all-too-brief compositions would benefit from considerably longer lifespans. The abridged tracks like ""Mud Lazer Lazy Lazers"" or ""A Worming Is Coming"" have merit, but feel like tonal exercises or ColecoVision outtakes, not burly rockers. The skeletal ""Argamnimals"" shouts for additional crunk from Lil' Jon. ""Five Minutes of Sporadic Beats"" lies about its length but remains pretty spot-on regarding the rest of its physical make-up. We all know it takes time to unearth transcendence, right? Well, much of the clipped efforts here crash back to earth just when you start nodding elsewhere. Most successfully, ""Revenge of Whales/Whale War""-- part one of a slight, but intriguing series of whale-centric tracks-- builds a rhythm of drum/flange rolls into a towering edifice of torturous Hendrixian feedback. It's a lovely climb, my boys. Less caustic, the fluttering lock-groove of ""1999 Animals Revenge"" is my idea of an unhinged booty jam for over-sexed pterodactyls in Gap t-shirts. And while I'm at it, the equally longwinded ""Psychic Fields of Animal Town"" blows a huge psych bugle into your mind's eye: As the drums pick up in the final few seconds, it's like experiencing a midtempo 80s hardcore show from the bottom of a sweaty pile of wasted delinquents. While It's Always 1999 remains an unrelenting serving of dark stew, it at times wades into the entropic (not always in the positive Melvins-esque or Sleep meaning of the term). There are more highlights, more duds, and some that fit both categories. Still, given the highs and lows, Chippendale and Brinkmann have such a raging dual chemistry that even their unsuccessful overdoses spit and kick and tell you to fuck off like a couple of anarchic hoodlums snuffing out the world on their way home from school.","Really, you only need a couple folks to make a boatload of skree.

Milk Man,Deerhoof,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f39d034d5c69bf3b7e/1:1/w_160/faae86f5.jpg,2004-03-09 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2253-milk-man/,Kill Rock Stars,"If pop is auto mechanics, then over the past few years, Deerhoof have completely unassembled the Benz. Deerhoof's excitement in toying with the building blocks of pop songwriting-- and their characteristically short, almost infantile attention span-- energized Reveille and Apple O' to near-unparalleled levels of melodic potency, while the music's lack of any discernable patterns kept listeners continually stimulated, wondering what might come next. By the time of Apple O's release last year, it was clear that the San Francisco quartet had come to understand the mechanics of melody-making, and, more importantly, that pop, when too saccharine, eats itself. But Deerhoof never compromised their melodies to avoid potential schmaltz; rather, they kept their lines short and to the point, coating the songs with well-placed sheets of noise and fragmented melody. And yet, Deerhoof have never come off calculated or bookish. In fact, they seem to stumble upon their ideas: Their songs are strings of perfectly fortunate accidents, explosive and radioactive, but also instable and always on the verge of self-collapse. At least with automobiles, there's a practical endpoint to mechanical deconstruction, but even with endless possibilities for combination (I wonder what happens when I hook the steering wheel up to the CD player?), one can only tinker for so long before the ideas become elaborate enough that the car must be rebuilt to support them. Deerhoof have reached a similar point in their career. With the exception of Holdy Paws, the band's songs have never seemed to aspire to ""song status""; they were basically well-assembled sequences of simple and powerful ideas-- even one-minute tracks like ""Holy Night Fever"" covered a tremendous amount of musical ground. On Milk Man, Deerhoof harness all they've learned from their previous experiments, and written what may be their first truly conventional songs. Here, they've focused their maniacal energy into seriously dense and carefully considered songwriting; even the cleaner and deeper production betrays Deerhoof's commitment to letting the songs speak for themselves, and to keeping individual parts as precise and undistracting as possible. Greg Saunier's drumming is the most restrained I've ever heard it, while Chris Cohen and John Dieterich-- who are of such one (brilliant) mind that in concert they can play in perfect tandem without ever looking at each other-- find themselves more concerned with static harmonies and more dominant of their precious miasmatic outbursts. Satomi Matsuzaki, meanwhile, has improved considerably as a singer, and is now capable of delivering remarkably complex vocal melodies. And with more developed vocal melodies comes Deerhoof's first crack at meaningful lyrics: Over the course of this record's 11 tracks, Satomi narrates a coherent (if somewhat disturbing) story about a milk man who kidnaps children and hides them in the clouds. So is this Deerhoof's best? Is Milk Man, as SPIN remarked, ""a perfect album?"" It isn't, unfortunately, but the album plays host to what are easily some of Deerhoof's best songs, conventional or otherwise. Four-minute opener ""Milk Man""-- longer than nearly every other song Deerhoof has recorded-- is as much a statement of the album's overall tenor as it is of the band's change of pace: Unaccompanied guitar lines interact confidently, building sparse but lush harmonies that together function as the song's recurring theme. The keyboard, which was noticeably absent from Apple O', returns here with remarkable subtlety, a respondent to Satomi's pristine melody. The internal interactions within the song-- as opposed to the external reactions of the band members-- are the focal point of ""Milk Man"", possibly Deerhoof's finest moment. ""Desaparecere"" may be as good as the title track. Set to a drum machine, the quiet song boasts Milk Man's most complex harmonies, built entirely from keyboard sounds and Satomi's razor-sharp Spanish delivery and glissandi. Not a note is out of place. The song marks the first time Deerhoof have indulged so openly in the clicks-and-cuts of minimalist beatmaking, and it's done to beautiful effect. ""C"", originally released on seven-inch in 2002, finds a place on the album perhaps for its similar degree of restraint; here, Deerhoof experiment with slow, static harmony composition and phaseshifted white noise, as Satomi squeaks out a poignant minor-key melody and Greg taps out frantic snare rolls. What's most noteworthy about ""C"" is its terrifying use of space, particularly in the moment before a tense guitar chord is resolved by Satomi restating her melody on keyboard. The three songs I mention above-- and to a lesser extent ""Giga Dance"" and ""Milking""-- are simply fantastic; the rest of Milk Man, however, performs at a frustratingly lower level. The instrumental ""Rainbow Silhouette of the Milky Rain"" boasts a brilliant, spidery guitar duet in 3/4 time, but is otherwise an incongruous, ill-conceived medley of mediocre riffs and uninteresting drumming, while ""Dog on the Sidewalk"" seems completely pointless, an unusual misstep for Deerhoof. And the album's last four tracks, while hardly offensive, sound somehow unfinished in comparison to the album's high points. Milk Man is certainly not some point of no return for Deerhoof-- they certainly aren't locked into writing in this more conventional style, just as they weren't locked in after the similarly song-oriented Holdypaws. The band is too committed to growing as musicians and writing better songs not to revisit the rambunctious Reveille and Apple O' woodsheds for inspiration. Milk Man not only testifies to how potent those sessions proved, but also to how successfully the band can step back and craft those rabid ideas into impressive songs without devitalizing them.","If pop is auto mechanics, then over the past few years, Deerhoof have completely unassembled the Benz.

Not Overtly Orchestral,Loop Orchestra,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc5abf31b7dc715600b/1:1/w_160/edac00c0.jpg,2004-03-09 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4958-not-overtly-orchestral/,Quecksilber,"There was a time not so very long ago when analog tape machines were the bleeding edge of music technology. Soon after, magnetic tape came into use and set experimentalists like John Cage and the French concréte crew to work figuring out all the weird shit to be done with recorded sound. At some point in those heady days, the tape loop became part of the new music composer's orchestra, and during the late 50s and 60s, composers like Terry Riley, Steve Reich and Pauline Oliveros were using the technique to make some pretty incredible music. The tools and technology of the modernist 50s have come to be seen as quaint and arcane, and when they're deployed now, their very age becomes part of their appeal. The idea of a collective working exclusively with tape loops is like a baroque chamber group dedicated to period instruments. Australia's five-man collective The Loop Orchestra is such a throwback. Live and on record, they work with analog tape loops and analog tape loops only. They've been around in various incarnations for over 20 years, but Not Overtly Orchestral is only their third album. The back cover of Not Overtly Orchestral excites me. There's a picture of two open reel decks set fifteen or so feet apart in some sparse warehouse, and stretched between them is a loop of \xBC"" tape. This photo makes me realize that The Loop Orchestra would be extra great as a live act, with a stage full of beautiful machines spinning out tendrils of sound in all directions. Still, this particular CD is an excellent consolation prize. The general M.O. here is to introduce and layer various loops, ride the faders so the mix is constantly in flux, and then tear the music back down at the track's end. It's a simple technique that's been done a million times, but experience has taught The Loop Orchestra how to find loops that work well together and complement the overall intentions of each specific piece. ""Son of Not Overtly Orchestral"" combines phrases of symphonic music of various lengths with some reversed radio static. The varying duration of the loops causes the piece to warble to and fro unexpectedly, so that each cycle brings a different combination to the foreground. ""Radiophony"" is sourced from materials nicked from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, so it's filled with old synths and sound effects. These loops are shorter and more numerous, so the entire track seems like a tightly choreographed vibrating cluster. ""Gam"", which uses bells and electrical interference among other identifiable sounds, is fast and percussive and, fittingly, of pop song length. The 16-minute closer ""Profiles"" is the most ominous track on the collection, with vocal samples that sound pained, bordering on demonic, some nasty bird calls, and a noisy train of backing noise that makes me think of a world in serious trouble. The Loop Orchestra remind me a bit of Philip Jeck in the way they use old technology to evoke the hazy dreams of another time. Consisting as it does of cycled fragments of sound, Not Overtly Orchestral can on the one hand be slotted alongside current electronic music that makes heavy use of repetition. But The Loop Orchestra's sources are old and creaky without any hint of a digital edge. Everything about the sounds is antiquated, and yet the music remains oddly timeless, ""classic"" in the realm of modern experimental music.","There was a time not so very long ago when analog tape machines were the\n\ bleeding edge of music ...

Soviet Kitsch,Regina Spektor,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a658b1335d7bf1698de8/1:1/w_160/3e7361e0.jpg,2004-03-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7739-soviet-kitsch/,Shoplifter,"Regina Spektor is, without a doubt, the most talented representative of New York's antifolk scene, although calling her that is like calling the current outbreak of bird flu Asia's least deadly epidemic. I'm an unapologetic relativist when it comes to music, so Spektor's alliance with the repulsive likes of The Moldy Peaches does color my perception of her. Antifolk's modus operandi is to masquerade drooling insolence as outsider art, but the unholy progeny of Tiny Tim and Beat Happening have a pretty good thing going, because it's absolutely impossible to approach them with any objective criterion of quality. Regina Spektor doesn't need that coat of post-modern protection. Her songs are clever and touching in any context, and her technical prowess is considerable: A girl from a good Russian-Jewish family (her father comes to her shows), she's put her inevitable piano lessons to good use. Spektor does, however, constantly employ a trick I consider dirty: She reaches her audience's ears and heartstrings through feigned naivete. The I'm-just-a-wee-lass stance is apparent throughout *Soviet Kitsch, as well as her live performances, where she's been known to pout and giggle and murmur and feed the crowd chocolates; what the Russians call * manernost' is her only liability, but it's badly holding her back. Take the best song on the record, ""Ghost of Corporate Future""; this exquisitely structured number steadily spirals up from a plinky opening to a majestic finish, from a street sketch to a Big Statement on life and how to live it. ""Everything is plastic/ And everyone's sarcastic/ And all your food is frozen/ And it needs to be defrosted,"" sings Spektor in an inimitable mix of horror and wonderment. But watch the whimsy go to work: ""Maybe you should cut your own hair/ 'Cause that would be so funny/ It doesn't cost any money/ And it always grows back."" Spektor delivers ""funny"" in a kindergarten squeak that would only be accessible to the rest of us through regression therapy; this kind of stuff only works live, and then in measures. In the studio, it's murder: Even if Regina's mannerisms are totally spontaneous, guess what? They won't be by your third listen. Other songs suffer a similar fate. There's a wealth of great material here-- ""Carbon Monoxide"", the expansive ""Chemo Limo"", ""Your Honor"" with its sudden outbursts of punk thrash-- all diminished, to various degrees, by genre affectations. When Regina's not belting Billie, she's cooing Tori, or vamping up elastic Bronx vowels; although there's no Russian accent to speak of, Spektor's occasional Björk-isms compound the cuteness. Soviet Kitsch, which was deliberately intended as a minor release, is currently enjoying a wider audience than it appears to have been made for. Some of it has to do with Julian Casablancas' dabbling in arts patronage: Spektor opened for The Strokes on their European tour dates and duets on the inconsequential ""Reptilia"" B-side ""Modern Girls and Old-Fashioned Men"". I'm reminded of the way David Bowie parades around his admiration for Daniel Johnston: Spektor is becoming a unit of freak-cred currency. Except in this case, the ball is still in her court; she can still walk out of the corner into which the circumstance and alliances are painting her, with wits and talent intact.","Regina Spektor is, without a doubt, the most talented representative of New York's antifolk scene, although\n\ calling her ...

Franz Ferdinand,Franz Ferdinand,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be7dc0084474cd0c2ec5/1:1/w_160/92f891b0.jpg,2004-03-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3279-franz-ferdinand/,Domino,"With the cash from the Thesaurus Musicarum sales snowing in, Editor-in-Chief Ryan Schreiber decided to treat the entire staff of Pitchfork to a weekend retreat at Steamers, a Finnish bath/scat fetish ""bunny ranch"" in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Having just completed principle photography on a documentary biopic detailing my creative life, I decided to tag along despite no longer feeling part of the team. Due to seniority, Ryan gave me the back bench on the bus. As the fresh writers swapped customized iPod skins and debated the cultural impact of Xiu Moo, I counted passing silos while listening to worn Britpop mix cassettes and neurotically rubbing the growing bald spot on my scalp. Ryan slipped in next to me. He pulled a maroon jewelry box from his Member's Only. ""I was going to wait to give this to you,"" he said. ""Oh, I, thanks,"" I said. Inside the box sat a green lapel pin shaped like the number six laid over Poseidon's trident. ""It's a service pin. It's jade,"" Ryan said. ""Yeah, I get the joke. I just don't see why six years is an anniversary to celebrate,"" I said. ""That's how long the Pixies were around. Besides, I wanted to ask you to write a new review,"" he said. ""Ah, Jesus, man, I knew there was a catch,"" I sighed. ""No, no, hear me out. I really want you to do one of your trademark concept reviews. Those always get tons of hits. People love them and hate them,"" he said. ""Ryan, that cow is dried up. It's Gordita meat. I've even done the I'm-not-going-to-do-a-concept-review-anymore concept review,"" I said. ""Hear me out. I'm seeing a comeback for one of your zany characters,"" Ryan said, making stupid TV-producer gestures with his hands. ""I'm seeing the interpretive dancer Santa Schultz, the Revolutionary War soldier Ham Grass, advice columnist Professor Rok, Diapers the glam-loving lab monkey, Justin Davies the bass player of The Hold My Coat, The Bummelgörk, Kelly the Masseuse, Volodrag the Yugoslavian sycophant, Paul Bunyan, Wolfie. Besides, you promised me the Franz Ferdinand review months ago."" He had a point. I had procrastinated on a promise. I looked up the aisle of the bus and spotted Ott hunched over a laptop, biting his tongue and copying studiously from a Thesaurus. No, no, Franz Ferdinand was the perfect vehicle for a comeback. I'm half Hungarian. My family had two dogs named Huszar. I've been looking for a way to work schnauzers and Magyar into a review. It didn't have to be that contrived. The parallels were fluorescent: Franz and I were both stubbornly nostalgic for the decade-gone heights of Britpop. In their silk button-downs and slickly combed hair, the band mimicked the gauche decadence of Suede to such a point that it appeared they were wearing Anderson and Butler's hand-me-down menswear. Each song on their self-titled debut catwalk swaggered with sucked-in cheeks like Alex James' effortless bounce on Blur's ""Girls & Boys"". If that sounds too hopelessly recent and uncool for the hipsters, I could go obtuse and say Franz Ferdinand revive the sounds of the John Cale-era Squeeze or the New York never-weres The Necessaries. I could erroneously throw Franz Ferdinand in with the recent dance-punk, freak-shit, whatever ""scene."" But I'm calling a spade a spade. Call it Scotpop if you feel uncomfortable. Not content to kickstart their career on an album laden mostly with potential, the Glaswegians have banged out a celebratory LP with lyrics bearing surprising satire, wit, and unabashed romance. On the upcoming single, ""Dark of the Matinee"", Alexander Kapranos positions himself as a bitter cynic who eventually gives in to fame (though it may be, as the title suggests, in the dimmer regions of the spotlight) after being charmed by an attractive optimist, and, one would imagine, the unapologetic funk of the track itself. By the last verse, Kapranos imagines himself smiling wide, sitting with Abba-loving AM talk show host Terry Wogan. With their meteoric rise, Franz Ferdinand could very well be within a year of it. They're poised to be the next Duran Duran or the next Pulp. Or they could be the next Menswear. In any case, it will be a spectacle. ""Jacqueline"" opens the album deceivingly with gentle acoustic strums and student poem prattle before raygun guitars and splashing cymbals annihilate any notion of plaintive reflection. Kaparanos soon blurts phrases like ""it's so much better on holiday,"" ""I'm so drunk I don't mind if you kill me,"" ""I'm alive, I'm alive,"" and ""we need the money."" The pace never lets up. Even their breakthrough single, ""Take Me Out"", blatantly changes its mind from Pixies-like pop to squiggly guitar disco a quarter of the way through. Only on ""Cheating on You"" do the drums drop their high-hat riding for stuttering punk. Franz Ferdinand rarely stray far from the dueling-guitars-with-occasional-keyboard approach, granting even the bounciest dance floor numbers pleasantly rough edges, but the final two tracks peak with greater arrangement and studio flourish.

Map of What Is Effortless,Telefon Tel Aviv,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74e13d19756521393a7/1:1/w_160/84760f89.jpg,2004-03-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7963-map-of-what-is-effortless/,Hefty,"At the time of its release in 2001, the liquid, jazz-inflected electronic of Telefon Tel Aviv's Fahrenheit Fair Enough provided welcome respite from IDM's relentlessly brittle and increasingly boring routine. Steeped in the same burbling warmth that defined Scott Herren's pre-Barcelona output as Savath & Savalas, Fahrenheit politely suggested a new direction that electronic music might take, one that relied as heavily on the Rhodes as it did the Cubase VST. Although it wasn't a radical approach, it was enough to differentiate Telefon's languid post-rock from the digital drill bit sounds buzzing out from every other 18 year-old's laptop. Temporarily, anyway. Three years is an eternity in electronic music's timeline; certainly more than enough to expose the inherent limitations in making chillout music for a subset that defined themselves by never going out much to begin with. In 2004, more of Telefon's once-novel blend of digital squiggles and organic arrangements would seem passe, a little late to its own party. So, rather than scale back the soul in their electronic music, Tel Aviv's Joshua Eustis and Charles Cooper downsize the electronic in their soul, in the process adding two singers and re-emerging as a sort of twerkier Zero 7. Where Fahrenheit Fair Enough was entirely instrumental, seven of the nine tracks on Map of What Is Effortless feature vocals. Singing duties are split by Damon Aaron, whose reedy tenor is serviceable but never exceptional, and L'Altra's Lindsay Anderson, whose disaffected vocals-- with only one exception, and only then with the help of some mansized DSP work-- are similarly unremarkable. But even with better performances from its singers, Map of What Is Effortless would still be a deeply flawed record. The reason for this is simple: The addition of vocalists and the move to a song-oriented structure demands better songs, and yet Telefon Tel Aviv continue to lean on immaculately sculpted sonics and massive orchestral swoops for their drama. Without decent source material, the singers are left to languish, and usually, they take the songs with them. Frustratingly, the instrumentals account for two of the album's best three tracks. Opener ""When It Happens It Moves All by Itself"" is a rolling slice of string-noir that invites comparisons to Cinematic Orchestra, while the album's title track contains an achingly bittersweet string motif that builds to a muted climax before slipping nimbly out the backdoor. To be honest, I'm not even sure if the third standout, ""My Week Beats Your Year"", stands out because it's particularly good or simply because it's something other than prettified, meandering neo-soul. Featuring Anderson's icy, mulched vocals, a clapback rhythm and a staccato keyboard line, it plays like Tel Aviv's approximation of a Richard X clubfloor track. But everything else, from the wandering ""I Lied"" (propped up by a well-placed rush of strings) to the stillborn ""What It Was Will Never End"" (propped up by a well-placed surge of guitars), just kind of hopelessly meanders, waiting, as if the arrangements might suddenly do something different to redeem it. Sometimes that happens, but too often, Map of What Is Effortless just plods, one track lazily into another, lukewarm and glazed over, all dressed up, nowhere to go.","At the time of its release in 2001, the liquid, jazz-inflected electronic of Telefon Tel Aviv's Fahrenheit Fair Enough ...

Nonsense Goes Mudslide,Michael Johnson,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3d13d197565213b050/1:1/w_160/6b3c8cf7.gif,2004-03-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4343-nonsense-goes-mudslide/,Must Delicious,"Successful art is as rooted in luck as it is in proven prowess, and sometimes homegrown projects can be just as powerful as million-man productions. No matter how many work hours are ultimately logged manipulating records and tweaking songs into perfect shapes from black leather studio chairs with sweaty-fingered engineers clutching knobs, the odd, unmediated moment of sonic serendipity can never be completely discounted: Nonesense Goes Mudslide, the first solo outing from Holopaw drummer Michael Johnson, is heavy with a kind of accidental grace that simply can't be manually inspired. Packed with peculiar, homemade twists and charmingly bewildered lyrics, the album is a wildly spontaneous and nicely composed platter of sound. Holopaw's self-titled debut was so soft and organic it almost felt edible; the band's yawning pedal steel, swampy electronics, and brisk acoustic strums established a crooked kind of Americana, something imminently more complex than the fetishized, backwards-country yelping of their contemporaries. Nonsense Goes Mudslide opts for a slightly less nostalgic turn, though, pairing Johnson's pert, friendly vocals with quirky electronics and fragile percussion, eschewing earnest acoustic laments in favor of perverse ideological lessons. Still, despite the obvious departures, there's a looseness to the record that mimics, however inadvertently, Holopaw's cowed, scrappy elegance: Each of Johnson's disparate components are laced tightly together, yet Nonsense still continually threatens to collapse on itself, as if any moment could bring the inevitable release of cymbals suddenly popping off their stands and rolling around the room, microphones spontaneously dissembling, and synthesizers shooting open, angular bits of black and white plastic rocketing in every direction. Johnson is nothing if not immensely resourceful, and Nonsense Goes Mudslide is riddled with archaic-sounding pops and snippets of found sound: a phone rings (and rings), someone clears their throat, water rushes, rain trickles, tapes crackle, taut strings bow in and out. Meanwhile, Johnson's sweet, meandering vocals are interrupted by groaning synthesizers and creaky beats. Opener ""Faulty Family"" is a twinkling, sprightly song built around an innocuous recorder line; zaps and claps rise and fall in the background, crafting a bizarre bedroom symphony that always remains surprisingly subtle. ""And Now, The Sequel"" features a synth line drowned in fuzz and plenty of giant drumming; ""The Staring Contest"" (Johnson routinely provides the audio for Staremaster, a Florida-based professional staring contest which has since spawned both a documentary and a national tour) is a fleeting splash of spectral, drowning keys. ""The Natives Going Under"" pits Johnson-in-falsetto against plucked guitar and a lone trumpet swell, before abruptly descending into the throes of quasi-tribal drumbeat and spacy, vaguely psychedelic vocals. Johnson's compositions are quick and impossible to map on paper, flitting relentlessly between styles, tempos, and sounds, a vaguely manic swarm of noise and melody. The resulting songs are disorienting, but lovingly so: like being blindfolded and led around by your best friend. With Holopaw plotting a spring tour with labelmate Iron and Wine, and a new record expected soon, it seems unlikely that Johnson's private experiments will see the exposure they deserve, but Nonsense Goes Mudslide's relative obscurity is an essential part of its charm: lock your front door, turn up the volume, and play every item in your house until you're officially part of the fun.","Successful art is as rooted in luck as it is in proven prowess, and sometimes homegrown projects can be just ...

Regard the End,Willard Grant Conspiracy,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa3a13d19756521399d5/1:1/w_160/8b9975e2.jpg,2004-03-08 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8686-regard-the-end/,Kimchee,"Have you ever wondered whether alt-country is representing its electorate? All these sorry tales of murder, blood-spilt love and the dead cow skulls scattered by gravel roads have become so synonymous with the music of the Midwest and the songs of the South, that it becomes easy to lose perspective. Are the likes of Houston and Omaha really the barren, backwards dustbowl towns you hear of in songs? Are there no people who wear suits, drive foreign cars, sip lattés and read the New York Times while making snide remarks about Bush? Yes, of course there are. So why doesn't the music ever reflect that? The Willard Grant Conspiracy is another clichéd country band, another bunch of blues-ridden, fire-and-brimstone missionaries whose opaque, gothic hymnals add to the myth of Americana. They've never been great, even back to 1998's sort-of well regarded Flying Low, a record that, in retrospect, seems virtually identical to all their others. Now on their fifth record, the band has shown no signs of growth, and the fact that their core partnership of frontman Robert Foster and guitarist Paul Austin is augmented by an alumni of assorted waifs, strays and passers-by (including Kristin Hersh, and members of Lambchop and The Walkabouts) does nothing to alleviate the sameness of what is essentially another set of safe, formulaic ballads for the No Depression set. By all measures, Regard the End is a conventionally ""beautiful"" record. Robert Fisher's bass-tinged voice can stretch from meek and tender to intense and bellowing, with an aged wisdom that adds grace and gravity to tracks like the near-Celtic lament ""Beyond the Shore"". They've also got the knack for ""tasteful"" arrangements. On the pompously titled ""Ghost of the Girl in the Well"", guitars strum and shimmer in line with Foster's voice while a bored rhythm section reminds the band to stay awake. Strings sway, shiver, and flail helplessly, reaching for a heartstring to grab. Yet, for the most part, The Willard Grant Conspiracy are grabbing at thin air. On tracks like ""Rosalee"", you're stunned by the utterly formulaic approach to some of the songwriting. As an acoustic guitar sparks up its folksy strum, Foster dictates a tale of a girl that refuses to speak with all the melodic distinctiveness of a Dave Matthews tune, before a violin takes its cue, embellishing the song with some unnecessary attention-seeking. This cycle repeats itself for 3\xBD minutes before stumbling to a failed, idea-drained finish. And then there's the suffering-- lots of it, all over the album-- not all of which belongs to the bored-to-tears listener. On closing track ""The Suffering Song"", Foster moans about how ""mother's got a few days left/ She thinks it's time we all learnt to pray."" And as the song climbs to its climax, with the rousing chorus of ""suffering's going to come to everyone someday,"" you certainly get the sense that, well, he might be suffering a bit. But suffering from what? What infuriates most about this record is not its rigid predictability, its absence of invention or its reliance on tired-out alt-country clichés; it's the fact that throughout Regard the End, the songs rely on only the vaguest utterances of emotion, amounting to little more than a bad landscape painting-- all grand brushstrokes, no substance or detail. It seems that the band is fully competent of evoking a mood, but incapable of articulating why. Rarely has a genre sounded so tried and tired, so forced, formulaic and reliant on its own mythology as country music is made to sound on Regard the End. Though its application and musicianship is admirable, its lack of lyrical argument or narrative leave us with a canon of paceless funereal laments that conjure endless feelings of enforced sadness without explanation. In a field full of fellow lovesick souls, these are failings we simply shouldn't have to accept.","Have you ever wondered whether alt-country is representing its electorate?

"Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes",TV on the Radio,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a839ea9e61561daa5783/1:1/w_160/63986229.jpg,2004-03-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8197-desperate-youth-blood-thirsty-babes/,Touch and Go,"The word I keep hearing for this band is ""soulless."" It's true that the Young Liars EP had a metallic sheen, a mechanical repetitiveness that both boosted and encased the silver-throated vocals of Tunde Adebimpe. The songs were full of distance and voyeurism, as if Adebimpe was stuck on his own satellite, watching lovers from afar. When he got close to a woman, on the stunning soliloquy ""Blind"", he couldn't close the deal without giving up the truth: ""My love is a suckerbet."" But that ain't soulless. Another description that never rang true was the comparison of Adebimpe's voice to Peter Gabriel-- a decent match in timbre, but Adebimpe's such a different person that I just can't hear the likeness. This isn't a man who would go on stage dressed like a flower. Instead, Adebimpe sounds like a superhero-- a troubled, Batman-style superhero, who can rescue the girl but frets over whether to take the grateful French kiss when they hit safe ground. Nobody with his talents and forthrightness could also have insecurities, yet that was what the lyrics made us believe. His vocals resonate because of his identity: He towers over most vocalists, not just for his skill, but because he's so transparent behind it. The band's full-length debut may be one of the most eagerly awaited records of the year. Until now, TV on the Radio have only flashed their talent: David Andrew Sitek's chugging beats and harsh grey textures, Adebimpe's voice, and new member Kyp Malone on vocals, guitar, and even more loops. So the final product, Desperate Youths, Blood Thirsty Babes, can't help but sound like a curveball when held against the flawless Young Liars, the monumental expectations, and the fact that they're still indulging their growing pains. The record starts strong: On opener ""The Wrong Way"", the sound of a sidewalk sax blower is interrupted off the beat by a dark chugging loop, a sound that resembles refrigerators being pushed down a hole-- but also resembles human feet stomping and hands clapping. Funk and gospel enter the palette as Malone and Adebimpe harmonize on lyrics that grapple with race. TV on the Radio don't base their work on the fact that they're an interracial, mainly African-American band; unlike Living Colour or the 2 Tone bands in the 80s, there's no reason to peg them as a ""black rock band"" more than a rock band that happens to have black members. So when race comes up, they use it for questions more than statements. On ""The Wrong Way"", they pick up and dismiss a series of black icons and stereotypes, from the ""soft shoe"" entertainer or the gentle ""magic nigger"" in the movies, to the ""fist up"" protesters and ""new negro politician""; but they're also trying out the roles, as if assessing where they stand or questioning whether they could end up ""playin' the whore."" If they have a message, it's mostly about themselves: TV on the Radio reflect the world they're in, but they'll never say they speak for it. The album repeats one track from the EP, ""Staring at the Sun""-- the catchiest but least introspective track on that album-- and that sets the path for the band's new style, which is alternately driving and repetitious. The guitar parts are almost as static as the beats, and no track develops with the subtlety of, say, Young Liars' ""Blind"". The loops and settings run out of ideas by the end of the record; ""Don't Love You"" chugs ahead with no progress, making the next song, ""Bomb Yourself"", sound more plodding than it actually is. Even ""Wear You Out"" seems limited when the swarthy opening picks up horns, and then plateaus right away. It isn't a climax so much as proof of how cold those textures can become. The last third is a tough slog. But track by track, the album's songwriting is tight and often beautiful, like the harmonies on ""King Eternal"" and ""Poppy"" that scrape the sky and even overshadow the graceful a cappella ""Ambulance"". And the lyrics are exceptional, with not-too-cryptic images that are both surreal and frank: ""All men condemned by men to die/ Damned by blind bitch in hallowed halls"" is an intriguing image of the justice system, but to follow it with ""Cover your balls/ 'Cause we swing kung fu"" is truly the way to greatness. The biggest improvement here is the addition of Malone. Is it even right for one band to hog two great vocalists, two singers with real personalities and no stylistic self-caging, at a time when most people just struggle to follow a template? Malone creeps through the high registers and whispers the heat that Adebimpe won't release; the two of them sound great as co-leads. My only objection is that the record sounds less intimate than when Adebimpe has the mike to himself. The Young Liars EP was as fully realized as all the critics suggested, yet now, TV on the Radio sound like a work in progress. Still, Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes shows more strengths than mistakes. The band's best work comes out of tension, out of a dramatic setting or the sparking of elements against each other-- multi-cultures smashed together, men harnessing their voices to machines, the excitement of that saxophone cutting against a sludge-loop at the start of the record. They wrestle with these tensions instead of letting them explode, they hammer out loops and sounds as they collaborate on music that's rent with conflict. Nobody knows where it'll end, but we're lucky to get to watch.","The word I keep hearing for this band is ""soulless."" It's true that the Young Liars EP had a ...

Groundswell,Parts & Labor,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16db1335d7bf1698260/1:1/w_160/ed1c7acd.gif,2004-03-07 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6532-groundswell/,JMZ,"I first heard these guys on a split LP with Tyondai Braxton late last year called Rise, Rise, Rise, and I was impressed enough by their half of the record that I figured they were worth further investigation. It turns out a brief trip back into 2003 reveals all there is to know about Parts & Labor: Prior to that split CD, they issued a single album of their own, Grounswell, and taken together, the two releases give a pretty good picture of a band rapidly maturing and developing a singular sound. The New York trio's half of Rise, Rise, Rise found them playing drone-centered instrumentals that had the effect of mimicking hurdy-gurdys and bagpipes, as well as balancing their electronic noise tendencies with melodic development, and even a quick pass through Groundswell displays the groundwork that they were building off of. The band's noisier tendencies tend to be less regulated and the compositions less streamlined, but the basic mix of pummeling percussion, frequently distorted bass and squelching electronics feels like a natural precedent for what came after. This record's overall sound is extremely bright-- from the massive low-end to the buzzing treble leaping from the speakers-- although Parts & Labor don't seem interested so much in establishing a mood as in punching you in the face (like Lightning Bolt, only slightly less akin to dental surgery). Keyboardist/electronics manipulator Dan Friel creates dense, aggressive textures with what sound like simple tone generators and oscillators, a la Silver Apples' Simeon, and the rhythm section then has their way with them, carrying the squealing cloud of melting drones that open ""Happy New Year"" on an epic ride through four-on-the-floor passages smothered in Jim Sykes' octopedal drum fills, half-time crawls and ecstatic crescendos. ""Parts & Labor"" staggers over queasy oscillation before launching into an alternate dimension surf tidal wave somewhat reminiscent of Disco Inferno's ""In Sharky Water"" in its third minute, BJ Warshaw's bass slapping around the reverb chamber like Dick Dale in an especially foul mood. For all their experimental and confrontational tendencies, though, Parts & Labor do occasionally see fit to just rock the fuck out, and the towering fuzz bass riff and thundering drums of ""TB Strut"" do the job nicely, while the textural mix of overdriven bass and oscillating electronics that carry the low end of ""Mike Burke for President"" are almost as hip-shaking as they are earthquaking. Parts & Labor still show room for improvement on their debut, and they've already hinted at how they'll make those strides on Rise, Rise, Rise, but it's still a sharp salutation from a band that seems capable of creating some incredible mayhem.","I first heard these guys on a split LP with Tyondai Braxton late last year called Rise, Rise, Rise, and ...

In My Mind All the Time,Numbers,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44613d197565213bf04/1:1/w_160/e404528b.jpg,2004-03-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5866-in-my-mind-all-the-time/,Tigerbeat6,"Comparisons are fun. Numbers are The Cowsills of showroom dummy punk. Numbers are the American Melt-Banana, with singsong choruses in place of scream-song choruses. Numbers are to opening bands as Vienna sausages are to baby showers-- they're kind of always there, but I'm not sure they actually have any fans, except that one group of weird guys. Numbers are to Wm. Bowers as Wang Chung is to C. Ott. Homemade synthesizers are to Numbers as post-punk is to Rolling Stone: Technically, they have to be mentioned, but it reeks of tokenism. Numbers vocalist and drummer Inda Dunis is to tall as is is to is. Thoughtful commentary is to Numbers as it is to this year's presidential race: You can try it, but you're probably going to end up just bitching about nothing. Numbers are the Numbers of fun, retro dance-punk bands. And there's nothing terribly wrong with that. On their second ""full-length"" (approx. 24 minutes) release, Numbers tighten up their act and spit out 12 micro-machine sized pellets of spirited pogo-pop spaz. In My Mind All the Time is reminiscent of 2002's Life, except that the sound is more polished and the songs are marginally closer to ""songs."" That means they tend to have verses and choruses, and sometimes little synthesizer or guitar figures other bands might call riffs. Same old martial bark, though, and that classically rigid human-drum machine beat is everywhere to be found. In a way, this album is a lot less energetic than Life, perhaps as Deerhoof's Milk Man suffers in comparison to their previous records. However, unlike Deerhoof, Numbers haven't yet won my trust that they can fall back on songwriting in place of visceral thrills. In the best case, they're a good dance band-- and no good dance band does their best work on record. By far the most interesting song on the album is the last one, ""Feelings"". It begins as a distorted synth drone, alternating between pulsating laser growl and pulsating major chord laser growl. It sounds simple-- and it is-- but it also sounds similar to the rudimentary black-box experiments coming out of Wümme 'round about 1971. The synthesizer carries on by itself for a couple of minutes until drums join in with a slow, military snare pattern. Numbers will probably always be robots, but at least here, they're softhearted robots with pleasant Krautrock memories. The only time they get so nice elsewhere on the album is on ""Drunk with Pain"", which, during the verses, could almost pass for The Cars. Still, the chorus rams the zombie staccato vocal pretty hard, and there's a big guitar feedback breakdown in the middle, so best not look for too many changes of pace. The meat of In My Mind is the meat of Numbers: speedy, goose-stepped punk vignettes. ""Go to Show"", ""Disease"", ""Dance Attack"", ""We're Numbers"" and ""I Will Smile No More"" are all variations on that template, while ""Hot Fire"", ""Waiting"", ""Anything"" and ""Product Lust"" are different mostly in that they're a little slower. That last tune actually reminds me of the first XTC album, but even that would have been a Barry Andrews song with disturbing background yelping. Two albums into their career, Numbers have amply demonstrated their niche among American dancepunk bands, but I could do with even more distinction. In fact, I would love never to begin another discussion about them with a lengthy comparison to other bands and/or party snacks. You know, Numbers are like sugar-free candy: I want to like them, but there's always something in the way.","Comparisons are fun. Numbers are The Cowsills of showroom dummy punk.

Le Grand Pic Mou,Mils,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44f69fc7814a47cd85d/1:1/w_160/a1991f5a.gif,2004-03-07 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5571-le-grand-pic-mou/,Gooom,"It's beginning to dawn on me that music criticism may still be mired in its colonial days. Reviewers can pontificate all they want about the latest subgenres, but let's face it, the underground is way too big for us to thoroughly examine its every nook and cranny. To keep up with the rapid metastasis of today's indie world is nearly impossible, and specialism seems inevitable. I won't go on record to predict a Pre-Crit program at Harvard anytime soon, but at the rate things are going, terms like lap-pop, glitch-funk, and psych-folk may eventually be used as universally as jazz or classical. The strongest evidence I see of this coming sea change is the orgiastic output from French electronic label, Gooom Disques. The music pretty much speaks for itself: Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts by M83, Spring by Cyann & Ben, Cluster Ville by Abstrackt Keal Agram, and now, Le Grand Pic Mou, the most challenging and utterly Francophone of them all. It seems the folks at Gooom are on to something we opining mortals yet lack the capacity to understand. Mils are a Gooom rarity, a group with more than just a couple years' experience and a handful of EPs and mixtape appearances under their belt. 1999's 7 Masses Déplacées and 2001's Echotones helped establish the four-piece outfit from northwestern France as one of the premiere voices in musique electronique. Le Grand Pic Mou is the group's fourth full-length, and offers a challenging counterpoint to the expansive drones of M83 and Abstrackt Keal Agram. Instead of creating space for a melody to shine, Mils have an IDM maven's infatuation with exotic textures. But unlike other glitch artists, whose work often suffers from a prevailing sense of prefabrication, Mils have found a way to enliven their creations: Even the most robotic numbers are swabbed with impressionistic dabs of color. From the trilling flutes and clarinets that introduce ""Les Mecaniques du Pic"" to the vibraphone and lightly plucked harp behind ""Societe Duret-Mol"", each composition breathes with a deep lifeforce. The fourteen songs on Le Grand Pic Mou are either extremely long or extremely short; its three longest constitute more than half the disc's total runtime. This disparity creates an interesting dichotomy within the complex architecture of the album. Melodies warble through vortexes of clipped rhythms and jagged beats, slowly gaining momentum as they head for either of two final destinations: a sideling plunge into the next song, or a prolonged denouement that offers a moment of cordial relief. ""Vivencia de un Copo"", for instance, builds for nearly four minutes upon a brusque repetition of washed-out beats, high-pitched drones, and hollow synth accents before a discernable melodic line emerges. Soon afterwards, the song performs another turnabout, as a subtle key change gives way to a sweeping synthesizer, instantaneously illuminating the dank milieu and bearing the listener heavenward. Of course, the problem with any kind of nine-minute song is that most listeners lack the patience to see it through to resolution. Conversely, Le Grand Pic Mou's shorter numbers are often stifling in their brevity. Still, the constant transitions between epic- and interlude-length songs doesn't hinder the flow of the album one bit. For those who prefer talking about music strictly in terms of other music, Mils can be thought of as a French answer to Múm, though perhaps not as touchingly demure. And of course, while these reference points do dot the landscape, Mils coat their influences in enough originality for them to be distinctly felt, if not easily identified. ""Tomato Kiki"" sounds vaguely redolent of Bablicon's noisome free-jazz, yet a marked difference lies in Mils' reliance upon programmed electronic sounds. ""Carotine"" and the fourth track (several songs have no titles) recall Kid A's celestial warmth, but remain ineffably unique. The bands on the Gooom roster do share one thing in common: They have all found a way of invoking the ghosts in the machine. Musicians long ago realized the once-remote potential for beauty in electronic instruments; Mils and others are now coming to epitomize it. ""Solid Fingz"" serves here as a testament to a positive human relationship with technology, as well as a convenient mission statement for the band. The song features Le Grand Pic Mou's only ""lyrics."" At first, a disembodied female voice delivers a soft-spoken monologue, expressing its desire to step outside the machine and become human. Minutes later, the voice returns, louder, exclaiming, ""I can feel it./ What is it?/ Is it being a human being?"" Talk all you want about the deleterious effects of technology: Mils see it as a mere manifestation of our most basic humanity, and I'm not ashamed to say the robot's words are some of the more poignant I've heard on record yet this year.","It's beginning to dawn on me that music criticism may still be mired in its colonial days.

The Rosetta Stone,Sankofa,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a656ea9e61561daa534b/1:1/w_160/ff320873.gif,2004-03-07 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7737-the-rosetta-stone/,Beyond Space,"Over the past few years, underground hip-hop's bedroom emcees have gained an increased legitimacy in indie circles. With the emergence of online commerce centers and message boards, finding and commenting on the best, most obscure artists has become incredibly easy. Rising from the ashes of Hip Hop Infinity and the Anticon doppelganger fallout, Australian-born rapper Sankofa (best known for his collaborative work with the Cunninlynguists and his group, White Collar Criminals) makes his long-awaited solo debut with The Rosetta Stone, a record that finally places him above the millions of CD-R mic assassins lying in wait. Sankofa is, on first listen, the sum of the largest components of the white underground movement-- Sole's speedy monotone, Sage Francis' wit and multi-syllabic wordplay, Buck 65's gravely voice and introspective rhymes-- even while his most direct influences lie in the roots of mid-90s hip-hop icons. His greatest strengths are his strong, unwavering flow and his commanding mic presence, at once booming, memorable and vulnerable. The Rosetta Stone is structured around relatively generic subject matter, for the most part, a wholesale defamation of the mainstream hip-hop machine and its proponents, as well as some well-placed battle rap and esoteric exercises. The most creative tracks are the poignant memorial to his father (""RDB"") and an industrial upheaval anthem (""All of Heaven's Angels""), but even in less powerful moments, his overwhelming talent makes up for his lack of topical variety. However, songs like ""Bill Macy"" (where Sankofa attempts to play a label rep/commercial label salesman) and ""Asphyxia"" (a lame, esoteric sub-Anticon death march) grate on nerves with their absolute pointlessness. Sankofa is by far at his best in his angrier incarnation. On ""Sunday Morning"", the rap protagonist allows the listener into his starkly distinct battle style, a mix of subtle wordplay and relentlessly dry wit. Over producer Ear Max's stunning mix of bells, chimes and harsh drums, Sankofa takes it to an enemy emcee's hypothetical girl, claiming that he's ""crushed apples and cinnamon/ Strictly in cider"" and that he's ""up in her body cavity with more decay than in NY."" He caps it with the brag rap statement, ""No smokin' haze, Romeo rope-a-dope/ I'm chilling in the Pokonos, eatin' Toblerones."" Unfortunately, the beats often fail to match Sankofa's abilities, especially in achieving a level of cohesion. The major standout is Kno's stellar twist on vocal samples and mesmerizing jazz-hop with ""RDB"", while Manic Depressive's heavy crunch funk guitar fits well on ""45 Notches"". Other beats, such as ""Eeyore"" and ""The Making of Believe"", are completely forgettable, while ""4th Wall"" and ""Asphyxia"" border on Anticon piggybacking. The general patchiness here underscores that what Sankofa really needs is to find a production style and stick with it. While it's difficult to find fault with a guy who refers to Penelope Cruz as ""Selma Hayek minus talent, body and sensuality,"" Sankofa could find much greater success by focusing his energies on either the esoteric side of his persona or on a more traditional battle rap angle, as the many sides of his character aren't so much refreshingly varied as difficult to get a handle on. His spotty beat choices and the occasional derivative subject matter hold him back, but his talent is almost staggering, especially given his lack of name recognition in the underground. The Rosetta Stone may be a relatively solid experiment, but Sankofa has yet to discover his personal sound.","Over the past few years, underground hip-hop's bedroom emcees have gained an increased legitimacy in indie circles.

Cee-Lo Green Is the Soul Machine,Cee-Lo Green,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fd9d034d5c69bf36a3/1:1/w_160/7768ed8f.gif,2004-03-04 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1755-cee-lo-green-is-the-soul-machine/,Arista,"In the commercial rap arena, few prospects are riskier than making the transition from a conventional sound to more avant-garde leanings. It can either bring you critical acclaim and general acceptance from the populace (Andre 3000) or it can alienate your original fanbase without appealing to the new audience whose eye you'd hoped to capture (Common). Cee-Lo's latest record, however, treads the line perfectly, allowing him to play by his own terms, while maintaining the kind of strong hooks, production, and songs that pretty much anyone can get into. His solo debut, 2002's Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections, was solid but ultimately forgettable and singularly toned. But Green seems to have focused on cohesion this time out, as this new collection of songs tie together nicely, despite the record's diverse melting pot of spoken word, R&B;, rap and gospel. Those expecting the pensive introspection and homemade synth-hop of his debut should look elsewhere, as this record draws on his greatest strength: the excitable rhyme flow that initially made him stand out from the rest of the Goodie Mob. Cee-Lo's most interesting aspect is his adaptable persona: The way he shifts from an apologetic former gun-toting drug dealer to a discotheque lover man to a church preacher gives this album a ridiculous depth of replay. And lyrically, he dominates much like he did on the Outkast side project Dungeon Family's Even in Darkness, spitting battle salvos (""I've been running since 'Rock Box'/ I've cocked glocks and locked blocks/ And rocked rocks in drop-tops"") and street knowledge (""When it hit ya, it usually hits somebody with ya/ Make 'em risk a total eclipse of the sun to get richer"") with the confidence of a man on a mission. His mission statement is ""The Art of Noise"". Produced by The Neptunes with background vocals from Pharrell, the track is equal parts In Search Of... snares, and the piano part from Jay-Z's ""Allure"", making for a minimalist exercise that burrows into your skull with its emphatic chorus. Cee-Lo sounds as excited to have this beat as we are to hear him over it-- and he doesn't disappoint. Employing his half-singing/half-rapping cadence, he draws attention instantly, asking the listener to ""Have mercy, if I seem to be heavy/ I don't mean to be heavy,"" as if asking for acceptance regardless of his many distinguished quirks. Needless to say, in a post-""Hey Ya"" environment, a song like this could easily make a giant dent in the singles chart. The playgrounds that this ""five-foot-six-inch god"" inhabits, for the first time, match his obvious technical proficiency, maintaining a general tone of futuristic chops and bombastic horns throughout the record that recall Lyrics Born's monster debut Later That Day. Standouts include the Organized Noise-produced stuttering chopped toy piano and xylophone on ""Childz Play"", the shockingly original DJ Premier production of finger snaps and subtle cop-show sax on ""Evening News"", and the Roswell synth whistle, exploding black-college horn line and ""We Will Rock You"" stomp of ""Scrap Metal"". The only drawbacks are the occasional disco and 80s R&B-inspired; cuts, as they fail to completely fit in context with the other beats. Cee-Lo doesn't come out completely unscathed himself: At 18 tracks, there's a bit too much music here, and some tracks, like the occasional spoken word-style pieces, prevent the record from being the opus Cee-Lo is clearly capable of making. But even with these minor faults, a happy medium is achieved-- especially given that the record contains only two skits (the ""Intro"" and ""Outro"", both roughly 20 seconds long). Which leaves us with a strong experimental record that draws on Cee-Lo's malleable style of rap, staying deeply grounded in the Southern traditions that started his career even while he pushes the boundaries of convention, making for one of the year's strongest hip-hop albums to date.","In the commercial rap arena, few prospects are riskier than making the transition from a conventional sound to more avant-garde ...

Dying to Meet You,Vaz,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98813d19756521398a5/1:1/w_160/5b7779dd.jpg,2004-03-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8513-dying-to-meet-you/,GSL,"No, not Yaz. Dressed like extras from a Lawrence of Arabia theme park and hiding behind secondhand Roman centurion stylistics, NYC's Vaz are another white-male duo linked incoherently to Pink & Brown and Lightning Bolt by lazy-bone critics. Sure, they've shared stages, situate that certain pummeling aesthetic within an obvious sartorial gimmick, and exhibit a not-unenjoyable penchant for gliding slippery hands up and down fretboards in the name of air-raid-siren squeals, but a more properly obvious comparison might be a hollowed-out version of Hammerhead, the middling ex-AmRep cock-rock trio that Vaz's Paul Erickson and Jeff Morridian, Jr. used to be two-thirds of. But maybe that's defining a word with another definition. To be more specific, when listening quietly to Dying to Meet You, its aged SST-era vibe unexplainably mustered the panoramic sense of dynamics found in Bitch Magnet. Turning up the speakers, though, Soo Young-- that gentle bastard-- was nowhere to be found. In his place were swooning modulations-- something like Thurston Moore's vocal contributions to Daydream Nation but remixed with ineffable elements of Dinosaur Jr's early guitar wash. Of course, Vaz sound nothing like Dinosaur; it's more a feeling of a particular time hidden somewhere behind the Black Flag adoration. If possible, Vaz crib the generational vibe of Our Band Could Be Your Life by heading sideways through the vocal territories of a more macho Depeche Mode covered by Midwestern punks discovering Joy Division in their first summer of cheep beer and wide-eyed discontent. Not mere pranksters-- despite the gleeful rocking horse winner of the album's cover-- Vaz don the obtuse black mask of gritty depression with pithy lyricism that tends to focus metaphorically on violent death, macular degeneration, bodily decomposition, and ghosts turning towards blindness. Obsessed, really, with ways of seeing, eyes are mentioned in the lyrics or titles of most of the fourteen tracks: in ""World of Death"", ""shadows freeze eyes upon your face"" and ""it's hard to breathe with crystal lungs,"" and in ""Fired Eye Quit"", ""daylight bends down on red knees"" while ""the twilight strains me in a gray sea."" Purple prose and a sense of underground USA's formative years are decent punk-noir ingredients, and if stronger works like ""They've Won"" and ""Blue Lip Special"" were placed tightly on a seven-inch single with the mopey ""Fired Eye Quit"" as the weaker, half-tempo B-side, Vaz would escape my censure. But alas and alack! As with many of today's thinly conceived bands and records, the shit loses steam after its first four minutes, after which hook-free stinkers gum up the operation: ""White Wall""'s sub-par Pussy Galore overdrive, the Arab-on-Radar-in-spirit dreck of ""Give Us the Creeps"", and the spoken word Arab-Strap-sans-narrative-arc of ""Kill the Strings"" are relatively pointless throwbacks to, well... a lot of boring AmRep bands. Relatively speaking, Vaz are best when tweaking the revved-up art-rock guitar swoons of days past. Any deviation from this tightly dated formula is a bore. While it pains me to diss a band who punningly name-drops John Fante, by the end of the set, Vaz is outed as the often tedious, randomly enjoyable band opening for your friends at CBGB's in 1997: they take too long tuning, plow through a much-unloved cover of ""Teenage Riot"", and fade out on a 20-minute medley of Cows tunes. You might find a fleeting moment to admire before passing out while talking to a business major from Hoboken who has a green mohawk and ""just loves"" the Didgits. And then again, you might not.","No, not Yaz. Dressed like extras from a Lawrence of Arabia theme park and hiding behind secondhand Roman centurion stylistics ...

The Garbageman and the Prostitute,Kill Me Tomorrow,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2c13d197565213b267/1:1/w_160/d7c4cd09.gif,2004-03-04 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4572-the-garbageman-and-the-prostitute/,GSL,"I've generally found live music backed by projected images to be a cop-out, an obvious way to lead an audience over a predetermined path towards a particularly myopic interpretation: ""I see overexposed mountains and sideways falling snow, therefore I'm sad."" It's worse when the appropriated imagery falls into one of the following standardized genres: high-contrast industrial locales, 80s video-art wipes/dissolves, suburban 8mm ennui, ironic juxtapositions (i.e. black metal and Sesame Street), faux-Brackhage avant. Such heart-tugging nonsense is common enough at stadium shows, and certainly felt at home accompanying downtown performances in the 60s, but over the past few years, the practice has crept into more and more situations that don't make an ounce of conceptual or aesthetic sense. If possible, a much more interesting ideal would be to turn your songs inward in a way that reflected the song's compositional guts. This way you become your visual geography and establish a work that acts as its own stimulus and response. Formed in the late 90s, San Diego's premiere ""noir-wave"" trio Kill Me Tomorrow definitely position themselves as a band jamming to their own damaged, apocalyptically stylish science fiction flick. Here, it works, mainly because it's easy to see the band as equal parts DIY art project, well-dressed gutterpunk commune, and rousing punk-rock act. I admire the self-sufficiency: Bassist and visual artist K8 Wince makes the paintings on the band's records and designs the lopsided t-shirts they wear. According to her husband, drummer/multi-instrumentalist Zack Wentz, he's working with her on a novel composed of 13 stories based on the seedy and beautiful characters inhabiting the realm of their newest full-length, The Garbageman and The Prostitute. In fact, rather than providing lyrics for their releases' liner notes, KMT prints song/story summaries, giving a sense that the actual lyrics are told, not sung. A follow-up to last year's Skin's Getting Weird EP teaser, The Garbageman and The Prostitute launches through nice feedback, pulling with the littlest, most claustrophobic details of post-punk noise and the percussive spirit of hip-hop, dub, and the Butthole Surfers. For those drawn to underbellies, KMT negotiate a jam-packed junkyard atmosphere like Blade Runner or Mad Max to write songs that might help the Bones Brigade negotiate a 360 from a corroded half-pipe. They overload their sonic palette with garish grumbles, screeches, trash-can noise; at the front of the mix lie processors, samples, and drum machines, establishing a schizophrenic dust-storm that flits and sails around the central guitar/bass/drums. Voices drift and shout at the same level, another color of paint. For me, The Garbageman and The Prostitute works best taken in sections; all at once, the insistence of the sprung rhythm gets exhausting-- the flatter materials are undistinguished. In the best songs, you can feel a front, middle and back, each member chipping away at a different area and uncovering all sorts of potential in their surroundings. ""Xerox My Hand"" mixes kinetic Texan twang and angular skree to impart the story of an office worker who, after copying his body with a Xerox machine, realizes he can spot the ghosts of past employees, as well as rat-race comrades of the future. The particularly meta ""This Is a Movie"" is OMD car-jacked by Crass-- breakdowns appear, turning out a shriveling bout of choose-your-own-adventure noise, dance loops, and grumbling amphetamines. ""I Require Chocolate"" discovers sex crimes in the heart of a superhero and turns The Commodores' ""Three Times a Lady"" into a frantic teenage riot, its shimmering guitar outro and schematic return to tunefulness reminiscent of the blasted beauty of distortion mastered by SY in their salad days. After ""I Require Chocolate"", the record skids into a bit of a lull. Some tracks are muddled, others too repetitious. Before the formula wears too thin, though, KMT gain momentum with the title track, which honestly possesses a Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights feel (if rebrewed as werewolf lore). After dullsville, this cathartic rampage emerges amplified and all the more jubilant. While The Garbageman and The Prostitute isn't a complete success, it remains a worthwhile treat. Whether looting a 7-11 or inhabiting the body of a transsexual, Kill Me Tomorrow convincingly navigate within a universe of their own making-- a rambunctious scene crammed with scattered, toppling, spray-painted things.","I've generally found live music backed by projected images to be a cop-out, an obvious way to lead an ...

The Tain EP,The Decemberists,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e85e6ef959693212f1/1:1/w_160/2e679d31.jpg,2004-03-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2242-the-tain-ep/,Acuarela,"""I never was a metal head,"" remarked Colin Meloy in an Earlash interview last July. ""It's something in my later years I've come to regret a little bit just because everybody has their stories of when they were a metal head. And it wasn't until recently that I started listening to Black Sabbath and started appreciating it."" Two albums and a six-song Five Songs EP into their career, The Decemberists' are beginning to seriously define their sound; a sudden plunge into, say, heavy metal, seems unlikely. Yet the first movement of The Tain EP, the band's new 18-minute composition based loosely on the 8th-century Celtic Ulster cycle's central poem ""Tain Bo Cuailinge"", finds Meloy and the others most immediately concerned with-- am I about to say this?-- serious Ur-metal riffage. Granted, Decemberist metal is not going to weigh down the Dominique Leones of the world, but make no mistake: Never has this band sung a flag so black, a maiden so iron. The opening of The Tain is indeed jarring, though there's always more than meets the ear with this band, and the disc's dark acoustic guitar opening is not without foil: Pay attention to how Colin overdramatizes the dark line with his heavy plucks, disarming its sense of foreboding. When the rest of the band joins him in unison, what should be enough of a killer riff for friendly genocide is undermined by the organ's funny whir and Rachel Blumberg's gentle cymbal taps. In short, the sound is off-kilter, though not without ample deception, and only hints at the level of sophistication to come in the remaining movements. The Decemberists have consistently proven that they understand the tensions that can be exploited in song: Morbid verses are set to straightforward, ""fun"" pop instrumentals (""July July""; ""Chimbley Sweep""), narration is often not Colin's own, but another's (""Leslie Anne Levine""), inconsequential banalities are granted cosmic musical significance (""Song for Myla Goldberg""), sincerity is performatively lampooned (""I Was Meant for the Stage""). The Tain is no different: In fact, it's easily The Decemberists' most carefully considered and sophisticated effort yet-- to a limited degree, some of Colin's subtle musical humor even depends on cursory knowledge of its bizarre Celtic cycle namesake. In short: the cycle's most celebrated tale is how Queen Medb's army attacks the town of Ulster with the intention of carrying off their great sacred bull, and only CuChulainn, the story's hero, is able to resist the invasion and defend the town. To call a queen, as Colin does, a ""salty little pisser,"" is a brilliant conceit, matched only by his decision to set her raid for a bull (her ""shiny prize"") to bombastic hard rock hooks. When the song reaches its third movement, Colin switches the focus of his narrative to how CuChulainn, originally named Setanta, became ""CuChulainn"", or literally, ""Hound of Cullan."" As a mournful bassline sways, accompanied by occasional strums of heavily distorted guitar, Colin assumes different points of view with each passing line, and the band swells to an ironic degree of celebration upon the words, ""Here come loose the hound/ To blow me down,"" the moment at which Setanta is attacked by King Cullan's guard dog. This is not to say that one cannot at all appreciate The Tain without knowledge of Celtic mythology-- though, for me, personally, the interaction between the instrumentation and Colin's lyrics has always been The Decemberists' most fascinating trait. Take The Tain's ghostly fourth movement, by far the entire composition's most poignant melody. Rachel assumes vocals akin to her orphanry on ""Chimbley Sweep"", this time accompanied by light piano and bowed cello. The accordion finally makes its somewhat tongue-in-cheek appearance at the bridge, fighting with found sounds and music box bells. Meloy reassumes vocals for the fifth movement, which restates The Tain's original theme-- though not before he beautifully overextends himself in lines like, ""Darling dear, what have you done?/ Your hands and face are smeared with blood,"" subjects that last word to a strange guttural contortion. With each release, The Decemberists grow more sophisticated in their songcraft and subtler in their wit. The result, naturally, is that their releases are increasingly more demanding on the listener. Meeting a record on its own terms, though, is to a large extent a forgotten responsibility. Especially given its disorienting opener, The Tain EP is dense musically and lyrically, a bona fide grower, but certainly worth the effort to unravel it.","""I never was a metal head,"" remarked Colin Meloy in an Earlash interview last July.

Bitches Without Britches,Kevin Blechdom,by: JT Ramsay,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30613d19756521389c7/1:1/w_160/5e04ae18.jpg,2004-03-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/797-bitches-without-britches/,Chicks on Speed,"Kevin Blechdom has put her days of cafeteria gossip and cheerleader tyranny behind her, and fled east to Berliniamsburg. Having morphed from a diminutive pupa into a full-grown, sex-positive gadfly since her first recordings with Blectum from Blechdom, she's now spreading her wings (and legs) and confidently striking out on her own. Her identity carves itself: Bitches Without Britches sounds like the creation of an bipolar NYU freshman who, frustrated by the rigidity of her classmates' buttoned-down conformity, watched full seasons of The Simple Life and Rich Girls for inspiration, revolted against her parents, popular culture and democracy, and is now living out her Dr. Jekyll/Ms. Hyde fantasy at subway stops and bodegas between Lorimer and Canarsie. The trade-off is that in place of the Pretty Girl Conspiracy Academy now stands the Electroclash Fashionista Cadre. Sure, this album reeks of the elitism it putatively refutes. Once it gets past its saccharine absurdity, the electro-torch song ""Use Your Heart as a Telephone"" would sound equally at home at Marie's Crisis as it does at Luxx. One dystopian industrial lovesong later, Blechdom deconstructs the consumerist/hygiene nexus, each new product or surgery relieving the user/recipient of certain duties and concerns, and further complicating the crux of the postmodern condition (""Binaca""). The frenetic abuse of presets and Reds makes each song sound like a botched overdose, a suicide incurring unconsciousness without fatality. ""I Am Nast-ay"" sounds like an intellectually honest take on Kylie Minogue, and it's imaginable that one could sync the ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" video with this song. Elsewhere, the exhibitionist ""Boob-B-Q"" sounds like a Pasolini orgy complete with ""dick-rowaves"" for his pleasure. Still, this all brings us back to the broader question of whether electroclash really accomplishes all it could. The genre's shameless indulgence in excess and shopping not only reinforces the sectarianism of pop culture that it should be subverting, but relies on it, making the music's absurdist, hypersexualized drama a novelty. In that spirit, Bitches Without Britches won't convert any nonbelievers, but the choir will gleefully singing its praises anyway. Regardless, the record is extraordinarily danceable and worth a number of good laughs, if not as many listens. But be forewarned: In 20 years' time, you'll be persuaded to pick up revivalist comps of this kind of stuff and love it. Don't wait for the boxset!","Kevin Blechdom has put her days of cafeteria gossip and cheerleader tyranny behind her, and fled east to Berliniamsburg. Having ...

Dusk in Cold Parlours,Norfolk & Western,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9649d034d5c69bf51f2/1:1/w_160/f77e5e09.jpg,2004-03-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5889-dusk-in-cold-parlours/,Hush,"The Norfolk & Western railway was, in a lot of ways, a quintessentially American construct. The ""Norfolk"" is Norfolk, Virginia, still one of the country's busiest ports, and in the rail line's pre-Civil War nascence, the ""Western"" was western Virginia, the Appalachian regions that otherwise took days to reach. Over time, like any well-run business, Norfolk & Western expanded, buying other rail lines and extending its passenger and freight services across the Eastern half of the country. The company became something of an icon for American ingenuity and progress, a footnote to the larger American experience. And then, in 1998, after more than a century, it ceased to exist, subsumed by the financial interests of larger competitors, and gone without fanfare, leaving behind little more than appreciative websites set up by admirers. The railway also left its name to an unassuming Northwestern songwriter named Adam Selzer, whose quiet whisper of a voice delivers his songs of meditative resignation with a solemn, understated grace. Selzer's project got off to an inauspicious start in the same year that the Norfolk & Western gave way to the new economy, with a Spartan EP called a Collection of Norfolk & Western that showed some promise but didn't quite fulfill it. Since then, Selzer's thrown his recordings open to an ever-widening group of collaborators, including M. Ward and Calexico's Joey Burns, and as his sound has expanded, he's staked out a nice piece of atmospheric folk ground for himself. His two full-lengths thus far have worked on incorporating a wide range of textures into his simple songs, and this one continues the trend. Dusk in Cold Parlours wastes no time in attesting to the aptness of its title with ""A Marriage Proposal"". Accompanied by banjo, piano, buzzing organ, brushed drums and watercolor electric guitar, the song is a stark reading of Selzer's poetic take on a couple's engagement despite their uncertainty of the future. The sound is dusty and sepia-toned, a sound the band takes to another level entirely a few songs later on ""Terrified"", whose spacious corners are awash in vibraphone, B3 and Raymond Richards' gorgeous pedal steel. Multi-instrumentalist Rachel Blumberg offers breathy backing vocals that perfectly meld with Selzer's own voice-- her impact on the album as a whole is inestimable, as she not only provides all of the relaxed drumming that drives it, but also plays about half a dozen other instruments, from piano to tubular bells. The ensemble offers two excellent instrumentals to fully flesh the mood they're going for; the first, ""Kelly Bauman"", is a cockeyed swirl of melting carnival organ and M. Ward's trembling, immediately recognizable guitar playing. The other instrumental, ""A Hymnal"", belongs to guest cellist Anna Fritz, whose portamento flights are the most sensual thing on the album. One thing the instrumentals make plain is the band's sense of dynamic interplay, perhaps the single greatest element of their success-- the music breathes and is always in the midst of a rise or a fall, and it turns songs that might otherwise sound pedestrian into something much greater. Dusk in Cold Parlours is the kind of album that rewards multiple listens, revealing details slowly but surely, and once it captures you, it's hard to escape its grasp. But then, it's hard to imagine why you'd want to.","The Norfolk & Western railway was, in a lot of ways, a quintessentially American construct. The ""Norfolk"" is Norfolk, Virginia, still ...

Liberation,Trans Am,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bcc0084474cd0bfe9c/1:1/w_160/03a13f42.jpg,2004-03-03 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8139-liberation/,Thrill Jockey,"These are tumultuous times, and rock music knows it. In light of America's recent turmoil, eminent voices in the genre are using their influence to ignite a protest movement-- though maybe not the kind you were expecting: The new rock dissent is proudly apolitic, concerned more with its fashion statements and coolly apathetic poses than changing the system. In short, it ain't your dad's counter-culture. While we sit around waiting for the dancepunk answer to Hair, Trans Am have gathered the chutzpah to call out the indie messiahs on their shameful disinterest. Liberation is the latest contribution to a burgeoning, as-yet undeclared genre of instrumental rock with a political message. A scant handful of bands have made albums of this nature over the past few years, but their putative ""protests"" are often as ambiguous as a Bush State of the Union Address. In lieu of lyrics, Godspeed You! Black Emperor drew a schematic diagram for their 2002 LP, Yanqui U.X.O., detailing the intricate web of relations between the recording industry's major labels and a nuclear holocaust's worth of weapons manufacturers. The results were, at best, lukewarm. Indeed, creating an impacting political album without lyrics seems about as predestined to fail as an Israeli-Palenstinian peace negotiation. As songwriters like Phil Ochs and Woody Guthrie established long ago, it takes the full brunt of articulate, meaningful lyrics to rile up any sort of populace, and that a movement is nothing without people behind it. That, of course, hasn't deterred Trans Am, who go for the jugular on seventh album, Liberation. Song titles like ""Uninvited Guest"", ""Divine Invasion"", ""Spike in Chatter"", and ""Total Information Awareness"" seek to parody the Bush rhetoric of terror. And if names like ""Idea Machine"" don't tip you off to the anti-war message, there are the vocoded voice samples of the president on ""Uninvited Guest"", which make it abundantly clear: ""Our commitment to weapons of mass destruction is America's tradition,"" ""The Iraqi people love their oppressors,"" etc. This cut-up technique, of course, is awfully tired: bedroom novelty artists have been doing it virtually since Bush took office. The difference is, Trans Am aren't laughing, and juxtaposed against their demonic synths, the speech is awfully disturbing. Unfortunately, ""disturbing"" is hardly the mark of a successful protest album. Any music that has ever contributed to political upheaval has done so by way of emotional appeal. In that sense, Liberation is closer in attitude to propaganda than an impassioned plea for humanity: It fails to invoke the necessary compassion that might compel us to act. Politics aside, Liberation does rock pretty fierce. Like the country it recriminates, the album sounds intentionally monolithic. Dank, unfeeling synthesizers and bombastic drum sounds conjure harsh futurism, while songs like ""Idea Machine"" and ""Total Information Awareness"" make up for their didacticism by just plain shredding. Unlike other instrumental soapboxers, Trans Am shun a barren, apocalyptic sound in favor of something tighter and more claustrophobic, and the result is more effective for it. Rather than creating a sense of imminent destruction and finality, Liberation ensnares you in an enduring hell, its unmistakable new-wave sheen invoking the political ghosts of the Reagan era and recalling the 20th century's legacy of totalitarian prophesy. Sadly, the album offers few musical thrills beyond that, and the disappointment is doubled once one considers the record's intended impact. Trans Am's intentions, like all the best ones, are noble and unrealistic. And while it's nice to see them getting serious for a change, Liberation will only serve to bolster the argument of those who contend that it's impossible to make effective political music without lyrics, and help others to appreciate the work of the past's truer crusaders.","These are tumultuous times, and rock music knows it.

"Oh Honey, We're Ridiculous EP",PAS/CAL,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00aea9e61561daa4491/1:1/w_160/03906807.jpg,2004-03-03 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6189-oh-honey-were-ridiculous-ep/,Le Grand Magistery,"Those early adopters along Madison Avenue are now so on top of things that an indie pop band can get into a Saturn advertisement on the strength of its first EP. This may get the hand-wringers in a bind, but for PAS/CAL and ""The Bronze Beached Boys (Come On Let's Go)""-- the standout track from 2003's The Handbag Memoirs EP-- it's a well-deserved, welcome opportunity for their summery, refined sounds to reach a wider audience. That track's lazy, hazy plea to leave your notebooks at home and ""be leaves pushed by the breeze"" perfectly captures the band's optimistic, open-armed approach to blissed-out pop. That approach is delightfully continued on the Detroit band's second EP, the five-track Oh Honey, We're Ridiculous. While many indie poppers stroll down the dead ends of traditionalism, aiming to either soothe the bruised souls of bedsit lonelyhearts or put the skip in your step with unabashed summery hooks, PAS/CAL manages to do a bit of both with panache and intelligence to spare. The band's kaleidoscopic arrangements and deft tempo changes waft and swirl, nicely framing Casimer Pascal's soaring, feather-light falsetto but still allowing it plenty of room for acrobatics and elegance. Not many bands can sashay from Morricone to doo-wop in less than a minute without snapping necks, but PAS/Cal manage the trick on ""What Do the American Girls Have on Jennifer JoJo?"". They'll likely receive more than enough comparisons to the Beach Boys (as well as contemporaries such as The Shins), but that sort of misses the mark. From pensive opener ""What Happened to the Sands""-- which starts with a few melodic tugs before accelerating into a whipsmart frenzy-- to ""The Handbag Memoirs"" and its acoustic approximation the low-rent style of His 'n' Hers-era Pulp, PAS/CAL sounds more like the humid haze of summer dusk rather than the scorching heat. Fittingly, then, Oh Honey is full of missed opportunities and haunts from the past, moments in which the sun is set and yet one can still feel its heat. From PAS/CAL's lament at the loss of the Sands Hotel and the exploitation of the 115-year old ""Poor Maude"", to a girlfriend's handbag full of ""notes [written] without me in mind"" and a litany of musical references, there's a tangible friction between the past and present. Which is just as well, because after two EPs of grandiose, warm pop, PAS/CAL shouldn't be wary of their future.","Those early adopters along Madison Avenue are now so on top of things that an indie pop band can get ...

Pawn Shoppe Heart,The Von Bondies,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a970ea9e61561daa5a2c/1:1/w_160/df94223c.jpg,2004-03-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8491-pawn-shoppe-heart/,Sire,"Most folks can only take so much parenting, and Detroit's Von Bondies have long been plagued by the creepy omnipresence and paternal proselytizing of neo-superstar Jack White: White co-produced their 2001 debut, Lack of Communication, offered the band a coveted opening slot on The White Stripes' European tour, and secured them a track on his fairly influential (and predictably retro-styled) compilation, The Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit. It wasn't until late 2003 that White and The Von Bondies finally somersaulted out of smiley symbiosis-- in December, White engaged vocalist Jason Stollsteimer in a bizarre, bruise-heavy scrapple, mashing Stollsteimer's mug beyond recognition and earning them both a mess of press. (White's injury: an oddly apropos ""redness to the face."") As 2004 rolled over, The Von Bondies seemed destined to ride out their fledgling career in the sidebars of American print mags, neatly framing glossy, art-heavy White Stripes features. But Pawn Shoppe Heart, The Von Bondies' massive major label debut, sees the band clawing their way up from the footnotes, and cramming a splintered drumstick into an otherwise diminutive little-brother trajectory. Entirely White-free, and produced by former Modern Lover and Talking Head Jerry Harrison, the album is crisp where you'd expect it to be crackly, billowing when you think it should whisper. With huge, ballooning vocals and a shit-kicking rhythm section, the record consistently threatens to pop its own feeble seams; by carefully shuffling away from their past outings, The Von Bondies have produced a booming sonic statement that's far more glam than garage, and a lot less ""Detroit"" than we've been trained to expect. From the chainsaw feedback of opener ""No Regrets"" to the scrappy punch of a blues-addled hidden track, Pawn Shoppe pummels unapologetically. Despite their pristine Motor City pedigree, The Von Bondies sound as much like Danzig here as they do The Gories, as Pawn Shoppe Heart is riddled with walloping rock riffage. Stollsteimer and guitarist Marcie Bolen drive their shit like it's stolen, ripping each song apart and kicking it to the floor; ""Broken Man"" sounds like all four members met up to pitch a simultaneous tantrum, pounding their instruments with unchecked, sweat-spewing fervor. It's that kind of kinetic flailing that keeps Pawn Shoppe Heart afloat when the songwriting sags (see ""Tell Me What You See""), and ultimately rockets the record out of mediocrity and straight into the street. Lead single ""C'mon C'mon"" is the album's goofiest and most instantly accessible track, with an undeniable chorus and plenty of quiet/loud flip-flopping. ""Been Swank"", a kicky nod to Detroit scenester/Soledad Brother Ben Swank, sees Stollsteimer's vocals backed up by Carrie Smith's plodding bassline, his bold caterwauls spot-on, pitch-perfect, and completely insane. ""Not That Social"" sees Smith swagger up to the mic, blankly admitting, ""I'm not that social/ I'm just a good drinker."" Stollsteimer returns here for Pixies-esque harmonizing, but ""Not That Social"" is really Smith's moment alone: With expressionless abandon, she guides listeners through a steady, solo-heavy pop song, her monotone coo dripping with loads of delicious attitude. The Von Bondies are most compelling when their hinges are a bit rusty, and Harrison's production, while impressively monumental, occasionally glosses a bit too hard, sacrificing some of the band's live spunk in favor of pure, colossal sound. But what little Pawn Shoppe Heart lacks, it eagerly makes up for in hooks, drive and raw conviction. It's a giant leap forward for The Von Bondies-- one that blasts them out of their homogeneous garage-rock roots and into their rightful position as amp-crashing successors to the indie rock thrones of Nation of Ulysses and Drive Like Jehu.","Most folks can only take so much parenting, and Detroit's Von Bondies have long been plagued by the creepy ...

Crocodiles / Heaven Up Here / Porcupine / Ocean Rain / Echo & The Bunnymen,Echo and the Bunnymen,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf4eb335119a49ecb5f/1:1/w_160/e90555e1.jpg,2004-03-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11727-crocodiles-heaven-up-here-porcupine-ocean-rain-echo-the-bunnymen/,SireSire,"So what kind of drugs do you think it was? I only ask because it seems fairly obvious that Echo & The Bunnymen were a band christened during a period of impaired judgment. I can see it sounding funny on a drunk Saturday evening, but to seriously go through with it and start releasing albums under the name The Bunnymen (Echo was their drum machine) is just beyond reason, not only because it's a silly name, but because it's a name that engenders skepticism immediately when you say it. I can't count the number of times I've found myself saying, ""No, seriously, they're really quite good once you get past the name,"" to someone unfamiliar with their work. And the fact is, they really were a good band in their day (and actually still are in their reconstituted form today), but it's hard to find anyone who really takes them all that seriously. Granted, there are reasons aside from their moniker that people might shy away from Echo & The Bunnymen. Ian McCulloch's (melo)dramatic, psychedelic crooner vocals and frequent forays into quasi-religious lyrical imagery are something you just have to accept without overthinking it, but the fact is that this band made that kind of stuff sound great. The Liverpool quartet created an absolutely huge sound on record to match their frontman's flair for grandiosity, and they bore it to you on the backs of bassist Les Pattinson and drummer Pete DeFreitas, a rhythm section whose sheer power and imagination is chronically overlooked. Listening back to the band's five original albums on Rhino's excellently remastered reissue series in an age when rhythm is returning to the fore of the underground, it's hard not to notice just how charged and visceral some of these records were. The epitome is ""Back of Love"", from 1983's Porcupine, an album that initially wasn't even released stateside, but in hindsight proves to be the band's definitive statement. ""Back of Love"" is simply the astonishing highlight of the group's career, featuring frenetic drumming, laser-focused basswork and Will Sergeant's choppy, heavily delayed guitar chords. The way the music drops out of the treble range and yields to a deep, miles-thick synthesizer groan behind McCulloch's frantically shouted chorus is disorienting and breathtaking-- it's an anthem for adrenal glands. Porcupine was loaded with songs like that, unfolding with the cascading stomp of ""The Cutter"", one of the band's best singles with its weird, elastic synthesizer melodies. While it showcases some of The Bunnymen's most aggressively rhythmic material, though, Porcupine also houses its share of strange, abstract material such as the title track and ""My White Devil"", songs that lurch on Spartan rhythms and mix disparate textures like Spanish guitar and cravenly artificial synthesizer, a fact that's led many to inaccurately characterize the album as the band's ""difficult"" record, something it's really not. Of course, it's not as straightforward as its two predecessors, 1980's Crocodiles and 1981's Heaven Up Here. The Bunnymen hit the ground running, and their debut album is a stunning statement of purpose, with McCulloch already in full dramatic swing and the band at their most straightforward-- any band that uses as much reverb as this one is hard to label ""raw,"" but ""Pride"" and ""Do It Clean"" nonetheless hit hard, and ""Rescue"", with Sergeant's massive opening riff, manages to turn a chorus that should sound like a plea into a rallying cry. Heaven Up Here ranges more widely, and makes motions toward the slightly funkier band that turned up on Porcupine on the aptly titled ""Show of Strength"" and ""With a Hip"", while also stretching out their theatrical side on the slow-burning, flute-laden ""All My Colours"" (also frequently referred to as ""Zimbo"" for McCulloch's weird, droning nonsense refrain). The Bunnymen mellowed to a degree for their fourth album, the widely acclaimed Ocean Rain, but all it did was cause them to get weirder. The album is stuffed with queasy midtempo tracks and bizarre orchestration, but it's by no means impenetrable. The strangest song, ""Yo Yo Man"" limps through skewed verses, building to McCulloch's refrain, ""I'm the yo yo man/ Always up and down,"" which triggers a startling interjection by vigorously bowed strings, percussion and Sergeant's spastic guitar. Most of the album is considerably less warped, but a chilly, haunted ambience settles over the whole recording like a fine dust. The creative strain of recording Ocean Rain took a lot out of the band, and it took them three years to deliver a follow-up, in the form of their self-titled record, which is as odd a collision of commercial sensibility and inescapable weirdness as you're likely to find. The band's attempt to reach a wider audience worked out when they splattered the hook-heavy reverb bomb ""Lips Like Sugar"" all over American college radio, but the backward guitar solo on ""Lost and Found"" is more representative of the album as a whole. The sunnier production watered the band's sound down a bit, but they still managed to turn out ""All in Your Mind"", a throbbing beast of a pop song swimming in twitching guitar and aggressive synth bass, and god, that is so obviously Ray Manzarek of The Doors playing organ on ""Bedbugs and Ballyhoo"" that you don't even need the liners to clue you in-- it works almost purely on improbability. The folks at Rhino have done an admirable job of expanding each album to include relevant bonus material, trucking out standout B-sides ""Fuel"" and ""Angels & Devils"" and some bone-crushing early live tracks, but they've also somehow managed to leave off ""The Puppet"" completely, and non-album singles ""Never Stop"" and ""Bring on the Dancing Horses"" are represented in atypical versions, which smacks of needless obscurantism. Still, these albums deserved another look, and the reissues offer a good one. If you've never heard The Bunnymen before, their career overview, Songs to Learn & Sing, is still the best introduction, but you can't go too wrong diving right into Porcupine. Either way, The Bunnymen are a band worth exploring-- you know, once you get past the name.","

Democrazy,Damon Albarn,by: Jedediah Gilchrist,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03e5e6ef9596931fed8/1:1/w_160/e7deebc7.jpg,2004-03-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/99-democrazy/,Honest Jon's,"Damon Albarn is rightfully cocky these days. He's weathered the rise and fall of Britpop with a creative and relatively daring body of work (at least, relative to that of your average Gallagher brother), and, in the face of losing longtime musical partner and melodic powerhouse Graham Coxon, even led Blur to new heights in 2003 with Think Tank, which pushed the band in brave new directions that frequently echoed his dabblings with Gorillaz and Mali Music. But as much as the fates have smiled on Blur's frontman, no amount of conceit warrants the release of half-baked ideas masquerading as songs, even if that release is mercifully limited to a homegrown 10-inch vinyl pressing of 5,000 copies. The 14 tracks that constitute Albarn's Democrazy are symbolic of both his creative process and celebrity hubris. Recorded in hotel rooms during Blur's 2003 Think Tank tour, this record offers naked representations of what may one day become fleshed-out tracks for any one of Albarn's pet projects. Composed principally of canned beats, acoustic guitar, Casio synths and Albarn's trademark whine, the songs vary between flat instrumentals (""Reedz"", ""Saz Theory Book""), truncated melodies (""Half a Song"", ""I Need a Gun""), and loop-centric vamps (""A Rappy Song"", ""Five Star Life""), most of which are less adventurous than the average self-produced download from the heyday of mp3.com. A few of the stronger tracks manage to approach full-blown song status, but fall short for one reason or another. With ""Sub Species of an American Day"", Albarn zings us Yanks with an ever-so-biting commentary on ambivalent American culture, pointing out our ironic simultaneous love for both exercise and leisure (touché, my limey friend-- Albarn 1, America 0); ""I Miss You"", at best, could have made for a subpar Great Escape B-side; and the pleasantly simple acoustic strum of ""American Welfare Poem"" is blown by Albarn's mumbled, extemporaneously wandering vocals, producing a half-song both uninventive and inaccessible. Democrazy's strongest moment comes with the hideously titled ""Gotta Get Down with the Passing of Time"", which, not coincidentally, is the closest thing here to a fully realized song. Curiously, the track seems to owe a debt to early Beat Happening, and in spite of its pithy lyrics, remains a brief respite from overwhelming mediocrity. However, it's been sequenced as the album's penultimate track, which makes it an unfortunate case of too little, too late. The release of such an incomplete and stillborn collection begs the question: Who really cares about Albarn's hotel room musings? It's not as though there's a shortage of Albarn releases in the world, and besides, his omnipresence neutralizes any mystique that might kindle interest in how a Blur song is born. Indeed, he's already recorded such a wealth of great material that no mystique remains, leaving no real reason for anyone-- including the most dedicated fan-- to seek out these poorly produced musical shreds.","Damon Albarn is rightfully cocky these days.

The Unsustainable Lifestyle,Beauty Pill,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24a5e6ef959693203a8/1:1/w_160/d80508a4.jpg,2004-03-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/614-the-unsustainable-lifestyle/,Dischord,"Fans of Smart Went Crazy who just can't accept the fact that Chad Clark is capable of producing anything short of brilliance should save themselves the trauma and skip right to The Unsustainable Lifestyle's seventh track, ""Such Large Portions!"", a serene rocker packed with pitch-bent guitars and acrobatic drumming; or crank up the cacophonous, multitracked percussion of the Breeders-esque ""The Western Prayer"". Either of these songs could allow a person to maintain, indefinitely, that Clark is among indie music's great talents, so long as they never delved into the rest of this record. The band, however, have made the regrettable decision of opening their long-awaited debut full-length with ""Goodnight for Real"", a listless jingle on which Chad Clark sings, ""There's a band on stage tonight/ Every note they play turns its back to you."" It's a sentiment that pretty much sums things up for fans of Clark's former band, whose emotional doomsaying and snappy minor-key geometry produced one of the best post-punk albums of the last decade. Unfortunately, all that made Con Art so effective is lost on The Unsustainable Lifestyle, save an overbearing cynicism, which, lacking an apposite musical backing, quickly grows tiresome. Since the late 90s, the once-influential Dischord Records harvest has proven the seminal D.C. punk label hell-bent on one goal: capturing that never-influential J. Robbins sound. So far, the label has been fairly successful at putting forth a sturdy lineup of D.C. post-punk prospects who, with proper guidance, may one day ascend to great heights. But what they seem to have failed to appreciate is that each band has a vastly different array of talents, and whether through mismanagement or the bands' own aspirations to a preconceived ""Dischord sound"", their creativity has too often been stifled. The Beauty Pill, thanks in part to their high-profile ancestry and their solid 2001 EP, Cigarette Girl from the Future, have been billed as the most promising of the lot. But expectation is a cynic's death knell, and on The Unsustainable Lifestyle, the band cuddles up to the safety of innocuous clichés. Instead of tearing loose here, The Beauty Pill elect to bottle their ample cynicism, and any emotional impact is lost to a relentless finery. Vocalists Clark and Rachel Burke often struggle to hit their notes, but rather than conceal a limited vocal range with flanger effects or high-volume ululations, they hog the spotlight with ambiguous verses. Perhaps most estranging is the caustic chirpiness of ""Won't You Be Mine"", which opens with a sample of Mr. Rogers offering friendship, and vaguely hints at a discourse on race relations. The chorus asks the question, ""What I really want to know is/ Are you my nigga?"" with delineation offered only in lyrics like, ""The leash is loose enough to feel like autonomy/ The milk's watered down in the tenement kitchenette."" Another misstep lies in the band's apparent unwillingness to attempt vocal harmonies: Possessing a halfway competent duo of vocalists is a rare blessing that The Beauty Pill sorely squander. The Beauty Pill are a surgically precise band whose compositions perform limber arabesques without losing a step, and Clark's homespun production accentuates every contortion. But then, that's Dischord in a nutshell. What was novel and exciting about Jawbox and Burning Airlines a decade ago is quickly growing stale in modern incarnations like this one. For a label that once prided itself on the spit-in-the-wind innovation of bands like Fugazi, Minor Threat, Jawbox, Rites of Spring, and Shudder to Think, its recent catalog's homogeneity is disconcerting. I'd be lying if I claimed not to enjoy J. Robbins' earlier work, but his production style was never more than a pedestal for adroit musicianship; it's feckless of a record like The Unsustainable Lifestyle to cling to ghosts when the musicians behind it have proven themselves capable of so much more.","Fans of Smart Went Crazy who just can't accept the fact that Chad Clark is capable of producing anything ...

Monsoon,Preston School of Industry,by: JT Ramsay,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a124b1335d7bf16981aa/1:1/w_160/e11df3ba.jpg,2004-03-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6463-monsoon/,Matador,"The short of it: This album has all the charm of a flaccid penis protruding out from beneath a fold of flesh on a balding, middle-aged man. Its ten songs retread the same ground covered on All This Sounds Gas, but where those songs sounded like a rehash of Scott Kannberg's contribution to Pavement (which wasn't so bad), Monsoon reminds us why he contributed his own material so infrequently. Without Pavement's alchemy, Preston School of Industry lacks those inimitable aspects of amateurism, nuance and play. Where Pavement rooftop-gambled in musical crapshoots, Kannberg's solo routine plays it close to the vest, folding when the stakes get high. And this game's being played for penny candy. Kannberg has functioned as Pavement's Jimmy Carter since their breakup in '99, crafting a legacy for the band while his role in the band itself becomes less clear. He shepherded Lance Bangs' Slow Century past Stephen Malkmus' disinterest; he's also the primary force behind a forthcoming Crooked Rain reissue. Kannberg's role as an archivist and a true friend to fans remains one of unvarnished good will, and for that we should be grateful. But this album sounds like it was recorded and released as a favor from someone at the label. Truth is, the lighter that ignited All This Sounds Gas is long out of butane. The record begins harmlessly enough, for better or worse. ""The Furnace Sun"" would be right at home on Old 97's Fight Songs-- it seems that all of Kannberg's guitars are stuck on twang settings. His reaching vocal on ""Walk of a Gurl"" sounds like a Counting Crows outtake. ""Caught in the Rain"" is an innocuous pop ditty, but would've been better with a piña colada. ""Line It Up"" begins with the same sexy-voiced nonsense that found its way onto All This Sounds Gas, except this time it's truly nonsense instead of ""we know that you like us"" repeated ad nauseum. Kannberg's voice renders every song nearly indistinguishable, each one a faceless victim laid out on the slab in this musical morgue. Not even Wilco can save him on the collaborative ""Get Your Crayons Out"". If All This Sounds Gas was Spiral Stairs aping George Harrison, then is Monsoon his Ocean Rain? Or does it speak volumes about his ego, like Matador's Louis XIV, ""Apres moi, le deluge!"" If anything, this album proves at least two old adages: ""When it rains, it pours"" and ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."" And I'm so easily fooled.","The short of it: This album has all the charm of a flaccid penis protruding out from beneath a fold ...

Quixotic,Martina Topley-Bird,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87713d197565213966b/1:1/w_160/7ca0a3fa.jpg,2004-03-01 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8255-quixotic/,Independiente,"As the story goes, Tricky discovered Martina Topley-Bird as a teenager, when he spotted the truant schoolkid smoking cigarettes in front of his Bristol home. Their conversations quickly turned to collaboration, and within a few years time, Topley-Bird was not only the sweetly vocal foil to the blunted chaos of Tricky's still superb Maxinquaye, she was the mother of his daughter. As the pair's romantic relationship and creative synergy disintegrated over the ensuing years, the release of her own solo record seemed inevitable. And yet, even as Bristol's trip-hop gave way to Morcheeba's slip-slop, Topley-Bird remained out of the picture. So how odd that she would return in 2003, eight years removed from Maxinquaye, with a record that mostly sounds, well, four years too late. Quixotic is a lot of things, but, in engaging in exactly the kind of non-committal genre-hopping and saccharine candy-kissing that practically defined post-Bristol also-rans like Mono, Hooverphonic and Morcheeba, it's mostly just dated. Topley-Bird's eagerness to distance herself from the billowing dope smoke of those early Tricky benchmarks is evident within Quixotic's first two minutes. We're eased in via ""Intro""-- a swinging a cappella track that's more O Brother than Pre-Millennium-- before Josh Homme and Mark Lanegan show up to draw some lumbering stoner guitar shapes on the diluted rock exercise ""Need One"". With its clumsy riffola and arrhythmic overproduction, ""Need One"" conjures up the precise strain of the Hollywood rock/electronica hybrid that was perfect for end credits in movies about things like cyberpunks and stolen identities, but nowhere else. The Morcheeba similarities rear their head again on ""Anything"", a supple acoustic ballad that gives way to a jumble of slide guitars, quivering synth bits and widescreen beats before collapsing in a hush of polite reverb. With its shadowy melody and lovely key change, ""Anything"" is by no stretch a terrible song, but it's difficult to listen to without feeling like you've heard it before. ""Soul Food"", with its warm Rhodes keyboards, library music string pieces and old soul accoutrements, is arguably even more derivative, yet thanks to its rolling arrangements and Topley-Bird's gloriously unhurried delivery, it's handily the album's standout track. Things get patchier from here on out. The bluesy, emaciated drone of ""Lullaby"", the awful space-rock whoosh of ""I Still Feel"", and the frankly inexplicable punk thrash of ""I Wanna Be There"" all seem to exist as afterthoughts. There are other highlights, mainly in the form of the shuddering drum workout of ""Ragga"" and the tousled Sunday morning sway of ""Lying"", but even those feel like small victories in the context of this disappointing aesthetic misfire. As ever, Topley-Bird's voice continues to be a strange and beautiful thing, but it's admittedly less strange and less beautiful when framed against this hopelessly warmed over setting. Although I can't quite figure out what she could've done to produce the distance and the renewal she so obviously requires, I remain fairly certain that making Even Bigger Calm is probably not the way out. Of Bristol, a typecasting quandary, or anywhere.","As the story goes, Tricky discovered Martina Topley-Bird as a teenager, when he spotted the truant schoolkid smoking cigarettes in ...

Seafarers Music EP,Will Oldham,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c113d197565213af1c/1:1/w_160/5f7290e5.gif,2004-03-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5977-seafarers-music-ep/,Drag City,"A few weeks back, at a secret Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy show, I made a rookie mistake, presuming that I knew what Will Oldham was up to, even a decade after having first been mystified by his music. Brashly assuming the seasick music I'd heard that night (courtesy of ""Prince"" and ""Cockfighter,"" aka Matt Sweeney) to be a taster for his soundtrack work for British director Jason Massot's documentary about sailors in the bustling Rotterdam seaport. The newswire quoted me blabbering expertly on ""songs about spanking, donkeys (but not spanking donkeys), and allusions to creatures such as the 'Super Wolf' and 'Panther Girl'."" I'd asserted that there couldn't possibly be more songs about sailors and the sea. Was I ever wrong. Not only were the dozen songs I'd heard completely new, but none of them referenced the soundtrack for Seafarers at all, save the fashion sense of the sardine-packed Williamsburg crowd itself. Sailor is the new Camo: Will-fully-induced scurvy, scruffy pirate beards, ironic bicep-tual hula girl tats, moth-riddled wooly peacoats, salty squints, and crooked seamen caps are replacing Radar hats, olive-green fatigues, boutique-bought dogtags, and $100 paratrooper pants at a frightening pace. Again, Oldham surfs ahead of the Zeitgeist, much as he did by anticipating skillet-licking necrofolkia with There Is No-One What Will Take Care of You and Days in the Wake. Like Oldham's previous seafaring soundtrack work, these four songs, dedicated to rough-hewn human flotsam from Sweden, Polynesia, Croatia and Nigeria, are instrumental-- Oldham, brother Paul and David Bird carving out four different variations on a melancholic theme. Not quite sea shanties, the gently finger-flicked notes sway to and fro, creaking like frayed ropes and salt-cracked lips on a stilled day, destinationless, and surrounded by the infinite waters. Each character bobs and pitches on the slight fluctuations of shimmering saline, their movements imperceptible yet in motion. The order of notes is uncertain and always changing, leaving me to wonder if the characters are but Abyss-like apparitions raised from the sea itself. That said, the little nuances of the Oldhams' and Bird's playing are what keep the notes afloat on the despondent, drunken music bed, and their soft focus makes for more return listens than Oldham's past scores for The Broken Giant or Slitch. The musicians enter in about a minute apart on ""Sapele"", setting up slight ripples between each others' notes while open strings and tube-warmed amps buzz towards the horizon, accompanying protagonist ""Lars"". The smallest of sounds, such as the wheezing of air organ and ungrounded fuzz bubble up on ""Emmanuel"" and shine as beacons, their minimal gestures conveying the sad depths that lie beneath the sailors' brutish exteriors. Could Will Oldham be the next Jean Genet, using the fragile-feminine to trace the savage-masculine, or does this just reinforce that incidental music is the next post-rock?","A few weeks back, at a secret Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy show, I made a rookie mistake, presuming that I knew ...

In Lynch on Lynch, he told Chris Rodley, ""Whenever you can build sheds, you've got it made. As soon as you capture some space and design how the shape of it is, mood starts occurring, light starts playing on the wall, and just to see it happening is unbelievable!"" I remember another interview with Lynch where he talked about his love of forgotten spaces, places like utility closets, the area beneath a flight of stairs in an industrial building, and so on. What's interesting about the unexamined corners Lynch describes is that they have an ambience that comes from the most basic elements. Walls, floor and light combine to create a feeling, instantly. Something similar happens with sound. The way ductwork in an old building groans, the buzz of florescent lights, the rattle of a loose shutter, plumbing gurgling somewhere a few floors away. When I'm in a certain state of mind, I can fixate on these sounds, what filmmakers call ""room tone,"" and let my mind wander. Swedish sound artist B.J. Nilsen, who also records as Hazard, apparently lives inside the sonic details of our everyday lives. Previous releases include Land, Wind, and Wood, all of which include, in part, processed recordings of the things described. Nilsen performed at the Vienna Opera House at a Touch event curated by Christian Fennesz (on a bill that [drool] included Fennesz and Philip Jeck), and Live at Konzerthaus, Vienna 06_12_03 is a recording of his set. The single 38-minute piece begins outdoors, with field recordings of thunder folded in on themselves, so the crashes and sub-bass rumbles happen with man-made frequency. Gradually, an industrial palette rises and overtakes the natural sounds. Nilsen is a whiz with atmosphere, creating held tones that blend perfectly with whatever ambient sound happens to meet them. I listened to this set at a medium level in my apartment, and it was difficult to tell where the recording left off and the world around me began. It was like my living space (which was admittedly a bit noisier than usual-- with the warm weather came more sound from the street) was engaged in a duet with Nilsen. The bus offered an even more interesting effect, and the grind of the coach engine slipped perfectly inside the music's whisper and hum. Rest assured, though, that Live at Konzerthaus, Vienna 06_12_03 is fantastic on its own at high volume, when nothing else but its rapturous drones can be heard. Field recordings come and go-- sounds of wind, buzzing bees, that sort of thing-- but the soul of the record is the subtle purr of vibrating metal. Gradually, the sound field becomes more dense and the textures more insistent. High-end static starts to creep in around the 20-minute mark, and the music develops a disorienting, psychedelic swirl. Over the last seven minutes, Nilsen erects a wall of pipe organ drone, pulled from material used to create ""Breathe"", his contribution to the Touch compilation Spire: Organ Works Past, Present & Future.

Hole of Burning Alms,Papa M,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299febea9e61561daa444d/1:1/w_160/b0175bd7.jpg,2004-02-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6162-hole-of-burning-alms/,Drag City,"Dear David Pajo, From now on, I'll call you by your proper name. It's the best way to keep track of you. Pinpointing Pajo has always been my problem. When explaining your musical lineage to quasi-compelled pals, I'm tempted to scribble flowcharts and draw convoluted figures on oversized sheets of graph paper: thick, black lines are scrawled from Slint to Tortoise to Zwan; little blue streaks shoot from M to M Is the Thirteenth Letter to Ariel M to Papa M; yellow stripes stretch from Mogwai to Matmos; with Will Oldham projects always in red, and written in cursive. Instead, I talk it through with sharp, pointed hand gestures and lots of squinting. Usually, my target stops listening, or fiddles with a cigarette, or just thinks that I'm being weird, and then I get nervous and tacit and play crowd-pleasing Justin Timberlake tracks on my stereo until everyone dances and forgets what we were talking about. Because David, your elusiveness is exhausting. I spent a night in Louisville once, bowling with my friends: I felt haunted and started looking everywhere for you, nervously scanning the aluminum ball racks for scrappy tufts of black hair, thinking maybe you were crouching there, lurking quietly behind the rows of orange and purple nine-pound balls. I checked the brown plastic tables for your initials, pushing aside scratched pitchers of beer, making sure I had accurately and completely inspected all writable ground for potential evidence. I typed ""Pajo"" into the scoring computer. Later, I thought maybe you would stop by the Steak and Shake for a strawberry sundae or cheese fries. I stirred a cup of coffee with my index finger, ate a sugar packet, and scanned every single booth: There were no signs. The next morning, I sat mutely in the backseat of a car pointed towards New York City. Hole of Burning Alms helps, David. All these instrumental singles and B-sides make your sonic trajectory clearer and easier to organize-- when taken together, they chug hard like your career, shifting chronologically from Slint-ish guitar surges to acoustic country hymns to traveling beats to scummy rock songs. Besides, everybody knows that you like singles and EPs better than albums. I get it: Albums are too self-contained, too complicated, too heady. Here you are in bits and pieces. And none of it sounds the same. ""Napoleon"" is post-Slint/pre-Pajo-as-vocalist and defiantly haunting, heavy, throbbing, and perpetually somersaulting between quiet parts and loud parts. And David, even though you recorded the song in your basement, it sounds enormous and monumental, like the whole neighborhood must have bowed, bent and quaked every time you crumpled into a chord. There are other people playing, too: bass and drums and an extra guitar. (They are nice.) Remember when you said that ""Wedding Song No. 3"" was the first and last multi-tracked recording that you ever did with a live band, and you sounded so unhappy about it? From the reversed guitars at the top and the heavy, plodding chords, I think ""Wedding"" is actually vaguely celestial, all that sound spraying out in one big wave, consistent and thick and glittery. But in collecting all these pieces of scattered material from throughout your career, you're perhaps sharing too much. I get that ""Xmas 1997"" was an audio holiday card for Drag City, and therefore sort of private and giggly, but why does it sound so lifeless? I can hear you on the piano and in some of the froggier croaking sounds; the strings and drum machines are chilly, though, like going shopping for presents in a bad mall. I mean, it's pretty, but that basic fade-out is just not like you, David! Still, I wholeheartedly appreciate the absurdity of your sunshine-and-flowers cover of ""Turn, Turn, Turn"", mostly because it's a completely insane 16 minutes long, has guitar solos, and seems to backhandedly feature someone hitting a saucepan in the background. Plus, you know that we know the words, and you let us sing along instead of stepping up and whispering all the verses yourself. Before I go, I should tell you: When I first wrote to Drag City asking for a promo to review, I called it House of Burning Alms and never heard back from them. I still feel bad about that, David, because my name is mispronounced all the time and it usually makes me a little sad. Yours,","Dear David Pajo,

Magic & Medicine / Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker,The Coral,by: Neil Robertson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65f9d034d5c69bf3508/1:1/w_160/e07820d1.jpg,2004-02-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11703-magic-medicine-nightfreak-and-the-sons-of-becker/,Deltasonic,"It could've been some lost chapter from High Fidelity. Monday morning and you've skipped lectures to fumble through the discount racks in your local record store. Across the shop floor, there's a pair of pallid, corduroy-clad indie kids, one of them clutching a copy of Magic and Medicine. ""I like The Coral,"" he says, reciting his best music journo impersonation: ""They're like Love's Arthur Lee singing sea shanties with the Beefheart band while The Cramps play pirates together."" ""Oh, well, in that case,"" his friend snaps back, just within earshot of the Stereolab fan whose eye he's trying to catch, ""you can't have heard anything by The Cramps."" Influence-spotting is one of the best-loved pastimes of the armchair music fan; reel off a dozen inspirations behind The Unicorns' album and watch jaws drop at your obsessive, nerd-like knowledge of all things psych-pop (hell, sometimes you might even be right). Indeed, it's true that almost all new music can be sourced back to a few solitary giants who trod their paths before anyone else. But there comes a point where you have to step back and wonder whether such records are an inspired synthesis of the strange and beautiful, or simply the bored shrug of artists without any ideas of their own. It seems the jury is still out on The Coral. Though their self-titled debut was a schizophonic monster of noise, blues and Beatle-delic pop, effects peddles and stoner rock, it was lacking in substance and cohesion, and sounded more like a gang of kids on a school trip discovering what they could do in a recording studio than a creative tour-de-force. Furthermore, its songs were not the white-knuckle, feedback-fuelled stomps they were hyped as, but merely stitched-together fragments of ideas, upon which frontman James Skelly sketched some rough melodic framework. Still, where that album disappointed in its application, it at least astounded with its audacity. On Magic & Medicine, the band's frenetic freakout leanings have been stripped away in favor of a more humble approach, placing subtlety and songwriting above the sounds being produced. It all sounds far less interesting. Opening track ""In the Forest"" sets the slowed-down tone instantly-- all antiquated organ chords and ghostly vocals-- before the cloyingly kooky maraca-shaking and spaghetti-Western guitars of ""Don't Think You're the First"" make you worry that maybe the band's increased attention span has smothered the smashed frontierism and drug-injected vitality of the band's debut. To the band's credit, it's not all downtrodden disappointment. ""Pass It On"" is the kind of condensed, country-flecked pop that their debut had dreamt of; ""Careless Hands"" caresses the legacy of Love with its flamenco flourishes and tempo changes; and ""Leizah"" is a heartbound brood of naked 60s pop that avoids hand-wringing earnestness through the realization that the song's main muse probably doesn't even exist. In fact, much of the record relies on the power of its narrator, as James Skelley's sideways scouse croon sounds both brash and beautiful, drunken and emotive, with lyrics (such as on the buoyant summer-strut of ""Bill McCai"") that can be stark, surreal and affecting all at the same time. Unfortunately, the concessions gained by Magic & Medicine are virtually obliterated by the rushed monstrosity of its companion piece. Issued in the UK as a limited edition release to fill the void until their third full-length, Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker is a flatulent, irrelevant, self-indulgent attempt at recapturing the hotwired spontaneity of their debut through a dirge of sub-par psychedelia and try-hard freakouts (such as the frankly appalling ""Auntie's Operation"" and ""I Forgot My Name""). Indeed, it ends as such a mess of absentee melody and soundchecked jam sessions that its only redeeming qualities lie in the nu-disco dalliances of ""Venom Cable"" and ""Grey Harpoon"", with their Rapture-esque samples and wisps of cyclical guitar. In the end, Magic & Medicine and Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker find The Coral at quite a pivotal moment in their development; torn between the idea-loaded diversity of their debut and the radio-friendly pop sheen that turned its heir into a chart-dwelling success-- and unable to effectively straddle the two. It finds them wading through their influences, unsure how to integrate their rampant eclecticism into something more substantive. If the band do have, as many suggest, a truly great album in their grasp, perhaps now would be a good time to prove it. If not, we may all have to settle for the real thing.","

Mondo Morricone: The Trilogy,Ennio Morricone,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44dea9e61561daa8103/1:1/w_160/b57c4459.jpg,2004-02-29 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5569-mondo-morricone-the-trilogy/,Royal EarforceStereo Deluxe,"Please excuse the hyperbole in this review. I know it's off-putting, and I know we critics hand out these laudations for any trifle or speck that obstructs our paths on the way to the Pitchfork vending machine. But this time I mean it: If you don't know Ennio Morricone beyond The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly soundtrack, your life is a sham, your friends are holograms, and your soul is a barren wasteland where maggots greedily feast upon heartlessness and willed ignorance. This is not to say Morricone's 1960s spaghetti-Western scores were anything other than indispensable space-capsule epics compressed into noble vistas and griseous beards. However, towards the early 1970s, Morricone realized it was time to put down his pistols, cast off his spurs, and stop terrorizing the Black Maiden's children in the Texan Graveyard of Doom or squinting at the mud-lined faces of lawless AWOL Mexican warriors. So, he jetsetted to a strobe-lit land of swinging Eurodisco chandeliers, Twiggy impersonators with lime-green skirts, sophisticated black glasses, bottles of Chardonnay, and a mad acid party with the Ambassador of Morocco in his opulent tie-dyed mansion. Mondo Morricone: The Trilogy charts this later mood. If you don't believe me, ask the Amazonian Italian vixen on the cover of the first volume of this three-disc box which collects the previously released Mondo Morricone, More Mondo Morricone, and Molto Mondo Morricone. Morricone's Western scores were galloping military warcalls and pacing anticipation, perhaps some regret for killing innocent townspeople. On A Fistful of Dollars or Navajo Joe, the electric guitar reigns like a fascist over the characters' heads, the aural equivalent of spectacular and intimidating brick beasts sliding down from the sky. The music on this box is from ""quieter"" Italian horror flicks and melodramas. It's still as dazzling and ceaseless as the Westerns, but its weight spreads in another direction. The Western scores are generally insurmountable pinnacles of agonizing or resigned cries, rushing along until they sweep you away in a gush of violins; the Mondo Morricone pieces sprawl out before you, clear a path, and let you come into them at your own pace. Not that Morricone is making it difficult for you to make the leap. The first piece, ""La Lucertola"" bleeds wilting clarinets into increasingly silent chimes. A tremolo of epic Western guitar fades in and out, some sort of space blender is turned on, and the rhythm is soft, skittering bossa nova punctuated by go-go harpsichord flourishes. But much of the effect is due to Morricone's sly use of that film score rarity, the human voice. The vocals on ""Le Foto Proibite di Una Signora per Bene"" are opera versions of Marianne Faithfull or Gal Costa, launching into ineffable tones that should tear down your house but never seem anything other than comforting-- and all with a Sinatra-in-Sin-City strut. ""Doricamente"" features a chorus of precocious Beach Boys wannabes crying themselves to sleep atop a spy theme guitar as sopping and fashionable as hair gel. ""La Bambola"" hits arrhythmic folk until it scatters into the softest, most beguiling ye-ye la-la-la tune to hit The Top of the Pops Christmas Special. And although you feel bad for getting off on it, there are songs that are clearly only suitable to play at Caligula's next birthday bash: ""Sospiri da Una Radio Lontana"" is either a whipping or an orgasm, depending on your temperament. A lilting flute tries to undermine the lasciviousness, but to no avail. It's so sensual that by the end of the song, your skin will be lacerated by fingernails as you try to take off your clothes. ""Voce Seconda"" has so little air; the vocal track is basically nothing but gasping. The reverbed guitars barely have enough space to be strummed. Somehow, Morricone also made time for the most gratuitously groovy garage hits of the decade, mashing chromatic scales off of wah-wahing keyboards amidst fleets of neon drumrolls. Sometimes, as on ""Citta Violenta"", there are no flashes of hope or levity at all: Grimy brass lows, some Mafiosi Faust begins intrepidly walking to his doom, and the fists start flying. The best, of course, is when these genres merge into the more traditional compositions: ""Belinda May"" opens with a music box twinkle, befuddled voices, shuddering percussion that could be spur-rotations or Brazilian percussion, and a melody that realizes it's never going to break into the Bubsy Berkeley bigtime promised by its first few moments. And on ""La Cugina"", free jazz noir dislocates itself, pops into pneumatic tubes, and emerges, reinvigorated, in some huffing funk make-out music belied by an impossibly chaste female voice. It's like sexing up a mockingbird-- a daydream for some bird watchers and an abhorrent, bestial perversion for everyone else. But the most perplexing and victorious is ""Rodeo"", a piece that begins with the jarring and ghoulish smacking of corpses and gets thrown by a massive funk shakedown into a bunch of tinny xylophones, like the ""Stairway to Heaven"" of call-waiting Muzak. The third volume is not nearly as innovative or diverse as the first two, but that's certainly no reason to avoid the set, or even the volume. The simple fact is that unless you enjoy searching for full soundtracks to one-week-only 1972 Italian pulp movies, this summation of Morricone's fashionable spy themes, bossa nova anthems, and all sorts of inspired genre-splicing is as satisfying as this whole ""entire century of music"" thing gets. The best song, the nine-minute ""Come Maddalena"", might be the most subtly experimental, even enlightening, song I've ever heard, slapping cool jazz drumming, droning church organs, ornate harpsichord, and the sound of playing children falling off a roof with a powerful, accessible, stirring chorus. I just listened to it as I typed that sentence and, right now, I want nothing more than to take a bullet to the head: I can't imagine my life getting any better. The last time total beatitude was this cheap, you had to petition royalty to sail to the West Indies to go and pick it up. Make the right choice.","Please excuse the hyperbole in this review.

Ultravisitor,Squarepusher,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a533ea9e61561daa509f/1:1/w_160/0141e142.jpg,2004-02-29 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7450-ultravisitor/,Warp,"All good things come to an end. Even as I flinch writing something so ridden with cliché, its annoyingly enduring truth rips my good intentions to shreds. This is a by-product of clarity, of waking up, and a built-in mantra for growing up, just like you probably heard your mom say when the ice cream melted or you got caught with pot under your bed. It's just a stupid part of life, like all the other clichés, but to see it in action is still traumatic. I can almost guarantee that Tom Jenkinson is still living to piss off lots of people-- isn't there another tired axiom about a rose by another other name? The thing that gets me about him is that, as a musician, he's obviously got the talent and muse to do pretty much whatever he wants. Witness him playing jazz drums over a stuttered breakbeat, filling in all the open spaces with bass riffs I could swear were piped in from a Brand X album. But at the end of the day, for Squarepusher and every other musical idiot savant, the power of people (and their ears) reigns supreme. When I say all good things come to an end, I'm referring to the notion that we should be impressed by his facility or pissed that he bailed on that U.S. tour. Ultravisitor is Squarepusher's sixth or seventh album (depending on how you consider Do You Know Squarepusher-- personally, I don't), and succeeds in surprising ways. It's nothing terribly ""new,"" in so far as the basic elements of his palette are concerned. He is still infatuated with atmospheric fusion instrumentals, abstract variations on drum-n-bass and now even more in love with his own live drumming. Yet, he's a good drummer; perhaps a tad faceless in the grand scheme of jazz-funk, but certainly competent, and often genuinely interesting. And if that were Ultravisitor's only highlight, Jenkinson would have fallen on bad times. Luckily, it's not: Practically tattooed across every track is the sense that he's ""matured"" as both a performer and composer. I know that sounds lame, especially when describing someone with a history of obscenity, irresponsibility and junkie tendencies. I think it's true, though, and far be it from me to knock good music just because I'm tired of the sideshow behind it. In some ways, Ultravisitor is the only Squarepusher album you need to know about. It contains instances of every idea, texture or beat he's presented until now, and unlike recent releases Do You Know Squarepusher or Go Plastic, little of it sounds stale. In this respect, the record is most similar to Selection Sixteen, though hardly sounding like a collection of leftovers as that album had. In fact, I'd go so far to say he sounds inspired here. More than on any record since Music Is Rotted One Note, Ultravisitor makes the case that not only does nobody else sound like Squarepusher, but that few (if anyone) are capable of even a second-rate impersonation. This album, however, is too long; there are scattered moments that seem redundant in the face of Jenkinson's own catalog, if not that of new-schoolers like Prefuse 73 or Hrvatski; his improvisations tend to meander, and seem more the work of someone much more in love with himself than his audience. And somehow, none of that diminishes Ultravisitor's accomplishments, chief among them being that it updates the template of the popular virtuoso. This is Squarepusher's ""Flight of the Bumblebee"". At almost 80 minutes, Ultravisitor contains too much music to really hold together as a cohesive statement-- if that isn't a seasoned rule of rock, then it certainly applies to Squarepusher. The title track is a deft, yet intensely melodic slice of drum-n-electro-pop, similar in spirit to his lone actual-pop foray ""My Red Hot Car"", but filtered through a much shorter attention span, even as it's nearly twice as long. The bassline still seems tangentially related to dub and the melody similarly a distant cousin to some Chick Corea line from the early 70s. In the hands of anyone else, or even the same person in other instances, it should add up to a disorganized, wanky mess. To my ears, it sounds like classic instrumental pop. Other tunes, like ""Circlewave"" and the relatively gentle ""Iambic 9 Poetry"" (not to be confused with Budakhan Mindphone's ""Iambic 5 Poetry""), take this concept and jazz it up or tone it down, respectively. In every case, no matter if Squarepusher programs drum tracks or plays them himself, theme and variation are the keys, again following the frequently beaten path of the virtuoso. And speaking of classical stuff, how about those guitar and bass solos? Unsurprisingly, the more Jenkinson manages to insert recurring thematic ideas into his cadenzas, the more interesting they are. ""I Fulcrum"" is an extended bass solo colored in wavering, dissonant feedback, and, like several other songs on the album, it features piped-in crowd noise. It begins as a dark, minor-key figure somewhat reminiscent of Michael Henderson's ""Willie Nelson"" figure from Miles Davis' Tribute to Jack Johnson, though the deft, harmonized patterns that emerge are purely of Jenkinson's design. The brief guitar piece ""Andrei"" hardly sounds like it could come from the same person, and in fact would work wonders played at the library as reading music. (And I mean that as a compliment.) Contrarily, ""Every Day I Love"" just seems aimless and boring. Plus it's called ""Every Day I Love"". The best argument for Ultravisitor is not that it's impressive so much as that it's interesting. Like Aphex Twin, Squarepusher exists in a sphere that, for many non-diehard fans, has to put up double the cash to reap the same rewards as it did before folks already knew what to expect. The album isn't a drastic stylistic shift-- though the warped noise-hop of ""50 Cycles"" suggests Squarepusher might be trying to create a new genre-- but rather, an almost perfectly realized example of how to pull off beat-driven instrumental electronic music without seeming either too abstract, or too hopelessly lost in 1997. I'll leave the light on in the hopes he gets a handle on the guitar solos and the running time next album.","All good things come to an end.

All People Is My Friends,DJ Koze,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb67abf31b7dc7155aa6/1:1/w_160/8ddb96ae.jpg,2004-02-26 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2542-all-people-is-my-friends/,Kompakt,"Let's get a couple of things out of the way from the start. First, DJ Koze's All People Is My Friends is probably the least essential mix CD ever released on Kompakt. Second, that's a meaningless statement. Over the past few years, Michael Mayer's Cologne-based label has been as consistently rewarding as any in the world, and even its relatively weaker output still carries recommendations. The bar set by mixes such as Mayer's Immer or Triple R's Friends is so high that to say a subsequent record doesn't clear that mark leaves only the faintest hint of its relative quality. To be fair, even if All People Is My Friends weren't a less satisfactory listen than most of those others, the comparison is also a bit faulty because this record embraces a different aesthetic than most Kompakt mixes. As the title indicates, DJ Koze casts a wider net than most, eschewing tech-house for large swathes of his set and including outsider music, folk-pop, ambient, and beatless noodling. In that sense, it skirts closest to Tobias Thomas' Smallville, although whereas that panoramic mix unfolded with grace and elegance, Koze casts himself adrift, wandering a zig-zag path with some abrupt tempo and style changes, exemplified with a wink and a nod perhaps by his early inclusion of the Langley Schools Music Project's sparse reading of ""The Long and Winding Road"". What often seems like a scattershot selection of records is infused with senses of nostalgia and comfort. That gooey familiarity is manifested in both Koze's inclusion of well-known electro tracks from Mr. Oizo and Smith N Hack and selections from tech-house pioneers such as Thomas Brinkmann, Isolée, and Jan Jelinek (in this case, avec The Exposures). Even more curious, Koze explores elements of music's permeation into both pop culture and our everyday lives. So Mr. Oizo nicks his song title from Indeep, a bit of ""Personal Jesus"" finds its way into The Christians and Konrad Sprenger's ""I Was Yours"", the Langley Schools Music Project covers 60s pop, and Koze's set itself closes with a (probably) drunken singalong of Frankie Valli's ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"". These referential nods and out-of-leftfield recordings illustrate the feedback loop on which pop music feeds-- particularly in a club context, in which the dialogue between performer and patron is both immediate and two-way. Koze takes a bit of time to get a proper foothold, but once an underwhelming beginning fades further in the rearview, there's a lot to like. Highlights from Isoleé and Jelinek should be well known to tech-house listeners by now, but among the lesser-known tracks, there are at least three real gems: Fabrice Lig's ""Meet U in Brooklyn"", Jackmate's ""80sc 7seq"", and Matthew Jonson's ""Typerope"", each of which are among the deepest and most vivacious tracks on the mix. Because DJ Koze's own productions are often hard-charging, it's a slight shock that, on the whole, the mix is so delicate-- even his own contribution, ""Geklöppel B2"" is arid and spacious-- but if this record is full of anything, it's surprises.","Let's get a couple of things out of the way from the start.

Curling Pond Woods,Greg Davis,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b45e6ef95969321285/1:1/w_160/c5a29d10.jpg,2004-02-26 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2189-curling-pond-woods/,Carpark,"You know how it is, after the logs have settled on the campfire, the tin plates cease to clang, and the mood of the evening is just about right to pull out the Powerbook and play a few finger-picked ditties around the fire. At least, that's how I imagine how it would be camping with Greg Davis. Having dabbled in the past with classical composition, electroacoustic sound-processing, hip-hop and boom-bap, et cetera, Davis hit upon his sound with his Carpark debut, Arbor. Drawing on the gentler sounds of acoustic folk, the instruments and warm notes were gently nudged into more random (or else more carefully considered) sound compositions, the process never overshadowing the trajectory of melody. He's grown nimble enough in his approach to pull out the computer and make it sound like anything but. As the nomenclature would attest, the move has been made from singular tree to the more holistic Woods, as Davis has grown increasingly concerned with the arc of the album as a whole. ""Red Barn Road"" opens like the mouths of an amateur barbershop quartet for a half-minute, foreshadowing the voices to come. For ""Brocade (Rewoven)"", he takes the finger-picked strings and stretches them to resemble barren branches in a snow-covered cloister, slowly moving the trunks about and blurring the spaces in between as a kick-drum trudges about in evenly-paced steps. Seemingly sparse from the outside, once among the trees, they reveal a nuanced density of sound that you can get lost in. ""Improved Dreaming"" could be a Nobukazu Takemura campfire tale, all bird chirps and music boxes scattered so as to sync up with a woodland walk, the boots cracking wood and crunching snow in the surrounding silence. The Moondog-like step of ""Shoes & Socks"" gives way to gentle manipulations, the handclaps flickering about like shadows as the flame crackles and a slowly plucked guitar resonates in the ever-shifting dark. The voices return midway through the disc for ""At My Window"", one of Brian Wilson's songs from 1970's underappreciated Sunflower, which, although thematically appropriate, falls flat, as Davis can't quite approximate the harmonies that the Beach Boys pulled off so effortlessly. While his voice is lacking here, the middle break billows into a keen arrangement not far removed from Jim O'Rourke's pop fantasias circa Bad Timing or Eureka. That influence also shines through on the title track, as the finger-picked figures get surrounded by circuses of piano, brass, clarinet, pedal steel, and upbeat handclaps, while subtle electronic textures shift about underneath it all. Davis closes with a cover of The Incredible String Band's ""Air"", but again fails to properly pull off the vocals. With the solemn harmonium and choir-like backing, all I see is the Budweiser Clydesdales tromping through the fresh powder. When he's not so concerned with blatantly showing his pop pedigree, and instead allows the instrumentation to breathe and retain its dreamy and bucolic lilt, Curling Pond Woods is a fine twining of the natural patterns that can occur at once, out on a walk through the countryside and inside the head.","You know how it is, after the logs have settled on the campfire, the tin plates cease to clang, and ...

Live in Japan,The Microphones,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a167ea9e61561daa47be/1:1/w_160/4c9502e4.jpg,2004-02-26 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5272-live-in-japan/,K,"Phil Elvrum is the veritable Walt Whitman of music: He's hermetic, possibly celibate, and immutably happy. His songs celebrate the sensual matter of life, and rarely fall back upon narrative clichés like simple depression or heartbreak in the conventional sense. Like Whitman's poetry, Elvrum's lyrics are often as elementary as a child's jejune rambling, and yet, in their simplicity, they're sturdy, sophisticated, and poignantly inquisitive. And unlike many of today's indie gurus, Phil isn't a gimmick: Despite epic songs that extend to multiple tracks and varying ""parts"", and a challenging concept album that attempted to conquer the galaxy, Elvrum's quavering emotionality never seems less than genuine. Of course, if you're not a sucker for sentimentally pregnant music, The Microphones might be lost on you: Once, after hearing ""Solar System"", Mt. Eerie's fleeting 3½ minute retreat to pop clarity, a friend of mine remarked, ""Anybody can do that."" I'm afraid not. Maybe it was my fault for playing him the song out of context, but to me, after the 17-minute percussive hysteria that precedes it, Mirah's gentle repetition of the line, ""I know you're out there,"" seems among the most serene pleasures on Earth. On The Microphones' website last year, Elvrum solicited fans in Norway who might be willing to board him for the sunless winter. When he found a taker, he packed up his things and went, intending to work and write in seclusion. Given this kind of unpredictable tendency, the release of Live in Japan, February 19th, 21st, and 22nd, 2003 isn't surprising-- especially considering The Microphones' long legacy of rarities, B-sides and Beck-like fakeout releases that seem to shun ""proper follow-up"" status. Still, a big part of The Microphones' music is that it inhabits a dark nether of studio wizardry; to strip away Elvrum's sound-transforming production is to only view half of the picture. Discounting winsome covers of ""Silent Night"" and ""My Favorite Things"", which elicit some of the liveliest crowd responses, Live in Japan consists of entirely new material, but the album sounds only vaguely like The Microphones we've come to know and love through a deluge of extraordinary studio releases. Elvrum's brittle voice and songwriting is as moving as ever, but represented live, these new songs wear thin and fail to carry the emotional weight they likely would have if set amongst the field-recorded effects, cavernous drum sounds and late-night radio buzz of The Microphones' transportive studio projects. Additionally, where many live albums sound more organic than their studio counterparts, the inverse is true here. It's not that Live in Japan isn't intimate; it's that practically nothing could match the intimacy we've come to expect from records like It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water and The Glow, Pt. 2. This aside, what differentiates Live in Japan from The Microphones' previous work is the emergence of a subtle blues bent; songs like ""After N. Young"", ""I Love You So Much!"", and ""Thanksgiving"" hint at a more conventional direction. But despite Elvrum's reported social monasticism, these songs remain paradoxically confessional, as reflected in lines like, ""As you can see/ Having descended the hill/ I still look like me/ I still howl like Phil/ And forever will,"" and in heartened cries like, ""I want my own wind to blow."" In these confessions, the point of this record becomes clear: to separate ""Phil"" from ""The Microphones."" That, of course, is a separation not many fans will take kindly to, as most still consider The Microphones a solo studio project with a revolving-door policy not unlike Robert Pollard's Guided by Voices. Nonetheless, this beguiling division hints that Elvrum has refocused his artistic vision on new vistas. Given this, and that these songs originated over a year ago-- since which time the band has broken temporarily asunder and reconstituted with an amended name-- it's uncertain whether this material will ever undergo the studio wringer. And even if it does, there's no telling whether Elvrum is determined to branch off his sound in some unforeseen direction. Regardless, he ought to consider giving these songs some kind of studio treatment, as they would seem to generate another astonishing LP. ","Phil Elvrum is the veritable Walt Whitman of music: He's hermetic, possibly celibate, and immutably happy. His songs celebrate ...

Portrait of Entwistle EP,The Anomoanon,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0abc0084474cd0bfc1f/1:1/w_160/eed69aae.gif,2004-02-26 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/203-portrait-of-entwistle-ep/,Western Vinyl,"The glorious Who, with their bursting bass drums and bombastic, volume-defeating live shows, were a band who churned expressly for open-mouthed adolescents: Like sniffing glue or dying your hair four shades of magenta, discovering The Who is an action best indulged before the age of eighteen. Consequently, anyone who spent the better part of high school strapped into headphones memorizing Who's Next probably felt a little green when bassist John Entwistle died unexpectedly in a Vegas hotel room in June of 2002. Music consumed during adolescence automatically assumes a kind of epic significance, having wiggled its way into swelling, nubile hearts, seeping deep into growing bones, forging a gummy, undeviating bond-- be it teenage idealism or thick-headed naiveté, that kind of total assimilation never happens again, or at least not in the same stupid, beautiful way. The Anomoanon's boisterous tribute to John Entwistle seems like the logical expression of that appreciation, whether a product of the band's own affection or simply a reflection of universal, seeping Entwistle love; either way, Portrait provides a scrappy, glowing homage to one of rock's greatest players. Portrait of Entwistle is the fourth installation in Western Vinyl's Portrait Series, a collection that works on a spectacular, albeit crazily ambitious, conceit: Each artist produces or procures a visual portrait (a photo, line drawing, painting, etc.), and then records two or more songs inspired by the subject of that picture (past contributors include Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, Papa M, Appendix Out, and Kohn, and new work is forthcoming from The Dirty Three's Mick Turner and Robert Lippok of To Rococo Rot). With three originals and a cover of ""Heaven and Hell"", the fifth track off Entwistle's first solo record, 1971's Smash Your Head Against the Wall, Portrait of Entwistle is a comprehensive, brooding representation of both the record's spectral, bleeding sleeve-art (check a blurry, vein-addled skull topped with rock-ready devil horns) and the wispy, squinting spirit of Entwistle himself. The Anomoanon is anchored by Ned Oldham, whose walloping, pointy voice is so Oldham it tickles, and he's supported here by an expectedly massive (and mostly familiar) crew: other-brother Paul Oldham, Aram Stith, Jason Stith, Dave Heumann, Jack Carneal, Mike Portera, Tony Bailey, and Willy MacNeal. Opening with Entwistle's ""Heaven and Hell"", a prodding, bottom-heavy rocker as good as anything Townshend ever scripted, the track morbidly wonders, ""Why can't we have eternal life/ And never die?"" Aram Stith's half-muted, perfectly sloppy soloing scribbles throughout, aptly resurrecting the kicky spirit of Entwistle's solo work, and showcasing Anomoanon's penchant for anti-folk noise. Layered over dark, distorted crashes, ""Cherries"" features lyrics snatched from a poem by C.M. Barker, who wrote about fairies for the whimsical depression-babies of the late 1920s. The choice to echo Barker's scented kid-sentiments is hilariously unsurprising for Anomoanon, considering 1999's full-length homage to Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses. ""Two Eyes Wild"" is rollicking country-folk, as infatuated with Neil Young as it is with Entwistle proper, falling out in a coil of wild feedback. And finally, closer ""John Entwistle"" is a long, loping quasi-ballad told from Entwistle's point of view (""I don't do what Peter did/ I don't do what Roger did/ I don't do what Moony did/ I don't do what the others did""), haunted by yawning slide, pointed acoustic plucks, and general Ned-as-Entwistle vocal creepiness-- until the entire band somersaults into a tinny ""I Can See for Miles""-ish crash, and The Who are reborn as clanging Tennessee teenagers. With the bass quivering loud up front.","The glorious Who, with their bursting bass drums and bombastic, volume-defeating live shows, were a band\n\ who churned expressly ...

Two Way Monologue,Sondre Lerche,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdfabf31b7dc7155e0a/1:1/w_160/9496ba92.jpg,2004-02-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4744-two-way-monologue/,Astralwerks,"There was no front: For the first half-minute of ""Don't Be Shallow"", Lerche was missing notes, singing out of key, just a complete mess. The crowd-- late twenty-somethings mostly there to see headliner Nada Surf play that one song they do-- was at a loss, too, caught between rants of insobriety and deep Langley School-ish sympathies: Lerche is young and clearly nervous, and I probably should stop being an asshole and maybe try being kind and supportive. Slowly everything clicked though, and Lerche commanded a degree of vocal control and rubato that rivaled Ted Leo solo performances. And now the crowd was at a complete loss. Lerche's kitschy youth appeal had earned their sympathy, yet now they actually liked what he was playing. ""It might be the most laidback album of lush pop I've ever heard.""
        --Rob Mitchum on Lerche's debut LP, Faces Down It's true, and perhaps Faces Down was unoffensive to a fault. Lerche's songs were a bit, as Mitchum went on to say, ""EZ-indie."" Lerche knows the right buttons to push when he wants to charm us, which is great, but perhaps not as impressive or interesting if we discern the mechanism behind the charm: subconsciously, we are not in awe of Lerche's skill as a songwriter, but simply rejoice in the melodies themselves. Says Lerche himself, half-proud, half-ashamed, ""The tunes on Faces Down poured out of me... beyond my control."" Lerche is, if anything, much more in control on Two Way Monologue. This is not to say the songs are any less natural or charming-- melodies undoubtedly poured out of him, but Lerche has much more of a hand in crafting these melodies into truly sophisticated pop songs. (Keep in mind that he'd written many of the tracks on Faces Down when he was just 16.) Lerche is consistently experimenting with alternate chord voicings and more complex song structures, not to mention broadening the scope of his production ethic. Nevertheless, he refuses to sacrifice the integrity of his melodies. With five more years on him, he's also cut much of the sugary and predictable melodrama, and his lyrical tendencies, with often charming flubbed English phraseology, have matured considerably. As a whole, then, the songs are less immediately gratifying than those on Faces Down, but any demand made by Two Way Monologue betrays the extent to which Lerche has grown as a songwriter. If the listener isn't eventually caught in swoons, at the least he will respect the degree of Lerche's refined artifice. Nick Drake's influence seems to play a larger role here than on Lerche's last LP. After ""Love You"", a baroque recast of Faces Down's ""Things You Call Fate"", Lerche begins ""Track You Down"" in falsetto, accompanied by his own strums, which, for all his solo concert appearances, he has done so rarely on his recordings. Even lyrically, Lerche touches upon Drake's celestial territory: ""Down came the sky/ And all you did was blink,"" and perhaps a more explicit confrontation, ""So why am I writing to the moon?"" The song showcases the latitude of Two Way Monologue's production styles, which spans the delicate voice/guitar balance to the massive swells of straightforward, studio-slick chamber-pop to track stuffing reminiscent of Beck's Midnite Vultures. On other songs, Lerche's struggle with his natural inclinations, and his wish to make his songs more interesting, becomes clearer. The sparsely accompanied ""On the Tower"", ""Days That Are Over"", and ""Counter Spark"" all start with verses as straightforward as those on Faces Down, but find their maturity in some intensely dense and beautiful bridges, rich with alternately voiced chords and swells of strings and background vocals. ""Counter Spark"" itself sports a B-section of ""ba-ba-ba bah-ba"" that subtly pokes fun at Lerche's melody on ""You Know So Well"". Elsewhere, Lerche situates himself in two distinct but equally rich 60s rock ballad traditions. Perhaps in light of all the Smile talk, songs like ""Wet Ground"" recall Beach Boys barbershop harmonies and tongue-in-cheek inflections (e.g. ""alar-Ming, dar-Ling""). Meanwhile, the strings and florid instrumentation of ""It's Over""-- not to mention the restrained balladic tone of Lerche as he hits and holds his highest recorded note in beautiful falsetto-- situate the song in the shadow of Abbey Road-era Beatles. Admittedly, these aren't Lerche's sophistications so much as they are Lerche appropriating the sophistications of his new touchstones. Still, Lerche attempts them and is to a great extent successful in his own right, never appearing a simple mouthpiece of his muses. Lerche's true accomplishment on Two Way Monologue comes with the title track. It's the album's longest, and encapsulates his stage presence, his songwriting ability, the progress he's made since Faces Down, and the wide variety of production he's employed on Two Way Monologue. The track begins nervously as a solo acoustic song, before instruments gradually begin to fill in the empty space until it's stuffed with distinct acoustic and electric guitar lines, baritone saxophone hits, and synth hooks of various vintage and vocode. At this point, Lerche could retire the ""Two Way Monologue"" as just another great pop song; but at about the 3:30 mark, as the song retreats into a quiet outro, an acoustic piano and guitar refuse to halt their vamp, and work up enough energy to explode back into the chorus once more, making for the album's most exciting transition. At once a compliment and a criticism, Two Way Monologue may be too dense for one sitting. It engages in the kind of pop overload that characterized Faces Down, though here, it's the melody as well as Lerche's ideas that overwhelm the listener. Malapropisms forgiven (""When tears are pretzels pouring down each time/ The sweetness is returning/ At times when you appreciate that you survived""-- what?), Lerche's lyrics are flat but never distracting. In the end, though, Two Way Monologue bears witness to the growth of an already talented young songwriter for whom the title ""talented young songwriter"" seems quite inadequate.","There was no front: For the first half-minute of ""Don't Be Shallow"", Lerche was missing notes, singing out of ...

Weekend Warrior,Biz Markie,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44c13d197565213bf0f/1:1/w_160/7c68e2c5.jpg,2004-02-26 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5568-weekend-warrior/,Tommy Boy,"Despite sporting a clunky, off-the-cuff flow, nonsensical rhymes, and a seemingly shapeless physique, Biz Markie has been hip-hop's own loveable mad genius for over two decades now. However, while the Biz's recorded output over the course of the past two years has resulted in little more than two unremarkable singles (""Studda Step,"" ""Turn the Party Out""), and guest spots for nostalgia-happy idealists like the Beastie Boys, it's fair to say that hip-hop listeners across the map have missed him. Unfortunately, Weekend Warrior is not the triumphant, ten-years-in-the-making comeback album fans have been anticipating, though its stripped-down, party-flavored production and Biz's trademark lackadaisical flow make it a respectable extension to the string of albums he cut for the Cold Chillin' label in the 1980s that made him a cult legend. While virtually every article regarding the Diabolical Biz paints him as hip-hop's resident ""underdog,"" it's important to note that he is so by his own consent. It's no coincidence that his most successful and career-defining moment (1989's anti-Hallmark ballad ""Just a Friend"") cast him as an affable, if too average, guy who more likely spent Friday nights alone in front of the television than out in the club. But it's precisely this illusion of stupefying averageness that has made Biz Markie one of hip-hop's most treasured and wholly original emcees. In a genre that often takes itself too seriously (the murders of Scott La Rock, Biggie, 2pac, Big L, etc.) and wildly dualistic stereotypes (Benz or backpack), Biz Markie's easygoing persona seems to exist outside all popular hip-hop caricatures: What other emcee would go topless for their album art or dress up in costumes ranging from a Native American Indian Chief to a Samurai to a Sumo Wrestler? (Note that Har Mar Superstar counts as neither ""hip-hop"" nor ""an emcee"".) Of course, while Biz Markie may be one of hip-hop's most heartfelt and idiosyncratic B-boys, his albums have always proven to be scattershot affairs, serving up both utter brilliance and stupidity in disappointingly equal amounts-- and Weekend Warrior is no different. Predictably, whenever Biz sticks to what he knows best (namely: reminiscing about rap, reminiscing about hotties, and reminiscing about Chinese food), the material lands on that more ""brilliant"" end of the spectrum. For instance, Mark the 45 King laces the show-stealing ""Turn Back the Hands of Time"" with syrupy piano chords and looping string swells (a la The Blueprint), while Biz smoothly brings the listener back to a time when he was ""the size of Jay-Z,"" and ""Ra was still with Eric B."" The minimalist party vibe of ""Tear Shit Up"" (featuring cuts from fellow old-schooler Jazzy Jeff) and ""Do Your Things"" (featuring an ambiguous cameo from P. Diddy) work equally well, and each no doubt will leave listeners longing for the pre-Jakob the Jeweler days, when all you needed to look fly was a gold chain. On ""Chinese Food"", over typically Ritalin-deprived J-Zone production, Biz re-writes the Black Rob hit ""Whoa"", transforming it into an ode to his favorite take-out food. After hearing Biz's proud mantra on this song's hook (""Four chicken wings with chicken fried rice, that's good/ Beef and broccoli with a little white rice, that's good!""), citing Biz for not being as virtuosic an emcee as, say Big Daddy Kane, would seem to verge on laughable. The most surprising aspect of Weekend Warrior, though, is that amongst the album's glut of shameless stabs at radio-play and outdated would-be party anthems, there remains one incredibly solid streamlined record. Still, since tracks as inspired as the butter-smooth, Kev Brown-produced ""Get Down"" are made to rub shoulders with sterile, Nelly-miming pap like ""EI YA"", Weekend Warrior can prove an incredibly frustrating listen. Biz has never sounded so ridiculous (in a bad way) as he does rhyming on a synth-heavy dancehall track trading lines with the likes of Dancehall phenom, Elephant Man-- it's so bad, it's of little surprise that the track serves as the album's first ""single."" But in the end, Biz Markie's jester-like presence overshadows his creative shortcomings; he is one of hip-hop's greatest auteurs, even if he only has one true classic to show for it.","Despite sporting a clunky, off-the-cuff flow, nonsensical rhymes, and a seemingly shapeless physique, Biz Markie has been hip-hop's own ...

I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness EP,I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b999ea9e61561daa7012/1:1/w_160/50304c20.jpg,2004-02-25 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4150-i-love-you-but-ive-chosen-darkness-ep/,Emperor Jones,"...And you will know them by their long, purposefully unwieldy moniker. Or perhaps you will know them because Spoon's Britt Daniel produced their debut EP. Either way, the five guys who constitute Austin's I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness (including a couple past members of Windsor for the Derby and Paul Newman) are obviously adept at cultivating attention-- and it turns out that they actually merit some, too, if this five-song starter kit is any indication. Daniel may be the big name on this marquee, but his presence is basically incidental, as he does his best to naturally capture the band doing their thing; reverb is about the most drastic addition he makes. Initially, listening to the band just do their thing without any attendant bells and whistles threatens overwhelming boredom-- they've strangely sequenced the absolute least engaging song at the beginning the EP. ""We're Still the Weaker Sex"" isn't a bad song, per se, but if Nelson had opened with a bow shot like this he probably would have lost at Trafalgar. The vocals are buried under clean, start/stop electric guitars, and though the music builds nicely as the drums pick up on the guitar rhythms and the band slides into a slippery faux-jazz groove, the melody never really builds with it, and the song fails to stick as a result, though the acceleration for the spiraling guitar outro is pretty exhilarating. Thankfully, it's nothing but broadsides of tightly constructed, Factory-brand indie rock, and soon enough, your battleship is sunk by the slow build and nagging guitars of ""The Less You See"", a Slint-lite swoon that climaxes with an airy bridge instead of a blistering pileup. The band hold their aces for the last two spots on the disc, though, unloading with the spiky disco stomp of ""When You Go Out"" on track four and proving why we should be paying attention. The detached, everyman harmonies sink into the band's best melody while the guitars scour the stratosphere with insistently droning lines that seem to ricochet off the open hi-hats. Closer ""Your Worst Is the Best"" drives home the fact that the band are at their best and most memorable when the vocals are performed in tandem, and the chiming guitars and electric piano of the first few verses create a crystalline, womb-like effect. The song dissipates into a keyboard ether, leaving behind thoughts of Big Things to come for the quintet. I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness already have the sound of a pink and grey counterpart to Interpol's red and black, and the Spoon connection feels logical, given the band's penchant for pop with a bite and a new wave edge. If they can deliver on their promise, we'll soon know them for a lot more than their name.","...And you will know them by their long, purposefully unwieldy moniker.

Once a four-piece, then a duo, the band's current lineup consists of original vocalist/guitarist Adam Miller, new bassist/vocalist Nat Sahlstrom, and Ron Avila of Get Hustle and Holy Molar as the temporary, very capable drummer. The trio's monological chiseling awakens subtleties that went missing from the more obviously engineered post-punk tropes on last year's Chrome Rats Vs. Basement Rutz, showcasing an insistent, wonderfully slovenly atmosphere, daredevil percussion, and a keen melodic sensibility. Of course, their arty dirge and pseudo dub has a ton of precursors. For starters, the shrapnel convolutions bring to mind The Grifters' So Happy Together (especially the silt-heavy bass) and the programmed moments taste like dingy, damaged Suicide. Likewise, the slow-motion urgency and overall compositional looseness is similar (enough) to Pussy Galore's asphyxiated garage door shouts (sans Einstürzende Neubauten foundation) and the grubby warp-speed of Royal Trux's Twin Infinitives. Plaster Hounds isn't as off-the-map as these ""classics"", but it's fun, nonetheless, because it moves interestingly, and within entropy, it locates nice flourishes like high-speed electro drums over gloomy distorted bass, pitter-pat junkyard crunk dodging phased and/or slinky guitar and basslines, and wiry shakers darting beneath ringing guitar. Certain songs feel like ciphers or pretty exercises in reoccurrence; others centered around these same tight repetitions burst into jagged melody: ""Chalk Dust (Holy Water)"" is Mark E. Smith sludgecore, ""Monarch"" lactates Arthur Doyle dub, and the pulsations and guitar announcements of ""Ice Hatchets"" nod at Sun City Girls' Torch of the Mystics interlocutions and Pussy Galore's ""Revolution Summer"". Just as often, the niceties occur on a verbal level: The strut of ""Surrogate"" has a trill hidden in its somber that can't help but remind me of Bee Thousand, and ""Garden""'s steady bass circled by angry guitars, makes a nice link to the last record, Dhalgren-style: ""In the garden I licked a chrome rat/ A shiny tailbone/ And a poached beak/ Amidst the debris/ I almost tripped on a prodigious mime/ Acting gestures to/ The prince of the palace/ Of divinity."" Really, though, I'm mostly glad Gang of Four are losing grip on the minds of our musical youths. And I'm even happier that Chromatics, along with Liars, have finally discovered the Silver Apples. Plaster Hounds even includes a nicely turned, unassuming cover of 1968's ""Program"". Though it lacks the wonderfully manic intro sample and continual weaving of second-level Books-styled radio noise, thanks to Avila, the percussive spirit of Simeon and Taylor remains. Whatever its precursors and wherever it's going, Plaster Hounds spouts muffled, often miffed rock 'n' roll with fine collagist tendencies, bringing to mind a musty the Lower East Side squat with some kid pissing on my shoe. Surpassing standard faux-broke-ass hep, this is a comfortingly collapsible record that manages more often than not to locate the correct note, feel, or rhythmic variation. And at long last, in the year 2004, Seattle plays host to a compelling new form of grunge.","On their second full-length, Seattle's Chromatics pare things down considerably.

The Best of Del tha Funkee Homosapien: The Elektra Years: B-Boy Handbook,Del Tha Funkee Homosapien,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb67c0084474cd0c2850/1:1/w_160/f4649799.gif,2004-02-25 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2541-the-best-of-del-tha-funkee-homosapien-the-elektra-years-b-boy-handbook/,Rhino,"Beginning his career in his cousin Ice Cube's group Da Lynch Mob, Del tha Funkee Homosapien has spent his career reinventing himself. Starting out as a militant slacker on his debut, he soon shifted to such personas as Slayer of Wack Emcees, Horrible Beatmaking Weirdo, Rappin' Nerd, and most recently, Absent Indie Rap Luminary. With such a storied history, you'd expect a greatest hits collection to actually include his greatest hits. When the fine print is read, though, something quickly becomes evident: He only released two albums on Elektra, neither of them being perfect. I Wish My Brother George Was Here and No Need for Alarm were far from bad records, but they were clearly two sides of a coin. The former fell short because failed to show his true personality and displayed too many of his younger and more ignorant opinions (""Dark skinned girls are better than light skinned""), though the latter succeeded on focusing on his rhyme skills and vocal quirks. This collection, unfortunately, focuses on B-sides and remixes, making it more of a completist's release than a greatest hits collection. Some are good (""Burnt"", ""Wrongplace (Casual Remix)""), some are bad (the ridiculously corny Judgment Night soundtrack amalgam with Dinosaur Jr. ""Missing Link""), but the realization that the only great album tracks from his early days are ""Mistadobalina"", ""Dr. Bombay"", ""Wack MC's"" and ""Catch a Bad One"" is disheartening. This being an Elektra-only hits collection means that his best work from Deltron 3030, the obscure Japanese import masterpiece Future Development, and even Both Sides of the Brain go unrepresented. Given this, the exclusion of Elektra tracks like ""The Wacky World of Rapid Transit"", ""Boo Boo Heads"" and ""No Need for Alarm"" is inexcusable. The biggest win on this piece is doubtlessly ""Eye Examination"", one of Del's all-time best performances. Rocking over a chugging guitar and drum tradeoff, a psychedelic backdrop falls around Del, who details his mentality and lifestyle choices better than anywhere else in his catalog: ""I never had real friends 'til now/ I never had to steal ends 'cause that's foul/ I walk the streets with the baseball bat, feelin' secure/ But I try not to incite fights, that's immature."" It's one of my favorite B-sides of all-time, and helps save this compilation from total irrelevance. What this label-sanctioned, contract-fulfilling release proves is that Del came into his own near the middle of his career (Third Eye Vision, Future Development, Deltron 3030). Still, without the powerful straight-rap from the majority of No Need for Alarm, this Elektra-only greatest hits package fails on its own concept.","Beginning his career in his cousin Ice Cube's group Da Lynch Mob, Del tha Funkee Homosapien has spent his ...

Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers,Manic Street Preachers,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38dc0084474cd0c34c4/1:1/w_160/7228c820.jpg,2004-02-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5073-lipstick-traces-a-secret-history-of-manic-street-preachers/,Sony,"In all of rock's varied and storied history, I can't think of another band that yearned harder and more desperately to be Important than the Manic Street Preachers. You can tell from every album they ever released, every photo they ever posed for, every line of lyrics they ever penned, that these guys wanted to change the lives and minds of millions and enter into rock's history books as nothing short of legends. From day one, they wore their politics (indeterminate though they sometimes were) on their sleeves and spoke only in Statements-- they're the kind of band who almost certainly come up with the titles for their songs before the songs are written (""If You Tolerate This, Your Children Will Be Next"", anyone?), driven by ideas and philosophical concepts more than raw inspiration or restless creativity. The band has managed to squeeze six albums out of that approach, which in itself tells you something. Back when they were just four unknowns in heavy eye shadow and feather boas with slogans scrawled on their clothes, they famously had the audacity (or was it marketing savvy?) to proclaim that they would make the greatest rock album ever and then split-- neither of which panned out, of course. Their debut, Generation Terrorists, walked a weird line between agit-punk, cock rock, romantic melodicism and glam, and was so obviously patterned after The Clash's London Calling that it was actually kind of cute. They did add a chapter to rock folklore, however, after releasing their best record (1994's tormented The Holy Bible), when lyricist Richey Edwards-- suffering from anorexia, alcoholism and a pattern of self-abuse that culminated in him carving ""4REAL"" in his arm with a razor blade during an interview with Steve Lamacq as a manner of addressing critics who doubted the band's conviction-- disappeared, never to be seen again. Their three albums since his disappearance have been no less grand in purpose and certainly no less serious, though they've made more concessions to pop as the years have progressed. Now, after a decade and a half of making some of the most stridently earnest music you can spend money on, Manic Street Preachers have released Lipstick Traces: A Secret History, which compiles 20 B-sides. The album not only references critic Greil Marcus in its title, but also quotes him on the inner sleeve: ""What appealed to me most were its gaps and those moments when the story that has lost its voice somehow recovers it."" That's a pretty damn pretentious mission statement for an odds 'n' sods collection, but if you've followed the band for any appreciable amount of time, you've come to expect this kind of grandiose contextualizing by now. Though one might be tempted to think that, like most bands, the B-side is where the Manics stretch out and try new things-- maybe even lighten up for a joke or two-- this turns out not to be the case. Unlike a fair portion of their UK comrades in the 1990s (Blur and Suede come to mind), the band didn't relegate many of their best moments to second-class status on their singles, so what you've essentially got here is leftovers-- songs that didn't make the albums, but that still reach for nothing less than changing the world. Just check out titles like ""Prologue to History"", ""Socialist Serenade"", ""Democracy Coma"", or ""We Her Majesty's Prisoners"", and you'll get the basic idea. ""Prologue to History"" is one of the band's better flips, a propulsive slice of piano punk that showcases the band's talents, and Sean Moore's unbelievable and underappreciated drumming, in particular. There are a couple of surprises hiding in the sprawling nonchronological tracklist, such as the surprisingly strong Bacharach pastiche ""Horses Under Starlight"", replete with gooey euphonium, cornet and big ""bah-bah"" harmonies, and the understated, synth-coated ""Dead Trees and Traffic Islands"", a song that could have fit snugly on 1996's excellent Everything Must Go, the band's first post-Edwards album. Guitarist/vocalist James Dean Bradfield (his real given name, by the way) is given a little more room to solo than usual on ""Valley Boy"" and proves he can tear it up with the best of them. His vocals have always been one of the band's greatest assets, too-- not many people could spin such strongly melodic material out of lyrics about debt reduction and stuffed with lines like, ""Ceremonial rape machine/ Life won't corrupt you,"" as he does on ""We Her Majesty's Prisoners"". Early pressings of Lipstick Traces also come with a disc of covers the band have performed at various points in their career, something that really ought to be more interesting than it is. The problem here, really, is that they just take it all too seriously. Their version of Chuck Berry's ""Rock and Roll Music"" is so comically earnest it kills the song's inherent energy, and their take on Camper Van Beethoven's ""Take the Skinheads Bowling"" doesn't fare much better. One of the few songs they really try to interpret and make their own, Nirvana's ""Been a Son"", is recast on acoustic slide guitar and winds up sounding totally flat, especially compared to the original. The group does score a minor coup with a shimmering acoustic cover of Wham!'s ""Last Christmas"", though, and their ultra-faithful live run through The Clash's ""Train in Vain"" borders on charismatic, but this disc is strictly for the fans who've tattooed ""4REAL"" on their forearms and kept Karl Marx quotations pinned to their concert tees. And that may very well go for the entire compilation. It's hard to see anyone who doesn't already own all six of the band's LPs getting any kind of long-term enjoyment from this set, but those who do will find it engaging, even if nothing on it comes close to ""A Design for Life"" or ""Mausoleum"". As retrospectives go, Lipstick Traces is reasonably comprehensive (it seems pretty unlikely anyone will be crying over the fact that, say, ""Montana/Autumn/78"" isn't included), though it might have been nice to see the band's debut EP, New Art Riot, and non-album A-sides ""Motown Junk"" and ""The Masses Against the Classes"" compiled in one place for posterity. Manic Street Preachers never conquered the world like they wanted to, but it's been a good enough ride that I don't begrudge them for trying, and this compilation, flawed though it is, is sure to please those who'd always hoped they would succeed.","In all of rock's varied and storied history, I can't think of another band that yearned harder and ...

List of Lights and Buoys,Susanna and the Magical Orchestra,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a653ea9e61561daa533e/1:1/w_160/31eb54b2.jpg,2004-02-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7734-list-of-lights-and-buoys/,Rune Grammofon,"I know nothing about this woman. I'm sitting still, listening for meaning in every nuance of her voice. It's reminiscent of sitting by a woman on the subway and making up a life together without even meeting her eye. For five stops, I haven't even turned the page of my book for fear of disturbing us. I'm trying to find a way to set my hand next to hers, or even just to hear her breathe. Susanna Wallumrød doesn't grab you immediately: Her voice is attractive, but it's cool and pure. She sings in English, but her Norwegian accent hints reedlike through the edges, and so do the feelings she evokes, as subtle as a catch her voice. Her sound here spans from the whimsical and dreamy, to torch songs-- like her pleas to a rival on Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"", or the cool lust of ""Sweet Devil""-- but her tone makes her intentions inscrutable, and even a sad whisper won't tell you what she's really thinking. Wallumrød is backed by keyboardist Morten Qvenild, who's as careful with the mood as a waiter with a trayful of crystal. Rune Grammofon is increasingly home to artists who have mastered small strokes, which suits Qvenild: While the electronic spritzes and near-beats on ""Friend"" or ""Sweet Devil"" recall Björk's work with Matmos, the keyboard line on ""Baby"" is pared to the bone, and the spaces between the words start to sound like a void. The ""magical"" side of the orchestra comes out in a few flashes of color, like the sudden eruption on Leonard Bernstein's ""Who Am I"". But Qvenild always stops short of exuberance, and in the tight ambience, he remains an orchestra-in-a-suitcase. It's easy to wonder what Wallumrød could do over bigger or more varied arrangements. But they made the trade-off to get that intimacy, which draws you in so close that it should be uncomfortable. On a record this moody, the ambience can carry too much of the weight. This is a gripping record but not a great one: A few of Wallumrød's originals could have been replaced with covers. But they've written at least one flawless ballad, titled ""Believer"". When this appeared on recent compilations, the naked melody and pure voice sounded almost quizzically bare. But when embedded at the center of this album, it's a staggering anti-anthem, as Wallumrød justifies a break-up with a single line: ""You are a believer, I am not."" And there isn't one extra syllable to ease the blow.","I know nothing about this woman. I'm sitting still, listening for meaning in every nuance of her voice.\n ...

They Were Wrong So We Drowned,Liars,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf313d197565213b42c/1:1/w_160/77940eca.jpg,2004-02-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4765-they-were-wrong-so-we-drowned/,Mute,"Sadistic is the only way to describe it-- a conscious effort toward slapping away all the little hands clamoring for more of They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top's antagonistic punk-funk. After winning enough early praise to make most lesser bands blush and acquiesce to the demands of a fanbase craving more of the same, Liars hinted that they were not in the business of catering to expectations. You want the battery (acid)-powered post-punk that drove all the Williamsburg hipsters wild in 2001? You want the brittle aggression of their debut? Well, you'll get wind-up toy funeral dirges and oblique, numbing sound collages, and you'll like it! ...Or leave it. It seems Liars don't much care either way. Liars know why their debut won them instant acclaim. It's no accident that They Were Wrong So We Drowned bears so little resemblance to their debut. Circumstance plays a part-- the old want-ad rhythm section hightailed it prior to recording, leaving longtime associate Julian Gross to take over on drums-- but more importantly, to Liars, they've beaten dance-punk at its own game and are ready to move on. So maybe masochism is a better way to describe what's going on here-- what else could cause a band to willfully alienate their supporters? Independent music isn't exactly the easiest racket in town, after all, even if you're blessed with almost instant celebrity (relatively speaking). But to walk away from your clearest, most accessible shot at success, to dare any fairweather trend-riders to keep listening after the wave has crested-- well, you have to be more than ready for a backlash; you need to want to savor it. If I'm treating a lukewarm reception for this album among Liars fans as a foregone conclusion, forgive me; the fact is, We Were Wrong is such an entirely different creature than They Threw Us All in a Trench that I envision widespread strife caused by its polarizing force, street-team members fighting turf wars, brother against brother. I envision the faithful losing faith, while simultaneously, former detractors, uh, tracting by the dozens in response to such a reversal. Older tracks like ""Everyday Is a Child with Teeth"" only hint at the screeching atonality, or the formlessness, of ""If You're a Wizard, Then Why Do You Wear Glasses"", or the overwhelming boredom of ""Read the Book That Wrote Itself"". These tracks aren't so much unwelcome as they are completely, utterly baffling in context. Nothing Liars have done in the past will provide listeners with an adequate transition to these anti-songs. For better or worse, though, nebulous, arrhythmic atmospherics comprise a significant portion of the album. When Liars remove the formal structure of songs and descend into carnival experimentalism, they do so not with the precision of intent, but with a punk vibe-- the sound of people attacking instruments with a desire to play that far outstrips any overt talent. Though the band has challenged listeners with this album, their intent doesn't seem as much like a desire to overtly alienate their audience as to embrace their artistic freedom. Contrary to what some have claimed, They Were Wrong is listenable, and intentionally so: the band frequently finds ways to successfully straddle the fence between form and noise (""They Don't Want Your Corn They Want Your Kids"", and the brain-stealing chant of ""Broken Witch"", among others), though most of the time, it's admittedly impenetrable and alienating. I'll be honest: I count myself among those turned off by the shift of focus. But isn't Liars' obvious intention not to pander to their fans' expectations-- even when it results in abrasive, half-formed lab disasters-- deserving of respect? Even laudable? They can be commended, to a degree, but ""there's no talent to obscurity"" as your old pal Chris Ott once said; when it comes to music, it's not hard to not be popular. A lot of this experimentation is simply in the name of narrative-- a rumination on the nature of witchcraft and the sordid politics surrounding the Salem witch trials-- which makes the decision to show preference to such intensely esoteric structures even more questionable. Although a little S&M; makes a good backdrop for the twisted subject matter of black magick and bedevilment, etc., Angus Andrews' vocals and lyrics are, as a constant, a complete non-factor. As such, the ""concept"" isn't any more apparent than the songwriting, conveying more in mood and implication than any substance. So as it stands, Liars mostly abandon their jittery dance blasts to highly mixed effect, to tell a tale that just gets lost in their deep, dark woods. But they don't even totally see that through-- the album is undercut, so to speak, by two songs capable of going toe-to-toe with anything Liars have done to date. ""We Fenced Other Houses with the Bones of Our Own"" is nothing but nervous electronics and the steady, dooming pulse of a bass drum counting down the moments until ""kingdom come"" amidst a steady chant that echoes the numbing opening verse of ""Grown Men Don't Just Fall in the River, Just Like That"", before sliding cleanly into ""They Don't Want Your Corn"". It only paves the way for the eventual, epic assault of ""Hold Hands and It Will Happen Anyway""; as the denouement to this story arc, the ritual concludes, the Earth splits, cracks, and erupts with hellfire and the rotten scent of sulfur as, for one brief moment, Liars summon up some of the (immensely entertaining) demons that infested their first album. The remarkable cacophony is fantastic as a stand-alone song, and does its part to bolster the minor sense of story, but only weakens the album as a whole by confronting its flaws head-on. In the end, the flash-in-the-pan excellence of that track sums up They Were Wrong perfectly: An entire album of exposition is not justified by one moment of revelation, but if nothing else, I can respect their intentions.","Sadistic is the only way to describe it-- a conscious effort toward slapping away all the little hands clamoring for ...

"Volcano, I'm Still Excited!!","Volcano, I'm Still Excited!!",by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a991b1335d7bf16994f4/1:1/w_160/253d7652.jpg,2004-02-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8523-volcano-im-still-excited/,Polyvinyl,"Every Tuesday, the music business doles out armies of debut albums doomed to spend an eternity collecting dust in record store used bins. The truth is not that most of these lonely relics of rock and roll were arbiters of cultural shame, so awful that no one could possibly want to listen to them, but that they simply ride the middle ground between abysmal and worthwhile so well that their existence is simply not worth noting. Following in this infamous line of harmless stereo-friendly pap comes Mark Duplass' stab at 80s nostalgia (as channeled through the influence of Spoon, Elvis Costello, and The Get-Up Kids) with his band's self-titled debut as Volcano, I'm Still Excited!! Reportedly named for the Tom Hanks driven cult flop, Joe Versus the Volcano, Mark Duplass started VISE!! after he was diagnosed with severe tendonitis in both of his arms, forcing him to trade in his years of guitar playing and take up the organ. However, while the circumstances of his band's fruition prove to be somewhat out of the ordinary, the music on this self-titled debut is anything but unpredictable. Despite that Volcano's idiosyncratic line-up is constituted by a Casio organ, a guitar, and a double bass drum, and that Duplass had been enrolled in music composition classes around the time of forming the band, the album sounds remarkably trapped in the conventionally adolescent and nostalgic-obsessed garments of emo. In fact, for all intents and purposes, Volcano sound like a less estrogen-infused version of Polyvinyl's other organ-centric outfit, Mates of State. The album's opener ""2nd Gun"" bounces along on a bed of cheap Moog chords and telecaster sheen, while Duplass drawls out painfully clumsy lines like, ""I miss you, Kate, and that shit hurts."" A line like this should be delivered with a wry bitterness, or a quick wit, not dripping with so much Hallmark heartache and banality that it could carry a scene from The O.C. ""2nd Gun"", however, is a mild offender compared with the high school stalker ode ""New Brad"", which features the album's most prosaic lyrics in lines like, ""I'm standing in your driveway but you're not home yet/ I've been waiting here since last night.../ Your window wasn't open like you promised. However, many a great song has featured utterly imbecilic lyrics, and Volcano are more than capable of kicking out some prime cheese when it counts. Both ""In Green"" and ""Fisticuffs"", while completely inane, showcase memorable enough anthem-lite melodies; although having these songs frustratingly stuck in your head is as close as recorded sound gets to the baffling power that The Real World/Road Rules Challenge has over my Tivo. The real problem with Volcano, though, is not only the fact that they aren't really doing anything inventive with their music, but that the music itself is utterly forgettable. There's not a single moment of genuine un-sentimental or mature emotion (or at least a scenario that hasn't previously appeared in a John Hughes film), and the glut of sixteen tracks seem to pass by in a glaze-eyed hum of 80s nostalgia of Casio watches, Delorians and aerobics. Of course, for a band that seems so obsessed with the trappings of adolescence in the Reagan era, what could be a more fitting place for nostalgia than the used bin?","Every Tuesday, the music business doles out armies of debut albums doomed to spend an eternity collecting dust in record ...

You Are Here,+/-,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2059d034d5c69bf2aca/1:1/w_160/28f4eb30.jpg,2004-02-23 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6356-you-are-here/,Teenbeat,"Weaving inoffensive melodies into odd time signatures and jagged rhythms is not an effortless task. Few bands even attempt it, and those who do are mostly found in hardcore and prog-rock, which is all but predicated on senseless scale masturbation. One of the very few bands in the past decade who built a successful discography on this formula is The Dismemberment Plan, who had a lot more going for them than just their rhythmic chicanery. +/- are indie's current masters of meter, and may one day inherit the Plan's crown as champions of the pop periphery, if only they sandpaper their edges and stick to their guns. On 2002's Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut, +/- employed glitchy samples, then common only in IDM, and electro-pop. They were, in fact, progenitors of the sound that would, for better or worse, come to be termed ""lap-pop."" James Baluyut's lullaby vocals and an array of dreamy synth pads helped smooth the stuttering a bit, but the sound was unquestionably loop-driven. At times, their compositions were so choppy and repetitive that they sounded as if they were woven together by a Garage Band maestro, yet always retained human character. The band also understood that, in some situations, the pale, robotic sound of a drum machine better accompanies a song than a less exacting, more colorful human performance. Chris Deaner gladly took a backseat throughout most of Self-Titled, only to emerge at the most opportune moments. You Are Here is a much more ambitious effort than its precursor. It's evident that +/- are attempting to branch out stylistically while simultaneously condensing their sound. The results, however, aren't always fruitful, as the band's incessant genre-hopping frequently sounds stilted. Only on ""She's Got Your Eyes"", a tasteful odd-time samba, do they master a niche experiment. Deaner's agile drumming offers a nice counterpoint to the one-bar guitar loop upon which the song is structured, while Baluyut delivers the line, ""I've got ways to make you pay,"" more benevolently than would seem appropriate for a song about a man abandoning his pregnant girlfriend. When the band relaxes into a wider, 4/4 time channel, they often succumb to prosaism. ""Summer Dress 1"" is a blithely strummed ditty that sounds as if it was torn straight from Chris Carraba's How to Be a Sissy Bitch Handbook, while ""Trapped Under Ice Floes (Redux)"" dangles not far from emo mediocrity. But fortunately, a more mature set of influences shines through on You Are Here's best numbers. On the sinuous opening track ""Ventriloquist"", Baluyut evokes Michael Stipe's nasal crooning when he sings, ""I'm riding in a car/ Please don't take this exit/ And please don't drop me just yet."" Other songs recall Joy Division and Depeche Mode, as Baluyut's brittle voice tiptoes to center stage with only a spare backing of guitars and drum loops. ""Surprise"", another standout, is a nocturnal rumination that would feel right at home among The The's standard fare. If anything holds You Are Here back from realizing the promise hinted at on +/-'s debut, it's the band's relentless modesty. While I can think of a hundred bands for whom it would be a welcome attribute, +/- are often frustratingly retiring, suppressing their prodigious rhythmic and melodic talents in favor of something more straightforward. Many of the songs here aspire to almost radio-friendly levels of accessibility and shamelessly exhaust easy pop cliches. Still, a few tracks manage to recapture the pop bliss the band achieved by doing it their way on Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut. If only for the endless promise of that record is You Are Here somewhat of a letdown, like untold albums from bands who choose to loiter on the cusp of something bigger and can't quite make that breakthrough step to greatness.","Weaving inoffensive melodies into odd time signatures and jagged rhythms is not an effortless task.

Circles,The Autumn Defense,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15aea9e61561daa479d/1:1/w_160/3cb18d47.jpg,2004-02-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/378-circles/,Arena Rock,"American record racks will always be peppered with competent and gratingly mature albums by artists with easy grins and nice cheekbones: see the benign-but-pleasant cooing of James Taylor, David Gray, and Joseph Arthur, or check the sudden and fantastic popularity of neo-powerhouse/Blue Note savior Norah Jones. What's most perplexing about these artists is not necessarily the relative blankness of their drowsy, silk-soft pop/rock/jazz-- it's the constant, undying ubiquity of it. Keith Harris, writing in the Seattle Weekly last week, pointed out how, in 2002, Norah Jones provided an improbable (but obviously valuable) antidote to the bizarre flamboyance of American entertainment-- that her appeal is inextricably linked to the casual tedium of her work. So is there a valid role in contemporary America for dozy-but-decent background music? The Autumn Defense openly suggests that, yes, congenial sincerity and sharp, glowing guitars are perfectly sufficient, more than enough to keep everybody warm and distracted. And in a way, they're completely right. John Stirratt has played bass for Wilco since the band's inception in 1994, and anybody who caught even a few key scenes of I Am Trying to Break Your Heart gets that, by now, Stirratt might require an independent (read: non-Jeff Tweedy supervised) side project to release his personal artistic steam. The Autumn Defense has provided Stirratt that opportunity for the last three years, allowing him to pair with multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone and to crank out some docile, glowing country-folk. Circles, the band's second full-length, boasts a few familiar guests-- Tweedy makes an appearance, adding subtle guitar figures to ""Why I'm Like This"", and Andrew Bird scrapes his violin on ""The Answer""-- and Stirratt and Sansone have been joined by new bandmates Brad Jones (bass, organ) and Greg Wiz (drums, percussion). Still, The Autumn Defense's plumped-up roster hasn't necessarily bred a thicker sound: Most of Circles is spare, golden and peaceable. Unsurprisingly, the record was recorded during a long, mulish Nashville winter, and Circles aptly reflects an immediate and careful self-insulation, with each warm, wispy strand of sentimental folk coiling and fading like steam from a teacup. Softer and less psych-heavy than its predecessor, 2001's The Green Hour, Circles is a slow, loving tribute to early 70s songwriters, swinging from Gene Clark-ish country to Big Star pop, keeping the scene as pretty and as polished as possible. The only problem is that it's difficult to tell exactly when Circles stops sounding like clean, earnest alt-country and starts to sound an awful lot like Air Supply. On occasion, the record even goes so far as to echo, in spirit, the syrupy promises and honeyed whispers of The Carpenters (see the ""I would die/ If I thought anyone would hurt you/ Yes, and I would cry/ To think anyone could do something like that"" of the near-unbearable ""Written in the Snow""). Stirratt's vocals are high and sweet, sprinkled with just enough salt to blend easily into his band's cymbal-tapping and gentle strumming, and very few of these songs attempt to wiggle out of their self-imposed restraints, settling, instead, into deep, satisfying lulls. Subsequently, listening to Circles is not entirely dissimilar to falling asleep in front of a fireplace, feet half-dangling out from under an orange afghan, a partially eaten oatmeal cookie resting on a napkin: The entire scene seethes with warm, quiet comfort, and your eyelids have no choice but to get progressively heavier, inching together until you can't quite see straight. Sleep seems imminent. And then you realize that it's actually only 6:00 PM.","American record racks will always be peppered with competent and gratingly mature albums by artists with easy grins and nice ...

Delìrivm Cordìa,Fantômas,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4a5e6ef95969323019/1:1/w_160/5b35d5e9.gif,2004-02-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2989-delirivm-cordia/,Ipecac,"What if Fantômas held a horror movie and nobody came? More appropriately, what if they held a horror movie lasting about an hour too long and people started walking out in the middle? Or, what if the movie itself was okay but the end credits took up a quarter of the entire running time and didn't actually tell us anything about what just happened? What, then, would reasonable ticket buyers do, especially had they just been held as a captive audience to creepy midnight autopsies and ""surgical sound specimens from the museum of skin?"" Oh, and there's no intermission. In fact, there are no scenes, rather one long, painful odyssey into the world of demented surgeons, graveyard theft and flatliner dynamics. Del\xECrivm Cord\xECa, Fantômas' third album of gothic, carnival goon horror-metal, suffers at the hands of its own density and impenetrable ambience. Chiefly, I'm beginning to think Mike Patton (like John Zorn) is convinced that his version of ""atmosphere"" is a lot more gripping than it really is. His band's latest opus into would-be horror soundtracks might well sound perfect if stretched under a low-budget, high-gore Mark Borchardt film detailing the various indecencies of highly unnecessary anatomical experimentation, but on its own tends to drag. And I'm not just talking about the final 20 minutes of vinyl end-groove, but a sense throughout that, despite an impressive mixture of black textures and depresso-sludge, all these scary moments should add up to more than tedious noir-moods and the occasional flash of visceral thrill. The album is comprised of but one track and will invariably work its most magic when you can afford to listen, uninterrupted, alone in a dark and stormy place (or as the background score for Silent Hill). It begins with a vinyl crackle and the soft ping of a distant music box. And suddenly-- Patton coos and guitar and drums bash something awful! Gasp! Then, as the music box returns and Patton once again uses his breathy falsetto to summon girly demons from the dank beyond, a Benedictine choir enters with a morose serenade. A ghastly wind comes from the east and overtakes their moan before... a shriek! All hell breaks loose for a few seconds, and afterwards only a church organ remains to (dis)comfort you. After a brief voluntary, the whole band enters on what sounds like a Morricone death march, as Patton doubles a melody with twang guitar and mandolin, accompanied by a jittery tambourine. This section leads to the most interesting on the CD, as handclaps, percussion and Patton's ever-changing vocals perform something like a voodoo ritual, akin to Zorn's ""Sex Magick"" from IAO. Furthermore, Dave Lombardo's furious snare pounding lends a much needed intensity. So while Del\xECrivm Cord\xECa is filled with great blocks of sound, it too often loses sight of direction. Were there images to accompany the music, perhaps its pacing might not seem quite so turgid. The eerily gorgeous, piano-led melody about ten minutes in is vastly overwhelmed by the girth of sound around it, and is long forgotten by the time I make it all the way through the record. Other moments, like the nifty hi-hat and pitter-patter vocals a half hour into the album, could have been excellent songs unto themselves were they fleshed out a little. Del\xECrivm Cord\xECa might have been given extra life were the individual sections indexed, and I could go back to the coolest moments, or program a Fantômas-redux album all my own. Since the band favor long stretches of minimal activity interrupted by jarring, metallic transitions, it's hard to consider this a very good ""ambient"" record. Nor is it an interesting soundtrack, without much in the way of ""story"" other than the admittedly impressive artwork in the CD insert. There are more than enough ideas here for a truly scary record, but as it stands, Del\xECrivm Cord\xECa works best as particularly damaged, gloomy background music, and little else.","What if Fant\xF4mas held a horror movie and nobody came?

Messy Century,Mountaineers,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44bea9e61561daa80fe/1:1/w_160/6c62dc6e.jpg,2004-02-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5567-messy-century/,Mute,"At least for the time being, psych-folk trio Mountaineers aren't going to shake the Flaming Lips comparisons, or the Beta Band ones, or, in some painful instances, the Counting Crows ones. The Wales-now-Liverpool-based band should be flattered, though: Their debut long-player, Messy Century, for all its thinly veiled similarities to these bands (Mountaineers' disguise is often no more than bedroom synthesizer manipulations or some lo-fi laptop haze), also often approaches some of their better influences' levels of songwriting sophistication. With the exception of opening track ""Ripen"", which swaggers in all self-satisfied but with nothing notable to justify the smirk, pretty much every song on Messy Century has one or two inventive moments before Mountaineers take skewed recourse to tried indie-psych formulas. ""Sewing"" employs a smart cut-up acoustic guitar stutter before launching into vocoded Adam Duritz melodrama. The wildly interesting syncopated drum and bass backbeat (though not drum-n-bass) of ""Want to Write You"", in union with lead singer Tomas Kelar's poignant downspun melody, is complete bliss until one catches wind of the teenage lyricism and the sweep of a painfully emotive chorus. The first half of ""I Gotta Sing"" is irresistible-- Kelar spins a melody inverse to the one of ""Want to Write You"", but equally catchy, atop a simple choked acoustic strum, warm strings, and a tasteful dose of blips and whiffs, before the drums enter and obliterate the song's charming internal pulse. The moments that stick out all seem to partake in some subtle, non-disruptive use of sampling, and, while not approaching the electro-acoustic psychedelia of, say, Manitoba's Up in Flames, the nearly undetectable integration of laptop-based microloops and guitar stutters on Messy Century is a characteristic that, if more fleshed out, might help Mountaineers distinguish themselves from the genre's muses. Motives are unclear as to why Mountaineers so shamelessly mimicking Kid A-era Radiohead balladry on ""It's Solid"", and it's equally confusing why, in ""Apart from This"", the trio takes such an honest stab at house music, a decision which results in little more than a Daft Punk parody. That said, Mountaineers redeem themselves manifold with two songs that are simply fantastic, regardless of however many influences inform them. ""Belgique Limb"" enters with a dark bitch-brew prelude, then spends time in vague Flaming Lips territory before delivering a sudden swell of sputtered guitar strums and passionate but off-kilter melody in cross-panned chorus. Whistling, jangly guitars, and the quirky shuffling beat of ""UK Theatre"" evoke the Mountaineers' namesake nearly perfectly, and seem to hint at some folk update the band intended. More importantly, the song proves that Mountaineers are capable of avoiding the dangerous ""regular old folk but with computer noises"" rut into which many acts have stumbled. Especially in a genre that often succeeds for its honesty and lack of ornament-- electronic or otherwise-- Messy Century manages to keep songwriting as its focus, but to find the space within for tasteful and often compelling experimentation.","At least for the time being, psych-folk trio Mountaineers aren't going to shake the Flaming Lips comparisons, or the ...

She's in Control,Chromeo,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fcb1335d7bf1698f5c/1:1/w_160/1fdc4af6.jpg,2004-02-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1754-shes-in-control/,Vice,"A lot of what you need to know about Montreal duo Chromeo is built right into their name. The ""chrome"" tips us off to their penchant towards flash, veneer and the artificially formal, while the ""romeo"" lets us know that real lovermen lurk behind the curtain, and that it's their human fingers tweaking out this analog bling. The word's not necessarily coincidental proximity to ""Cameo"" also helps locate them as spiritual contemporaries to the electro-funk of the 80s. Some of this aesthetic sounds familar, sure, but as grade-A pastiche artists, Chromeo wear familiarity well. Consisting of lifelong friends Dave 1 and P-Thugg, Chromeo was formed at the behest of Turbo Recordings head Tiga, who was already a fan of their work within local hip-hop circles and wanted to hear them try something electronic. The liquid funk workout of ""You're So Gangsta"" followed. Featuring a rubbery keyboard lead, a coattails-to-the-wind saxophone solo and an accompanying remix from Playgroup's Trevor Jackson, the single fell perfectly in sync with the burgeoning Vice City-inspired 8-bit revival. She's in Control, the duo's ensuing full-length, is an 80s-plundering scrapbook of talk boxes, gloopy synths and digital funk that, for all its contrivances, proves Dave 1 and P-Thugg to be extremely keen-eared dilettantes. From the slightly unpolished quality of the recording to its carefully gated drums, the album doesn't simply appropriate the plasticky elements of the decade so much as it marinates in them. Were its hooks not as strong, She's in Control would probably come across as mechanical and calculated, but its many bright spots elevate it above being just a shrewdly timed exercise in cultural re-appropriation. The punchy ""Me and My Man"" opens the record with a slap-funk bassline and a flurry of canned beats, while P-Thugg heads the haters off at the pass through heavily treated vocals (""You think it's irony/ I wish you'd try to see/ That I need someone to set me free"") before being drowned out by a barrage of percussion. Even better is the album standout ""Needy Girl"", a bright-lights-big-city cruiser that's equal parts Hall & Oates and Mantronix. The aforementioned ""You're So Gangsta"" makes an appearance, as does the rubbery funk of ""Destination: Overdrive"", which houses a glorious instrumental hook and features an impressively gaudy abuse of the vocoder. Admittedly, things do drag a bit during the latter half (especially on the aimless ""Mercury Tears"", which grinds itself into the ground with an ill-advised guitar motif), but even most of Chromeo's misfirings have something interesting behind them. Opulent in all the right ways, She's in Control has the good sense to wear its gimmick proudly.","A lot of what you need to know about Montreal duo Chromeo is built right into their name.

Sweet and Vicious Like Frankenstein,Rob Mazurek,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f313d197565213be40/1:1/w_160/cb689a3b.gif,2004-02-22 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5169-sweet-and-vicious-like-frankenstein/,Mego,"When a record has two tracks totaling more than an hour, the question arises: Why? What are you doing with all that space? Well, in the case of a drone artist like Daniel Mensch, each half-hour slab meticulously dissects a narrow world of sound, offering the kind of slight changes over time that stand in for theme and variation. Mensch's long lines develop and tweak the central sonic idea, guiding the listener along a narrowly defined emotional path. Then there are the jams. Acid Mothers Temple's Kawabata Makoto took part in a pair of two-track, hour-long discs last year (Tsurubami's Gekkyukekkaichi and Rebel Powers' Not One Star Will Stand the Night) that were pure, deep space exploration, a chance for copasetic instrumentalists to lock arms and flap into the cosmos. This sort of trip is bound to take a while. Rob Mazurek's Sweet and Vicious Like Frankenstein takes another approach, stitching together a number of discrete sections, each with their own character and mood, into loosely connected patchwork pieces that go on for a while. Here, Chicago Underground Trio and Brokeback member Mazurek puts down his trumpet and steps away from anything resembling jazz to work solely with computer and electronics. Mego is a regular outlet when the younger set of the Chicago avant-garde wants to step out and try something more abstract and digital, and Sweet and Vicious Like Frankenstein is a very Mego record. Mazurek mixes field recordings, primitive sound machines, and loads of computer-generated sound into pieces that seem a bit like travelogues. ""Body Parts (Spectral White)"", which runs for 37 minutes, reminds me a bit of KLF's Chill Out the way it seems to roam from place to place without really going anywhere. Sounds streams past-- hissing pipes, whispery drones, aquatic gurgles, metallic scrapes-- and then, for a minute or two, there will be a lyrical keyboard passage with an ambient gloss that seems pulled from a record of twee bedroom IDM. There are a few nice little instrumental songs buried in this lengthy passage of meandering (but often interesting enough) noise, and a lot of silence, too. Either minute-long stretches are too quiet to be heard or there's just the sound of the furniture. There's loads of dynamic range, which perhaps exists to keep the listener tethered to the sound. During patches of boredom, however, it's easy to lose track of what's happening. ""Electric Eels (In Half Light)"" has a different vibe, darker and ultimately a hell of a lot louder. Mazurek evidently spent a fair amount of time with a DAT capturing the sound of industry, because all sorts of chugging machines can be found here, mixing with his comparatively tiny, computer-generated squall. The track wanders through several levels of blackened, spark-lit snapshots of the factory floor and then eventually hits a noisy state of bliss, with its final eight minutes given over to a punishing high-end howl of distortion. Listening to ""Electric Eels (In Half Light)"" yesterday, I had the odd revelation that this kind of track is actually much more effective in a live setting, where the volume can be controlled and there's no choice but to immerse yourself completely in the sound. It's an impressively textured harmonic squall, but the desire to reach for the stop button can be too great, especially when you've been sitting with the record for almost an hour. Sweet and Vicious Like Frankenstein is likewise more of an ""event"" record, rather than something to reach for with any regularity. It's occasionally dull but has a few great moments and some impressive dynamic shifts. Still, an hour of your life is a lot to ask.","When a record has two tracks totaling more than an hour, the question arises: Why? What are you doing with ...

The College Dropout,Kanye West,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa8c5e6ef959693215e8/1:1/w_160/7b1099ec.jpg,2004-02-20 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/,Roc-A-Fella,"College Dropout Mini-Course Syllabus Week 1: Allow Myself to Introduce Myself. Backstory. Discuss humble beginnings making beats in bedroom, car accident in October 2002 that nearly killed him. Consider rise to fame: Currently has three singles in the Top 20 (""Slow Jamz"", ""You Don't Know My Name"", ""Through the Wire"") bearing his name. Compare/contrast rise of hip-hop artist/producers with singer/songwriter movement of 1970s; Is Kanye West Neil Young or Neil Diamond? Week 2: Chitown, What's Going On? Discuss the failure of Chicago to produce a bona fide hip-hop star despite possessing more than enough fertile neighborhoods of racial segregation and socioeconomic difficulty. Uncover reasons why Common and West needed to move NYC-wards to attain widespread success. Week 3: First Nigga with a Benz and a Backpack. Analyze the fast-disappearing line between mainstream and underground hip-hop, as personified by College Dropout's guest appearances, and West's personal rap style. Compare/contrast to analogous rock divisions, in regards to how rock collaborations of similar caliber (Nickelback ft. Xiu Xiu?) would be greeted with indignant horror by fans. Week 4: School Spirit. Engage the anti-education themes of College Dropout's songs and skits, discussing why this particular message is greatly emphasized by West. Acknowledge the groaner irony of discussing an album's anti-intellectualism in syllabus form. So many extracurricular angles, so little time; so let's just suffice it to say that College Dropout is the first great hip-hop album of the still pre-pubescent 2004. Runner-up in its first week on the Billboard album charts only to Ravi Shankar's jazz-waif kid, the record is poised to be a huge coming-out party for one of the top producers working today, possibly even winning him the Outkast Triple Crown of acceptance from pop radio, hip-hop purists, and reactionary rock critics. Frequently delayed, retooled, overdubbed, teased on the mixtape circuit, overloaded with skits and guest stars, and dispersed in multiple misleading forms over the Internet, the retail version finally takes the form of a flawed, overlong, hypocritical, egotistical, and altogether terrific album. In a way, it's strange that West would be the first of the current producer bumper crop to find such success with his own name on the spine, with The Neptunes and Timbaland having colonized the charttops for a much longer period of time, and with much more adventurous and characteristic sounds. West's style is far less future-vision, as he typically reworks old records with the playfulness of a kid enthralled by playing 33s at 45. You can write it off as a safer or less original approach, but the sugar-high soul technique tends to be an addictive substance in West's hands, as anyone who's had the hook from ""H to the Izzo"" stuck in their head for a week or eight can attest. But Kanye's success through the studio glass is more drawn from his surprising abilities as an MC: He possesses a sizable amount of his Rocafella boss' charisma while hiding his occasional technical shortcomings with his gift for comedic timing. Mixtape downloaders have known this for a while, thanks to his whip-smart verses on ""Heavy Hitters"" and ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", but College Dropout brings a new evidence file, whether he's probing creative tax accounting on ""We Don't Care"" or puncturing the air bag of designer materialism in ""All Fall Down"". And when words fail, Kanye can always fall back on his day job, camouflaging even less-inspired lyrical moments with affably absurd beat constructions like the vocoder/strings/handclaps amalgamation that carries ""The New Workout Plan"" past its lyrical juvenilia. One begins to wish there were even more examples of Kanye's mic-work, as the album is also laden with distracting guest appearance speed-bumps-- spots that safety-net the album's bottom line but dilute the spotlight on its lead performer. Strangely, the biggest names fare the worst, with Jay-Z already sounding groggy from retirement on ""Never Let Me Down"" and Ludacris sounding groggy from something less legal on the hook to ""Breathe In Breathe Out"". The small names of Kanye's Chicago crew fail to impress as well, with GLC and Consequence's laconic verses deflating the menace of working-class lament ""Spaceship"". As a result, the mid-level MCs steer around the flank to steal the show, particularly on the quietly tense ""Get 'Em High"" where Kanye coaxes Talib Kweli into lightening up and fellow Southsider Common into getting serious. Chart-topper ""Slow Jamz"" appears in a slightly longer (and slightly weaker) form featuring overkill Jamie Foxx and depleted Twista, but if you haven't reached your quota yet, it remains the best getting-it-on song ever written about getting-it-on songs. The ferocious ""Two Words"" up-ramps a Mandrill sample into an ominous choir and violin-fed war cry flexibly savage enough to allow Mos Def to spit about his politics, Kanye about his Grammys, and Freeway about Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Steven Seagal. That ""Two Words"" is sequestered (along with the chock-full-of-clever ""Through the Wire"") behind a painful stretch of three clunker skits in four tracks (with the song island, ""School Spirit"", one of the album's weakest) shows that Kanye hasn't quite soaked in the lesson of the Jay-Z album that made his reputation: less skits = longer shelf life. Fortunately, listeners can take the editing into their own hands in this age of the iPod, also axing the once-interesting, twice-tiresome biography speech that fills out the 12-minute ""Last Call"". Deleting the skits also cuts down on the strange logic of the album's anti-college stance-- someone should tell West that not everyone on the street has the ability and/or luck to make a living in the music biz. (Full disclosure: Your reviewer may be biased by the fact that he'll probably be spending his lifetime in the Ivory Tower.) Bloated tracklist, guest star overload, lyrical paradoxes: It all might sound a bit critical for an 8+ album, but College Dropout's flaws tend to only help make Kanye West all the more personable as an artist. With the fat playlist trimmed, the album lays down a sky-high standard for hip-hop challengers in '04, featuring enough singles in reserve to fill out the calendar year. Ideal weather conditions of Chicago's rap void, producer name-dropping, and mainstream/underground bleedover may have handled the advance work for Kanye West's arrival, but College Dropout doesn't muff the kick.

Dresden Dolls,The Dresden Dolls,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba1813d197565213afdf/1:1/w_160/dce05469.jpg,2004-02-19 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2452-dresden-dolls/,Eight Foot,"""This is... bombastic,"" said one of the people I played this for. It's hard to argue with that: The Dresden Dolls call themselves ""Brechtian punk,"" meaning they blend the heavy-handedness of punk with the overwrought drama of cabaret. That makes it sound hideously, guiltily entertaining-- which is what I expected before hearing the record. If you've never seen their stage show, you can still get an eyeful from this album's black-and-white liner photos, which show the duo swooning or flopped like cast-off goth toys. As a performance artist-- before we knew what she could do to a piano-- Amanda Palmer used to pose as an eight-foot-tall ""living statue"" outside Harvard Square, dressed as in a thrift store bridal gown, blowing kisses or handing out roses for dollars. Clearly she doesn't shy from the spotlight. Behind her, drummer Brian Viglione looks to be the strong silent type: With his matching outfit and stern Jonathan Rhys-Meyers cheekbones, you'd expect to see him holding Palmer's bags at the fetish fair. But Viglione's both precise and tremendous as he locksteps behind Palmer, and his battery of percussion tics accentuate her lyrics. As much as they namecheck Brecht, this album-- the Dolls' proper debut, following the out-of-print primer A Is for Accident-- runs the gamut from theatrical to poppy, from oldies to showtunes. Remember that piano and drums were all that Jerry Lee Lewis needed to record ""Great Balls of Fire"", and the Dolls can match that frenzy. The world is full of songs about depression, but isn't it a relief to hear someone act manic for a change-- as on ""Girl Anachronism"", where Palmer pummels the keys like her skirt's on fire while Viglione clatters like a drawerful of razor blades? Palmer's voice drips and chills through the damaged-little-girl songs, but she can also melt into confessionals with melodic melancholy, like Tori Amos' punky younger sister. But the roles Palmer plays are even more intriguing. Sometimes she paints her characters cartoonishly broad, like the sinister little girl on ""Missed Me"" or the ""I sound hurt because I am hurt"" acting-out of ""Girl Anachronistic""; other songs use the illusions more subtly. On ""Coin Operated Boy"" she describes the plastic boyfriend that gives her ""love without complications,"" and the twist comes when she admits that she can't love a real boy because she's too difficult to be with. The stilted puppet-music shifts to an aching bridge that almost swirls her down the drain, until she stops, ties her strings back on and decides to act fake again. As clever as the Dolls may be, they know they won't last if they're typecast as the band that writes catchy songs about hermaphrodites and self-mutilation; and you can hear them move to steadier terrain, with the conventional message (and torrential music) of ""Truce"", a song about a mature emotional compromise. But the listener still has to decide whether to believe the whole act: Are they out for self-pity? Is the whole act just a spectacle, like a young angst freak show? Or do they know how to make entertainment from misery, to purge evil and waltz on its carcass? Maybe I'm just sucked in by the voice, but I vote for the latter. And if it takes them a lot of broad strokes to do it, well, that's probably what punk-cabaret is all about.","""This is... bombastic,"" said one of the people I played this for.

I Don't Wanna,Henry FlyntThe Insurrections,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be87ea9e61561daa78e8/1:1/w_160/8cdb30ab.gif,2004-02-19 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3288-i-dont-wanna/,Locust,"The 21st century has been pretty good to Fluxus fiddler Henry Flynt, which is funny, as the four decades previous yielded but one cruddy, dubbed cassette from a gallery show in 1981. After Alan Licht ranked it in his Minimalist Top Ten, that tape-- a ferocious wail titled You Are My Everlovin', which slashed like Tony Conrad and Eck Robertson in a straight-razor fight-- finally made it to the CD age. From that point onward, numerous other Flynt releases have appeared, documenting a powerful and prolific artist, and revealing a moonshine and meth to his madness. Following two excellent explorations of Flynt's obsession with the demented drone behind mountain music on his Back Porch Hillbilly Blues series, the Locust label digs up dead weathermen from the basement tapes for their fifth release by the man, documenting a (lone?) rehearsal from 1966. Though he's more renowned these days for his bow-pulling and unfettered dancing, he'd just learned guitar by way of the Velvets' Lou Reed at the time of I Don't Wanna, and was rolling tape with a drummer/sculptor named Walter De Maria. Soon forgoing the crackling thunder of the drums, De Maria would go on to gain international fame with his Lightning Field sculpture in New Mexico. Whether you hear his strumming patterns as inept or outsider, goony or genius, Henry Flynt sucks in all aspects of time for his sound. He gets that chilling thwack of Dock Boggs' bailing-wire blues from the 20s, the Fugs-frenzy and Godz-idiocy of the Lower East Side in the mid-60s, and anticipates Bob Log III's 90s catgut caterwauling. The sneer and stumble that constitute protest songs like ""Uncle Sam Do"" and ""Goodby Wall St."" tremble outside of time. De Maria, far from the cleanliness of the gallery scene, pounds and splats in the muck, his ideas of dumped garbage can as snare drum still heard in the trashy thud of Gibson Brothers, Pussy Galore, and the In the Red label's entire catalog. With the shuffling rhythm of ""Sky Turned Red"" or the almost-competent keyboards and bass that join in for ""Corona Del Mar"", you could mistake the duo's basement space for a juke joint, just as the stomp of ""Missionary Stew"" would pass as a Junior Kimbrough tune, were he backing up The Cramps' Lux Interior. Over some wiggling squalls of saxophone on ""Jumping"", Flynt strums out clumps of surf-reverb that suggest more than just a single idea of protest. Closer ""Dreams Away"" is even further out, a spindizzy solo on guitar that fidgets and twists before speeding into a blur of white light-- meaning it's quintessential Flynt.",,7.4,
The Rough Guide to African Rap,Various Artists,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81713d1975652139591/1:1/w_160/29bbecbf.jpg,2004-02-19 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2038-the-rough-guide-to-african-rap/,World Music Network,"A major music critic I formerly held in some esteem last year proposed, in a flurry of stale, self-annihilating wit, that ""there was only one thing more dystopic and frightening than [Company Flow]; I believe it was called the Zaire dictatorship."" First of all, maybe a certain international publication should learn some grammar rules. Secondly, it turns out the Zaire dictatorship has inadvertently inflamed some of the best hip-hop of the last decade. The Rough Guide series has never been particularly relevant (unless one considers classical compositions from feudal Beijing in tune with today's Billboard heatseekers). How they'll ever manage to convince enough geriatric socialites to purchase a compilation focusing on what will eventually be the hippest genre in the Rocafella world is one for the ages. In case you've forgotten, the last significant encounter with African rap was Dead Prez's description of the continent as ""camouflage fatigues and dashikis, somewhere between NWA and PE,"" which makes Africa sound less like a diverse and gigantic continent and more like an army surplus store. The problem, of course, is that in the era this compilation charts (1989-2000), portions of Africa actually were a QuarterMaster Supply Store. Adding innumerable cases of an inexorably deadly disease to the poverty, rampant carnage, and natural disasters didn't exactly help matters. Coming to this compilation from a culture where the most pressing social issue is Ludacris' right to sell Pepsi is like walking straight into The Garden of Progressive Socialism. The parties on this disc are not based on bling or bounce, but on stifling child abuse, AIDS and civil war. This is not most people's definition of a raging block party. And the artists here are well aware of how difficult it is to instill enlightening, even revolutionary, sentiments into svelte, mellow jazz and calypso samples. The opener, ""Right Here in Front of You"", opens with frond eaves whispering over crystal percussion, abating brass patches, and lulling clicks and hums. But the chorus might as well be off It Takes a Nation of Millions and the lyrics assail everything from gun control laws to carbon dioxide and dodecahedron-haters amongst such elliptical sense-jumbles as, ""Mainstream, can I piss in a puddle/ Then represent a bug like a kiss in a cuddle?"" Let's see the mainstream get out of that one. Ghana's Reggie Rockstone injects ""Eye Mo De Anna"" with cracking planks of Fela samples, but litters it with apocalyptic catastro-tympanis and clinically insane mutterings about Pope John Paul and Columbus. Mozambique's Mabulu lounges in a disconcerting marrabenta shanty before a young upstart with a gruff, cavernous cry goes Groucho all over the senior citizen cruise ship. Oh, and it was recorded in the middle of the worst flood since Noah. Kanye West's jaw has nothing to complain about now. Things tend to encroach upon hardcore rap deep within the second side, where even the softest song pledges that ""my Babylon eats suckas for breakfast."" Cape Town's Prophets of Da City is a sustained basement rumble that creeps through drowning alto to reach a flow that uncannily resembles Del tha Funkee Homosapien as it reels off an inner city hit list with an idolatry so ironic it's almost imperceptible at times. Similarly, we might as well just call off the race and proclaim Kalamashaka's ""Ni Wakati"" the apex of globe-hop or Diaspora-rap or whatever we call these sorts of things. Like all great political rap intros, a Malcolm X sample manifests a Mafiosi Mancini riff clouded by rasping, stultified Swahili, like Mobb Deep with severe lung damage. ""Msimu Kwa Msimu"" is all rattling violin histrionics severed by absorbed synths and dire handclaps, and, like all great pop songs, I have absolutely no idea what the lyrics mean. This raises the question of whether it's simply ignorant to listen to rap performed in obscure languages that have essentially no decipherable cognates. Put it like this: Pee Froiss' ""Djalgaty"" is regrettably the African version of ""Make 'Em Say Ugh"", but no one will even remember the beat because the lunatic lyricists are running a scorched-earth campaign through everyone's brains in the Wolof dialect. As this is a ""rap and rap-inspired"" comp, a few songs coast in on good faith, shutting down any momentum and failing to really serve as primers to these other permutations of African ""rap."" While it would be heresy to denounce Manu Dibango (of African Jazz fame), his contribution is the definition of anonymous ""world music,"" with harmless, desensitized flute and sax solos falling asleep to one another. Unless you're making out or on a family road trip (or some combination of the two), there's no reason to twiddle your thumbs through eight minutes of this. Those jokers at Rough Guide shouldn't be blamed for these lapses, though. They're trying to summarize an entire continent of music and that's simply too daunting for one album. Necessarily, many luminaries and trendsetters from dozens of countries were neglected. If there was a North American version of this, it would include K-Ci & Jojo, Cannibal Ox, and ""Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)"", and it would be enough of a disaster to hit an 8.2 on the Richter scale. In contrast, the genius of this album is that it locates the subtle differences while retaining a motivated sense of cohesiveness which is impressive when you're dealing with all of Africa.","A major music critic I formerly held in some esteem last year proposed, in a flurry of stale, self-annihilating wit ...

Westworld,Valley of the Giants,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9905e6ef95969321433/1:1/w_160/1976ff5f.jpg,2004-02-19 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8522-westworld/,Arts & Crafts,"In the 1973 Michael Crichton film, Westworld, Yule Brynner portrays a robot gunslinger at a fantasy themepark where patrons enact their John Wayne dreams in harmless shootouts against mechanized cowboys-- at least until James Brolin and Richard Benjamin come along, whereupon the computer systems that control the androids malfunction and start killing people. 31 years later, Ontario supergroup Valley of the Giants claim that early entry into the Crichton canon as the inspiration behind their new release on the burgeoning Arts & Crafts label. Unfortunately, like the movie, Westworld the album aims for Clint Eastwood but hits nearer Blazing Saddles-- except it's not a joke. The Giants mean serious business: If you thought prog-rock was the most titillating genre since fusion jazz, wait until you hear themed prog-rock! As the song titles indicate, this album borrows the essence of Crichton camp and injects it into a fictionalized world based loosely around the Old West. Thankfully, the album bears little resemblance to its inspiration, other than that it aspires to epic proportions and falls flat. Valley of the Giants arch back to when men wore spurs and met at high noon to exchange bullets, but fail to capture the suspense inherent in the world they interpolate. Valley of the Giants comprise a cross-section of the hip-as-shit Canadian instrumental and experimental pop scene. Anthony Seck of Shalabi Effect and Sophie Trudeau of Godspeed You! Black Emperor claim to have brainstormed Westworld in (what else?) an old Ontario farmhouse in the dead of winter. Soon after, Brendan Canning (Broken Social Scene), Charles Spearin (Do Make Say Think), Deidre Smith (Strawberry), and Raoul Tanguey joined them on a runaway train to concept album hell. If anything holds Westworld back, it's the thematic mandates of a concept album. Much of the music is palatable, but the western theme is a malady, as the record's lazy tremolo guitars move at roughly the pace of tumbleweed. The album's eight songs tend to hover around the eight- or nine-minute mark, with the laborious ""Waiting to Catch a Bullet"" clocking in at an even ten. Sophie Trudeau's influence is at once the album's greatest asset and detractor: Like Godspeed, Valley of the Giants are lost in the ozone and take their sweet time getting from place to place-- when there actually is a destination-- but along the way they experiment with lush, atmospheric sounds that at least make the trip endurable. On ""Whaling Tale"", however, the band drops the Stetsons and waxes piscine to produce its most intriguing song. The track features a gently pulsating synthesizer under a spare, reverberating guitar melody, and is punctuated by the sporadic ebb and flow of a stuttering drum beat. On top of the milieu, in wonted Godspeed fashion, an old man recalls a bizarre and oddly moving story of how a penguin is gobbled up by a killer whale. The song is a sure spoiler for a happy mood, and an awkward fit on this otherwise ineffectual album, and exemplifies what these talented musicians could accomplish if they only dropped their obsession with a world that's tricky to portray in any form of modern music without sounding cheeky. Westworld seems like the type of album with which its musicians would be quite satisfied: It accomplishes most of what it attempts to do in deliberate and virtuosic fashion. The crisp production is an unnecessary aid to the deft musicianship, which shows more discipline than most solo-afflicted prog-rock. However, like The Mars Volta's Deloused in the Comatorium, it suffers the gravest of musical illnesses: lackluster content. The songs on Westworld, put simply, just aren't very provocative. Spiraling acoustic guitars lack the dramatic buildup and restraint needed to make their prominent figures interesting, while their driving, amplified counterparts would serve well as a soundtrack for an enraged motorcyclist. Prog-rock is not and never will be ""hip""; the members of Valley of the Giants should stick to their roots, and not try to supplant them with indulgent experiments.","In the 1973 Michael Crichton film, Westworld, Yule Brynner portrays a robot gunslinger at a fantasy themepark where patrons enact ...

Having convinced brother Donovan to spend four hours crouched in a studio, cranking out boorish, slappy blues-rock for the In the Red label (the session yielded a triple seven-inch package later that year), Bauer stumbled, unassumingly, into an entirely new musical pursuit: 20 Miles mixes American roots with scrappy blues rambling, fusing bar-band rock with ample rockabilly rolls. Shuffling through a variety of players (no two 20 Miles records boast quite the same lineup-- 2002's Keep It Coming was recorded in Bauer's New York apartment, with cameos from friends and neighbors), Bauer also secured himself an artistic outlet that is, shockingly, far more stable than his previous outfit. The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's discography is notoriously mottled, and 20 Miles is Bauer's golden opportunity to wail consistent. Each of Life Doesn't Rhyme's eleven tracks are strikingly coherent, near-infallible in their dogged composure. Accessible and clear, the album is easily 20 Miles' most sophisticated record to date, a superlative Bauer earned by sheepishly abandoning all the goofy, bleeding jubilance that made JSBX so hopelessly scattered. Now, Bauer's guitar shoots swiftly through his band's basic roots-rock, establishing prominence while still eschewing loping solos; Bauer's vocals, clean and wobbly, humbly offer quiet, plaintive observations (""My dirty laundry tops the list of my confusion""). Written in just eighteen days and recorded at London's lovingly archaic Toe Rag studios (on some presumably ancient gear), Life Doesn't Rhyme is still gloriously loose, far closer to the Delta blues in spirit than in sound: Musically, there's not too much here (beyond the obvious rock citations) to compare to Bauer's stubbly Fat Possum labelmates, but he's still tapped into the prickly honesty of classic blues yowlers-- nothing here is overwrought or unfelt. The moping ""Gypsy Babe"" feels like swallowing a mugful of molasses, a slow, meandering love song layered over organ, bass, and drums-- thick and dripping, the track is also stubbornly subdued, Bauer's vocals barely rising and falling with the melody. ""Drown the Whole World"" opens with backwards guitar-swishing, Bauer's voice bouncing overhead; ""Ship Is Sinking Fast"" folds in piano and bold vocal confessions, a throbbing bassline backing up questions like, ""Who's gonna be the judge? Who's gonna be the hangman?"" Depending on how you like your blues (and in a post-Stripes rock landscape, we should all have a preference), 20 Miles will either be a curious footnote to or a welcome antidote from Bauer's work with the Blues Explosion. Solidly written and powerfully played, Life Doesn't Rhyme is an unflinching slice of American rock.","Judah Bauer spent the better part of the 90s squirting out guitar licks for Jon Spencer, pausing briefly in 1996 ...

A collection of primary-colored analog fingerpaintings and wispy drum patterns, that superior debut established a candycoated electro-naif aesthetic that the pair has adhered to since. Even as their home label Morr Music flirted more overtly with shoegaze, vocal pop and post-rock conventions over the years, Isan remained blissfully faithful to their template, releasing a string of albums with little-to-no variance between them. According to their official website, 2004's Meet Next Life affords a ""mild expansion"" of Isan's sound, which is a probably just a generous allusion to the fact that Saville and Ryan have acquired an acoustic guitar and a glockenspiel in the interim. Certainly, many of the predominant textures in Isan's music have become more organic with this release, but their songs still float by as ever, in a pleasant but amorphous mist of brightly struck notes that hang together for brief seconds before evaporating from memory. The sheer volume of notes that percolate through Meet Next Life might insinuate it to be a melodic record, but the truth is that by tinting the room with its persistence of texture, it functions more like ambient music than anything else. Relying on things like wood blocks and winding watches for rhythms, Isan don't seem to pay much mind to the low end of the frequency spectrum. Just as with ambient, there's a bias here towards the middle and upper frequency registers-- anything to make the music swirl and hover. And so it does, almost relentlessly. The songs pass into each other without fanfare or much in the way of differentiation. Aside from the breezy, guitar-aided opener ""Birds Over Barges"", the insistent chug of ""Iron Eyes"" and the miniature waltz of ""Sat73"", Meet Next Life feels transitional, incidental and affectedly dainty-- like the intermission music between acts of a stage production being put on by Playmobil toys. The last five years have already yielded more than enough records that sound like the precious machinations of a miniature cuckoo clock, and surely Isan have been responsible for their fair share of those. But as this particular chapter of laptop electronica passes on, suffocated by a bubblegum pink avalanche of similarly superfluous records, one can't help but think that Isan need nothing short of a massive Notwist-shaped U-turn to veer out of the self-parody zone. Well, that and possibly a secondhand harpsichord. Harpsichords never hurt anyone.","London duo Robin Saville and Antony Ryan prefigured the laptop twee-pop boom by more than a year with their 1998 ...

Milieu,Tape,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a733ea9e61561daa5522/1:1/w_160/bdfac71b.jpg,2004-02-18 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7938-milieu/,Häpna,"Intelligent Dance Music has become a much heralded thing, but intelligent ambient's just as difficult to pull off without landing in snoresville. In that vein, Stockholm, Sweden's Tape succeeds where other ""folktronica"" acts noodle themselves into a corner or fall prey to an over-determined laptop. On Milieu, the trio's second album, the compositions are carefully and emotionally layered, a midnight Fahey/Parch pantomime against a rusted silo. Birthed patiently by lamplight, Milieu's unspoken landscape is inhabited by a sleepytime progression of percussive washes, analog whirls, acoustic arpeggios. Beneath it, there's a sense that the ever-present vibraphone and glockenspiel are tapping out a secret language. It follows the tone set by its successor, Opera, but the nocturnal rumbles are more tuneful with less static downstrokes. Overall, there are more flourishes to rustle the upper branches: Andreas and Johan Berthling and Tomas Hallonsten blend acoustic instruments, electronics and field recordings in a way that shows the stitching but isn't collagist. It's the barroom mope of Tom Waits' Closing Time re-approached by Tortoise. Or perhaps it's just easy listening. The tracks are brief and contain enough spaciousness to allow counterpoint and rhythmic variance, but also solid melodies and even hooks. Some kindred spirits are Cincinnati-based Joshua Treble, Tim Hecker, Talk Talk, a less avant Gastr del Sol, or an ultra-concise Fennesz. The closest approximation for me, however, is The Books, though Tape show more restraint and are apt to stick to a single voice rather than to pour all the samples on the table. The album opens with ""Oak Player"", a gentle folk recital with vibraphone, guitar arpeggios, bells, flutters, brushed cymbal taps and rides, synth notes, chimes, and maybe a harmonium, among other things. I once saw a guy in a tuxedo play an orchestra of variously filled water glasses, and this comes close to eliciting similarly understated awe. There isn't much to it, but what's there is done skillfully. It's the kind of compositional purity that people often mar with sappy vocal samples or clips, and here they continue the firefly minuet without puncturing the spell. For me, it's a late Spring night on a roof in the suburbs-- catching the honeysuckle smell of an overgrown lot across the street-- listening to the street lights turn off and on and off. Buds, birds and unopened flowers emerging from a cardboard box. ""Sponge Charms"" continues treading between melancholia, nostalgia and joviality. Horns, keyboard, and guitar are backed by a tableau of static and loosening cables that drift through the same soporific ring of the first track: tiny toys walking in twos, cricket cut-ups, the aquatic-evoking sounds of a tape rewinding, New Years noise makers muffled beneath a foot of snow and ice and performed as accompaniment to a waltz. The track empties out with the sweeping sounds of dried weeds, sand, pine needles, underwater monsters-- a small-scale take on Nurse With Wound's Salt Marie Celeste, but in a cedar pond. There's a definite sense of submersion. Otherwise, I love the sloppiness of the synthesizer on ""Golden Twig"": The garish highs and lows mop over the lapsteel and vibe as accented flutters move between speakers like insects escaping a net, butterflies losing their maps, someone choreographing a bug light. And on ""Switchboard Fog"", the album's strongest track (and its closer), you can feel another sort of agglomeration, a ragtag orchestra of tired hobos building to a rousing crescendo of piano, accordion, synthesizer, and violin and finally getting it right: One note at a time leaps to an ecstatically lilting, jam-packed ending. It's actually heartbreaking, like the finale of some tear-jerk film. A number of these eight tracks create similar epiphanies, like you're bearing witness to a colt being born in some stable somewhere-- all damp and new and creaky on its legs, looking left and right and figuring what this new container involves, if escape's a possibility. It can be unwise to make effusive claims for tiny music, but by allowing the space for this sort of interpretation, Tape's creation also increases in size. These Swedes never come forward to say much about who they are or what they're doing; they allow the music to amble with charmed grace, leaving it to you to provide the picture.","Intelligent Dance Music has become a much heralded thing, but intelligent ambient's just as difficult to pull off without ...

Motor City Madness: The Ultimate Funkadelic Compilation,Funkadelic,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbaabf31b7dc7155ff1/1:1/w_160/cd361e93.jpg,2004-02-18 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3089-motor-city-madness-the-ultimate-funkadelic-compilation/,Westbound,"If you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky emotions. Let me play with them, for nothing is good unless you play with it. Let me slide a yard of tongue down your throat. Can you feel it, girl? It's called Funkadelic music. If you try to sit on air, you're gonna fall, I bet you. And man, I was in a place called Keeprunning, Mississippi onetime, and I heard something on my way. Sounded a little something like raw funk to me, so I slowed down and took a listen. And this is all I could hear: Soul is a ham hock in your cornflakes and a ring around your bathtub. Soul is chitlins foo young and a joint rolled in toilet paper. Soul is you, big mama. Freedom is free of the need to be free, so free your mind, and your ass will follow: The kingdom of heaven is within. The pusher push, the fixer fix the judge acquits and the junkie leads his life for the funky dollar bill. Said you blow my mind, you sure look fine. You make the heart beat sweeter than the honey that replaced the rain since I met you. Do you feel the fire in your veins? I can't free my mind. I'm so mixed up, so mixed up. What time is it? Friday night, August 14? Hey pussycat, come and see. You are as free as you want to be. Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time, for y'all have knocked her up. I was not offended. I read an old quotation in a book just yesterday that said, ""Gonna reap just what you sow."" Can you get to that? You can shake it to the east, shake it to the west but GOOD GOD HIT IT AND QUIT IT. And if in our tears we don't learn to share with our brothers, you know that hate is gonna keep on multiplying. Your maggot brain, your grins and frowns: Super Stupid you're here today and the winner is fear. More power to the people. More pussy to the people. And I want to know if it's good to you, baby. Eeny, meeny, miney mo, catch a junkie by the toe. If he hollers, let him go. If he don't, do the loose booty. Snorting his New York dope, went into a nod. Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet snorting some THC. Along came a spider, slid down beside her and said, ""What's in the bag, bitch?"" Skin it back and monkey it. I don't know but I've been told that dog's a man best friend. And I call my baby pussy, spell it P-U-S-S-Y. And the animal instinct in me makes me want to defend me. It makes me want to live when it's time to die. I believe in god. She's the devil, and I like it. When she comes, I'll be there to meet her. Everybody is going to make it this time. Everybody is going to make it this time. Ain't you deep? Give us the strength to understand ourselves, for we are mysterious animals, man. We've seen it hard and kind of rough, but always with a smile. I can hear my mother call. Father, please don't judge me too strong. I meant no wrong. My sexy jones was below sea level and the hornies occupied my being. What's wrong with making her call me ""daddy?"" I said, ""All looks are not alike and all holes are not a crack."" She said, ""No compute."" But I could tell she was interested. Everybody is gonna come play in the nappy dugout this time, so please don't judge me too strong. Lord knows I meant no wrong. Who is this bitch? Thumbing her way to Savannah, she's been cooped up too long. She promised to do all kind of freaky things to me. I said, ""Be my dog, and I will be your tree and you can pee on me."" They call it mental masturbation. I want to help you use what you got. Even if you don't dig it, it don't mean it's not the thing to do. If you don't feel it right now, that don't mean someday it'll turn you out. You really shouldn't ought to fight it. Reality can be a stiff sometimes. Think right, and you can fly. Shit, goddamn, GET OFF YOUR ASS AND JAM! Remember, the kingdom of heaven is within. Pleasure's the motivation for the human race. Everything starts and ends with sex and appeal. There's a tidal wave of mysticism surging through our jet-age generation, and it's designed to take us to the sky. Everybody's funking and don't know how; sitting in the woods on a log, finger on the trigger. If you ain't gonna get it on, take your dead ass home. Can you relate to what we're programmed to do? Can you see what's going down in you? Wouldn't you rather fly than die? Good god.

The Cansecos,The Cansecos,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fb9d034d5c69bf369d/1:1/w_160/e975a61e.jpg,2004-02-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1753-the-cansecos/,Upper Class,"Could it be possible that popular music's capacity for innovation and expansion is actually infinite? Infinite is pretty big, I know, but every time I think things have turned into a cul de sac and it's all just regurgitation, someone springs something fresh on me and suddenly I can see the roads stretching in every direction again, just waiting to be traveled. Given the constant proliferation of new technologies and the shear breadth of possible sounds and combinations, both natural and electronic, it stands to reason that there will always be something that hasn't been tried. There may not be another sea change in music the way there was in the late 60s (although one could argue that hip-hop is as revolutionary), but from where I stand, several decades after rock's initial evolutionary explosion, I can't possibly see it stagnating completely. The more music I listen to, the more likely this possibility seems, and as long as there are albums like The Cansecos' self-titled debut out there waiting to be heard, I'm not changing my theory a bit. I don't know what's caused this sudden run of creativity in Toronto, but ingenuity seems to run in the blood of the musicians there, from collectives like Broken Social Scene and Do Make Say Think to loners like Manitoba and The Russian Futurists. The Cansecos fit somewhere in between all that stuff; the work of sometime filmmaker Bill Halliday (no relation to the Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Roy) and Upper Class label head Gareth Jones (not the guy who produced Clinic's Internal Wrangler) is decidedly rooted in solid, straightforward melody, and branches from those roots into strange and distinctive sonic territory, a whirring mix of the obsolete and the absolutely modern. The album opens with the excellent mission statement ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" with off-handed, double-tracked vocals over acoustic guitar and spare drum programming. The beats ramp up to the chorus, building to a dancefloor frenzy and then back down for the next verse. Those relaxed, even vocals are the core of every song, and though Jones and Halliday aren't going to share poet laureate honors for Ontario any time soon, they spin some interesting verses, such as Jones' ""Business hopes religion chokes the life out of religious folks/ So we all can safely consume/ And make those dollars and cents,"" from ""In Bloom"", a song awash in harp samples and swishing ambience. The watery echo and soft-hued keyboard of ""This Girl and This Boy"" create a Spector epic in miniature, a Wall of Sound that's more return-to-the-womb than wrecking crew, but nonetheless overwhelming. There are plenty of BBC Radiophonic Workshop synths winding and warbling their way through the textures The Cansecos create-- ""This Small Disaster"" even borders on microtonalism with its buzzing, wavering patches-- and much of what the duo does parallels the work of Dan Snaith's Manitoba in terms of dynamics and sonics, respectively. This album was recorded between 2000 and 2002, and as such it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what they were taking in; regardless, they've made such a complete and accessible whole out of it that they can call the sound their own. With luck, it'll take less than two whole years for The Cansecos to dream up a follow-up to this incredibly promising debut, but even if it does, this album pushes just a little further in pop's great infinite, and definitely deserves to be heard.","Could it be possible that popular music's capacity for innovation and expansion is actually infinite?

Bravehearted,Bravehearts,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a44b13d1975652138c9c/1:1/w_160/58ab9b20.jpg,2004-02-17 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1101-bravehearted/,ColumbiaIll Will,"Release schedules for commercial rap albums usually dictate their level of appeal to an audience or the label's confidence in the record's profitability, marketability, or general accessibility. That said, Bravehearted was snuck into the week before CD production ceases for Christmas holidays. Why would this happen? I mean, Nas is on five tracks. Seriously! He made Illmatic! His name is on the cover three times. Surely, this is practically a Nas EP, right?! And one of the Bravehearts is Nas' brother. But if you think of things in the comedic perspective, Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy's brothers are both comedians, too. Therefore, Bravehearted is effectively the Comedy Central special where Mike Rock gets to talk about his brother on TV. In the simplest of terms, Bravehearts sound and rap like Nas. Except, along with a general lack of charisma and a dearth of ridiculous statements, the artists here rap as if they don't know the mic is on, or, at the very least, have never actually rapped on record before. This is bedroom hip-hop with production values and Nas saying things he would never say if he didn't already know no one would ever buy the album. In an example of what I call ""dancing like nobody's watching,"" Nas completely loses it on the title track, a surprisingly enjoyable bare-bones boom-bap number by Jungle, with flailing horns and cipher-styled vocal adlibs. Mr. Jones goes to Washington, not to talk to the president or transform into a gun (as is his custom), but to fornicate with ""horny white nuns"" and ""black dyke ones,"" while ""dressed like Bush."" And then he lets loose the ""You thought Nas kept his ignorance to interviews?"" couplet of 2003: ""I'm Jewish like Sammy Davis Jr./ Holding a Louis suitcase with Colin Powell chopped in pieces."" But seriously, if anything, Nas is the reason you might steal this off the Internet, as the short bus lyricism of the Bravehearts knows no end. At one point, Jungle brings about knowledge beyond his years: ""I broke a nigga back with a baseball bat/ I crack your fucking skull, you'll need a body bag/ Your family's mad and sad, I'LL BE GLAD."" Worst of all are the choruses that range from the vaguely homoerotic all-male singalong of ""Sensations"" (""I get a sensation when you suck my dick/ And you lick my balls"") to the girl-on-leash misogyny of ""I Wanna"" (""Baby, I wanna fuck/ I'll be your down-ass slut/ You know I like it rough/ You can do it in my butt""). Production-wise, Bravehearted is a consistent style clash that sometimes proves effective but ultimately fails. The tribal ambience and classically raw drum loop (same used on ""Five Man Army"" by Massive Attack) of ""I Will"" and dark song to the siren assault of Lil Jon's ""Quick to Back Down"" win big and distract from the obvious lack of talent on display. But beats like the Casio cascade and soft drums of ""Twilight"" and the harsh harpsichords and sub-Cameo synth whistle of ""Cash Flow"" make you wonder if anyone could ever listen to this album without skipping a cut. Situations where this album might be played in rapid succession appear to me in night terrors. Cult meeting, bumping ""Buss My Gun (For the One I Love)"". I wake up with a start. Bomb shelter soundtrack of ""Situations"". Cold sweat. Nazi death march, loud speakers blast ""Sensations"". My girlfriend leaves me because of my restless sleep. Fuck you, Bravehearts. With skits that are pure mid-90s self-aggrandizing (one involving a confusing anal sex soap opera), the most inane choruses ever, awkward flows, uninspired beats and Nas phoning in any number of ""cred-heightening"" verses, Bravehearted consistently sputters like a broken lawnmower or a shot down WWII warplane... fuck. The dreams are coming back.","Release schedules for commercial rap albums usually dictate their level of appeal to an audience or the label's confidence ...

Calling Out of Context,Arthur Russell,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f6b1335d7bf16985f3/1:1/w_160/605522b4.jpg,2004-02-17 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6908-calling-out-of-context/,Audika,"Now I know what it's like to assume you know what Arthur Russell sounds like. Back in the day, those comfortable with his modern classical accomplishments were baffled by his acetates of loopy leftfield disco. Likewise, lovers of these dance tracks were confounded by their beatless, beatific recasting on World of Echo. And then there were listeners astounded by the intimacy of his voice and cello work, stymied by both the pop songs and the classical works, all spinning in a vicious cycle of artistic assumptions. Smug with the presumption that I could accept all of his work, here comes the first release from the label now responsible for the Herculean task of gleaning the contents of hundreds of hours' worth of unreleased music from Arthur's tape archives. Culled from an unreleased album from 1985 called Corn and another slated for release on Rough Trade but never solidified, Calling Out of Context's twelve tracks are unlike anything I've ever heard from the man. Consider the immediately striking ""The Platform on the Ocean""; gone is the personal, arm-hair rubbed dub of cello, the atom-heart palpitations of layered drum skins, the murmuring, translucent voice in the chilly discofloor of space. In its stead is the rigorous drive of programmed drums and a heavily distorted cello that fuzzes like The Jesus & Mary Chain, chopping up the surface of the song. Arthur's killer whalesong voice, often a lone entity, bobs in multi-tracked rounds like schools of jellyfish on the unplumbed depths. He sings about seeing the fish beneath him, yet he also hears the steam room churn behind him, and it makes for seven minutes of cycling pop strained between the pull of fluid motion and a more mechanistic push. I'm so used to hearing Russell be ahead of his time (the cover even shows him anticipating hipster style with a crooked trucker's cap!), that I'm surprised to find these twelve pop songs are simply of his time. While long-time collaborator Mustafa Sidahmed provides a good deal of percussion, he bolsters the beats with drum machines that would sound more familiar on a Mantronix track or Patti LaBelle comeback. The keyboard intro to ""That's Us/Wild Combination"" could pass for a Mike Post theme song, but while the production is shiny at points, there's just enough of that innate, anachronistic ability of Arthur's that-- though it marred his career during his lifetime-- has guaranteed critical resurrection ever since his passing in 1992. With all these cheesy earmarks of an era, Arthur makes it seem unfamiliar: synth-pop in an alternate reality. ""I Like You!"" takes simple sentiment and slices it with tin-canned handclaps, serrated cello, and ancient arcade game bleeps. ""Calling All Kids"" takes a digital keychain and sets it as a destabilizing sound effect throughout the song, robotically intoning that ""grown-ups are crazy."" Despite the factory presets that date ""Arm Around You"", Arthur's watery vocals convey that endearing, universal gesture of touching a lover's face yet never quite overcoming the space in-between. A poignant koan reiterates throughout the song: ""All alone and right next to you/ What I'm doing in a fine, this fine stretch of time."" As the title track runs on, the comforting cello and percussion rises up between the drum machine hits, and Arthur echoes through the space, conjuring both the Iowa fields of his youth and the Indian Ocean. There's that axis of intimacy and unrecoverable distance, of the tangible and ethereal, dealing with the hardware that makes music and the soft machines that do, too, inseparable no matter what song form gets explored. The disc proves Russell to be a changeling artist whose only parallel might be Miles Davis, constantly placing his individual sound in new contexts, constantly searching. But whereas Miles' explorations-- from cool nonets and electric washes to on-the-one funk and Cyndi Lauper-- came over a forty year period, Arthur did it all at once; the genres undifferentiated in his mind and compacted into the infinity of a single decade.","Now I know what it's like to assume you know what Arthur Russell sounds like.

Fabulous Muscles,Xiu Xiu,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aacfc0084474cd0c126b/1:1/w_160/3cfe61b0.jpg,2004-02-17 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8826-fabulous-muscles/,5RC,"Ever since the release of their 2002 debut Knife Play, Xiu Xiu frontman Jamie Stewart has been hard at work redefining the concept of ""challenging"" music. Rather than obfuscating songs with grating noise and ostensibly atypical structures, Stewart challenges the most fundamental conventions of musical expression and honesty with an intensity that's often been misread as parody, irony or cheap theatrics. Thus, while Xiu Xiu's music has continued to gain support in recent years, it's rare to hear a recommendation that isn't qualified with some sort of hesitant apology for the band's atypical instrumentation and over-the-top delivery. Well, all that can end right now. After showing tremendous musical growth on last year's A Promise, Stewart has come frighteningly close to producing his masterwork-- an album that's as accessible as it is unconventionally affecting. On Fabulous Muscles, Stewart plays with dissonance without succumbing to it, contorting electronic drones, drum machine beats and his own haunting tenor into a propulsive and elegant record. The songs are often tremendously dense, but the combinations and contrast Stewart teases out of the mix are always immediate and striking. Indeed, the quality of the melodic and instrumental interplay here is right up there with many more straightforward pop bands, but Stewart manages to use it to an entirely different end. Detached from the safety and set form of traditional pop music, Fabulous Muscles is an album bursting with tension, tenderness, pain, and restraint-- concepts that have informed Xiu Xiu's music from the beginning, but which the band has never so deftly expressed. ""Crank Heart"" immediately establishes Fabulous Muscles as both accessible and deeply layered. Perfectly balancing melody, energy and chaos, the song sounds as if it's ready to blow apart at any minute, held together only by a hauntingly present force of will. The tension increases on the album's title track, which appeared last year on a split EP with the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up. This new version foregoes the spooky atmospherics and whirring spaceship sounds of the EP version in lieu of a chilling, almost self-punishing restraint. This restraint is often shaken by an underlying intensity, best conveyed on ""I Luv the Valley OH!"", quite possibly the finest single track Xiu Xiu has ever released. ""I Luv the Valley OH!"" is an immediately accessible song, but also a profoundly subversive one. Mimicking traditional pop forms while simultaneously defiling them, the intrinsic discomfort of ""I Luv the Valley OH!"" comes through in both its structure and its articulation. The song's titular scream provides the frozen emotional centerpiece for a feverish and insistent dirge, and a rare moment of absolute release amidst an album often marked by a chilling sense of emotional confinement. Only once does Fabulous Muscles threaten to descend into absolute cacophony. On the harrowing ""Support Our Troops (Black Angels OH!)"", Stewart tackles politics with characteristic intensity. Rather than hiding behind tried-and-true anti-war sloganeering, Stewart delves into the troubling psychology of war. Whether or not the sentiments expressed here are ""correct"" is entirely moot-- what's striking about the song is not so much its direct political implications, but the overwhelming and sincere sense of human terror that permeates it. Part of what makes this record so powerful, though, is the fact that this darkness often lifts. On ""Clowne Towne"", Stewart sings, ""Your true self has become weak, alone, and annoying/ A true ridiculous dumbass,"" in an oddly sweet combination of fondness and frustration that fits perfectly into a disarmingly catchy song. ""Little Panda McElroy"", which first appeared on the same split EP as ""Fabulous Muscles"", remains one of the most poignant and complicated love songs I've ever heard. With lyrics like, ""I can stop wanting to kill myself.../ Because of you,"" this is about as far from your typical, rote and sterile love song as you can get. This version offers an even more moving musical exploration, as Stewart's breathy voice is subsumed by pulsing electronic drones into a single, insistent beat. Though there are many notable high points to Fabulous Muscles, its overwhelming consistency is what cements its place as Xiu Xiu's finest. The album does not contain a single hiccup or yawn-- no extraneous noise, no potentially offputting histrionics, no throwaways and no dull moments. Fabulous Muscles, like the best of Xiu Xiu's catalog, is challenging not because it's particularly dissonant or noisy, but rather because it addresses you in a manner that's categorically different from what you've come to expect from any kind of music-- pop, experimental or otherwise. With Fabulous Muscles, Jamie Stewart continues to explore and expand this mode of address, and in doing so has made an album that is profound, innovative, and absolutely vital.

Feel Good Lost,Broken Social Scene,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3adea9e61561daa4d31/1:1/w_160/180cd8c0.jpg,2004-02-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/953-feel-good-lost/,Noise FactoryNoise Factory,"Certain records are just made for close listening on headphones. Some albums cannot be fully experienced save a complete discontinuation of the outside world. The inner retreat of headphone listening sheds light on a group's true colors; the makeup rubs off, and leaves us to discover all the flaws and inconsistencies in the music's resplendent left/right asymmetry. What on speakers sounds like an extension of a refrigerator's hum may upon closer inspection be revealed as a delicate, pulsating harmony that draws together an otherwise lifeless song. Ambient noises, effects and other tricks are also often lost by stereo speakers' capricious playback tendencies. For such intricate and subtle records, only headphones paint a just portrait, and while they limit themselves to a narrow environment, their payoff can be duly satisfying. You Forgot It in People, the album that brought Broken Social Scene due prestige last spring, wasn't one of those albums. Though it sounded just as great in the isolation of Prestige Series Grados, the record was a bona fide speaker blaster, full of craggy, overdriven guitar lines and unabashed vocals. It pulled few punches and refused to drown its populism in reverb or overblown production. Part of its appeal was its vulnerability: the diversity of musical styles and songwriting voices, the unashamedly tuneless vocals on songs like ""Looks Just Like the Sun"". Yet somehow, all its elements came together perfectly to create a work of accidental genius. So it may come as a shock for fans of that record to discover that Broken Social Scene premiered as just another of Canada's many instrumental post-rock bands. Their debut album, Feel Good Lost, features only two separate instances of distorted guitars or impassioned vocals (the raspy strumming on ""Love and Mathematics"" and the sober murmuring on ""Passport Radio"", respectively)-- which seems like a great disappointment until you get up close and personal with the record, and realize just how greatly it informed its successor. Feel Good Lost is the sort of album that does lend itself to intimate listening, and while not nearly as inventive or as well-rounded a statement as You Forgot It in People, it owns its fair share of dazzling moments. The similarity between the two records has more to do with their spirit than with their sound: Feel Good Lost isn't a rock album, but the band affects the same cogitating melancholia that made You Forgot It in People so intimate-- in fact, that record's bittersweet warmth is even more prominent here. A sense of historical influence permeates the recording, creating a pleasant sense of familiarity. The tangled, chorused guitars of ""Guilty Cubicles"" evoke Durutti Column at their ethereal best, while a track like ""Stomach Song"" possesses a blasé cheerfulness that stretches back to Nico-era Velvet Underground. ""Stomach Song"", in particular, feels affable, featuring a mumbled, repetitive soliloquy, delivered by a breathy female voice over a loop of jumbled talking that at times sounds like an unlikely precursor to The Books' patented crowd-sampling. Some newer influences have also wrestled their way into the mix: ""Passport Radio"", with its quavering strings and heart-pulse bassdrum, conjures Sigur Rós circa Agaetis Byrjun. Unfortunately, Broken Social Scene's few attempts to step outside the narrow coordinates of Feel Good Lost's overarching vibe don't always yield successful results-- which is surprising, given how skillfully You Forgot It in People navigated the pop strata. Part of the problem is that the band seems too attached to the things it does well. The record maintains a laser-like focus that runs through all twelve songs. Any and all detours are taken with noticeable wariness, such as ""Prison Province"", a spare, two-minute porno-esque guitar track that left me slightly bemused, as did the percussion on ""Last Place"", which wouldn't sound out of place in a Lexus commercial. The song is the album's longest, and at over eight minutes of thin, repetitive drones, it's by far the least engaging track in Broken Social Scene's catalog. Feel Good Lost is balanced nicely, however, by various embellishments which help break the occasional monotony, and even hint at the more confident band that produced last year's paramount orch-pop opus: A harmonica breathes life into the feeble ""Blues for Uncle Gibb""; rustic strings add a fragile touch of broke-down sadness to ""Mossbreaker""; diced drum loops drive the otherwise subdued ""Love and Mathematics"". Feel Good Lost may inhabit a much smaller plot of land than its successor, but the ground on which it rests has been just as thoroughly reared and cultivated.","Certain records are just made for close listening on headphones.

Fool for Love,Paul Burch,by: Chris Drabick,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f35e6ef95969320764/1:1/w_160/a319dcff.jpg,2004-02-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1021-fool-for-love/,Bloodshot,"It seems hard to believe that Bloodshot Records is celebrating their tenth anniversary this year. Between their 45th Jon Langford release and doling out Graham Parker's latest to the minuscule number who still give a shit, Rob and Nan occasionally treat us to something worth listening to, as sometime Lambchop collaborator and WPA Ballclub leader Paul Burch's latest offering proves. Over the course of five records, Burch has continuously reminded listeners that he's carefully studied his Johnny Cash, George Jones, Hank Sr., et al. Fool for Love does not stray at all from his formula, and most of the tracks here would not sound at all out of place if inserted randomly into 2000's Merge release Blue Notes. While there's no song as sublime as that album's ""Isolda"" (still a mix CD winner), this record's push and pull between boom-chicka-boom twangers and high lonesome balladry is essentially without an outright weak moment. Burch's lyrical prowess could certainly never be confused with the Elvis Costellos of the world, but the focus implied by the record's title is maintained to a strength. The narrator of ""Bad Girl That She Used to Be"" effectively evokes the hapless sucker that falls for some dirty slut only to delude himself that his love has redeemed her from her days of getting triple-teamed by some Theta Chis. (I mean, who hasn't been through something similar? Well, I mean, I haven't, but this friend of mine...) In ""Call My Name"", the shy-guy hides his ""face behind a Belgian Chimay"" as an understated pedal steel whines his tale. And while ""Sparks Fly Out"" is a touch obvious, Burch's halting vocal delivery is worthy of the album's only falling-in rather than -out-of-love song. While the first half of the record has its winners (the opener ""Lovesick Blues Boy"" and the aforementioned ""Bad Girl"" come to mind), ""Fool for Love"" surges in the second half. ""Moments of Weakness"" and especially ""Like Railroad Steel"" use traditional instrumentation to hit Sun Records-style highs. ""Steel"" and closer ""My Last Match"" are heavy on the simile and metaphor, but each are in keeping with the theme. And when the narrator of ""Match"" uses that spark to ""leave this building burning,"" one can only hope that he's used the flames to light a Camel as well. Let's be straight: There are really no surprises here. And if you're the sort of listener that agrees with the 5.9 afforded Blue Notes here at Pitchfork upon its release, there's certainly nothing on Burch's latest that would change your mind. That being said, February, with its endless gray and holiday for lovers, is the perfect month to pop open a Chimay and drink along with the parade of sad and lonely losers that Paul Burch and various members of the Ballclub introduce us to on this eminently enjoyable release.","It seems hard to believe that Bloodshot Records is celebrating their tenth anniversary this year.

Smallville,Tobias Thomas,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a78913d197565213942c/1:1/w_160/05c9f0a9.jpg,2004-02-17 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8023-smallville/,Kompakt,"It really shouldn't follow that a sound rooted in picking and choosing the elements of another established genre would be more fruitful than its blueprint. Subtraction is supposed to be about deduction, isn't it? Musically, one would think it would whittle away elements of a sound and reduce sonic possibilities. Yet by turning down the bombast and thrust of house, producers have been able to explore the space between its rhythm and melody and revel in the push and pull of placing delicate, avant-glitch alongside oft-direct melodies and regimented beats. The result is that microhouse has been one of the more durable, inclusive sounds of the past few years. On Tobias Thomas' mix Smallville, he illuminates microhouse's gentle shading by artfully constructing a mix that goes from a whisper to, not a scream but certainly a clamor, without any neck snapping. Smallville is Tobias Thomas' second mix for Kompakt, following 2000's Für Dich, which featured Wolfgang Voight (Gas), Lali Puna, Vladislav Delay (Luomo), and Crane A.K, among others. This time the mix is far from primarily Cologne-based, or even a purely German sound: Smallville includes producers from upwards of six countries. There are few actual Kompakt releases here-- and not everything is even proper microhouse-- but they all share the label and sound's basic aesthetic. The diversity of the record ranges from Dntel's hushed vocals and acoustic-electronic shuffle to the tasteful, understated four-on-the-floor of Cologne ""supergroup"" Forever Sweet (Voight, Thomas, and Michael Mayer). Taken as individual tracks they could seem disparate and unsettling, but under Thomas' skilled hand the mix gradually unfolds like a sunrise. Rather than treat the genre as microbic, Thomas takes a microscope to it, highlighting the nuance of these tracks by allowing them to subtlety build on one another. Dntel opens the set with ""Season"", a fragile, yawning acoustic-electronic gem. The spirit of Dntel's genre-blending is made more explicit when it feeds into a delicate mashup of Kaito's pillowy, beatless ambient-trance pearl ""Release Your Body"" and the vocals of Erlend Øye's ""Ghost Train"", a track from the Kings of Convenience singer's debut that was originally produced by Metro Area's Morgan Geist. Much of the rest of the record's first half is a blend of click-house and the soothing washes of sound found on the Pop Ambient series. Here the delicate skips of Andres Ilar's ""Onehow"" and the glitch-dub of Sten's ""Asami"" peak with the album's psuedo-centerpiece, Jan Jelinek's ""Tendency"". Jelinek's first single released under his own name, ""Tendency"" was also featured on Loop-finding-jazz-records. Here Jelinek's trademark pops and cuts act as a revolving door, fluidly separating the focus on texture and atmosphere of the first half of the record from the bass and rhythm of its second side. As arranged by Thomas, the mix's other producers seem to take ""Tendency"" as a starting point and either bury deeper into Jelinek's enveloping sound or step back and click their heels over increasingly pronounced rhythms. Those more traditional house sounds pepper the second half of Smallville, which includes more melodic, 4/4 structures, as evidence by tracks from artists on more hyperkinetic labels as Shitkatapult (Sami Koivikko), Tresor (Aril Brikha), and Bpitch Control (Feadz). Thomas indicates that he had a specific intent in mind when he created the record, calling Smallville a ""musical try to compare the structures of living in small communities with the restrictions and possibilities of the dance community."" Hey, that's super. There really isn't much to clue the listener in on that information here-- instead the wide range of sounds allows a wide range of listener responses. What is clear, however, is that this is a dance mix arranged for doing the standing still, crafted as for solitary moments. It's a record that starts with brittle bedsit intimacy and, once its hooks unfold, just might soundtrack a solo bounce around your room.","It really shouldn't follow that a sound rooted in picking and choosing the elements of another established genre would ...

4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up,Gift of Gab,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfeeea9e61561daa7b2c/1:1/w_160/acf5d011.jpg,2004-02-16 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3633-4th-dimensional-rocketships-going-up/,Quannum,"The type of person who makes a concerted effort to have things like Blackalicious B-sides and Lyrics Born 7-inches in their life probably won't find much to dislike about Gift of Gab's solo recording, 4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up. It's everyone else that Gab will be fighting hard to win over. Like 2001's studious Blazing Arrow, this sturdily constructed debut locates itself at a very specific place in hip-hop, a place that derives its identity almost entirely from what it is not. Reverant, nostalgic and brutally po-faced, Gab's hip-hop is meant for a specific mode of consumption-- to reassure and reinforce in the face of the muggy, undignified backwater that mainstream hip-hop has become. Unfortunately, whenever you define your aesthetic in strict opposition to someone else's, you slam the door on a million possibilities, and 4th Dimensional too often feels shut out. Duty-bound and mature, it's the sound of Gab's personal war being waged in some faraway place where things like jokes and bump and playfulness and ambiguity are regarded as unnecessary detours on the road to hip-hop nirvana. None of this is an indictment so much as it is another way of suggesting that since there are things you almost definitely won't get from a Gab record, what he's willing to give you needs to be good enough to compensate. 4th Dimensional opens well in this regard, with the harp-tinged opener ""The Ride of Your Life"", striking just the right balance between a candlelit, new-agey vibe and Gab's motorik flow. It's even alright when he smears his introductory verse with metaphysical palaver about ""dimensions of a positive invention"" and ""the infinite provocative"" because, hey, somehow it feels good, it fits. It doesn't take long for ugly stepsister ""Rat Race"" to break the spell. Built around a farting tuba line and containing the opening couplet, ""All the bull stops here, I'm a matador/ Here to introduce a new rap catagore,"" it's a cringeworthy little thing that, back-to-back with ""The Ride of Your Life"", forecasts the album's inconsistency. For every honeyed glimmer of a track like ""Way of the Light"", there's a drab funk cutup like ""Real MCs""; for every ""Just Because"", a ""Flashback"". And so it goes. Much of this unevenness has to do with the production, which is supplied here by relative newcomers Jake One and Vitamin D. At their best, the backing these producers provide is still only good as an obvious homage to something else; half the time you can't help but be overcome by a sneaking suspicion that they're trying to out-Xcel each other. Even the tracks you imagine they think are hot are actually dutifully restrained, afraid to bump too hard or with too much cut. That might be interesting if there were some juxtaposition between their stubborn politeness and Gab's lyrical content, but his flows flow with the same caveats-- an often boring technical precision and a hamfisted deference to moralizing and finger-wagging. I'd have loved to have seen Gab take on a completely different persona here, or at least to indulge himself and step away from the Blackalicious schema a little more than he has. But even on his own terms, 4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up feels a little too smoothed over and sedated; like Nia, three dimensions removed.","The type of person who makes a concerted effort to have things like Blackalicious B-sides and Lyrics Born 7-inches in ...

Me First,The Elected,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcecc0084474cd0c2bba/1:1/w_160/d9071459.jpg,2004-02-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2901-me-first/,Sub Pop,"Has any other label done more to fight the unwarranted stigma attached to the side project than Sub Pop? Recently, Ugly Casanova and The Postal Service have served their artists as leftfield career highlights while fans anxious awaited new material from their full-time bands. 2004 isn't yet two months old, and the label has already unleashed yet another unexpected slice of side project ingenuity with Rilo Kiley guitarist (and sometime vocalist and songwriter) Blake Sennett's collaboration-heavy debut as The Elected. Sennett, thankfully, is worthy of the endeavor. His originals with Rilo Kiley have always alluded to an infatuation with the breathy tenor and fragile melodies of Elliott Smith, but also manage to bring in a healthy, Byrdsian Rickenbacker sparkle that's allowed for some of Rilo Kiley's most earnest (if oft-overlooked) material. Despite the shamefully lame album art, Me First proves to be a remarkably consistent and memorable listen. Each of Sennett's songs overflows with fragments of hyper-specific details like dates and place names, which lends an uneasy and illusory intimate quality to the album. On the record's opener, ""7 September 2003"", the title signifies the date on which the conversation documented in the song takes place; later, the listener learns that it's also fifteen days before the narrator's birthday. This kind of unabashedly meta pandering, trademarked by the likes of Conor Oberst, usually only leads to solipsistic levels of melodrama, but the specificity of each number here seems to fuel Sennett's piercingly dry humor instead. On album highlight ""Greetings in Braille"" (on which Jenny Lewis makes a rather ambiguous guest appearance), Sennett coos such biting confessional bits of dialogue as, ""If you see me down at the liquor store, please don't tell my dad/ And if you see my dad down at the liquor store, please don't tell me anything at all."" Sennett is aided here by a rotating cast of indie rock royalty-- from producer Mike Mogis, who lends his characteristic production work, to Jimmy Tamborello's sonic flourishes, to guest vocalist Orenda Fink of Azure Ray, to fellow Sennett's Rilo Kiley cohorts Jenny Lewis and Jason Boesel. Fortunately, the restraint of each lends Me First an unexpectedly refined quality: Rather than announcing their presence with a grandiose flair, the artists are content to garnish these tracks with subtle nuances. ""A Time for Emily"" is an all-too-brief burst of horn-accented piano pop set to a minimal bossa nova beat and skittering drum programming, while the rousing denouement ""Don't Blow It"" sees Rhodes keyboard and mercurial synth melodies giving way to a Saddle Creek style singalong courtesy of The Mogis Choral Ensemble. It's revealing that a line addressed to Elliott Smith tops Sennett's thank-yous in this album's liner notes, but if Me First fails to quite live up to the promise of its influences, it still stands as a warm-hearted soundtrack to reminiscing on the kind of music with which you grew up.","Has any other label done more to fight the unwarranted stigma attached to the side project than Sub Pop?

Soundchambers,Ekkehard EhlersJoseph SuchyFranz Hautzinger,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0cea9e61561daa73a7/1:1/w_160/33b53a46.gif,2004-02-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2692-soundchambers/,Staubgold,"I still haven't warmed completely to the idea of laptop improvisation. The historical analogue to software-based music seems to be classical composition, where the graphic score was ultimately the piece. Computer music is bookish work toiled over during late nights in dingy bedrooms, and the heat of the moment can't even withstand the wispy breeze of the ventilator fan. I may never get used to the idea of ""jamming"" with a wireless mouse. Still, interesting stuff is happening. How much laptop improv is actually generated on the leading edge of ""now"" I may never know, but plenty of good records have been released as such. Soundchambers developed out of improvisation and one of three players, Ekkehard Ehlers, is on the 1s and 0s. Joseph Suchy joins him on guitar, and Franz Hautzinger is on trumpet. It's a diverse bunch. Ehlers has a strong sense of composition and a great ear for texture, he's also prolific as hell and seems to basically reinvent himself with each new project. Suchy may be the ultimate Cologne insider, the guy who knows everybody and has had a hand in at least one release by every label in Germany. He producers, mixes and masters, and plays guitar in an odd style without clear reference points. Franz Hautzinger is a university prof and regular on the European improv circuit. On Soundchambers, this crew of German abstractionists locks together to form a constantly shifting musical triangle. Each of these five tracks is continually in flux, as Ehlers switches between melodic plinks and subterranean noise (his sources are piano samples by Adam Butler [aka Vert] and recordings of boiler rooms), Suchy transmits his far-flung psychedelia, and Hautzinger adds an earthy moan. It's like watching an amoebic blob expanding and contracting on a glass slide. The first track (no titles) begins like a field recording, with Ehlers providing buzzes and chirps, and then develops into the kind of music that seems to sprout up from the ground. Ehlers' and Suchy lock together to form a thick, wet atmosphere and then the few held notes of Hautzinger's pitch-black trumpet sound like they should be bouncing through a shadowy valley somewhere. If Miles Davis' version of ""Concierto de Aranjuez"" really roused a great bullfighter back from retirement, Hautzinger's haunting tone would send him back under the covers until the nightmare is over. Another track starts with some clarion trumpet, gradually becomes consumed in machine racket, and then returns five minutes later for a wonderfully lyrical trumpet and guitar duet, where Hautzinger and Suchy team up like Jim Hall and Chet Baker beamed in through a wormhole. The pieces are constantly changing but each has a thematic center. For all its sputtering noises and relentless sense of movement, Soundchambers is surprisingly accessible. Perhaps because the sound so frequently veers from the familiar (backward guitar, piano, trumpet) to the foreign and back again, the album never fades into the background or becomes fatiguing. An excellent record that's loud like nature with enough structure to appeal to non-musicians.",,7.8,
The Grey Album,Danger Mouse,by: Rollie Pemberton,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb655e6ef95969322bde/1:1/w_160/5c64cfbe.gif,2004-02-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2540-the-grey-album/,self-released,"Remix albums rarely have purely noble intentions. From underground promotional vehicles to hobbyist experiments for props at local watering holes, the concept of backing familiar voices with unexpected surroundings had been all but lost to simpler production clinics with high profile guests. That is, until Danger Mouse (best known for his work with Jemini and Sage Francis) turned a color inference into an underground phenomenon with his bootleg conceptual assault, The Grey Album, a remix album that pairs the vocals of Jay-Z's Black Album with The Beatles' legendary White Album. By the most basic rules of the homemade remix, the record works: The vocals are on beat, pauses are natural, and the background always works thematically with the lyrics. In these more technical areas, the record effectively succeeds. But the most exciting part of any remix project is hearing whether or not the producer can save your least favorite songs, and this is clearly where DM shines. ""Moment of Clarity"" was the kind of awkwardly misplaced synthetic emotion expected from posthumous Tupac records. Here, however, it's a stomping guitar monster, with John Lennon's chopped vocals croaking like one of its victims. And while the original ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"" sounded like Timbo going through the motions (if he decided to morph into The Neptunes for a day), Danger Mouse's rendition is like Prefuse 73 meeting David Banner, arguing chops over handclaps and eventually finding middle ground through a second strangulation of Mr. Lennon. Of course, it isn't all so progressive. Similar to the fates of ""December 4th"" and ""Change Clothes"", ""What More Can I Say"" works on the tone it develops, but ultimately ends up too simple to hold attention. ""My 1st Song"" is enjoyable for the harsh drums that DM tracks and the closing statements that have Jay-Z doing the Charleston over ""Cry Baby Cry"". Of course, Shawn Carter's elastic speed-rap is near impossible to capture, as evidenced by the distracting guitar-crashing effect which closes off every few couplets. Most glaringly, no remix attempt is made on ""The Threat"", arguably Jay-Z's hardest performance on The Black Album, while ""Lucifer"" is sacrificed at the altar of conceptualism: DM simply inverts a couple Jigga vocals, chops up vocals and pianos, and inserts a bass riff and orchestral bits from ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Revolution 9"". Though DM's takes are obviously more rock-centric than the original Jay-Z tracks, they still manage to be undeniably in tune with the spirit of hip-hop. ""PSA"" is turned from a menacing spin on a Black Moon standard to woodland crunk with rings of Robin Hood flute, acoustic finger flicking and truncated outbursts from George Harrison. And ""99 Problems"" turns the obvious rock nod into a slightly more pronounced clinic in ""Helter Skelter"" headbanging, with panning walls of guitar sound and a chugging main riff that, in this context, reminds me of Kool Keith's ""I'm Destructive"". Danger Mouse was recently issued a cease-and-desist by EMI regarding this project's Beatle-sampling. While he insists the record was intended only as a promotional item, 3,000 copies are already in circulation, and one can't help but feel the loom of a forthcoming lawsuit. So the question now is, was the creative payoff of this project worth the possibilities of this potential worst-case-scenario? Well: While The Grey Album is truly one of the more interesting pirate mashups ever done, it ultimately fails at the hands of perfectionism with several pieces sounding rushed to beat some other knucklehead to his clever idea. Additionally, the missing songs and occasionally poor tracking means the project take a few hits. Still, it's stronger than it ought to be given the disparity between the two artists, and as far as raw experimentation goes, it further proves DM as a wildly imaginative producer. Even taken out of the context of listenability, The Grey Album will end up the trivia answer we'll always love to submit.","Remix albums rarely have purely noble intentions.

Aw C'mon / No You C'mon,Lambchop,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8ac0084474cd0c2af2/1:1/w_160/6878e68e.jpg,2004-02-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4660-aw-cmon-no-you-cmon/,Merge,"A frequent criticism of the double album is that it would have made a better single album. Which is often true: To maintain any kind of consistency over the course of two full discs is a difficult undertaking. But, as with so many other things, Lambchop, Nashville's finest genreless collective, have managed to turn this unspoken rule firmly on its head, by releasing two separate LPs that by all rights should be one double album. Aw C'mon and No You C'mon, released on the same day a la Tom Waits' Alice and Blood Money, each sprang from the same sessions and writing project, and don't differ from each other in any meaningful way-- in fact, they feel more complete together than they do apart. The story goes that Lambchop ringmaster Kurt Wagner challenged himself to write a song a day for several months, and then chose the cream of the crop for these records-- and a fine cream it is (although one does have to wonder how this strategy led to the inclusion of six instrumentals). It doesn't seem out of the question that Wagner may have chosen this simultaneous-double-release strategy simply for the fun of titling one in response to the other, and in an odd way, that naming convention works: No You C'mon feels like an escalation of the aesthetic of Aw C'mon, pushing just a little harder out of its creaky ballad box than its companion. Both records, however, feel like a logical progression away from the limited range of the band's last full-length, 2002's Is a Woman, an album whose icy, monotone piano balladry and spit-shine polish paled in comparison to the band's impressive back catalog of aggressively eclectic, wonderfully strange country/soul/noise/jazz/etc albums and EPs. Most of the tempos aren't much quicker this time around-- only the instrumentals break much of a rhythmic sweat-- but the arrangements are a lot more varied, and the huge, fourteen-piece band (that's not even counting the string section) feels more engaged as an ensemble. Aw C'mon works best when the sun is down, when the elaborately arranged strings and downbeat R&B; of songs like ""Nothing but a Blur from a Bullet Train"" and ""Steve McQueen"" have their best chance to slowly unfurl and fill in the quiet of the night. ""Women Help to Create the Kind of Men They Despise"" sounds like it was recorded after beer #9, beginning as a sickly lounge tune and spilling further into leftfield from there, ultimately arriving at a Zappa-worthy choral bit just before staggering to a close. ""I Haven't Heard a Word I've Said"" is a tangle of wobbly, wah-drenched guitar, Wagner's ragged vocals and some smatterings of piano and other barely noticeable instrumentation. No You C'mon initially promises to be the sunnier half of the pair, opening with the brisk instrumental ""Sunrise"", which, apart from a great string arrangement, also features a breathtaking pedal steel solo, one of the few appearances the instrument makes on either disc. But it's back into the guts of the nighttime from there, and the band goes much deeper into darkness this time around, flirting with their edgier days on a few of the ballads, and diving headlong into breakneck noiserock on ""Nothing Adventurous Please"". The guitars are muddy and abundant, spewing forth sheets of distortion to challenge Wagner's surprisingly snappy melody-- the song is actually reminiscent of some of Lambchop's earliest demos. Wagner sticks to his trademark mumble for the rest of the album, though, allowing the impassive guitars on ""Low Ambition"" and the swirling strings of ""There's Still Time"" to do most of the musical talking. An hour and a half after the first disc began, ""The Producer"" closes things with a rousing instrumental full of melodic piano, twangy guitars and breezy rhythms, essentially bringing things full circle, and it's clear that Lambchop have regained some of the form they once had. Certainly, they've rediscovered their broad range and proud, sleeve-worn strangeness, and it shows in subtle ways, from the Brazilian shuffle of ""The Gusher"" to the alternate universe country doo-wop of ""Shang a Dang Dang"". To say one of these albums is better than the other is basically beside the point-- anyone who buys one will certainly want the other, and both are fairly comparable as far as quality is concerned, anyway. There are better routes into this band's strange world-- namely Thriller, How I Quit Smoking, What Another Man Spills and Hank-- but Aw C'mon and No You C'mon are each worthy albums in their own right and deserve to be heard. Welcome back, Lambchop.","A frequent criticism of the double album is that it would have made a better single album. Which is often ...

In 2004, dubbing a band ""punk"" and walking away is, essentially, a completely meaningless exercise. There are a handful of constants-- hammering drums, loud guitars, shouting-- but the spiky essence of punk music is as vague as ever, having been long reduced to a series of cheap indicators (see black pleather jackets) and empty buzzwords. Challenger, a trio born from hardcore bouncers Milemarker, seem stubbornly preoccupied with recapturing the piss and stomp of late-80s punk torchbearers (The Minutemen, Black Flag, Hüsker Dü), and their debut, Give People What They Want in Lethal Doses, somehow ended up sounding just as hollow and unlikely as the idea of quasi-authentic nu-punk tearing up the new millennium-- and just as cynical as The Kinks record of the sorta-same name. The problem isn't that Challenger's players (Milemarker's Dave Laney and Al Burian alternating on guitar, bass, and vocals, with Timothy Remis on drums) aren't insanely energetic, or that they're not wholeheartedly selling their hot-footed power chords, it's that their entire founding principle seems so painfully, tediously borrowed; in sticking to that ever-nebulous true-punk formula, they've abandoned their only shot at capturing an original, non-nostalgia laced sound. Most of Give People What They Want is fairly textbook. Opener and highlight ""Input the Output"" pits teamed-up shouting matches against harrowing guitar solos and wildman drumming; ""Unemployment"" twists the same formula into a more dynamic shape, with Laney and Burian's throaty yelps bouncing off each other, vocal lines battling with guitar solos for total noise supremacy. Challenger seem confident in the weight of their assault (and rightfully so), but that comfort ultimately leads to monotony: Not too many of these tracks are especially discernable from each other. Which is fine, when you're just thrashing around your apartment in big boots-- but it's not so promising when you sit down to weigh the respective heft of Challenger's own brand of punk rock. Challenger may punch up their songs with some exhilarating vocal harmonies and unexpected structural shifts, but in the end, they never really transcend their own love/appreciation for their legendary influences-- a choice which prevents them from making a sizable dent in the ever-flexing history of punk.","It's always been kinda impossible to isolate the defining ethos of punk rock, but over the course of the ...

For (much) better, the French duo debuted Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem at the in-Cannes film festival Quinzaine des Realisateurs in May 2003. The duo had worked for two years on the film with Leiji Matsumoto, one of Japan's most celebrated manga and anime artists, and the result was an animated musical with Discovery as its score, which mixed ""science-fiction with the decadent world of show-business, limousines with spaceships."" It was finally released on DVD in December. Like Pink Floyd's The Wall, the music for Discovery and the storyline for Interstella 5555 were conceived simultaneously. The videos for ""One More Time"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", which had both seen a fair bit of MTV rotation around the time of the album's release, were not simply clever vignettes for the songs, nor was Discovery purely a film score-- in fact, Interstella 5555 makes clear the degree to which each influenced the shape of the other. Ultimately, Daft Punk intended Discovery to be heard in the context of Interstella 5555, and it's no wonder: Matsumoto's animation enlivens some of the less formidable tracks, and the details of scenes in Interstella 5555 often are inspired by the music itself. The project was an ambitious undertaking for both Daft Punk and Matsumoto, who were forced to communicate through a bilingual friend. For the uninformed, it's worth noting how enormous an accomplishment it was that Daft Punk were able to enlist Matsumoto. The 66 year-old, who was awarded the Japanese Cultural Award in 2001 for outstanding national contribution (Matsumoto is responsible for 25 years of film productions, including Galaxy Express 999, Arcadia, and Star Blazers, which, after Akira, are some of the country's most revered anime), legitimates Interstella 5555 as a serious anime film, replete with subtle intertextual references to other series and Matsumoto's own work. Each of Interstella 5555's character betrays the different styles of animation Matsumoto has taken up throughout his career, and Stella, the female guitarist and lead heroine, is practically a scarless Emeraldas. Scenes follow the sequence and corresponding moods of Discovery's original tracklist; the opening concert scene of ""One More Time"" boasts lush Jem-rock colors and, more interestingly, what seems to be Matsumoto's first bout with animating characters who speak English. The words themselves do not correspond perfectly to how they're mouthed, lending a certain vulnerability to the characters that stays with them throughout the musical. Matsumoto does not have any of the Crescendolls speak thereafter, and since the track sequencing has more or less been determined, the burden is on him to communicate the story entirely through his animation and its interaction with the music as it changes tenor. His facility reveals itself right away, as the band is kidnapped to the moody second track Aerodynamic, and perhaps most perfectly during ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", as the band is systematically dismantled, reprocessed, and spit out onto Earth as The Crescendolls. For the song, Matsumoto chooses to highlight the simple mechanics of the factory machines operating on the band, offering a formidable interpretation of the song's robotic lyrics and commercial implications. The record industry and its stereotypical abuse of the artist comprises the main topos of Interstella 5555, and indeed the main antagonist, Earl de Darkwood, is a perfectly stodgy, heartless profiteer who cares less about supporting music and artists than racking up enough gold album awards to-- so the plot goes-- conquer the entire universe. That said, it would be rash to accuse Daft Punk of biting the Virgin hand that feeds it, or to say that Interstella 5555 exists purely as a careful subversion of the record industry's supposedly shifty practices. If anything, the film is a sensational execution of a relevant stereotype; Daft Punk and Leiji Matsumoto are less concerned with making some cultural critique than they are with telling a story. How well Matsumoto is able to overcome the lack of dialogue is truly fascinating, as he instead relies on his ability to craft extremely nuanced body language for the characters. The Crescendolls' entire career on Earth happens without a smile; Stella is always on the verge of tears; when Darkwood forces Stella to shake the hand of a fan (she is reluctant, of course, since is being forced to make physical contact with an entirely alien species), the frame becomes still, and she stares at her own hand in utter despair. Countless moments find Matsumoto exhibiting levels of artistic consideration on par with some of his best work. Moreover, his delicate use of humor keeps the film from a tempting degree of melodrama that Matsumoto knows when to restrain and when to let loose. Put simply, Interstella 5555 is both fine anime and the ultimate context for its more-than-soundtrack Discovery. Taken as a whole, it's the fantastic culmination of years of artistic dedication.",,8.0,
Probot,Probot,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1719d034d5c69bf2971/1:1/w_160/bb2ccae6.jpg,2004-02-15 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6536-probot/,Southern Lord,"Ever wonder why metal has yet to take over the charts? Me either. For all its populist strains-- metal can be all things to all people; party music, headfuck therapy music, protest music, even background music-- this is a genre which simply isn't ""pop."" And that's no judgment against metal (or pop), just one of its most important characteristics. I didn't grow up listening to this stuff. I didn't really even have a good idea of what it was until junior high. I thought Mötley Crüe and Twisted Sister were metal. In some stupid way, they were-- at least to fourth graders in Denton, Texas-- but it wasn't until puberty that I realized there was a whole other world of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, King Diamond, Slayer and Napalm Death out there. And those were eye-opening experiences to say the least. ""What's wrong with these people?"" I thought, referring to my friends who listened to that stuff. What the hell was going on for them that wasn't going on for me? The answer: nothing at all, merely a matter of aesthetics. Metal is better than music. It can be a surrogate for every job you don't get, every girl who ignores you-- or it can just be the noise you put on when you're bored. Even as a fledgling college music student, I could find stuff on Reign in Blood to show my teachers and say, ""See, no matter what kind of stuff you tell me, I know there are guys doing it better, harder, faster."" Because of its power, metal fans tend to be diehard, as would I be had I discovered the next best thing to getting high and getting laid. I won't claim to be a metal expert, but ever since that awakening, it's always been music close to my heart in one way or another. No surprise, then, to see the last remaining Gen-X ""icon"" stick up for all that's right and hard in the world with Probot. Dave Grohl, possessing arguably the most successful post-Cultural Signpost career outside Wings and Bush, Jr., is hardly a hero of mine-- as Cheap Trick would-be's go, Foo Fighters lose out to Weezer by a long shot-- but I can't fault him for his principles. Rather than let his P2 battles with Jack Black suffice for keeping it real, he went out and made an album with a lot of the same metallic royalty who confused me so all those years ago. More than that, he made a decent record, one that might betray his lack of metal songwriting chops, but also his utter sincerity about playing this music for anyone within earshot. The story goes that Grohl got ex-Zwan/Chavez guitarist Matt Sweeney to help him track down a bunch of legendary vocalists to perform on a record featuring songs he wrote in a metal mood. The pair laid the tracks down, but an all-star cast supplied the rants, featuring the likes of Motörhead's Lemmy, King Diamond, Lee Dorrian (onetime Napalm Death and current Cathedral vocalist), Max Cavalera (Sepultura), Cronos (Venom), Mike Dean (Corrosion of Conformity), Snake (Voivod), Wino (of underrated Saint Vitus, and Obsessed), Kurt Brecht (DRI), Eric Wagner (Trouble), and Tom Warrior (of legendary Swiss band Celtic Frost). Metal fans awaited the outcome of this CD with baited breath, and many were skeptical. However, Grohl and company made good on at least one aspect of Probot: They translated a love of metal into a valid creative statement. A lot of it jams to high hell, too. The best idea Probot put forth on their self-titled debut (though I doubt we'll ever see another record by the ""band"") is the track sequencing; the four best songs are the first four. ""Centuries of Sin"" begins as Benedictine cathedral drone before exploding into D-tuned riff mayhem and Cronos' ragged description of a ""survivor, warrior prince, psychopath making difference."" Grohl drums with typically thrashy aggression, though I would argue he hasn't quite crossed over into the realm of great metal drumming yet. Still, Cronos completely sells this song, and I have no problems jamming it whenever the need for noise arises. Likewise, the incredible ""Red War"" and ""Access Babylon"", featuring Cavalera and Dean, respectively, fly by with the royal pound of the best hardcore-laced doom-metal. Cavalera's performance in particular should be given some kind of cameo-of-the-year award as it not only owns the song, but also almost single-handedly makes Grohl seem completely believable as a metal bandleader. Failing that, he gets points for his Motörhead-soundalike ""Shake Your Blood"" with Lemmy. The most disappointing aspect of Probot is that many of the songs sound more like Foo Fighters turned to eleven than actual metal. ""The Emerald Law"" (with Wino) not only could have been Foo product, but a hard-edged Nirvana B-side. It's not a bad song, per se, just a tad less intense than what preceded it. Likewise, the near-anthemic ""My Tortured Soul"", featuring Wagner, sounds like the best possible result of Grohl's traditional hard rock songwriting meeting up with a vocalist who isn't afraid to sing sans doubling effects. It also sounds a hell of a lot like Soundgarden, which shouldn't be surprising since Kim Thayil shows up later to play a guitar solo. And speaking of that, the King Diamond-fronted ""Sweet Dreams"" is probably the least interesting track on the CD, not so much because it seems to go on forever without ever really mustering up much grandeur (or better, any good riffs), but that KD sounds like he's doing a bad Billy Corgan impression most of the time instead of his trademark hyena wail. Probot will not go down in the annals of metal as a great band. As tributes go, the spirit is willing but the execution is a bit weak on about half the tracks. So even though you might approach this record with an open mind, something tells me the best tracks will be ripped for future mix fodder and the CD eventually left somewhere in the sell-back pile. Jack Black makes a hidden appearance at the end that should sum up everything you need to know about the band's ""authenticity"". But for once in metal, that really isn't the point. Probot gets by on unabashed hero-worship, raw enthusiasm and the lucky coincidence of having a few pretty damn fine tunes. And really, when you have the those, what else matters?","Ever wonder why metal has yet to take over the charts? Me either. For all its populist strains-- metal\n ...

The Best of K.M.D.,KMD,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2beb335119a49ecbd4/1:1/w_160/88fe0a27.jpg,2004-02-15 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4571-the-best-of-kmd/,Nature Sounds,"Repeat after me: MF Doom is not Zev Love X. Zev Love X is not MF Doom. Or so he would have had us believe for the last half-decade. Last year, hip-hop paragon MF Doom (aka Daniel Dumile) completely flipped his pancakes and released three albums under divergent personas: Take Me to Your Leader as King Geedorah, Vaudeville Villain as Viktor Vaughn, and another installment in his Special Herbs series as Metal Fingers himself. The move brought him his greatest success to date, and cemented his position at the forefront of underground hip-hop. Before the masked man terrorized the undieground with raspy rhymes and hallucinogenic beats, of course, he was Zev Love X, and he represented Five-Percenters and bouncy black power sophisticates with the underappreciated collective K.M.D. It wasn't meant to last: After just one album, his brother and bandmate DJ Subroc was struck by a car and killed, and the band's subsequent album was shelved by Elektra Records. Zev reappeared underground in 1997, after nearly five years in hibernation, and has since come correct with an array of records invoking and sampling everything from Stevie Wonder to 1950s monster movies. In anticipation of K.M.D.'s upcoming reunion, Nature Sounds has cobbled together this best-of collection featuring much of the trio's out-of-print material. Of course, the disc amounts to little more than a refresher course for the K.M.D.-impaired, considering the group only released two proper albums. The first, 1991's Mr. Hood was a sprightly bit of Sesame Street-sampling brilliance that built a narrative around the album's ignorant namesake; the second was mired in controversy for much of the last decade: 1993's Black Bastards, whose cover featured a Sambo-like cartoon character being lynched, was put on hold by Elektra, and didn't see official release until 2001 on the Sub Verse label. To this day, Doom believes Elektra's motives went beyond the cover art, noting the more aggressive nature of the album as a possible reason for postponement. So this compilation has been hashed together, somewhat lazily, in hopes of reigniting some interest for the nearly forgotten Long Island crew. Both album's best tracks are lifted and placed in chronological order, without any apparent rhyme or reason, save a few Busta Rhymes-featured remixes at the album's end. Even the liner notes are slapdash, with snapshots of scribbled notebooks scattered throughout. There are no credits or thank yous, just written-in chaos, which is apropos of K.M.D.'s sound, but unfortunate for a greatest hits compilation-- especially one whose subject's history is so notorious. The good news is that virtually every track is a standout, from the rolling piano bump of ""Humrush"" to the wildly original ""What a Nigga Know"". ""Nitty Gritty"", however, showcases hip-hop's Five Percent godfathers, Brand Nubian, and exemplifies how they were always better at this type of thing. Zev, Subroc and Onyx were capable and energetic MCs, but lacked the charisma and flow control of Sadat X or Grand Pu. Most of the beats here are self-produced, and the raw sound, while intentionally grimy, exposes less than up-to-date technology in the studio. Even now, MF Doom is prone to taping samples off his VCR. The more incendiary diatribes from Black Bastards are smarter and more focused. By shedding their animated jester-characters, the trio's rhymes punched through the paper-thin walls of alcoholism (""Sweet Premium Wine""), drug abuse (""Stop Smokin' That Shit"") and womanizing (""Plumskinz"") without succumbing to the pedantic or pretentious tendencies of some of their contemporaries. What's most appealing than this release, though, is that it provides the opportunity to hear a more helium-voiced Doom as a young and hungry MC, less deluded by death and drugs and more driven by racism and poverty. His evolution into a gruff rapper's rapper would have been hard to envision given some of his goofier appearances here. It should be interesting to see what the schizophrenic genius cooks up for K.M.D.'s forthcoming Mental Illness. Until then, this shoddily assembled set should tide you over.","Repeat after me: MF Doom is not Zev Love X. Zev Love X is not MF Doom. Or so he ...

Espers,Espers,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bceaea9e61561daa75bf/1:1/w_160/cf0caec4.jpg,2004-02-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2899-espers/,Locust,"Maybe it was when Nick Drake's ""Pink Moon"" inexplicably came beaming out of television sets far and wide selling Volkswagens, but there's been a disproportionate amount of interest lately surrounding the enigmatic canon of folk music from the late 60s and early 70s. As reverently packaged reissues from treasured shoulda-been folk legends like Karen Dalton, Jackson C. Frank, Dando Shaft, Linda Perhacs and established revivalist heroes such as Bert Jansch and Pentangle, Fred Neil, John Fahey, and Fairport Convention seemed to take up increasing amount of space in my CD changer, a slew of indie-bred legionnaires (Devendra Banhart, Iron & Wine, Animal Collective, Sufjan Stevens, Currituck Co, etc) seemed hard at work setting out to passionately revive the folk revival in their own wildly idiosyncratic ways. For anyone who's seen so much as the album insert for any of these treasured older records, it makes sense that the indie community would fall head over heels for the Folk aesthetic; Bert Jansch looks like Stephen Malkmus' more literal twin, while Fairport Convention, covered in all things involving facial hair, Converse and corduroy, bear an uncanny resemblance to the incestuous communal trappings of the indie-royalty of Elephant 6. The postmodern landscape successfully tread by the likes of the White Stripes, The Strokes, The Rapture, and (The) Ryan Adams has arguably put a price-tag on the bourgeois ""cleverness"" of miming critical approved ""tastes"" from lost eras; a renewed interest in folk music's reliance on song rather than sound seems only natural. Thankfully, Greg Weeks' steady stream of neo-folk records (culminating in 2001's landmark Awake Like Sleep and 2003's more esoteric, Slightly West) has been supplying listeners with a lush blend of psych-charged melancholia (a la Nico) and kaleidoscopic drones while always retaining beautifully baroque melodies as their focal point. However, it's his work with Espers, an expanding folk collective which also includes members Meg Baird and Brook Sietinsons, that accounts for some of his most accomplished work to date. While some of Weeks' past recordings seemed bogged down in his penchant for drone, on Espers, Meg Baird's breathy vocals and Brooke Sietinsons' embellishments of finger cymbals, chimes, and harmonica add substantial depth to the hum. The album's sublime opener, ""Flowery Noontide"", bares testament to this; the track is a fingerpicked acoustic pageant, where Baird's lilting alto floats atop a din of interweaving flutes and somber string lines, while the ominous ring of an autoharp and chimes channel Donovan at his best. On ""Meadow"", Weeks' understated vocals and eerie lyrical imagery of ""our willingness to die"" are made all the more striking by Meg Baird's contrasting lullaby-like harmonies. Espers is populated with enough folk garnishes to resurrect the recorder from out of its natural habitat in elementary school music classrooms, but the record's seamless melding of traditional elements with modern sonic touches and beautiful, close-mic'd production is what provides its unique flavor. The album's eight tracks are centered around an ominous, 8+ minute-long, minor-key psych-folk paean to darkness. The track begins with a tranquil call-and-response vocal suite between Weeks and Baird. At roughly the four-minute mark, a procession of acoustic guitar chords gives way to a blissful free-folk rampage of wailing, distortion-soaked bowed-guitars, Ornette Coleman-miming flutes, and scrambling hot acid leads. Meanwhile, on songs like ""Riding"" and ""Meadow"", the harmony-centric British folk form meets equally unpredictable treatments. Taking a cue from kindred avant-folk spirit Richard Youngs' later work, these numbers make space for portentous electro-trimmings like the crazed otherworldly drone of a tone generator and freeform electric guitar work. Indeed, with this album, Espers have brought to life a monument of understatement: an album which manages to embrace its influences while simultaneously eclipsing them.","Maybe it was when Nick Drake's ""Pink Moon"" inexplicably came beaming out of television sets far and wide selling ...

Modern,Ogurusu Norihide,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0fd13d1975652138512/1:1/w_160/ad1384af.jpg,2004-02-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5833-modern/,Carpark,"There is a place you probably go to escape the rest of the world. Maybe it's not even a physical location, but a state of mind that blocks out movement and noise everywhere. I guess it's a pretty noisy world, and isolation doesn't seem like such a lonely word when you're cornered by the frenzied and fucked up on all sides: Buddhists meditate, and from what I can tell-- my exposure limited to a haggard David Carradine roaming the Old West-- they seem like pretty levelheaded people. Transcendence: to rise above and beyond, and into a world of equilibrium where all is perfect, natural and without dissonance. Ahhh. But then again, without anything to brush up against, I'd probably explode into a boundless ball of mush. Especially in music, it seems friction and strife are absolute necessities to produce anything interesting. That doesn't mean there has to be crazy explosions going off all the time, but until the day comes when my spine can take no more celebratory flailing, there has to be a tension-release involved. Ogurusu Norihide, a Shinto priest and self-proclaimed ""laptop-folk"" musician, makes music with round edges, and without much of that tension to chew on. His music is pretty, in a way, but in general seems a tad on the static side to me, opting for continuous (some might say directionless), mellow resolve at the expense of something more viscerally engaging. Modern is Norihide's second release, on which he further develops his mildly computer-assisted acoustic mood music. It is also a rather stone-faced document in stark minimalism, with some tracks having much in common with contemporary avant-garde Japanese improvisers like Toshimaru Nakamura and Taku Sugimoto, who are working with an extreme idea of ""negative space""-- in other words, really, really quiet music. Norihide doesn't title any of the tracks on his CD, and that may further distance them from some folks. Personally, I'm just listening for something, anything, to grab hold of. The sixth track features very spare handclaps and single, fingerpicked guitar tones in what seems like a take on traditional Japanese court music. The suspension created by the guitar notes, and what seem like endless silences scattered everywhere within the piece, do lend a considerable tension to the music-- but after ten minutes, the tension loses its potency, and the end result may well conjure impatience rather than real interest. Likewise, track four features only soft sine tones, and while arguably the most relaxing track on the disc, isn't really the kind of thing I'd put on to chill out to. Again, he's superficially related to the onkyo (experimental Japanese electronic improv) scene, but tends to either emphasize an almost transparent mix of sounds, or run very sparse ideas too long. I wonder if Norihide might not sound better as a straight acoustic folk performer, without the aid of his gear. Track seven is a gorgeous ballad featuring only two guitars, and extremely minimal effects. The vibe is delicate but not passive; the melodies are sweet and it captures a mood similar to Richard Youngs' non-psych-out folk music (and Norihide seems a lot more Jagjaguwar than Carpark to me, in general). Maybe that means I like Modern best when it isn't, when the music seems less an awkward electronic fusion and more a simple, perfect meditation.","There is a place you probably go to escape the rest of the world.

Panda Park,90 Day Men,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40aeb335119a49ed85e/1:1/w_160/fad4af23.jpg,2004-02-12 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5808-panda-park/,Southern,"In ninth grade, I brought some tapes to my school band teacher. It was stuff my then-band had been working on in my scant, single-mic'd bedroom. We weren't a bedroom pop outfit by any stretch; back then we played dour, emotionally apoplexed emocore. And what we played weren't quite songs, per se: There were chords, and some faint attempts at melodies, but that was about all you could make out underneath the tumescent basslines and audible flying shards of metal from my cymbal crashes. Still, Mr. Rotello put his blistered ear to speaker and carefully considered our laughable concoctions. When it was over, he declared, ""I think you guys need a piano."" I like to kid myself and think that if we'd taken his advice, stayed together, and learned to play our instruments, like, really well, we might today sound akin to 90 Day Men, whose piano-driven compositions resonate with Biblical intensity. The fact is, no one does: 90 Day Men are one of the most original bands underground, and their instrumental competency offers something for high school freshman everywhere to admire. The band has been labeled everything from prog rock to ""hardcore pop,"" but so far no one's been able to pigeonhole their sound successfully-- and actually, I think it would be doing the band a disservice to shoo them into any genre or subgenre just yet. Panda Park, the band's third full-length release in four years, updates a sound that was already intriguing and distinctive on To Everybody and the pompously titled (It (Is) It) Critical Band. By now, the Men have earned the right to sound as pretentious as they did on their debut album, but opt instead for a more honed approach. At a modest 32 minutes, Panda Park is like a French dinner: a tight package of intensely rich compositions, best taken one forkful at a time, accompanied by a gracious interlude to help cleanse the palette and, of course, a decadent finale. But where the band's earlier material was dreary to a point of being downright oppressive, Panda Park utilizes lighter textures to help brighten the milieu. ""Chronological Disorder"" and ""When Your Luck Runs Out"" contain sufficient helpings of electronic sugar, making the songs blithely enjoyable, and at times even a bit (gasp!) uplifting. A naive conception commonly held is that instrumental skill must always upend a song's integrity by superseding everything that makes music meaningful to us. 90 Day Men seem as if they're on a mission to erase that fallacy. But before calling compositionally intricate songs such as ""Even Time Ghost Can't Stop Wagner"" prog-rock, be aware of the implications. These guys aren't Queensryche: every 32nd note and oddly syncopated melody feels meaningful and integral to the overall piece. As for the piano, its presence fits right in to the clamorous mix. Like Menomena on last year's I Am the Fun Blame Monster, 90 Day Men gracefully interweave high-volume electronics and acoustic elements. Andy Lansangan's listful keyboard and piano parts often serve as the driving melodic element. In the grandiose chorus of ""Chronological Disorder"", an ideal side-one closer, he and Case team up for their best ""November Rain"" impersonation-- which actually isn't such a bad thing: Like all the bold ideas on Panda Park, the move is pulled off tastefully and with just the right restraint. Case's arena rock caterwauling is reserved for a few well-placed choruses, which is symbolic of the huge strides 90 Day Men have made with this album. The band have finally mastered the monstrous proportions of their diffuse talents and arranged them in ways that are wholly satisfying and distinctly unique.","In ninth grade, I brought some tapes to my school band teacher.

Split EP,!!!Out Hud,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70913d1975652139304/1:1/w_160/a8a2c599.gif,2004-02-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1765-split-ep/,GSLGSL,"Everything starts somewhere. Disco started as Miami club music; green started as blue and yellow; Out Hud started out as a band of hardcore kids. Though it's tempting to romanticize those early days, before everything got big and complicated, they're very often best left to good memories and the comfortable buffer of time. Partially because everyone grows up and out of their various inspirations, and because we're prone to learning from our mistakes, beginnings seem at once thrilling, disastrous and raw. In the some cases, inspiration carries us through rough spots, but usually, the best stuff pours out when we realize what the hell is going on and can do something about it. But then, there's also much to be said for ignorance, bliss and beginner's luck. Out Hud and !!! began as two Sacramento-based bands having backgrounds in hardcore punk but also interested in experimenting with their own weird, white funk. The two shared members (Tyler Pope and vocalist Nik Offer), so it's no surprise they should begin and hit their strides at approximately the same times. In 2003, each were recipients of praise transcending the usual trendy underground lauding that goes on every year for relatively unknown bands; even when ""dancepunk"" was supposed to be taking the indie nation by storm, Out Hud and !!! presented music heard and loved by all manner of folks otherwise unimpressed by hipster cred. The bands had released music long before they relocated from Cali to NYC and before this whole angular dance craze was supposed to have begun, but were probably surprises to most of their fans over the past couple of years. In 1998, Out Hud and !!! released a split single on Gold Standard Labs (GSL), and the following year, they released a split 12-inch EP containing the single and remixes. And, as is so often the case, their beginnings reveal slightly larval forms of what garnered them attention in later years. Chiefly, the music on the CD reissue of this split EP is of modest-fidelity, inspired and amateurish in the way every new idea is amateurish. And yes, it most certainly predicts a day when punks will trade their apathy for j's, and lead sweaty crowds through all-night grinding sessions. If the music isn't as accomplished as it is on later releases like Me and Giuliani or S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D., it's hardly without its charms. !!!'s ""Instinct"" is a lengthy punk-funk stomp, and the better of the record's two original sides. It begins with slashed, chicken-scratched guitar. Soon afterwards skittish disco drums and a funky dub line enter, sending no mixed signals about exactly what the agenda is here. Offer's breathy mutterings act more as rhythmic color than melodic device, and when the horns come in on the next verse, the band works up an impressive swirl of near-feverish skank-beat and phased trance. ""Instinct"" isn't anywhere near the ""pop"" song that ""Giuliani"" was, but nor is it unsuitable for a party. Dare I say: it ""jams"" in places. Out Hud's three pieces (titled ""jgne"", ""jgdg"", and ""jgxtc"") sound more the work of a ""project"" than a band, and also sound like they began life as adventures on four-track. The first begins with the mini-pound of a Casio disco preset, and features more funk rhythm guitar given the quick-delay treatment just like all the old punks used to do after they'd heard dub in the late 70s. In a way, Out Hud's songs are actually more reminiscent of the first wave of dancepunks than !!!'s, but their execution is also a lot more ragged here. ""jgdg"" is a variation on the same groove, featuring Molly Schinct's cello and a little abrasive guitar skronk and feedback to offset the ambience, while ""jgxtc"" is almost a purely rhythmic exercise in drum machine chaos. So, as beginnings go, this split EP is nice and not terribly ambitious, but there are sparks here, and fans should enjoy the history lesson.",,6.0,
Ten,cLOUDDEAD,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6055e6ef95969320c33/1:1/w_160/0cf3560a.jpg,2004-02-12 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1518-ten/,Mush,"cLOUDDEAD's debut was an unassuming record, if you overlook how many people it confused or annoyed. It was the breakthrough success for the three artists who spearheaded it, but it built on a series of low-budget and bedroom projects-- like rappers Why? and Doseone's Greenthink project, Dose's murmuring Slowdeath, or producer and DJ Odd Nosdam's Plan 9: Meat Your Hypnotist-- where obtuse verses spilled out like ripped-up paper scraps over hazy, droning vinyl, overheard conversations or snippets from TV, on CDs that were fragmented into at least forty tracks apiece. The cLOUDDEAD project extended those methods; sharp humor and surreal images leavened the album's odd shapelessness, and the band even managed to eke out a few cogent concert pieces for their tour. But the way they stitched the record together was even more interesting: The songs run together at the drop of an attention span, and the band combined them as intuitively as a found sound artist creating order out of tossed-off materials. It had an unfinished feel fed by the two years that they worked on it, at dorms and parents' houses, and even through their relocation from Cincinnati to the Bay Area. It was an album about a process, not an outcome. The cLOUDDEAD record hit, as much as records like that ever do, and the Anticon collective-- of which Why?, Doseone and Odd Nosdam are founding members-- made waves beyond the underground hip-hop community with which it feuded. (And to be clear once again, the group never claimed this project was ""hip-hop,"" although the controversy from purists has done nothing but make people think harder about their work.) So as they finally release their follow-up, Ten, we know more about the artists, and they've grown more into their styles. You can identify the two frontmen at the start of ""Pop Song"": Why?'s the one gently singing, ""Elvis, what happened?"" while Dose chants, ""The wooden man and his splintering self."" Why?'s excellent Oaklandazulasylum revealed a rap-based artist who wants to write songs and strum a guitar, making him one of very few artists trying to cross over from hip-hop to indie rock. Doseone has worked with producer Jel under the name Themselves, and he also came into his own as a performer on his album with Circle, where partner Boom Bip's production challenged the sometimes self-absorbed intricacies of his lyrics. Completing the trio is Odd Nosdam, who produced half the tracks (Why? handled the rest) and played electronic drums. Nosdam demonstrates his deft taste in ambient vinyl and oompah beats, with a couple kitschy samples mixed in; on his tracks, the most static sounds can buzz and excite-- like the smoggy ""Rifle Eyes"", where the crackling noise seems to come from something more sinister than just old vinyl. Ten is half as long as the band's debut and much more focused; each performer shows improved range and sharper talents. And yet, it's still a mixed bag. If several of the songs are fantastic, the album is more stilted and less intriguing. Take the lyrics, which are so refined that they sometimes become too arch to flow, like they've been pinned down in a display case. The precise and verb-free imagery works on ""Dead Dogs Two"" or ""Rifle Eyes""-- for example, Why? declaiming, ""A single long-stemmed rose resting between two mounted antlers""-- but it gets distracting on other songs, especially for Doseone, who chops his inimitable flow into pieces; ""The Velvet Ant"" runs more like a set of mantras than a song. cLOUDDEAD have also never been strong with lyrics that have literal meaning, and Ten's themes about the gun industry or the music business lose power when they become too clear: take the list of predictable victims of gun violence on ""Son of a Gun"". (Though any lyric that puts Malcolm X and Mahatma Gandhi and Tupac and Biggie in the same list has a certain sly appeal.) By contrast, the gory, context-free imagery of ""Dead Dogs Two"" is sublime. The production on Ten is strong, although you can tell that cLOUDDEAD is more a special project than a working band when the heavier tracks rub almost disconcertingly against jerky and whimsical ones. ""The Teen Keen Skip"" starts with a sample of that new cliché, a children's record, but it gets better from there: the young boy in the sample is cut off at a ""Whu-- "" that's repeated in a loop. (They also throw in a solo on power drill.) The moodier half is also effective, and if the instrumental ""3 Twenty"" comes off too blank-faced, ""Rifle Eyes"" is deeply ominous, sharpening the rapid-fire lyrics even as it swells and moans like a slow-motion sideswiping. But it's telling that where cLOUDDEAD's debut worked like a collage, the strongest moments on Ten involve a sustain: sustained organ tones, long throbbing noises, stretches where the words trail off. The best moments are the surest, when the three performers come into perfect alignment, like on ""Dead Dogs Two"", where Why? and Dose float over the whomping beats and swap the mike to the point of alternating by the word. The record even ends with a long, electric drone, as if their ideas have crunched together and the differences in their styles have dissolved. But it also paves over the free flow of ideas that made their last work so absorbing, and so experimental. Unquestionably, cLOUDDEAD have arrived. But next time, we might want to spend more time watching them get there.","cLOUDDEAD's debut was an unassuming record, if you overlook how many people it confused or annoyed. It was\n ...

America's Sweetheart,Courtney Love,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7babf31b7dc7155f67/1:1/w_160/73b597b3.jpg,2004-02-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4889-americas-sweetheart/,Virgin,"Contrary to reigning rock crit wisdom, gunning for Courtney Love to fail is not all that fun. America's Sweetheart could have been stupendous: check Courtney charging out of a Hollywood compound, flaming guitar slung low around a bare neck, shoulders suddenly and miraculously freed from the impossible weight of addiction and trauma, stuffing her solo debut in the mouths of her most vocal detractors and proving relevance against all odds. It could have been perfectly majestic, glorious, stupefying. Instead, America's Sweetheart is exactly what you thought it would be: collapsible, frantic and depressingly repulsive. Most music fans are curiously well-acquainted with Courtney Love's battle scars, and capable of name-checking the formative circumstances for each dull, yellowing bruise. Half the post-Kurt barbs lodged at her were either painfully sexist, dumbfoundingly naive, or both-- and while it's easy to argue that Love wholeheartedly encouraged her own pigeonholing, the resulting avalanche of whore/addict punchlines also completely fucked up her chances at having her records judged on their artistic merits alone. No matter whom you end up blaming for it (see Love's grievous, unapologetic attention-grubbing, or a press historically perplexed by women with guitars), Love's sloppy public persona has long superceded her music. Ultimately, this kind of filter is as boring as it is superfluous: arguing over whether or not Love's empowerment-heavy punk posturing was compromised by a team of plastic surgeons and Versace-fitters is interesting only as it relates to her lyrical agenda; bickering about the songwriting credits on Hole records (Kurt Cobain? Billy Corgan? Michael Stipe?) is relevant only in terms of how you finally decide to judge the respective heft of a collaborative effort. Because in the end, journalists and fans have always been more than happy to swallow the goofy, satisfying sleaze of hair metal bands and poorly-aging cockrockers, but a drug-addled, sexually aggressive woman still grosses everybody out. And while including a discussion of Courtney's personal life in a conversation about her music may have become unfortunately inevitable, it's also totally unnecessary. America's Sweetheart comes complete with enough unforgivable flaws to nobly arm anyone even remotely interested in a vicious attack. It's finally safe to ignore Courtney's ridiculous magazine antics; this record is a far more embarrassing and desperate spectacle than shedding an overpriced shirt for a British photographer or bickering with Dave Grohl. At its best, America's Sweetheart sounds helplessly marred, as if it's been completely and preemptively exhausted by several named (""an eight ball isn't love"") and unnamed sources. Being that Love is often an overtly confessional (verging on solipsistic) songwriter, the sludge of her recreational activities comes to bear pretty heavily on her songs, both lyrically and vocally. Love's once-powerful pipes have been scratched raw, the low, rumbly growls of yesteryear giving way to a thin, disembodied screech. No matter how many filters her yelps are re-routed through, or how blushingly blatant her lyrics remain, Love's new anti-range is incapable of conveying any of the clenched-fist fury her fans have come to expect. Sometimes Love sounds harried and overwhelming, nuance-free and overstretched (""All the Drugs""); other times, her voice is so heavily treated that it becomes essentially unrecognizable (see the anonymous sing-sounds of ""Sunset Strip""). Opener and lead single ""Mono"" is prefaced by a series of ""Hey!"" screams that sound so unpleasantly inhuman (they resurface before the otherwise non-specific Strokes-homage ""But Julian, I'm a Little Bit Older Than You"") that it's hard not to bend your ears away from your speakers in knee-jerk self-defense. While it's unfair to directly compare Courtney's solo work with Hole's shifty discography, America's Sweetheart demonstrates a fairly monstrous decline in both quality and conviction. The record is caked in thick, indiscriminate guitar goo and peppered with quasi-confrontational lyrics (""I got pills for my coochie/ Coz baby I'm sore""), but it ultimately fails to recapture the convincingly bratty swagger of Love's tipsy past, while retaining all the dated grunge crunch. No matter how many times she hollers gabba gabba hey, America's Sweetheart is still insanely one-dimensional and oddly anti-punk (see also the ""find legal downloads... save the music!"" dogma of the liner notes). Half the tracks are imminently forgettable (especially the early-90s buzz of ""Uncool"", ""I'll Do Anything"" and ""Life Without God""), while the others either grate (""Zeplin Song"") or seem vaguely desperate in their grasps at relevance (two mentions of Eminem?). Having exhausted either the patience or the songwriting skills of her contemporaries, Love opted to mine the resources of generations below and beyond, enlisting Elton John lyricist Bernie Taupin and Xtina/Pink hitmaker Linda Perry (credited as a co-writer on nine of the record's twelve tracks) to act as collaborators. What's weird is that their presence is almost impossible to note-- some of these tracks take half-hearted swipes at pop palatability (""Never Gonna Be the Same""), but very few come close to achieving any kind of accessibility. Ultimately, the title of America's Sweetheart isn't just cute, it's caustic. Courtney Love is only now coming to terms with the hyper-reality of being Courtney Love: drug-addicted, flailing artists are rightly tragic, but America still, for assorted reasons, finds Love annoying. America's Sweetheart is both a response to and a reflection of that collective distaste, inadvertently perpetuating Courtney-mythology while simultaneously half-smirking at it. In the end, it's the partially cooked anger here that's most compelling: In the future, Love's tragic flaws may be her only shot at redemption.","Contrary to reigning rock crit wisdom, gunning for Courtney Love to fail is not all that fun.

Nilsson Schmilsson,Harry Nilsson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9625e6ef95969322951/1:1/w_160/ac9e5f54.gif,2004-02-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5887-nilsson-schmilsson/,RCARCA,"Dear Diary: Wake up, slightly dazed and out of it, and just like every other morning for the last eight months of unemployment, it begins the same way. Tie on the robe, fumble for the coffee mug, the ketchup-y Bloody Mary, and the initial pipe pull, and clumsily drop the needle onto the crackly, burnt first side of the record that remains glued on my turntable, waiting for those same ""Chopsticks""-esque piano notes that bang singer Harry Nilsson out of his slumber for ""Gotta Get Up"", the opening song on 1971's Schmilsson. He's still in his robe too, out of focus, unshaven, a hash pipe in his fingers. Harry wakes up, weary, but rouses quickly, showers, resigned to being late for the day's meetings. He's already mourning the salad days and wasted nights slowly slipping away to the high-fiber diet and working late. As the music hall accordion and tuba breathe in the evening's hiccupy bubbles and the bass bumps along with lines about a sailor's conjugal visits, we're back in the swing times of the early 70s, where the 60s' residual good times hid, trying to stay high and jovial even as the highs got slightly more complicated and expensive. Long considered the ""American Beatle"" by The Beatles themselves (and John Lennon's drinking buddy during his year-long ""Lost Weekend""), Harry Nilsson originally reflected them in his quirky, knowledgeable pop (and was a rumored Paul McCartney replacement) before scoring a Grammy for his delirious version of folkie Fred Neil's ""Everybody's Talking"" that loped throughout Midnight Cowboy. As the clime of pop hardened into rock, and groups like The Beatles dissolved, Nilsson teamed up with producer Richard Perry to bolster both of their careers. Moving the party over to London, and drawing on a pool of players that would have hands on rock landmarks of the era like All Things Must Pass, Layla and Assorted Love Songs, Tumbleweed Connection, Sticky Fingers, Plastic Ono Band, and Transformer, Nilsson's rock record Schmilsson is easily the most loveable scamp of the bunch. Its success was the watershed (and all the subsequent washing out that word implies) of his career. As spins run into the thousands for me now, new little sonorities appear in the song craft. I'll always love the way he paved over the sub-Lennon scream of Badfinger's chorus on ""Without You"", beyond the simplistic resignation of the original and into a cathartic, climactic release. (The Spanish version included ""Si No Estas Tu"" as a bonus track-- the song's more Romantic lingua showcases the true force of Nilsson's operatic reading as he tremors and holds the notes.) The pounding, detuned-bass rocker ""Jump into the Fire"" and the similarly belted and horn-blasted ""Down"" define Nilsson's harder take on this particular album (the former could still burn up dancefloors), although his stab at the golden oldie ""Let the Good Times Roll"" humorously weaves about, drunk on its own Bacchanalian clank of keys. My new favorites took awhile to come to the fore. One is the incredibly human-- if somewhat George Harrison-esque-- commuter meditation on ""Driving Along"". ""The Moonbeam Song"" is succinctly perfect, with a visual aesthetic worthy of Taoist poets: moonbeams light on train tracks, windowpanes, weather vanes, and the eye of the beholder himself. Its sweetest line is about ""a fence with bits of crap along its bottom, blown by a windbeam,"" and as Herbie Flowers' bass slides between the luminescent clouds of mellotron, Harry catches all of the Beach Boys in his Brandy Alexander'd croon. Closer ""I'll Never Leave"" is sumptuous and bittersweet: a farewell to Harry Nilsson's baroque pop past with producer George Tipton. Over an aching vocal performance, Tipton swaddles Nilsson all in bells, oboes, glockenspiels, blurted brass, pizzicato'd violins, and xylophones, bidding an elongated adieu to pop's previously ornate design. Tipton also provides the orchestration for the added demo of ""Gotta Get Up"", a shiny remainder of baroque tendencies that has our man keeping the song at a bubblegum level, sidestepping the album's more ""blue"" themes. The soap opera twinkling of the demo version of ""The Moonbeam Song"" reveals its beauty from the start. Weirdest of the bunch is the throwaway, ""Lamaze"". Banged out on piano and with a grandiose burst of Franco-babble about contractions and moving the left and right leg, Nilsson's joker smile flashes for an instant, a goofy, eclectic streak that riddled other parts of his catalog, like the follow-up, Son of Schmilsson. Aiming for the heart and the top of the pops, though, Nilsson's Schmilsson, in its shuffling, slightly askew, and idiosyncratic way, hit it all perfectly, and this ridiculously overdue reissue still makes my day.",,9.4,
Sun Lights Down on the Fence,Stars Like Fleas,by: Sam Ubl,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65213d1975652139167/1:1/w_160/6b5146bb.gif,2004-02-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7733-sun-lights-down-on-the-fence/,Prae,"The post-rock collective is the hippie commune of the 21st century. ""Peace, love, and empathy"" has been replaced by ""more peace, more love, and ornate orchestral pop music."" Lately, here in the northeast, where it's been too cold to safely eat, sleep and write about music, I've felt glad to be a fan of these groups and not a member. Few things could deter me from producing transcendent avant-garde opuses; living in a farmhouse with no heat during subzero nights is one of them. Luckily, there are those who brave it, like New York-based conglomerate Stars Like Fleas, whose 21 members lurked stealthily under the indie radar in 2003. I first heard Sun Lights Down on the Fence after an accident involving week-old pot roast gravy, in which I ruined a pair of suede shoes and what had been a perfectly good night at the theater. After scrubbing my kitchen floor and all the cabinets that had been splattered, I was too worked up to sleep, so I retreated into my headphones and tried to ignore the lingering odor. The smell of gravy took two days to lift, by which time I had thoroughly examined the wily 70-minute landscape of Sun Lights Down on the Fence. Unfortunately, my relationship with this engaging and relentlessly subtle album will be forever marred by an association with putrid pan juices, but it speaks to the band's merit that I was still able to derive such pleasure from it under those circumstances. Aside from sporting a member for every A.D. century, the Stars Like Fleas lineup is duly impressive for its jaw-dropping genealogy: Sun Lights Down on the Fence received contributions from bands as diverse as Out Hud, Mercury Rev, Papa M, No-Neck Blues Band, and At the Drive-In, to name just a few. The group was founded in 1998 by Austin music-scene veterans Shannon Fields (producer and multi-instrumentalist) and vocalist Montgomery Knott (who formerly collaborated with Stars of the Lid). 2000's Took the Ass for a Drive saw New York-only release on the now-defunct Shimmy-Disc and is currently unavailable. Sun Lights Down on the Fence is the fruit of two years' labor, and a ruthless attention to detail is apparent throughout. Many of the songs saunter by, content to linger in a particularly comfortable spot for minutes at a time. ""On a Generous Day"", the album's generously sized centerpiece, evokes Talk Talk in its slow evolution and subtle movements. Montgomery Knott's vocal delivery borrows directly from Mark Hollis, but his arrangements are much busier: Where Hollis placed curt crescendos and one-liners sporadically and perfectly throughout his songs, Knott drags a lazy legato out for minutes at a time. His vocal sheets are seemingly interminable and often mar otherwise pristine instrumental passages, sometimes plummeting into defenseless gratuity. Over the staggering denouement of ""On a Generous Day"", he sings, ""Bending over you lightly/ Hard on/ In your ass."" The song is a pained lament to a lost sexual relationship, but the words sully what is conveyed beautifully and articulately through the music alone. Luckily, Knott's voice serves just fine as textural element, often blending delicately into the instrumental mix. The Dust Bowl melodies are scarce and fragile. Flutes, saxophones, clarinets, trumpets and bassoons share the spotlight and take frequent solos that, like the vocals, often ramble aimlessly. Songs occasionally break out into well-placed free jazz trances, which offer welcome relief from the sometimes cloying vocals. The album avoids the cheese-factor inherent in most electro-free jazz these days, which is typically performed by indie musicians who are, by nature, awkward and soulless. Some of the more amorphous sections are among the album's best moments. Sun Lights Down on the Fence's most impressive quality is its balancing of carefully arranged electronic sounds with improvisational acoustic performances. As on The Books' stunning The Lemon of Pink, there are two types of virtuosity present: sonic manipulation and instrumental prowess. Songs dive through wormholes of thought without inhibition, but pass through intact and neatly polished. The improvised sections are tasteful and restrained, and at times feel quite intentional: Songs such as ""Isabel of Lilac"" and ""Third Night, Wisconsin"" are precognitive glimpses into the workings of the subconscious mind. Fields and Knott take the immensity of musicians and concentrate their disparate ideas into one intimate and wonderfully realized statement. It's hard to tell whether this record is the cerebral read-out of its entire populous lineup, or of two very complex minds, but the finished result is intimate and utterly beautiful.","The post-rock collective is the hippie commune of the 21st century.

What the... You Mean I Can't Sing?,Melvin Van Peebles,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98fea9e61561daa5a62/1:1/w_160/d77cb6fb.jpg,2004-02-11 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8521-what-the-you-mean-i-cant-sing/,AtlanticAtlantic,"Better known as the auteur that birthed the poorly monikered ""blaxploitation"" genre with his groundbreaking 1971 film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, Melvin Van Peebles also made contributions to literature with La Permission, Broadway with his score for Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death, and theatre with his own Don't Play Us Cheap. So, when not starring in and producing independent features, painting, writing plays and books about trading futures, or else making a soundtrack with some unknown band known as Earth, Wind & Fire, he was concurrently cutting proto-rap tracks along the lines of Gil Scott-Heron and The Last Poets and releasing LPs on A&M; and Stax. Originally issued by Atlantic Records in 1974, Van Peebles' third album takes truth in advertising to its excruciating extreme, as he really can't sing on any of these eight songs. Wince as his warble rafts out from the manholes like tone-deaf Dr. John gris smoke or Ol' Dirty Bastard's hustler uncle, and realize its potency: forcing poetry through like Leonard Cohen with Thunderbird breath, Melvin's intent clench of voice stinks like cigar smoke, obnoxious and burning on tracks like ""A Birth Certificate Ain't Nothing but a Death Warrant Anyway"" as hookers chirp back from across 110th Street that you got to ""get it, get it."" And yet, the world-weary breath of Van Peebles also knows the hard-earned truth, enough to croak to you from across ""So Many Bars"" that: ""Between a woman's breast is the thickest thorns you can ever lay your head on."" Is it worth wading through the viscous chocolate pudding that he drools like Bill Cosby? When he's coughing up razor blade lines like, ""If the Lord's eye is on the sparrow, what's wrong with Big Brother watching you?"" while telethon femme robots coo ""Save the Watergate 500,"" the answer is yes. As he steps out of the time of Nixon and into the fog of war (and misinformation) to deliver a verse like: ""Sure we lost a couple of soldiers and they raised a tax or two/ Yeah, maybe there was a promise broken and that law and order rallying call don't seem as shiny as it used to/ But come on and rally round the flag, y'all,"" it's plain that it takes the ugliest of voices and darkest of humors to survive and render the horror of truth, either personal or political. Not quite the iconoclast in the recorded medium, though, the arrangements by Harold Wheeler draw too heavily upon the standard production sound of the day. Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"" gets recast with a Richard Pryor ""Wino vs. Junkie"" opening bit, twinkling steel drums, and overwrought female choruses. But it all comes together on the sappy, stringy, cloyingly sweet tale, ""Eyes on the Rabbit"", which utilizes Melvin's syrupy Elmer Fudd baritone to greatest effect: Melvin realizes he misses his old girlfriend, a preschool teacher, as he humbly cuts out paper rabbits and glues on the eyes. Leave it to the actor/writer/director to nail the cheesy sentiment in such as a way as to make you misty-eyed.","Better known as the auteur that birthed the poorly monikered ""blaxploitation"" genre with his groundbreaking 1971 film Sweet Sweetback's ...

"Wine, Women and Wolves",Dead Raven Choir,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb65c0084474cd0c284a/1:1/w_160/f951d63f.gif,2004-02-11 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2539-wine-women-and-wolves/,Last Visible Dog,"Obsessed with wolves and the latent terror lurking behind silences, Dead Raven Choir honorably represent the raw black metal wing of San Francisco's Jewelled Antler Collective. Eking out an acoustic Melvins dust-storm force-fed Metal Machine Music, Smolken, a Polish exile named for the grave digger in Corman's The Undead, inhabits the wilds of Texas, masterminding miasmatic atmospherics that initiate buried-alive claustrophobia as well as the beauty of a backlit spider-web. Accompanied here by Birdtree/Thuja/Blithe Sons favorite son Glenn Donaldson on splintered acoustic guitar and sundry stringed things, our dark-blooded hero whispers and rages from Rilke and A.A. Milne to Baudelaire and Hilaire Belloc and back. More Paris Spleen than Pooh Corner, when Smolken steps to the mic (which I imagine dangling just-so from a cragged tree branch), he conjures the lonesomest strains of folk, cabaret, and sung poetry. His treatment of the poems can be mesmerizing. In some cases, accents are placed at odd or unforeseen moments, while others are read audio-book straight. His dusky rendition of Rainer Maria Rilke's ""The Kings of the World are Growing Old"", for example, follows the original text word-for-word, albeit with a strange, lupine hiss in the background. Others are twisted around with brambles (unless he's using cut-up translations I haven't located). ""Beacons ~ Rubens, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Michaelangelo, Puget, Watteau, Delacroix"" offers an elliptical take on the last three stanzas of Baudelaire's ""Beacons"". Smolken doubles his voice, initiating his own call-and-response between clipped fanaticism and drawn-out, dry throated whispers. His high-flung subject: ""These, Oh Lord, are the benedictions. The tears, the ecstasies, the blasphemies, the cries of 'Te Deum.'"" With Smolken going off in the forefront, Donaldson's left to his own devices. And though it isn't clear who plays what, the array of sounds are subtle and wonderfully textured. There's an upright bass, I think, as well mandolin, banjo, bells and percussion. Structurally, choruses are avoided and besides the acoustic punctuation marks that jump from nowhere, there are zero build-ups: the endless skies above a plain, wisps of pale that hover inches above a cedar lake. It's all beautifully codified: One might have more background than another and perhaps another goes into different sorts of convulsions, but for the most, the pitch remains within the unplugged zone of bands like Badgerlore or Darkthrone. If you're more interested in Dark Raven Choir's equally enjoyable noise strain, you'll need to look elsewhere (I recommend the upcoming 3"" CDR, Sturmfuckinglieder, which features seismic, totally harsh covers of Leonard Cohen, Garnet Rogers, and Townes Van Zandt). Though words prove essential, there are a couple instrumentals. A squeaky cover of ""Streets of Laredo"" whips up Woven Hand burning in a Gypsy fire with a lonesome, warping violin. ""Piano Practice - Impatience for a Reality"" is a protracted set of random, dramatic plucks and bowed strings wound large through gaps of dead space bottomed out with the minutest rattling of Morton Feldman's bones. (Anyone interested in creepy ambiance and/or the eccentric appropriation of found materials, do yourself a favor and mix this with Liars' upcoming witch-hunt, They Were Wrong, So We Drowned. Now get a walkman, wander the country at night, and have yourself a really fine Walpurgisnacht.) For those familiar with Smolken, this new full-length won't surprise. What makes Wine, Women and Wolves special, beside the great title, is that it's the first non-CDR release aside from compilation appearances. Therefore, it ought to be easier to track down than, say, Eaten by Wolves, released in an edition of 7, or the equally out-of-print Lesbian Corpse Wolves, limited to a whopping 30 copies. For the new fans I should warn you now that most of Dead Raven Choir's extensive back catalogue-- 25+ releases since 1998-- is already out of print. With someone this productive, though, there's of course hope for the future. (As we go to print, there are four releases scheduled for 2004: Goating Shapelessness Theatrical Wolves, Death to Dead Wolves, Cooking with Wolves, and the anomalously non-wolf title, Dead Raven Choir and Never Presence Forever - Rozrywa Szwy Ciszy). And, hey, becoming a collector at this stage of the game seems an admirably obscurantist activity. Wine, Women and Wolves isn't the most exciting of listens, and it won't get you out on the dance floor, but like a good horror film, the atmosphere's so finely intense, that even the most mundane creak of a door or a cat's innocent mew proves startling enough to make you scream like the feckless sissy you are, really.","Obsessed with wolves and the latent terror lurking behind silences, Dead Raven Choir honorably represent the raw black metal wing ...

Evergreen,Evergreen,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce913d197565213b410/1:1/w_160/56becb84.jpg,2004-02-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2898-evergreen/,Hi-BallHi-Ball,"Two things: 1. The DFA's James Murphy produced this album. My bet is that Murphy's presence is the primary reason, if not the only reason, that Temporary Residence has re-released Evergreen's 1996 self-titled opus. Murphy is relevant, the DFA is untouchable, and here we are, for better or worse, in the Pasiphaean throes of disco-punk, whose only worthwhile examples have been the ones in which Murphy himself has been directly involved. That said, Evergreen are not disco-punk. Their album is not some proto-DFA, proto-""HOJL"", Ur-dancerock underground classic (although I'm willing to entertain the possibility that those who say otherwise are simply very imaginative dancers), and if hi-hat cymbals open at all during a song, check your speakers before you wind your neck. 2a. Britt Walford, who percussed most notably in Kentucky bands Squirrel Bait, Slint, and The Breeders, is Evergreen's drummer and keyboardist. The operative word here is Slint, precisely because of how telling-- and dare I say, how inexhaustibly fun-- the game of rock-and-roll connect-the-dots becomes when Slint and post-Slint splinter bands are its playthings. Yet even I, who at the slight downward turn of a mid-90s volume knob, haphazardly cry out ""Slint! Slint!"" as if the band invented dynamics, can hardly forge half-baked synapses between Spiderland and Walford's effort (though moments on ""Solar System"", ""New York City"" and, I guess, ""Klark Kent"" might have a chance with more time). Perhaps there's a reason Evergreen aren't mentioned as often in the same breath as, say, The For Carnation or Pajo M, who betray their Slint roots more ostensibly. 2b. Listen, if anything, Evergreen are just solid sorta-garage rockers-- less energetic though more colorful than The Stooges; reminiscent of Fugazi's overall timbre but not nearly as trigonometric; nearly as dark as the Pixies' most opaque moments, but never approaching their expectations of melody. Evergreen recorded 13 songs in toto (11 from their original LP on Hi-Ball and two bonus non-Murphy recordings), a few of which are pretty good. It just might be a bit overblown to put Evergreen in the credmonger's favorite room, the nymphaeum of criminally overlooked albums. It's not the curiously adolescent marriage some of us expected between the DFA's dancefloor sensibilities and an emotionally charged, possibly Slinty sound, but Evergreen, taken for the sloppy 90s rock romp it actually is, certainly proves itself worthy of re-release. 2c. Fight me about it, take me to town, etc., but garage-rock is garage-rock. ""Pants Off"" is equal parts 'Stripes, Hendrix, and Stooges blues ""ballad,"" with very little to differentiate itself from those acts. Hendrix aside, if anything Evergreen seems to possess musicians who are more technically proficient, and since Murphy's production refuses to push all channels to the front of the mix, the album's depth of sound mirrors the depth of Evergreen's compositions in earnest. This works to the band's advantage on songs like opener ""Fairline"", whose fresh drum-led intro with gritty guitar catcalls vividly recalls the opening moments of Miles Davis' ""Right Off"" on A Tribute to Jack Johnson, and also in parts like the second half of ""Klark Kent"", a glassy-eyed outro where single-line guitar parts converge from deep within the mix into a swooning maelstrom. The downside is that it presents straightforward and unilateral rockers like ""Whip Cream Bottle"" as a little more airy than they were likely intended, and as a result, the band sacrifices immediacy for more texture than is probably needed. 2d. ""New York City"" is nothing new but still fantastic, a simple instrumental built around an off-kilter, two-chord guitar riff and a steady low bass punch. I admit I like this song because we can see Murphy's role and Slint's possible influence on Evergreen most clearly. As the track progresses, low-level squeaks and squirms are left unfiltered to pass into the mix, and Walford's drumming ebbs back and forth with metallic complexity, the other parts barely changing up their acts at all. By the next track, ""Coyote"", Evergreen return to their sophisto-garage tendencies, which, while not the sound I most appreciate on the album, is pretty much fine, too.","Two things:

No Thanks!: The 70s Punk Rebellion,Various Artists,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d113d19756521394e9/1:1/w_160/424232dd.gif,2004-02-10 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1969-no-thanks-the-70s-punk-rebellion/,Rhino,"""At its best new wave/punk represents a fundamental and age-old Utopian dream: that if you give people the license to be as outrageous as they want in absolutely any fashion they can dream up, they'll be creative about it, and do something good besides.""
     --Lester Bangs, NME, Dec. 1977 ""It was obvious at Winterland-- everyone knew how to behave, everyone knew how to spit, how to dress-- everyone knew how to pack the place. But it was just sensationalism, a spectacle.""
     --Danny Furious of The Avengers, on opening for the Sex Pistols at the Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco, Jan. 14, 1978 It was the best of punk, it was the worst of punk; it was December 1977, the winter of nearly everyone's discontent, but it had been a banner year for angry young men on a handful of continents. All you disenfranchised modern malcontents, you grew up too damn late. Even Lester Bangs, the most vociferously jerky of all knee-jerk misanthropes, was predicting great things; he'd just published a three-part treatise on egalitarianism, the new democracy of music, and the frailties of human nature in NME masquerading humbly as an observer's tour diary with the Clash. The Ramones were finally bringing the Bowery to Britain, and the few, nascent battle-cries of the MC5, The Stooges, and the New York Dolls from a few years back were now being echoed by thousands of new voices. None, of course, screamed louder than the Sex Pistols, though; with some careful management, in just over a year, the Pistols had enjoyed more controversy and notoriety than most other punk acts combined. For better or worse, they were the public face of punk, a voice for all the restless rejects shouting down all comers, and they were on a collision course with the southern United States. By December 30th, 1977, the Sex Pistols didn't even have visas; less than three weeks later, after a brutal reception throughout America's heartland, John Lydon sat dejected on the stage of the Winterland Ballroom and famously asked, ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?"" With his last words as Johnny Rotten, he cast off the fetid mantle of punk's figurehead, and the most notorious punk band of the era had hung it up; with Goliath slain, so died the ""big story"" of punk. Most of the press dried up, casual, rubbernecked gawkers looked for another car wreck, and inside of five years, the punk journalists had burnt out, the punk heroes had blown up, and punk footnotes like The Avengers had simply faded away. Punk rock, bang-to-bust, a flicker of revolutionary greatness smothered by de rigeur rebellion, and all neatly summed up in a tumultuous microcosmic two-month tumble. Conventional wisdom is often simplistic like that. Fortunately, Rhino's overwhelmingly comprehensive four-disc love letter to the heart and soul of punk music isn't particularly conventional. While punk remained a mostly well-kept (and easily documented) secret prior to the Sex Pistols' spectacular collapse, the aftermath of the punk explosion was a shambles. That the Pistols are conspicuously absent on No Thanks! might be the doing of a petulant Lydon (presumably irked that Rhino pulled a stateside release of a Sex Pistols box a few years back), but fitting nonetheless. Fine. Fuck 'em. Of all the admirable successes of No Thanks!, the finest is surely the deliberateness with which it unearths so many of the also-rans long-since buried in the Pistols' wake. With barely a track to spare for The Clash, The Ramones, or The Fall, they're barely an afterthought here. No Thanks! isn't about ""essential""; it's ""scope,"" pure magnitude. Deadbeats and dilettantes, glammed progenitors and goth poseurs, the revered and the reviled. This isn't just ""punk,"" this is everything that was boiling beneath the surface, the whole of the late-70s underground brought to light. The Motors will never, ever be spoken of in the same regard as Richard Hell. Or The Damned. Or even Generation X (Billy Idol was the Diamond Dave of punk rock, after all). Ditto for the Glen Matlock's Rich Kids, 999, The Vibrators, Subway Sect, and half of the other bands that grace this stage, and that's the collection's charm; every Englishman or Yankee to ever hold a guitar, let alone learn to play one (how else can you explain The Adverts?) gets at least an act, maybe two. The diversity contained here is staggering, but the disparity of sound is nullified by the unity of motivations; whether out of sincerity or fashionability, everyone's got a grudge to bear. No matter what form it takes, the underlying theme is simple dissatisfaction; no one was playing because he or she was happy (except maybe Devo-- who knows what they wanted?). Something, anything, needed to change, but all any of these people were empowered to do was play music. Punk was fundamentally unfocused rage, a loaded gun aimed at any institution-- politics, clothing, loneliness, provinciality, music itself-- too societally entrenched to get out of the way. The tactics aren't always smart, and rarely pretty, but the execution is brilliant, and Rhino has released the ultimate document. Large-scale entropy demands order, though, if only to maintain the physical form of the discs themselves. To that end, Rhino offers two minimal criteria: Every track included must come from label-distributed singles released during the 70s. The 70s was a singles-driven decade, for certain; some pulse-stopping LPs emerged from bands that went on to dominate the canon, but many of the other bands had the half-life of a mayfly-- they were lucky to even make it through a 45 before splintering. With a fraction of the media saturation we have today, bands fought for recognition on the radio waves, or Top of the Pops, or with the pocketbooks of the working poor-- three minutes were all they had to make a name for themselves. And surely, chronology must factor in, so, sure, why not draw the line at the close of the 70s? [Beware: the pointless whining of a perfectionist follows, but only out of my all-consuming love.] Here's why. Arbitrary guidelines made out of necessity are for sissies; reap your bastard rewards: No Crass-- ridiculously, sincerely radical, no one epitomized agit-punk better. No Anti-Nowhere League-- they drove around in a van spray-painted with ""We're the Anti-Nowhere League and you're not""; a completely laughable bunch of buffoons, but for sheer, mindless disposability, ""We Are the League"" isn't so far removed from The Vibrators' ""Baby Baby"". Plus, Elvis Costello liked them. No Angelic Upstarts-- see Crass; skinheads against racism. No Misfits-- for the 28 minutes of Static Age, The Misfits were as perfectly hopeless as the best the West Coast had to offer, schlock horror and all. No Birthday Party-- same reason, but Nick the Stripper & Co. are Aussies. No Rocket From the Tombs-- sure, why include the first voice of Cleveland punk, the group that spawned both The Dead Boys and Pere Ubu (who are naturally present)? No MC5!-- ""Rock & roll, drugs, and fucking in the streets"" was printed on their freakin' business cards. No Lou Reed-- I heard he shot anti-freeze and lived, dudes. There's more. And yet we're left with Devo. That doesn't even touch on multiple questionable song choices; ""Final Solution"" is a poor man's alternative to ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" (and that was a single!), but I'm about to get carried away. Let common sense dictate some choices, guys; this compilation is so close. But even if not absolutely perfect (and could any compilation really be?), compilations don't come more essential than this; it is required listening for anyone new to punk, and unquestionably the best primer on this music in existence. Rhino does away with any pretense of chronology to great effect; vital, fiery sermons spar with tense, calculated cool, and with one-hits back-to-back with the classics, virtually every track commands attention. Middleman-ing between Richard Hell's perversely jubilant ""Love Comes in Spurts"" and the primally willful, snot-nosed ignorance of The Dead Boys' classic ""Sonic Reducer"", even the (still living) Boys' ""First Time"" sounds like a hit. Each disc is an untouchable mix, varied enough that five consecutive hours of listening isn't out of reach, but Rhino have outdone themselves even here, in case you can't afford that time commitment. Subtle as it is, disc one flirts precariously with becoming a full-fledged classics compilation, between opening with ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" and ""White Riot"", followed in short order by The Damned's blistering ""Neat Neat Neat"", The Jam, Pere Ubu, and Jonathan Richman's hypnotic ode to midnight radio at a thousand miles an hour, ""Roadrunner"". The proud, preening showcase taken by disc one is welcome as a one-shot primer, but in the end, nothing but old news, and just as compelling as the less-well-traveled discs two and three. Disc four, however, is the true masterpiece; coming close to exposing the splintered force of punk near the end of the decade, frail and faltering against the ropes before succumbing fully to new wave and post-punk, it takes an angle not often seen. With early idealism and bravado stripped aside, bands were slowly falling out of step. Talking Heads and Elvis Costello's ""Radio, Radio"" carefully tread the path to commercial success that Blondie recklessly followed before them; ""Boys Don't Cry"" famously hints at The Cure's forthcoming, beautiful pop romanticism. Gang of Four ride Andy Gill's shattered guitar lines all the way to name-drop superstardom; ""Adult Books"" is X's impression of Talking Heads before they leave the limitations of West Coast punk behind for the Dead Kennedys to flog. These are the epilogues to a story stretched out over the three prior discs, and provides easily the most memorable individual moments of this compilation. The last notes heard as No Thanks! closes out the decade are Joy Division's, with an air of obvious finality, but Johnny Thunders' ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory"" is more poignant. Thunders' life mirrors the larger story of punk as presented here in a way the Sex Pistols never can. From his untouchable beginnings with the New York Dolls, he was a catalyst of the breaking New York scene, but he was helpless, naïve and vain-- he fractured the Dolls because he wanted the spotlight. Although he went on to headline with The Heartbreakers, he toiled only to mixed success in a sea of bands he helped inspire. A growing heroin habit eventually dissolved any vestige of stability, and The Heartbreakers, too, buckled under the pressure. For his remaining years, Johnny solo was a joke; not falling off the stage marked a successful performance. Shooting up in his hands and feet because other veins had collapsed, playing for cash in hand to get smack after the show-- he tried to clean up, but like so many tragic figures, it seems, he was too late. Johnny Thunders died in 1991, long after the punk rock he fostered had disappeared, but he wrote ""Memory"" in 1978; like him, its greatness had passed, but it would be a long time fading away. ""It doesn't pay to try/ All the smart boys know why,"" and when he sings it with his innocent, put-upon inflection, one thing is certain: He was too dumb not to give it his best shot, and smart enough to realize it. We're better off that he-- and the rest of them-- did try, at least; I can't think of a more appropriate conclusion.","""At its best new wave/punk represents a fundamental and age-old Utopian dream: that if you give people\n\ the ...

Blue Sky,Bottle Rockets,by: Chris Drabick,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a449c0084474cd0c0468/1:1/w_160/27b59b32.jpg,2004-02-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1100-blue-sky/,Sanctuary,"Let me start with a confession; for several years I was a card-carrying No Depressionist. I didn't dress funny or drink Pabst Blue Ribbon (unless I was at the Empty Bottle, and only then because it was $1.00) or any other such affectation adopted by roots rock weirdos. But the Old 97s, Whiskeytown, Richard Buckner, et al., were the focus of my taste and time. If you're like me, then you consider 1997 to be ""The Year Y' allternative Broke."" Between Too Far to Care, Stranger's Almanac and Devotion & Doubt in my CD changer rested 24 Hours a Day by The Bottle Rockets, which I considered to be one of the finest albums released in that heady year. The (let's face it, clock-stoppingly ugly) boys from Festus, Missouri peaked on that well-written, witty and ridiculously catchy record. Brian Henneman's songwriting, of course, has always tended toward the obvious, but any simple-mindedness seemed to belie the underlying small-town tunefulness and universality of theme that songs such as ""1000 Dollar Car"" and ""When I Was Dumb"" made good on. The high points of their earlier records were almost always smarter than a cursory listen would indicate, and the great songs far outnumbered the mediocre ones for a short time. But even the casual observer could sense trouble in the late 90s, when the band released back-to-back pedestrian efforts between 1999's ""Brand New Year"" and 2001's Bloodshot-issued Songs of Sahm, an album's worth of Doug Sahm covers. Even the usually able production of Eric Ambel couldn't save the rote ""Year"", which sandwiched losers like ""The Bar's on Fire"" between alternate versions of the winning title track. And a covers record, no matter how worthy the subject, always speaks to the songwriting well running dry, which obviously Henneman's had. With all of this in mind, my optimism ran high that, after an extended layoff, the band could at least conjure the spirit of their earlier winning streak. How disappointing to find that, after an early highlight (""Lucky Break"", which was done better as ""Welfare Music"" on The Brooklyn Side), ""Blue Sky"" descends into an utterly boring sloppy mess. Perhaps most tellingly, the album's only other worthy track, ""I Don't Wanna Go Back"", isn't written by Henneman at all. By the time Blue Sky slumps to ""Pretty Little Annie"", a somewhat disturbing tale of voyeuristic borderline pedophilia that lifts the riff from Sahm's ""She's About a Mover"" note-for-note, I just get frustrated. What's happened here? I mean, I never expected experimentation or growth from these guys, but surely, a listenable record is not too much to ask for. Going through the motions is usually reserved for aging stars playing out the string for legions of fans eager for any new output from their old favorite, not a group hungrily clinging to a record contract and lugging gear from gig to gig to pay the bills. Put simply, Blue Sky is a heartbreaker, and not the Ryan Adams kind. As evidenced by any number of 90s hits compilations, nostalgia moves faster all the time; at least some basic recycling would have allowed me to re-engage with their music the way I once did, and maybe even relive some of the better moments I've had while their music played out in the background. Blue Sky fails to even approximate that sound. Rather, it's their bleakest and most humbled record to date: They've lost all hope, and so have I.","Let me start with a confession; for several years I was a card-carrying No Depressionist.

Wings Beneath the Sills/Casket City Wolves,Resplendent,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2eaea9e61561daa4b73/1:1/w_160/877edded.gif,2004-02-10 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11817-wings-beneath-the-sillscasket-city-wolves/,Mixx Tape,"The current update on Michael Lenzi's Resplendent homepage isn't so much a diatribe as a lament. After ten years making music, first in Number One Cup, later in Chicago's brilliant, aggressively experimental Fire Show, and now on his own as Resplendent, he writes that he's grown tired of playing the game of promotion and jumping through the music industry's hoops, and as a result, his series of numbered, tin-encased EPs isn't selling at all. He hits on a sad truism of really any line of business: It's almost impossible to succeed if you don't play the game at least a little. But in a sense, you could say he's never really played the game the way it's supposed to be played; at every stage of his career, Lenzi has made or been a part of making music that broached no compromises with anyone. It doesn't look like he's ready to start changing his ways now, either, as all three of his solo EPs have steadfastly walked unbeaten paths away from his older work, all the while sharing with his past a seeming addiction to change and exploration. While his first EP, last summer's In a Wilderness, struck in a sort of lo-fi hip-hop direction with detours into dark-forest IDM and demon-approved lullabies (okay, it was all over the place) with appropriately mixed results, the two that have followed it, Wings Beneath the Sills and Casket City Wolves, are minor masterworks of sometimes breathtaking beauty and startling creativity. Whereas In a Wilderness seemed to strive for invention, its counterparts are effortlessly new sounding, almost inevitable in their off-handed innovation. Wings Beneath the Sills opens with an unsettling combination of steel drums and flute, which comprise nearly the entire arrangement of ""Resolution Time"", apart from Lenzi's low-key vocal. Oddly, the song's chord structures and melody (partially nicked from The Clash, but only just) lend it an old-school R&B; feel-- it's consonant, eerie, familiar, and alien all at once. The disc is filled with fractured percussion: ""Luminescent Exultant Chariot"" is constituted entirely by sputtering drum cutups, minimal, rounded synth tones and Lenzi's solemn sing/speak. Those rounded synths help shape the static core of ""Nape of Neck Hints"", giving Lenzi's plaintive vocals (played backward for one verse) something to cling to and helping to create the prettiest squall of noise I've ever heard, while ""Sleeptalking in the Natatorium"" raises the hair on your neck with its grotesquely gorgeous wash of sound-- it's pastoral and yet mechanical, like Boards of Canada with razor edges. Casket City Wolves builds on the textural blueprint of Wings, with greater rhythmic variety and an ear toward more traditional songcraft. ""Judas Priest Cul de Sac"" is nudged along by a keyboard bassline and junk percussion courtesy of Califone's Ben Massarella and Chicago session man Joe Adamik, while Lenzi's vocal melody casts hooks across it all-- it's a pop song, basically, but the jittery texture and oddball arrangement turn it completely on its head. ""Rise the Sun (On Cassette Mountain)"" swings from sung/spoke verses to catchy choruses complete with descending, sing-songy bass countermelodies that are perversely sunny next to Lenzi pleading ""don't take your shit out on me."" According to his site, Lenzi is now working on a Resplendent full-length, and the mind reels trying to imagine what he's got cooking up in the studio. The signature sound he's forged has almost limitless potential to expand and incorporate essentially whatever threads might be hanging nearby, and his minimalist approach is devastating almost by default. As the closing tones of ""Dreamer's Dub"" evaporate into the ether to end Casket City Wolves, it intentionally leaves you hanging, wanting more. Whatever follows is almost sure to be amazing.",,8.4,
Rise Up!,Klezmatics,by: J. Wasserman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0cf5e6ef95969320038/1:1/w_160/6f648821.jpg,2004-02-10 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4570-rise-up/,Rounder,"Does anyone bother denying anymore that The Pogues (when they still had Shane McGowan) were a punk band? I'll admit that the first time I heard them, I thought they were just an exceptionally drunk Irish trad group. But listening more closely, I heard the sounds of defiance and ethnic exultation in Shane's lyrics about getting drunk, wandering around town drunk, going to church drunk, and getting blown into little tiny pieces in the Battle of Gallipolli. The Pogues were so punk they didn't need overdriven guitar, breakneck drumming or discontented lyrics. They, like The Clash, knew that punk was an approach, not a template, and that it found its best expression in Beat-like joy and darkness. Now that The Pogues are no more (or maybe they still are, but without Shane there's hardly any point), the world needs The Klezmatics more than ever. Nerdy where The Pogues were scruffy, and stoned where they were drunk, The Klezmatics are the uncontested rulers of the current Jewish Alternative Movement/Radical Jewish Culture/Scare Your Grandparents scene. Sure, John Zorn releases more records in a month than The Klezmatics do in a decade, but the 'Matics do a much better job of fusing the traditional with the radical-- side project Hasidic New Wave reworked a Dead Kennedys chestnut as ""Giuliani Uber Alles"", but The Klezmatics would not be out of place playing a Long Island bar mitzvah. And now they've released Rise Up!, a record plagued by delays. Is it worth the wait? Probably. It's certainly not as out-there as their last couple of albums, but that might be because we know to expect the unexpected from this crew. It's certainly a more mellow ride than Possessed or Jews with Horns, and maybe that makes Rise Up! as utterly bizarre as Mr. Bungle's Brian Wilson tribute, California. The immediate standout, ""I Ain't Afraid"", is also the only one sung mostly in English. Beginning with a Sousa-meets-Peter Tosh drumbeat, it quickly becomes a defiant declaration of religious independence. Lorin Sklamberg tells us that he's not afraid of God, but rather ""what you do in the name of your God."" For a supposedly religious band (my local record shop files klezmer music in the back of the Christian section), this is a 95 Theses moment. Sklamberg and his gospel-flavored backup singers implore their listeners to ""rise up"" against the ""ones who say they know it"" before they ""impose it on you."" The lyrics alternate between English and Yiddish, just to make sure that all of their target audience understands the message exactly. Blam. The rest of the record is less gripping. ""Tepel"" is a fast freylech with a nifty a cappella intro by Sklamberg, followed by an overcaffeinated faux-children's chorus. ""Bulgars #2 (Tantsn un Shpringen)"" is a traditional dance tune with a driving beat and a couple of great breakdowns. And yes, it's a bit odd to use the word ""breakdowns"" to describe a klezmer tune, but I don't think anyone will mind. ""Barikadn (Barricades)"", which samples a 1948 recording by Shmerke Kaczerginsky, is a ballad of a workers' revolution (""Fathers, mothers, children, too/ Are building barricades/ Detachments march along the streets/ Workers on parade"") set over a free-jazz folk dance tune. The Yiddish lyrics make the song sound like something my grandmother would enjoy, but the lyrics sound primed for an (International) Noise Conspiracy record. The punk community has yet to embrace The Klezmatics the way it did The Pogues, and I'm guessing it has something to do with their lack of pop immediacy or heroin habits (and their dopey sense of humor doesn't help, either). Still, Rise Up! is as welcoming as it is challenging, and a welcome addition to their forward-looking, tradition-shattering oeuvre.","Does anyone bother denying anymore that The Pogues (when they still had Shane McGowan) were a punk band?

Kimi Ga Suki,Matthew Sweet,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a600b1335d7bf1698d22/1:1/w_160/6b93405c.jpg,2004-02-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7659-kimi-ga-suki/,Cutting Edge,"In 2003's multimedia pen-pal exchange program with Japan we ostensibly came out a little ahead, as Sofia Coppola expertly borrowed from a potent mix of ancient Japanese culture and kaleidoscopic urban Tokyo's American pop-culture obsession to stage one of the year's most moving films. With an equally celebrated cult-status reception, the land of the samurai has embraced a number of American musical exports over the years, hosting a list of artists ranging from vital to virtually defunct-- among them, the sugary guitar-pop of Matthew Sweet. Kimi Ga Suki is a requited return to form of the love affair, and sports the original lineup that spawned his swan song. Originally crafted as a Japan-only release, the album has since deservedly been released domestically. The time constraints placed on the production left Sweet with little room to foul up the effort with excess nursing or overwrought sonic-management, a problem that's sullied his most recent releases. Opener ""Dead Smile""'s rousing chorus and buoyant melody molds a perfect pop anthem; simple and poignant, it represents everything maturated talent can and should positively yield. Sweet's unpolluted execution even forgives the delivery of such second-language crafted lines (""You can't hide/ The rotten in your soul/ Cold as ice/ Hot as burning coal""). Most of the record plays to Sweet's strengths as a songwriter, as he spins timeless pop melodies that unravel with ease and retire before they grow too stale. ""I Don't Want to Know"" and ""Love Is Gone"" exemplify Sweet at his best; as the latter Big Star battleship-sinker overlaps crisp vocal harmonies, while gamboling across a simple, crestfallen acoustic framework. Unfortunately, ""I Love You"" drags with a little sonic excess, but the same seed, properly nurtured, reaps its rewards in ""Spiral"" by simply staying shy of the two-minute mark. Thankfully, Sweet keeps most of the songs right where they belong-- hovering in and around three minutes. True, there's little in the way of deftly pioneering material, but Sweet's never been one to shirk his influences, as his sound, both modern and classic, rests fitfully in the gray area between innovation and mimicry without really offering an insult to either camp. Closer ""Through Your Eyes"" even comes off as an under-strung Ted Leo number, only you can't tell who influenced who, nor does it seem to matter. It's a fitting end to an album that reaffirms Sweet's pop-chartering snap, not only across the sea but also amongst America's finest.","In 2003's multimedia pen-pal exchange program with Japan we ostensibly came out a little ahead, as Sofia Coppola expertly ...

Although the humble label (which houses each CD in a thin card case and whose CD face contains concentric circles as its main design motif) excels more in documenting an intimate scene of unassuming folks combining acoustic instrumentation with gentle washes of electronic processes, the closest parallel I could draw would be to the similarly grounded Häpna label out of Sweden. Aero is the double for label co-founder Koen Holtkamp and his own such explorations, and his latest release keeps with the modus operandi of the catalog to excellent effect. Fellow labelmate Brendon Anderegg helps open the disc with a hesitant bit of banjo plucking. The initial association might be to someone like The Books, but as the drone of the harmonium (or is it melodica?) swells and swallows up the sound in a dreamy gauze, there's little adherence to folk forms or tricky cut-editing, much less the shapes and sounds of the physical instrument itself. Instead, sonic distillation is Aero's intent; the warmth of each blended element and how it permeates the whole is the focus. Expanding out over the course of 11 minutes, ""Rises"" runs the twangs of Anderegg's guitar and what could be a pedal steel through the dream machine, so that they flicker past like a Kansas cornfield in the middle of a car nap. The drift of the track becomes blurry but remains snug as it morphs into ""Falls"", with its more openly aired echoes that encase each bit of piano and guitar and give them more room to radiate. Velocity finally happens to the sputtering bits of ""Rinse"", but as the increasingly unidentifiable sources are further reduced to abstract snaps, crackles and pops, we find ourselves plunked in the abstract spaces of ""Coast"", aware that the borders between each five-lettered track name are mere indicators of where we might be in the disc itself. There is notable fuzz and ball of stylus fluff on ""Aug31"" and an embryonic fluidity to its neighboring ""Float"", but they're slight alterations in a holistic entity, fluctuating ratios of sound and processing pressure. The traces of instrumentation gleaned at the start are further elucidated yet also freed from their encumbering sources as the disc moves along.

The Parable of Arable Land / God Bless The Red Krayola and All Who Sail with It,The Red Krayola,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a22eea9e61561daa4997/1:1/w_160/f5c8e798.jpg,2004-02-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11813-the-parable-of-arable-land-god-bless-the-red-krayola-and-all-who-sail-with-it/,International Artist,"Believe it or not, Pitchfork does not afford me the luxury of having only one job. I don't claim to have the most bizarre profession on staff, but my capacity as a curator of the Special Exhibits Gallery for the Kansas State Historical Society gives me a lot of time to think about history's trajectory. Amongst the thousands of dissertations, portfolios and anthologies that slide across my desk claiming to classify epochs and develop new historical methodologies and schemas, there's one thesis I don't believe I've ever heard proposed in any of these texts: The 60s were fucking nuts. Like seriously. The historian Alice Echols claims that the culmination of the 60s occurred at the infamous Rainbow Ricochet soiree on May 8, 1967. And indeed, it's difficult to combat any party (let alone that epic bacchanal) that found Timothy Leary, Otis Redding, Abbie Hoffman, Betty Friedan, Stanley Kubrick, Twinkle and the newly appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd hovering (literally, according to some eyewitnesses) around a punch bowl that packed enough wallop to send eleven attendees home in body bags. The sheer wackiness must have been astonishing, righteous, revolutionary and filled with enough permanent brain atrophy to run for prime minister. Any lingering devotees of the 1980s still insisting that ""well, um, that Frehley's Comet album was pretty crazy for too, uh, often as well"" better pack up their belongings and go home. Fuckin' illiterates. Learn to read. And yet, there was an even more momentous day in the marshmallow-sky twirling unicorn massacre we call the 1960s. In March 1967, The Red Crayola walked into the studio and spent a day making one of the most visionary album of the year, The Parable of Arable Land. It's a band that has no idea how to play its instruments. In fact, they don't even know what instruments are, or if the guitarist has the ability to remain conscious long enough to play whatever it is a ""note"" might be. Shattered psalms, wobbling percussion courtesy of poet Frederick Barthelme, patently overused echo chambers, and the clumsiest staircase bassline in garage history smashes into a bunch of clopping machine men as Mayo Thompson croons out the only serious line in his entire career: ""I have in my pocket a hurricane fighter plane."" And that's just one of the actual songs. The ""free-form freakouts"" are about as fervidly psychotic as anything in any genre. This is a band that was paid ten dollars to stop a performance in Berkeley. If Berkeley's not having it, you know you're in for rough sledding. (Think amplified ""Revolution 9"" or the more scandalous Sun City Girls' field recordings.) Kazoos, tribal race riots, steamrolled radios, irate circus barkers, distressed toddlers, and spy themes assail each other over crackling soda pop. And then there's those oscillations and extravagant mouthfuls of static that are so heavy you may as well tattoo fake PCP lips onto your skull and shoot yourself in the legs because you thought the act of shooting a gun was the object chocolate worship goalosphere itself. And in the middle, Thompson hollers out ""Woo-hoo!"" like he actually thinks he's rocking out. He is mistaken; this is not a rockin' trip. It's a mind-milkshake where everyone's friends are dead in abscesses of lunatic incompetence at an epic pitch of stoner rock doom. How could it possibly get any more chaotic? Oh... I don't know. How about if you put Roky Erickson on an organ and told him to pretend he didn't have any hands? Yes, that does the trick nicely. A year later and a drummer short, Thompson recruited Tommy Smith to make something their label, International Artists, might actually accept after the botched release of Coconut Hotel. This is not to say God Bless the Red Krayola is particularly accessible. First of all, they spell their name incorrectly. This may seem like a feeble move, perhaps even stupid, but let us recall that misspelling is #1 on the making-crazy-music-for-its-own-sake to-do list. For all the laudations heaped upon the Krayola by the punk and post-punk crowds, it might as well be bootleg Einstürzende Neubauten at its grimiest atonality and infuritating double integral time signatures: ""The Shirt"" and ""The Jewels of Madonna"" are vicious gorges brimming with abrasive wire-cutting, pop-gun propulsion, and whimpering, receding vocals. That's not to say there aren't memorable ""songs"" here: ""Say Hello to Jamie Jones""' stark drumming and lulled vocals are relentlessly dry and stoical, and the hilariously out-of-sync back-up singing on ""Save the House"" is the experimental rock version of call-and-response performed by stoners with Tourette's syndrome. The catchiest song might be the lost-love reverie of ""Victory Garden"", except the protagonist is Hitler patched onto what we'll have to call an ""angular bop jam band"" simply to get out of it intact. ""Ravi Shankar: Parachutist"" is delivered with such convulsive sincerity, the lengthy interruption by a flickering middle school choir's scales seems both disingenuous and ravenously insane. Most songs are under two minutes. Many more are under one. If your temperament's not what the 19th-century scientist Eberhard Wilkson called ""amicable and shrewd through divertissement,"" this will be an interminable slog through everything that was ever bad in underground rock. It's indulgent, poorly recorded, entirely befuddled in its own crazy aesthetic, existing solely to counter the mainstream and prove they don't care about gloss, significance or talent. And, like Trout Mask Replica, it will feel like a halfway decent comedy album the first few times you listen to it. Persistence will pay off. The Krayola would disband shortly after this release (and a lost double-album with John Fahey) only to reform in the late 1970s to sustain a legendarily spotty three decades of releases. The great Pitchfork meta-raconteur, Nick Mirov, once concluded a review of a recent Red Krayola album by noting that it has ""nothing to do with entertainment. Or even art."" Granted. Unfortunately, that's many people's definition of truly great entertainment and art. Way back when, no one wanted to call Duchamp, Michelangelo, Mozart or the Queen's portraitist ""artists,"" either. The Krayola's legacy is surely bolstered by their location in rock history-- simply put, this was likely the most experimental band of the 1960s-- but until we've caught up with them, this remains essential listening for fried brains of all creeds.",,9.3,
Kamikaze,Twista,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a85e6ef95969320230/1:1/w_160/6e24dea7.jpg,2004-02-09 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8253-kamikaze/,Atlantic,"Let's be honest here. The reason you're reading this has a lot less to do with Twista than with super-producer/rapper/genius purveyor of chipmunk soul Kanye West. I know because I'm here for the same reason. The album's first single is the inescapable ""Slow Jamz"", produced by and featuring fellow Chi-town native Kanye along with comedian Jamie Foxx on the R&B-loving; hook. This Luther Vandross-ripping soulfest has somehow placed Twista's third solo album at the top of this week's Billboard charts. Which is incredible on a few fronts. First and foremost, Twista is the ugliest man in hip-hop. Just peep the album cover: Dude's an acne-riddled Rescue Ranger. Second, after more than a year of delays, it's the Road Runner-rapping MC's first album in nearly five years. This aside, Twista (formerly Tung Twista) sports perhaps the most dexterous flow since mid-90s Busta, and on ""Slow Jamz"", he wraps his voice around a supremely accelerated Burt Bacharach-penned sample. Unfortunately, based on the immediately quotable couplet, ""Got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson/ Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson,"" Kanye outshines him completely. While Twista could rely solely on his ridiculous verbal agility on posse cuts like Memphis Bleek's classic ""Is That Your Bitch?"", he hasn't got it in him to sustain an entire album. And if Kamikaze isn't an absolute abomination, its scope quickly reveals itself as limited: three songs about female ass (including the hilarious ""Badunkadunk"" and the R. Kelly event ""So Sexy""), a sequel to a song no one's heard (""Still Feels So Good"") and another about rims (""Like a 24"", featuring T.I., who also has a single about rims in rotation right now-- sadly, his are only 22's). Topics like these have been drained of what little juice they might have had by, among others, the nefarious Nelly. Aside from ""Slow Jamz"", Kanye's production appears twice more, on ""One Last Time"", and later, on ""Overnight Celebrity"", which outdoes his previous crate-digging by jacking Lenny Williams' 70s Motown hit ""'Cause I Love You"". Bombastic strings, heart-rattling urgency, and Twista's sharpest punchlines make it the star of the record. Elsewhere, the vaguely uplifting (but ultimately perfunctory) ""Hope"" fills Twista's ""sensitive thug"" prerequisite. Granted, any rap song that gives a hopeful shoutout to Christopher Reeve's ability to walk is going to seem strangely off-putting. Thankfully, Cee-Lo's shimmering chorus saves this borderline piffle. On the strip-club anthem ""Sunshine"", Twista nearly pisses all over what little respect he's gathered to date, sampling Bill Withers' luminescent ""Lovely Day"". Good thing The Gap already raped the beauty of that song. ""Drinks"" compares fine ladies to-- naturally-- alcoholic beverages while Toxic, who produces nearly half the album, provides the best Dr. Dre-impersonation you'll hear this side of Scott Storch. Kamikaze ends with one last Roc-A-Fella posse cut, ""Art & Life"". The song, laced with a beat worthy of an NBA introduction ceremony, features strong verses from Freeway, Memphis Bleek and Young Chris, until Twista swoops in to smoke to whatever's left of the ominous beat. Obviously, Twista's not breaking down any walls with his wordplay on Kamikaze, but along the way he kicks over a few garbage cans while letting Kanye West, Toxic and the rest of his production crew move some crowds and elevate their status, one slow jam at a time.","Let's be honest here.

Das Capital: The Songwriting Genius of Luke Haines & The Auteurs,Auteurs,by: Michael Idov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a153b1335d7bf1698220/1:1/w_160/1ecdc016.gif,2004-02-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/370-das-capital-the-songwriting-genius-of-luke-haines-the-auteurs/,Hut,"I doubt that most artists enjoy selecting their greatest hits for a package like this. More often than not, these collections are forced by market necessities, imply the end of an era, and lead to inevitable bifurcation between fan favorites and the label's idea of a hit. Imagine, then, the enormity of such undertaking for a songwriter whose shtick involves both unflagging self-admiration and utter contempt for labels, marketing, colleagues and fans. I'm talking, of course, about the UK's Luke Haines, the leader of the defunct Auteurs and, with John Moore, the creator of the minimalist-pop project Black Box Recorder. Evidently facing a contract obligation to ransack his old band's four albums for a hits package, Haines found a conceptually flawless way out: He rented out a symphony orchestra and proceeded to re-record eight of Auteurs' songs in nauseatingly grand, mellow-gold arrangements that most definitely do not have to be heard to be believed. Das Capital: The Songwriting Genius of Luke Haines and the Auteurs is a primo Situationist stunt. From the title on down, it concerns itself purely with the sound of money. Fat with winds, strings, chimes, echo chambers the size of Wembley stadium and, per liner notes, ""the greatest sax solo in the history of popular culture,"" the album is meticulously designed to mimic fundraiser quickies like The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Plays the Music of Oasis. There's even an overture, ingeniously hidden before the first track (you have to hit pause and rewind well into negative numbers to play it). The result, needless to say, is patently and intentionally ludicrous; it could be one of the greatest jokes ever played on a label by an artist. I can't help but applaud Das Capital's meta-architecture, which incorporates everything from the cover art to the attendant interviews filled with bragging about the project's cost (press manipulation has always been an integral part of Haines's work-- his solo debut came out the same week he called for a ""pop strike"" from the op-ed page of The Guardian). One small quibble, however, remains: The album is unlistenable. From the first notes of ""How Could I Be Wrong?"", a formerly jangly number slowed down to a stately stupor, it becomes painfully clear that Haines' songwriting does not lend itself well to bombast. His Auteurs albums, especially the sophomore Now I'm a Cowboy, did make pleasant use of strings, but the arrangements were never allowed to overtake the laconic lead melodies. The gag wears off awfully soon; what's worse, Haines-- a C+ vocalist at best-- is unable to complete it by belting his lines like Tom Jones or dropping down into the Barry White register (the only two appropriate options, given the arrangements). He sings in his usual reedy voice, sounding all but lost in the swirl. Of the eight supposed chestnuts, only ""Baader Meinhof"" holds up, but the original-- off the 70s-terrorist-nostalgia concept album-- was awash in Moroccan strings to begin with. The obligatory three new songs barely register; ""Satan Wants Me"" (""...for my mind/ To marry his daughter/ Have a child"") provides an exception by running its humor into the ground more violently than his others. As any piece of conceptual art Haines claims to despise so, Das Capital is primarily valuable as a conversation catalyst. As a piece of self-assessment, it's useless: Haines' liner notes bring to mind Nabokov's Strong Opinions, wherein Vladimir Vladimirovich spares a couple of kind words for Joyce, but only for Ulysses. Haines operates in a similar mode here. He assigns his albums short captions (""my second masterpiece"") and stars (most get five out of five), obliterates any suggestion of collaboration within the Auteurs, and blurbs a remix album by \xB5-Ziq thus: ""Remixes by some kid from Wimbledon for L500. A lot of money for a teenager. Never listened to it myself. Went on to sell well in America. 100% of the publishing goes to me."" Paired with the deliberately subpar stuff on the album, the braggadocio becomes suffocating: What we appear to have on our hands is a spoof of the very notion of quality. I would never recommend a living soul to purchase Das Capital. And yet, full marks are due to Haines for making good on the hissed mission statement from his Oliver Twist Manifesto: ""You better believe me when I say/ I never wanted to be liked.""",,5.1,
Spirit Stereo Frequency,All Night Radio,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1875e6ef959693201d6/1:1/w_160/d891def1.jpg,2004-02-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/424-spirit-stereo-frequency/,Sub Pop,"In 2001, Boston College professor Michael Keith wrote a book called Sounds in the Dark: All-Night Radio in American Life. In it, Keith explores the socio-cultural motivation behind middle-of-the-night radio broadcasts, prodding at the occasionally curious demographics of all-night radio listeners-- think people in sweaters driving cars and drinking black coffee from plastic thermoses, security guards flipping through decks of cards, janitors pushing buckets, or insomniacs eating crackers and gnawing their fingernails. As a companion, all-night radio is warm and crackly, vaguely surreal, and encoded in the way that late-night activities always are. Everyone thinks just a little bit differently at night: familiar objects become encrypted by darkness, taking shapes that aren't their own; dimensions are expanded, images are distorted, and everything inadvertently and suddenly becomes really, really weird. Thus, the meandering, blowsy psych-rock of All Night Radio. Fronted by ex-Beachwood Sparks members Dave Scher and Jimi Hey, All Night Radio have successfully captured the shape-shifting, peculiar magic of midnight crackles and shitty speakers, freaky callers and awkward on-air personalities. The band's full-length debut, Spirit Stereo Frequency, is, happily, just as fuzzy and unpredictable as its namesake suggests, with high, hissing vocals, archaic-gone-futuristic blips, pedal steel, keyboards, glockenspiel, and a barrage of other noisemakers helping to build a thick, spacy stretch of soft 60s psychedelia. Opener ""Daylight Till Dawn"" mixes Scher and Hey's gentle, lapping vocals with whiny guitar, their rousing chorus of ""I wanna wake up in the morning!"" tempered by a bum-bum-bum vocal breakdown and plenty of echo. Most of Spirit Stereo Frequency comes in short waves: ""We're on Our Wave"" is framed by samples of crashing tides and filled with sweet, Byrds-ish whispers, each vocal dose perfectly rising, cresting and falling, while ""Sky Bicycle (You've Been Ringing)"" is a galactic, meandering high, with tinkling melodies blowing up and then subsiding in a tiny cloud of pink and yellow smoke. Much like a sleepless night, Spirit Stereo Frequency lags a bit in the middle, mimicking the inevitable dip and sag of insomnia: the initial rush of adrenaline wanes, resources are gradually exhausted, and, somehow, there are still plenty of empty hours to fill before daybreak. When the moon finally sinks, the sun-spotted reward turns out to be well-worth your patience: closing self-anthem ""All Night Radio"" is a buoyant singalong, the perfect soundtrack to careening down the interstate at 4:00am or launching streaming blue rockets into space. Awesomely, Scher and Hey claim to have composed these songs based on non-stop bandwidth signals from the sun, and caution that signal content can vary based on ""atmospheric conditions."" It's entirely possible that they're right-- depending on exactly what brand of moonlight you end up dancing under, Spirit Stereo Frequency can be an empathetic buddy, an omnipresent guide, or just the perfect accompaniment to the most illogical of all human situations.","In 2001, Boston College professor Michael Keith wrote a book called Sounds in the Dark: All-Night Radio in American Life ...

The Happiest Days of Our Lives,My Favorite,by: P.J. Gallagher,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42613d197565213beba/1:1/w_160/7f1d0101.jpg,2004-02-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5528-the-happiest-days-of-our-lives/,Double Agent,"In high school, I thought I was a victimized nonconformist trapped in a world that didn't understand me. The claustrophobic blandness of my existence in suburban Buffalo blinded me from the legions of disaffected youth across the country fighting the same battles. And not only was I cliché, in 1993 I was about ten years late. I was the blueprint for privileged, melodramatic suburban youth. Music was my oxygen. I would suck comfort out of my bright yellow Sony Sports Walkman, which was host to a parade of Maxell-brand mix tapes that were replaced biweekly, but always held the same songs. Sometimes they started with The Smiths, and usually they ended with The Cure. My Favorite captures these memories, and serves them up with the synth-infused respect they deserve. I love this music because I love everything that came before it. The Happiest Days of Our Lives is an unashamed love letter to 80s British new wave. Johnny Marr's jangle snuggles up to New Order's electronics. Singer/songwriter Michael Grace, Jr. wants to be an American Morrissey, telling tales of heartbreak from between the cinderblock walls of his dorm room. In ""Badge"", he croons, ""I examine the pictures on my wall/ I am the pictures on my wall/ Then nothing."" His songs tackle the mind-numbing stupidity of suburbia (the boy/girl pop-rocker ""The Suburbs Are Killing Us""), college crushes (""L=P""), and confessions of love though depreciated audio formats (""The Black Cassette""). In splitting vocal duties with Andrea Vaughn, the melodrama becomes all the more convincing-- at times, it borders on poignant: ""Loneliness is pornography to them, but to us it is an art."" The Happiest Days of Our Lives compiles three out-of-print EPs released by My Favorite since 2000, as well as four new tracks. But it also includes an additional disc featuring fourteen ""controversial"" remixes by Soviet, Flowchart, Phofo, Alexander Peris, Future Bible Heroes, Double Agent, and a host of others. Somehow, My Favorite escaped the all-consuming maw of the recently defunct electro movement, but the majority of these remixes serve as a ""what if,"" reworking the band's songs into irreverent dance hymns to Casey Spooner. A handful of others attempt to bring something new to the original material. Phofo's interpretation of ""Le Monster"" is a bizarrely enjoyable mash-up of styles, from mambo and bossa nova to 60s French pop, while three artists rework ""Homeless Club Kids"". Alexander Perls turns it into the dance anthem its title begs for. Double Agent's take on is a booming miasma of drums and echoing vocals, complete with a nuclear blast in the middle. However, though the electro-pop doodles of Stephin Merritt are usually a joy, the 8:22 runtime of the Future Bible Heroes remix is nearly impenetrable, even as far as club-friendly remixes go. All told, My Favorite set out to appeal to a distinct class of music fans: If you don't know every lyric to Meat Is Murder, or never patched a broken heart with Disintegration, you'll likely be mystified by the band's dreamy teenage anthems. Those of us who fall into this category, however, will find it an blissful journey back into days that were anything but.","In high school, I thought I was a victimized nonconformist trapped in a world that didn't understand me.\n ...

The Yes Album / Fragile / Close to the Edge / Tales from Topographic Oceans / Relayer / Going for the One / Tormato / Drama / 90125,Yes,"by: Chris Dahlen, Dominique Leone & Joe Tangari",,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23f5e6ef9596932038e/1:1/w_160/9e0f6207.jpg,2004-02-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11869-the-yes-album-fragile-close-to-the-edge-tales-from-topographic-oceans-relayer-going-for-the-one-tormato-drama-90125/,AtlanticAtlantic,"I. Exposition: Time and a Word Odds are you already have an opinion on Yes, and since you're reading this website, there's a good chance that your view of them isn't a favorable one. Despite the fact that a formidable portion of the music we love (anyone from Radiohead and Super Furry Animals to Hella) is directly influenced by Yes and their prog-rock peers, we tend to look at the early 70s through punk's distorting lens, and that lens shows us images of dinosaur muso wankers lumbering from stadium to stadium with comically oversized light shows and Victorian clothing (never mind that punk itself became a mill of convention and spectacle in only a few short years). Of course, there's quite a nugget of truth to that image; on-again-off-again Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman staging his Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table album as an ice show alone demonstrates how out of hand things could get when the budget was too big and judgment was lacking. When you move beyond the pageantry and pomp, though, you're left with some pretty interesting music. Yes were the most popular and longest lasting of the quartet of bands that defined progressive rock in the early 70s. Genesis, ELP, and King Crimson were the others, and listening back to them, it's easy to see why Yes won out. For all their lengthy songs, virtuoso musicianship and softheaded philosophical musings, Yes were fundamentally approachable, even radio-friendly. Try listening to ""Roundabout"" or ""I've Seen All Good People"" without getting them stuck in your head. Of course, there's a certain ridiculousness to the grandiose Roger Dean artwork, would-be poetic lyrics (random sample: ""Battleships, confide in me and tell me where you are!""), and multi-part suite naming formulas-- but then, that's part of why Yes got listened to in the first place. Nevertheless, a past penchant for prog is a major skeleton in the closet for a lot of people, but as Rhino reissues the first eleven Yes studio albums, it feels as good a time as any to let the bones rattle in public. Feel free to forgo the band's first two albums with guitarist Peter Banks (we did), records that feature a band still finding its feet and occasionally hitting on something great, like ""Astral Traveler"", but often stumbling. II. The Albums: The Solid Time of Change Yes had already released two albums, but 1971's The Yes Album was the record that put them on American FM radio and into millions of living rooms around the world. With guitarist Steve Howe on board for the first time, it also established the classic Yes sound, where essentially any instrument could take the lead at any time. Drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Chris Squire (the only member to appear on every Yes album) were a tight and angular, almost funky rhythm section by this point, while Howe's slashing guitar parts fit nicely into that mix. The two-part ""I've Seen All Good People"" is one of the band's best singles, while Howe's slow, spacey guitar build at the end of ""Starship Trooper"" is one of the great Yes moments. Howe also shows off his acoustic chops on ""The Clap"", a rollicking rag that bears little resemblance to anything else in the band's catalog (the original album version was a live recording, the reissue also appends a slightly crisper studio version). This album showcases Yes at their most concise, and is probably the best starting point. 1972's Fragile introduced Yes' highest-powered line-up, as the silver-cape wearing, 12-keyboard-hauling Rick Wakeman replaced the mediocre Tony Kaye. But the question is, what was ""fragile?"" Their egos? The battle between the perfectly balanced arrangements-- as on classic rock radio staples ""Roundabout"" and ""Long Distance Runaround""-- and each virtuoso's need to grandstand, vented through five solo interludes (most memorably Steve Howe's ""Mood for a Day"")? All that firepower could have ruined the band, yet on Fragile, they put songcraft firmly over indulgence. The intriguing middle section of ""South Side of the Sky"" might've blown up like a laser light show had they recorded it in the late 70s, and even though the band had a knack for crescendos and flighty, eagle-centric lyrics, they were more likely to get high through chugging guitars and Bruford's precise drumwork than outright bombast. ""Heart of the Sunrise"" still holds up as a deftly constructed proto math-rock epic, and Jon Anderson would never sing a lyric as plainly as ""I feel lost in the city"" again. The band's crowning achievement, Close to the Edge, contains only three lengthy ""songs,"" but each one is an absolute epic. The title track dominates all of side one of the original LP, rushing in with a burbling, dissonant intro, Howe's jagged riffing and Wakeman's fluttering fingers building a dense, overpowering texture. Squire's bass in the majestic ""Total Mass Retain"" section could liquefy solid tissue at the right volume; it's almost impossible to believe it hasn't been made into a hip-hop sample yet. Most importantly, the title track has a sense of coherent progression, tension and release that most of the band's other side-filling epics lack. ""And You and I"" is arguably the ten most gorgeous minutes Yes ever laid to tape. It begins humbly, with twelve-string acoustic guitar, rises through mellotron-soaked crescendos, and then does it all again, building to a huge closing climax called ""Apocalypse"", essentially laying out the blueprint for Sigur Rós. That leaves ""Siberian Khatru"" to close out the album with nine minutes of hook-stuffed organ and guitar interplay, understated harmony vocals and more of Squire's chunky, front-and-center bass playing. This record is an essential document of just how powerful prog could be when focused. It couldn't last. On 1974's Tales from Topographic Oceans, they simply took things too far. Anderson's lyrics (supposedly based on Japanese ""shastrick"" scriptures, wtf?) are pure astral hogwash, and even worse, they're printed so you can read them. The band seems totally disinterested in communicating musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it) squanders its few inspired moments. ""The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)"" is the most promising, opening with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe, but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had, and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of ""The Remembering (High the Memory)"", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling. It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career. Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion. Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork. However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made Relayer a fan-favorite, the record is all but unlistenable to the rest of the world. Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of any Yes record. Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; ""Gates of Delirium"" is a kind of nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale. That's followed by ""Soundchaser"", a vomit stew of jarring rhythms and bastardized funk climaxing with Anderson's infamous ""cha cha cha"" section. And ""To Be Over"" would've been pretty if they hadn't jammed it with instrumentals. Someone once told me that this is what they should have blasted at Noriega to drive him out of that nunnery; casual listeners turned their backs on this mess, while fans that could appreciate its dissonant, virtuosic extremes hid under their headphones and just kept basking. After an extended hiatus following Relayer, Yes regrouped for 1977's Going for the One, bringing grand old ham Wakeman back to record an album of much fewer pretensions than anything they'd done since Fragile. Of course, that really meant only one 15-minute epic instead of four, but right down to the non-Roger Dean cover art, it signaled a new start for Yes. The title track, with Howe's great steel-guitar opening riff, did indeed reveal a band that still knew how to rock even if lyrics like, ""Get the idea cross around the track, underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser,"" exposed their hippie-mystic trappings. However, Squire's ""Parallels"" and the Beatlesque ""Wonderous Stories"" forecast the band's 80s rebirth as pop stars. Furthermore, the album's lone concession to headier days and side-length symphonettes, ""Awaken"", was a fairly amazing example of how Yes could fuse new age sentiments and reverb-drenched tinker-bell soliloquies, yet somehow come out unscathed. Sure, it went on a bit too long, but in retrospect, it was a fine last gasp for a band concerned with ""progress"" in the 70s. Perhaps inspired by the fact they didn't all hate each other after finishing Going for the One, Yes took the same lineup in for 1978's Tormato. However, even as streamlined song-lengths and a couple of attempts at pop crossover appeared, the band sounded desperate rather than invigorated. Primary offenders on an album among the most hated of all hated Yes records include the flat, rigid ""Don't Kill the Whale"", in which Wakeman managed to insert ridiculously baroque synth stylings into a would-be Greenpeace disco protest anthem, while Anderson pleads with us to ""dig it."" And whomever thought it was a good idea to invite Anderson's kid to twee it up on ""Circus of Heaven"" should probably have been fired on the spot. Oh right: it was Anderson, and he left right after this record. It's too bad, because relatively aggressive, driving numbers like ""Future Times"" and the fusion-tinged ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"" weren't bad, even if the album's lack of punch throughout sucked the life out of most of the music. With Anderson's and Wakemen's defections, Yes recognized that they could no longer continue in the same lackluster manner as on Tormato. At the end of the 1970s, the band finally felt ready to embrace a new era. A Buggles era! Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, possessing neat new synthesizers and actual MTV experience, joined for 1980's Drama, and paved the way for a decade of Yes at their most pop-friendly. The transition, however, was not an easy one. For starters, longtime fans weren't fooled for a minute by Horn's vocals, which didn't quite hit those high notes as easily as Anderson. Also, songs like ""White Car"" and ""Into the Lens"" just didn't sound like Yes, rather like Yes-influenced, overblown AOR fare. However, ""Machine Messiah"", ""Does It Really Happen?"" and especially the new-wave-meets-prog of ""Tempus Fugit"" were better than anything the band had done in years and, doubtlessly due to the Buggle-presence, sparkled with state-of-the-art production sheen. Of course, this lineup would disband shortly after the record, but lessons were learned and the next time Yes graced the world with an album, the world listened. On Drama, Horn had simply attempted to emulate Jon Anderson, but by the time he produced 1983's 90125 for the (yet again) newly reformed and reconfigured Yes, he had become the synth-pop genius behind ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the Zang Tuum Tumb label, and gets no small share of credit for reinventing Yes as a hit 80s pop band. The extensive drum and horn samples on ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" and the glowing a capella on ""Leave It"" turned those songs into radio hits; but just when you think they've sold out, they write elaborate pop songs like ""It Can Happen"" or characteristically bizarre lyrics like, ""This world I like/ We architects of life,"" or, ""Your heart is inside your head."" This line-up formed practically from scratch, bringing Squire and White back together with Anderson and the long-lost Tony Kaye; Trevor Rabin-- the only one who didn't bleach his hair-- completed the band with an 80s hard rock guitar sound that's the most dated thing about the record. Still, if you can handle the style-disconnect, 90125's songcraft makes it one of their tightest records. III. Recapitulation: High the Memory Yes may have disappeared commercially after 90125, but they're still active today in varying lineups, and have a full nine subsequent studio albums that Rhino has wisely chosen not to reissue. The much-delayed follow-up to 90125, Big Generator, was a dud of spectacular proportions (in all seriousness: 0.0), and few of their subsequent releases are much better. For all intents and purposes, the band that tours now is something of a traveling history lesson, so it'll be interesting to see how hindsight treats them in another twenty or so years, when they've finally hung it up and rested on their laurels. For now, don't surround yourself with yourself and move on back a square. Yes would love to meet you.",,8.1,
Tomorrow Is Again,Relict,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2faea9e61561daa4b96/1:1/w_160/c681e971.jpg,2004-02-08 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6911-tomorrow-is-again/,Vegas Morn,"Minimalism and subtlety aren't words that are often used to describe indie pop. Jingle-jangle guitars, heart-on-sleeve lyrics, bouncy pop melodies, or even post-Spector/MBV washes of sound are typically the bricks and mortars of that sound. Hitting the nail on the head or getting up and/or creating sounds to bop around the room to is fine and all, but at times, graceful tones and small gestures can be more riveting. The debut album by The Relict, a loose collective built around the gentle songwriting of former Clientele man Innes Phillips, captures that sometimes elusive hazy, textural charm. Functioning more as a loose group of friends and collaborators than a full-time band, The Relict features vocal performances from a who's who of intelligent pop front people: The Clientele's Alasdair MacLean, Pipas' Lupe N\xB7\xD2ez-FerxB7ndez, Pam Berry (The Pines, Glo-Worm, Black Tambourine), and Abigail Marvell, as well as Phillips himself. The Relict's debut, Tomorrow Is Again, is the culmination of years of work, featuring six tracks which appeared on the group's low-key 7"" releases over the past four years-- ""Southern Way"" (which was recorded at the same session as The Clientele's glorious ""Reflections After Jane"" / ""An Hour Before the Light"" double A-side), ""Along the Avenue"", ""Held in Glass"", ""Childlike"", ""I Saw Your Eyes"", and ""Letters""-- as well as six previously unreleased songs. A well-selected batch, the only largely regrettable omission is ""Out of Time"" which appeared on a Johnny Kane split single with Below the Sea. Phillips' songwriting shares a number of qualities with MacLean's. It's an enveloping, nuance-filled sound that paints pictures yet seems to present them in either different states of completion or to cast alike images in various shades of light. Which isn't to say The Relict's songs sounds like sketches-- these are fully formed tracks, heartfelt and evocative but in a spacious, windswept way that invites the listener to fill in the contextual details or to attach his or her own associations. The Relict are at their best when they shade closest to the woozy autumnal melancholy of The Clientele. It's then that Phillips' dexterity as a songwriter is best revealed and his propensity for highlighting slight movements in tone, mood, and pitch is most effective. The removal of elements from typical indie pop structures allows him to relish in the empty space, to let a chime or chord or moment linger, compounding the record's faraway, 8mm feel without sacrificing its delicacy or elegance. As a result, a track like ""Time Spent with You"" lingers and hovers like the memory of its titular moments and ""Held in Glass"" perfectly balances the contradictions of its protagonists, actively seeking to interact with their world but still feeling trapped, restricted, and ultimately alone. As with any record that seeks to sort of gently lull and woo, Tomorrow Is Again risks drifting from the speakers and never making a connection with its listener. Pastoral and haunting, The Relict's charms are subtle but not slight. The song's charms and the emotions they capture are more like a single ray peeking through the clouds than a bright sun-- welcome not only because they're rare and coveted, but also because it feels somehow as if they're potentially fleeting and fluid. So when MacLean sings, ""I'll always remember your smile,"" on ""Letters"", it's either bitter or sweet-- it just depends on whether his sky is cloudy or not.","Minimalism and subtlety aren't words that are often used to describe indie pop.

1+3+1,Triosk Meets Jan Jelinek,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87413d1975652139662/1:1/w_160/9393e6a5.gif,2004-02-05 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8251-131/,~scape,"""Hence the album's titled 1+3+1-- it's a reference to how it was made. He sent us stuff, then we did stuff, then he added the final touches. He did a little bit more editing and production and mixed and mastered it in Berlin.""
--Triosk drummer Laurence Pike to Jasmine Critteneden, December 2003, Jazzgroove Call it The Postal Service II. Triosk is an otherwise unknown Australian jazz trio that liken their compositional approach to the loops and ""clever layering of sound"" of electronic music. Pike's ""he"" is Berliner Jan Jelinek, of course, easily one of the most consistent and multi-capable electronic artists around today, and whose Loop-Finding-Jazz-Records Pike once heard on late-night radio and now credits as one of the trio's primary influences. In fact, in the past, Jelinek samples constituted Triosk's primary sound source: live and on record, the trio play controlled improvised sets atop a collection of loops that emanate from a nearby mini-disc; as the loops change, the trio reacts accordingly. And indeed, 1+3+1 sounds like a jazz trio not playing alongside Jelinek's material, but atop it. At most times, Triosk overpowers Jelinek's original loops to the point of near-obliteration. Which is somewhat ironic, I guess: On projects such as Loop-Finding-Jazz-Records, Jelinek nominally works with the vinyl physicalities and actual sounds of jazz records, though no one would ever know that jazz was the source material for his clicks and hazy dub atmospherics. While it's important to an extent to meet the record on its own terms (i.e. Triosk is not simply attempting organic covers of Jelinek tracks, but are using the loops essentially as jumping-off points for their own compositions), Jelinek devotees, of which I am one, may be somewhat disappointed by the great absence of audible Jelinek presence. His minimalism is a compositional one, certainly, and Triosk masters this aspect of Jelinek. That said, Jelinek is not a loop composer in the vein of Philip Jeck or Ekkehard Ehlers; the sounds Jelinek uses are themselves minimal, and the extent to which he can maintain a curious degree of the listener's interest despite this sonic temperament bears witness to his high-horsery. 1+3+1 is not minimalist jazz; it is loop-based jazz, influenced and produced by a minimalist composer, and then given to a jazz trio with post-rock tendencies. Of course, with post-rock tendencies comes the very real possibility of tedium via unmodified repetitions, and Triosk falls into this rut often. The agility of Jelinek's builds and collapses becomes apparent in contrast, as Triosk gets caught in a loop and always seems to stay in it a minute or so too long before making their next alteration. Opening track ""Mis-Leader"", while benefiting slightly from the post-Triosk Jelinek production miasma, suffers from this languor, and to a lesser extent ""On the Lake"" does as well. The deliberate and hazy ""Munmorah"", which superficially sounds the most similar to Jelinek's ambient output, lacks the degree of Jelinek's subtle modifications. That said, there are three tracks on 1+3+1 where Triosk and Jelinek meet equally, and we finally understand the vast potential for their alliance. ""Track 2"" is essentially relentless free jazz run through whatever there is of a Jelinek glitch machine. Jelinek slices up Triosk's passionate outbursts, repackages and resequences them across the pan and in and out of a beautifully dusty mix, and in short, there is never a dull moment, a testament equally to Triosk's chops and to Jelinek's fanciful post-production. ""Theme from Trioskinek"" bears effectively less Jelinek influence, but seems to represent what the trio intended to come of the other tracks, quickly and seamlessly moving from one loop to the next, never staying on one for too long. ""Vibes-Pulse"" is all build, finding its beginnings in an audible Jelinek sequence, and then focusing on a fantastically reverbed vibraphone loop until Jelinek's stormy cloud reaches supersaturation and dissipates. It's a shame Jelinek didn't have more to do with this record; 1+3+1's best moments-- when Triosk's wider dynamic and range of possible sound meets Jelinek's agility and degree of subtlety-- are the ones that most clearly betray his influence.",,7.3,
Bows and Arrows,The Walkmen,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9c69d034d5c69bf3cee/1:1/w_160/ffbbb7db.jpg,2004-02-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8572-bows-and-arrows/,Recordcollection,"Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone was among my favorite records from 2002; the debut full-length was warmly luminous, equal parts humility and grandeur. The Walkmen tiptoed where other bands stomp, and if they broke a few eggshells, they did so only when least expected, and in a strangely elegant manner. Their hollow, reverberating guitars and ""cinematic"" atmosphere earned a few apt comparisons to War- or Joshua Tree-era U2-- keyboards aren't made that placid, or guitars that jangly, by accident, folks-- but this comparison still strikes me as ridiculous. I might be more willing to accept the parallels had U2 played Christmas music in Vaudeville; I know the song's called ""The Blizzard of '96"", but the last time I heard so many bells was on a sleigh ride to grandma's house. The first album was a process of trial and error, with the desire to make music taking precedence over a clear goal, and even then they were impressive. Now, exactly one infamous car commercial later, The Walkmen find themselves signed to the Jason Dill-affiliated Record Collection label, which means a distribution deal through Warner Bros, and for the first time, a kung-fu grip on their sophisticated, fragile-yet-aggressive aesthetic. Despite the consistency of Everyone, it tended to drift aimlessly through pastoral passages, which were sometimes charming but just as often faceless next to highly structured compositions like the incomparable ""We've Been Had"", or ""Wake Up""; on Bows and Arrows, every moment feels deliberate and meaningful. But ""what's in it for me?"" laments Hamilton Leithauser, commiserating with a doleful church organ and trembling, sorry plinks of their now-famously ancient piano, as he opens the album. Well, quite a lot, actually; with so much poised and in place, this is as close to a career-defining moment as any band is likely to have, but if the guys are nervous, they aren't letting on. The easy ebb and flow of ""What's in It for Me?"" is disarmingly comfortable. ""I came here for a good time/ Now you're tellin' me to leave/ Well, I heard you the first time,"" he sings, casually prodding that sense of resigned disappointment everyone's felt at one time or another, and simultaneously reassuring that it'll eventually pass. Maybe the improbable and correspondingly short-lived signing of Jonathan Fire*Eater (elder project of three-out-of-five Walkmen) served as preparation for this moment on the cusp, but their confidence is overwhelming. Their extreme lack of urgency is enthralling, and paradoxically, more of a wake-up call to listeners than any sort of chest-thumping, browbeating assault. The Walkmen refuse to be rushed; they have the acumen to overwhelm, but only when they're good and ready. Although the delicate sheen of more relaxed numbers like the beautifully faded bar-room regret of ""138th Street"", the supersilent ""Hang On, Siobhan"", or even the comparatively cheerful piano-tinkling of ""New Year's Eve"" is impressive, with a focus that would shame most of the interim tracks from Everyone, the few rock standouts are seemingly miles out of their league. The entire record buckles from the force of ""The Rat""; guitars pound tirelessly forward, and Matt Barrick's brilliant, relentless drumming becomes truly demoniacal. Tortured, sleepless, Leithauser screams for retribution, or even simple recognition: ""Can't you hear me when I'm calling out your name?"" ""The Rat"" could be The Walkmen's finest moment, if they didn't immediately surpass it with ""Little House of Savages"", which most clearly demonstrates how immeasurably these guys have tightened as a band. Paul Maroon leads with a cyclical riff as the band unloads their full inventory of aggressive histrionics into the resulting hypnotically tangled mess, like a rock 'n' roll fire sale. I'll even concede that Leithauser's voice now actually merits, albeit rarely, an occasional allusion to Bono (if crossed with a gravel pit); when The Walkmen are in full-on assault mode, the vocal comparison doesn't seem quite so silly. With just these two songs, the vast refinement demonstrated on all the comparatively subdued tracks comes dangerously close to being nullified-- it's all too easy to overlook the wealth of great material in the massive shadow of just these two songs (the wistful ""Thinking of a Dream"" is energetic, but also pales in comparison), but listen closer: On such a triumphant album, The Walkmen don't succumb to filler. Each of these songs displays a mastery of craft rarely heard, and while not all strike with the same immediacy of its two unbreakable watersheds, each quickly reveals itself as equally forcible and infectious. Beyond this, no grandiose claims warrant stating; Bows and Arrows states them itself.

Come Feel Me Tremble / Dead Man Shake,Paul WesterbergGrandpaboy,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa03b1335d7bf16995bd/1:1/w_160/76793b06.jpg,2004-02-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11864-come-feel-me-tremble-dead-man-shake/,Vagrant,"Paul Westerberg's solo efforts have always been notoriously spotty, and his relentless presence-- releasing albums on four different labels, under two names-- has somehow shoved him even further back into the colorless, rocker-without-a-band horizon. Now, releasing two brand new records (Come Feel Me Tremble, the soundtrack to his 2002 tour documentary, and Dead Man Shake, under shifty alias Grandpaboy), Westerberg is taking one last stab at escaping his disproportionately lame destiny. Grandly somersaulting between styles and bouncing from name to fakename, Westerberg seems tried of being Westerberg. And it's awfully easy to understand why. Ultimately, it's not entirely Paul Westerberg's fault that most of his solo records sound formulaic to the point of tedium-- in the early 90s, the newly defunct Replacements were shamelessly co-opted by countless alt-rockers, with each bland, mediocre re-interpretation further deadening everybody's ears to the majestic howls of its sloppy originator. The Replacements were deservedly beloved, and for Westerberg, listening to alternative radio must have occasionally felt like squinting into a funhouse mirror-- familiar and grotesque at the same time. Each watered-down bar band shout and canned guitar riff became a distorted version of his own perfect, recorded truth (see also Westerberg's timely determination that longtime follower Ryan Adams ""needs to have his teeth kicked in""). Given all this, Grandpaboy, Westerberg's freewheeling, bluesman pseudonym, might just be Westerberg's (gentler) way of reminding future generations that there are plenty of other bands to rip off besides The Replacements. That Westerberg convinced Epitaph subsidiary/Mississippi blues-pushers Fat Possum to release Dead Man Shake is telling: Copping freely from the sludgy Chuck-Berry-by-way-of-the-Stones canon, the album sees Westerberg abandoning his own well-imitated chops for the super-derivative, ever-repeating blues-rock paradigm. Snatching everything from coarse, booze-addled howls to an entirely nonsensical, not-quite-supported moniker (even The White Stripes are more convincing public fibbers), Grandpaboy's second long-player is another contemporary reinterpretation of gritty Delta babbling. But no matter how hard Westerberg tries to bury it, Grandpaboy still screams his name. Ramshackle, jumpy and curiously charming, Dead Man Shake is full of Westerberg's trademark spastic vocals and nimble guitar work, only now determinably fuzzed up and shrouded in Sun Records spunk. With nine new songs and a handful of covers (including songs by Hank Williams Sr. and John Prine), the record stumbles between styles, but still offers more variety, kick and shameless soloing than Westerberg-as-Westerberg. ""No Matter What You Say"" is the record's most convincing departure: Westerberg yelps and purrs, his lazy, lustful vocals dripping with unnamed longing while first-take guitar noodles run circles around some perfectly unsophisticated percussion (Westerberg plays all the instruments here, including the ones he does not actually know how to play). Opener ""MPLS"" is slightly less raw, with hokey, rockabilly guitar and purely autobiographical lyrics (""On the Mississippi River/ Born in '59.""). The song, whose title abbreviates the full name of his hometown, Minneapolis, has a mind-numbing chorus (shocker: ""M-P-L-S"") and some goofy melodic turns, but Westerberg's guitar playing has never been so fiery, and even the nervous cymbal crashes are somehow spot-on. Westerberg's closing cover of crooner-fave ""What Kind of Fool Am I?"" (see comparable interpretations by, yes, Robert Goulet, Sammy Davis Jr. or Perry Como) is noteworthy just for the sheer scratch of the vocals-- eschewing the kind of syrup-voiced goo that the song so stubbornly demands, Westerberg karaoke-caterwauls, his voice off-key, cigarette-tinged and awesomely brash. Meanwhile, Westerberg himself admits that Come Feel Me Tremble might as well be considered Side 3 of last year's Stereo-- picking up where that album left off, Come Feel Me Tremble is a scrappy, lo-fi collection of acoustic folk songs and storming rock ballads, some of which are excellent (""Wild and Lethal"", ""Meet Me Down the Alley"") and some that are disappointingly mediocre. ""Never Felt Like This Before"" mixes wobbly piano with Westerberg's salty vocals, and the effect is perfectly subdued; ""Knockin' Em Back"" is a perky drinking anthem, aggressive at all the right moments, shifting back and forth between giggly acoustics and head-hitting guitar slams. Nearly every track included here (all of which were recorded in Westerberg's basement) takes one of these two approaches, and while the juxtaposition keeps listeners awake, the transitions aren't always entirely logical-- in the end, Come Feel Me Tremble suffers for its lack of cohesion. Thus, the conundrum of the stalled artist: In a bold attempt to trot away from his past, Westerberg seems to have misplaced his future. Dead Man Shake is playful, but the record never really becomes compelling enough to rise above its ""alter-ego"" stigma; Come Feel Me Tremble is also nice enough, but ultimately lacks the hyper, Westerberg-ian spark that can, when present, make his work so insanely inviting. If nothing else, Westerberg's quirky solo career may finally convince some of his devotees to stop stealing his stuff and to go sniff out their own (inconsistent) sounds.","

"I Don't Know Who I Am: Let the War Against Music Begin, Vol. 2",The Minus 5,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c551c0084474cd0c3706/1:1/w_160/55ea14c8.gif,2004-02-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5319-i-dont-know-who-i-am-let-the-war-against-music-begin-vol-2/,Normal,"By far the strangest thing I've ever heard the train conductor announce over the intercom is, ""Your attention, please: We're waiting for a coroner to show up. We'll keep you posted."" This happened just yesterday, in fact-- the commuter train I was riding hit a pedestrian at top speed, killing him. As it turns out, realizing that the reason your train hasn't moved for three hours is because someone is dead throws your annoyance into perspective. It was in this setting that I became familiar with Scott McCaughey's latest Minus 5 offering, a limited release called I Don't Know Who I Am. Astute fans have probably already noted the parenthetical title, Let the War Against Music Begin, Vol. 2, which, for the initiated, tells most of the album's backstory. These 13 songs are the leftovers from the original sessions for McCaughey's 2001 split LP between his now-defunct power-pop band the Young Fresh Fellows and his ongoing all-star collective The Minus 5 (The Minus 5 half was titled Let the War Against Music Begin)-- not that you'd ever guess they were castoffs to listen to them. I Don't Know Who I Am is easily as strong as the material that made it onto the original album, and in a lot of cases, it's more effective. McCaughey's Minus 5 albums have always showcased his darker, more experimental side, but this record moves more sharply in that direction than any of the others, including last January's Down with Wilco, focusing almost exclusively on downtempo dirges and supplanting the typical jangle with roomfuls of electronic keyboards. Even so, it's a little surreal listening to a song as bitingly humorous as ""Rooting for the Plague"" in one ear while craning to hear a conductor quietly discuss cleaning up the rapidly freezing remains of some unfortunate person. That humor is what makes even McCaughey's darkest work easy to sit through; he always seems a step ahead of any critic who might accuse him of miserablism, and his head is stuffed with bitterly funny stuff like the fantastic childhood memoir ""I Don't Want to Fuck Off Anymore"", a song that rides a bizarre banjo part that's played almost as if it were a sitar. Over this weird, two-step backing, he offers lines like, ""You tried new ways to say it when I was twelve/ like 'leave me alone,' 'go play in traffic,' 'get lost,' and 'go to hell,'"" making for one of the most left-field songs he's ever recorded. Other highlights include the synthstrings-coated ballad ""Queen's Head"", whose great melody is delivered sans-embellishment by McCaughey's thick, almost Tom Petty-ish tenor. ""Tunnel of Lungs"" is slow-motion power-pop with a penchant for anatomy metaphors and some nice swelling vocal harmonies on the chorus, while the feedback-tinged dirge of opener ""There Is No Music"" recalls the broken-down pop of Big Star's Third. It's entirely possible that my impression of I Don't Know Who I Am is irreparably colored by the strange circumstances under which I came to love it, but I believe it's an arresting album that deserves better than a limited runoff of a couple thousand discs. McCaughey is one of those perennial also-rans that litter the pop landscape, a great songwriter in his own right, but seemingly destined to forever be overshadowed by the other work of his own collaborators (see: Wilco, Peter Buck, The Posies, High Llamas). And who knows? Maybe that's the way he likes it. With a little more pressure and scrutiny, he may not have had the guts to make such a subversively smart record.","By far the strangest thing I've ever heard the train conductor announce over the intercom is, ""Your attention, please ...

Thunder Perfect Mind,Current 93,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f7ea9e61561daa54ac/1:1/w_160/56e29b9a.jpg,2004-02-05 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1750-thunder-perfect-mind/,DurtroDurtro,"Named for Aleister Crowley's ""93 Current,"" a concept involving the internalization of spiritual change by select men of power, David Tibet's work is loaded with spiritualist references. Revering innocence and darkness, Tibet has also worked his childhood and present relationships into the complex cosmos. According to David Keenan in his excellent book, England's Hidden Reverse: A Secret History of England's Esoteric Underground, Tibet was inspired to take a personal approach to his lyricism after listening to Shirley Collins and reading Pascal and Kierkegaard. As he says, ""I didn't want to be involved in anything that wasn't specifically dealing with one's own soul."" His world is peopled with outsider artists like Louis Wain, the fantastical writings of Thomas Ligotti and Count Stenbock, apocalyptic literature (especially Maldoror and William Blake), sleepytime language via Joyce's Finnegans Wake, and musical anomalies like Arthur Doyle and Abner Jay. Despite the cryptic ingredients, Tibet's path is lined with children's toys and The Wicker Man, Blue Öyster Cult and Love, Sand and Six Organs of Admittance. Perhaps the most important (or at least visible) aspect of his poetics is world religion: Tibetan Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and Paganism. So, yeah, some approach Current 93's output like a graduate seminar. Most, however, attack the allusions intuitively, smoke some cloves and fade into its atmosphere. Such a rich backdrop could result in stilted stodginess, but Tibet funnels the information through punk roots and a great ear for off-kilter (or off-key) melody. Before founding Current 93 in 1982, he was a member of two jaggedly danceable, wonderfully chaotic industrial groups, 23 Skidoo and Psychic TV, and he incorporates these beginnings into his singular mix of atonal vocalizations, nursery rhymes, spoken word/scream, Incredible String Band pastorals, religious chants, ambient interludes and spot-on traditionals. A constant experimenter, too, he never left behind his more raucous early years completely, apt to unleash extended noise freakouts, blending the shepherd's song with the Downtown. One of the strongest examples of this teeter between abstract noise and intimate soul-bearing is the epic Thunder Perfect Mind, a dense musical allegory released in 1992. Its title comes from the Gnostic poem, The Thunder: Perfect Mind. (Parts of its text are spoken and snarled by Tibet on the track ""Thunder Perfect Mind I"".) Interestingly, after Nurse with Wound's Steven Stapleton, a collaborator on almost all of C93's releases, had a dream that his next release would also be Thunder Perfect Mind, he recorded an album of the same name and released it alongside Tibet's. His is droning electronic pulses, tones, twitters-- an ever-escalating loop of frozen machine-age ominousness. According to David Keenan, Thunder Perfect Mind was originally conceived as a concept album, an ""apocalyptic Tommy,"" in Tibet's words, but he condensed its concepts into the album's opener, ""The Descent of Long Satan and Babylon"". (You can unpack that one yourself.) Now, though, the record stands as a haunting collection of ballads and laments. Here, the longest and perhaps most complex piece is the 16-plus minute ""Hitler as Kalki (SDM)"", dedicated to ""my father who fought Hitler."" Joined by The Bevis Frond's Nick Saloman on psych guitar, Tibet, as Keenan put it, ""explores the terrifying idea, first put forward by the Hindu social Darwinist, Holocaust denier and Hitler worshipper Savitri Devi Mukherji ('SDM,' as Tibet refers to her in the title), that Hitler was in fact the final avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu, and the initiator of apocalypse."" On it, noodles turn to frantic strumming and acid-jazz wah, culminating in a tripped-out, near-metal feedback solo and after total vocal histrionics, Tibet's ominous whispers. Less sinister, ""A Sadness Song"" is melancholy 4AD ethereality. On it, Tibet's imagery and Rose McDowall's background vocals fill the gaps of an existential reminiscence. (The track shows up again as ""A Sad Sadness Song"", with McDowall alone intoning the tale). Another gorgeous work (and a mind-fuck for its recipient), ""A Song for Douglas After He's Dead"" was written for Douglas Pierce of Death in June: harp, harmonic guitar, bells, violin, and McDowall spin and sigh behind maniacal incantations. Besides the album, this reissue comes with all the studio outtakes and live, stripped-down variations on songs from the album-- highlighted by two takes of ""A Song for Douglas After He's Dead"", one hopefully called a ""rebirth."" Another, ""They Return to Their Earth (For My Christ Thorn)"" is a 50s prom performed by a Celtic troupe, Tibet presiding over a room of nervous, angelic teens. Thunder Perfect Mind has long been regarded as an excellent place for uninitiated Current 93 listeners to dive in to David Tibet's 40+ album discography, and though it's certainly not for everyone, it stands as one of the most important works of the last decade. Those who've listened before and couldn't get it the first time, try again.

All Request Live,Ween,by: Dan Miron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9ec5e6ef959693214cd/1:1/w_160/876ff0dd.gif,2004-02-03 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8609-all-request-live/,Chocodog,"Does the world need a seventh official disc of live Ween? Well, no, but at least a few of us find it a happy occurrence. That, presumably, is the reason they've released, via website, a triple set, bracketed by a single live disc, and this latest release, taken from an in-studio webcast-- in addition to a more widely released two-disc set. So your options are open, but let me make a case for this as the definitive live Ween album of the moment: Only three of these tracks appear on their prior live releases, and four of them have never been available on CD until now, so value's in. And if All Request Live is not the best choice if you're looking for dirty-mindedness and sheer rockitude, it is unquestionably the brownest live Ween of them all. That twistedness leads to the biggest plus/minus of the album. Following a wonderfully psychedelic version of ""Happy Colored Marbles"" from 2003's quebec comes ""The Stallion"", Parts 1-5. 18 minutes of screaming, moaning, pounding and thrashing (and briefly, melodic jamming) is funnier in conception than it is in execution. Admittedly, the fact that fans voted online for the first joint appearance of parts 1, 2 & 3 is great. The addition of a new Pt. 4 is genius. The addition of a new Pt. 5 is so wrong it's almost, but not quite, right. Nonetheless, most Weenies take the approach that there's no such thing as too much of a good thing, and in that context, there's quite an appeal to so many variations on a theme, and the boys really do wring more out of it than you'd expect. It's a prime example of their main dichotomy: a sense of humor so puerile that at times even Jack Black would be embarrassed, and musicianship so strong that you'd swear they'd been gigging since the 70s. After this minor rut, the album provides variety in spades: a heartbroken tenor crooner alone at the keyboard; a two-minute boogie-bash wherein Dean demonstrates the happy medium between Eddie Van Halen's notes-per-second and Stevie Ray Vaughan's look-how-far-I-can-bend-this; an awesome deep-southern-fried slow stomp; a version of a Chinese folk dirge to a deceased mate. This array of styles is a huge component of their live releases, as the albums of late have been very thematically focused. quebec is the only recent exception, and this is a better album. Next comes their sketch of the Mang asking Mr. Addled Whiteboy what ""pollo"" means, trailed by an unassailable rendition of ""ReggaeJunkieJew"". A wild example of combined juvenility and accomplishment, it works up to a steady bassline that rocks, funks and calls to mind Pee Wee Herman doing his ""Tequila"" dance. Anything with guitar lines so subtly shredding and lyrics including the word Matsohfarian can only be bowed before. Again with the dichotomy-- two totally straight luv-u-always paeans parenthesizing a freaked and fractured guitar-snarl that seems to equate mononucleosis with a bad psychedelic trip. And one of these odes-to-muse actually proposes, ""'Cause tried and true, I see the light in you. Oh, can you dig in my soul? Could you smell my w/hole... life?"" We've been through the tunnel of Ween, and the absolute highlight is waiting: ""Where'd the Cheese Go?"" is a rendition of the duo's notorious rejected Pizza Hut jingle that's been upped to nearly six minutes. It may be the best balance of idiot/savant they've accomplished to date. The music is burbly Cars intro meets chicken-scratch JB's guitar, double-dating Cameo's vocoder and the ""Purple Rain"" guitar wind-up-- and it's all anchored by a bass so fluid I barely believe it has strings. Never mind how warped the lyrics are. (I could attempt excerpts, but without the accents, it's pretty pointless.) Ween's appeal isn't universal, and this release hews even further from the mainstream than unusual. Good thing, too, as it's in the band's interest to keep their fanbase happy. Even if they garner new devotees, most of them will probably be age 13, thus becoming too cool within a few years for a band so childlike. That leaves Ween with a fairly large fanbase old enough to know better and sharp enough not to care. And that raises an interesting question-- how many die-hards actually bought this disc? I don't think Ween give a shit, but it'd be nice to know how amply they're being rewarded for treating fans right in the course of running their own little web-label.","Does the world need a seventh official disc of live Ween?

Don't Stop EP,Tussle,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a871c0084474cd0c0e1b/1:1/w_160/435a81f4.gif,2004-02-03 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8249-dont-stop-ep/,Troubleman Unlimited,"San Francisco quartet Tussle are about the groove. Their rhythm-heavy lineup-- a traditional drummer, an auxiliary percussionist, a bassist, and a warm body behind the synthesizers-- betrays this dogged preoccupation, as does their decided lack of proper melody, or song structure, or really anything that might distract from their deep 4/4 stomps. Tussle are dub before they're trance or some equally confusing organic abomination, but, to put it crudely, they're able to maintain the warmth of the former without compromising the precision of latter. It's an impressive ""best of both worlds"" equation that, perhaps despite this creative dissonance, allows Tussle to create almost completely hookless tracks that are memorable nonetheless. We experience this sound fully but for too short a time on Don't Stop. The twenty-two minute EP collects one previously released remix of ""Eye Contact"", two new songs (""Windmill"" and the title track), and two remixes of these new songs including a Soft Pink Truth ""disco-hijacked"" reworking of ""Windmill"". The bassline of title track begins typically enough amidst the hi-hat swishes, only to jump suddenly from its lowdown self to an extremely colorful (if off-key) major third, an unexpected but delightful punchline. The auxiliary percussion wades in and out of chamber echo effects and trashy cowbells, eventually forcing the bassline to surrender completely for a few moments before the line recasts itself and beckons the synthesizer into the mix. ""Windmill"" is the title track's crisper cousin, stumbling in with a string of vocal cutups and featuring a reserved but energetic percussion breakdown. Percussion almost entirely subsumes the bassline of Tussle's own remix of ""Eye Contact"", the band hinting at it like dub Picassos, fragmentarily. The Soft Pink Truth remix of ""Windmill"" centers its larger-than-dub beat atop a feisty conga solo, leaving the bassline intact for a time before wrenching it entirely into high-flying kaleidoscopic arpeggios and chopping it up so finely that by the end of the track, the bassline's sole seems purely rhythmic as well. The storied Stuart Argabright approximates simple tape and pitchshifting manipulations, not to mention a peppering of Mego-esque noise, before granting the bassline its proper entrance and subsequent de-evolutions. For songs so minimal to begin with, it's remarkable how well both remixers are able to mine their source material for energy without decimating the songs' original dub appeal. If Tussle can be criticized for anything, it's that their songs can be extremely homogenous, both among the tracks and within the tracks themselves. One can't help but bring up LCD Soundsystem's pretentious mix of ""Yeah"" as a benchmark for similar-sounding releases such as the Don't Stop EP, since the former's infinite depth and versatility seems to be the major point of superiority. In a live setting, I can't imagine Tussle not indulging in more expansive builds and overall jumpiness, and with any luck they might be able to translate this restless energy more readily to their future recordings.","San Francisco quartet Tussle are about the groove.

Dusk at Cubist Castle,Various Artists,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c79d034d5c69bf52d9/1:1/w_160/3520c6fa.jpg,2004-02-03 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5983-dusk-at-cubist-castle/,FlydaddyFlydaddy,"The world will never know just how many potentially great pop albums have been lost to misguided attempts at innovation. Though the implementation of unexpected song structures and ostensibly experimental sounds can make music quite a bit more interesting, it can also render it sterile, flat and emotionless. In many cases, the finest pop songs are those that transcend their form entirely-- songs so instinctually graceful that listening to them feels like a creative act in and of itself. Indeed, the best pop songs are often the most difficult to discuss rationally, those indispensable not for their formal inventiveness but for their ability to tap directly into the intangible realm of human memory and emotion. In the mid-to-late 90s, Athens, Georgia's Elephant Six collective established themselves as a group of artists with a shared interest in expressing the inexpressible through pop music. The Olivia Tremor Control, fronted by singer/songwriters Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss, encapsulated both the collective's unabashed love for both classic pop and psychedelic music, and its sincere interest in experimental music and sounds. This, the band's debut album, represents their most fundamental integration of these two impulses-- never does the record's sonic palette seem like an afterthought to the songs, nor do the songs themselves seem like haphazard carriers for carefully chosen sounds. For an album with so much going on, Dusk at Cubist Castle is strikingly holistic, its diverse elements held together by an uncanny awareness of what they can evoke and represent. The Elephant Six Collective is known largely for their reverence towards classic pop music, and Dusk at Cubist Castle inevitably draws comparisons to The Beatles and Beach Boys. But the influence of these seminal pop groups seems to be evident in the Olivia Tremor Control's approach as much as their aesthetic. One imagines Hart and Doss not simply admiring Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds, but utterly internalizing them-- appreciating them not only for specific melodies and sounds, but also for how affecting those melodies and sounds could be. Though the bouncy basslines and rich vocal harmonies of Dusk often bring to mind Paul McCartney or Brian Wilson, nothing sounds like the result of shallow imitation, as much as reverence and profound understanding. Nowhere is this clearer than on Dusk's near-flawless first half. ""Jumping Fences"", one of the finest songs ever penned by Hart and Doss, conjures an air of introspective melancholy without ever approaching languor. At just under two minutes, ""Jumping Fences"" barely repeats itself at all, instead subtly building upon a beautiful, catchy melody with layered vocal harmonies, pianos and guitars. ""No Growing (Exegesis)"" follows a similar path, this time incorporating dramatic horn blasts into a climactic chorus. The second half of Dusk at Cubist Castle is a decidedly more abstract affair, anchored by the 10-track ""Green Typewriters"" suite. It's here that the experimental undertones of Dusk at Cubist Castle begin to bleed through more noticeably. The fifth ""Green Typewriters"" track is a brief, unsettling, rhythmically insistent drone piece that foreshadows the extended ambience of ""Green Typewriters"" number eight. In part nine, the first discernible vocal melody for about ten minutes simply utters ""how much longer can I wait,"" ushering in a majestic guitar solo that immediately plunges into a swirl of backwards sounds, whooshing cymbals and fuzzed-out chords. After the final installment of ""Green Typewriters"", Dusk at Cubist Castle returns to a slightly more stripped-down and fragmented variation on its first half, finally closing with the ghost-in-the-four-track noises of ""NYC-25"", one of their most affecting pop songs. Aside from granting the album an air of timelessness, Dusk's saturated 4-track production always leaves me with the feeling that there's more to this album than can possibly be heard. And sure enough, eight years after its initial release, Dusk at Cubist Castle still somehow surprises me every time I listen to it. As its title suggests, there's something intensely cinematic about the record, and also something perpetually incomplete-- the images and ideas evoked stay with you much longer than the album itself. It's the masterful translation of these images and ideas that makes Dusk at Cubist Castle such a unique and unforgettable record.","The world will never know just how many potentially great pop albums have been lost to misguided attempts at innovation ...

Lost Sides,Doves,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba03c0084474cd0c273e/1:1/w_160/0d48d1aa.jpg,2004-02-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2431-lost-sides/,Capitol,"The Law of the B-side states that the luscious dregs of unused material doled out by artists on overpriced import singles and lame movie soundtracks will be sought by only the most devoted fans, who will dutifully mine every last scrap of a band's recorded sound, no matter what they'll be made to pay or where they'll be forced to go. So, I tend to wonder who the audience might be for an official collection of a band's non-album tracks-- and that's without tackling the ramifications of the MP3's rise to ubiquity. The Manchester trio Doves, however, have a far more elusive nemesis than the MP3 threatening irrelevance for their B-side compilation, Lost Sides: themselves. These tracks are listed as having been culled from the eight singles spanning their 2000 debut Lost Souls and 2002 follow-up The Last Broadcast, but the fact is, more than half of these songs first saw the light of day as bonus tracks on the stateside release of Lost Souls or on a bonus CD accompanying the domestic limited edition version of The Last Broadcast (which is still readily available). Disregarding the two overtly unnecessary ""alternate"" versions of tracks from Lost Souls, little of the material here is legitimately new to the group's stateside fans. Releasing a collection of rarities when your entire recorded output has yielded only two full-length records could seem an act of putting the cart before the horse; however, the Doves thankfully exist among a legion of B-side crazy Brits whose alternate material is almost as strong as any of the stuff on their actual albums (even if some of it is pulled from those albums). ""Darker"", for instance, is a bout of blissfully fuzzed-out basslines, melancholy guitar arpeggios and rolling breakbeats, while the piano-driven live staple ""Hit the Ground Running"" manages to mutate the Warren Zevon original into a Supergrass-influenced, pub-friendly rocker. ""Valley"" is one of the finest songs in the Doves' repertoire (it was one of Lost Souls' highlights back in 2000); as frontman Jimi Goodwin sings of ""a new day,"" layers of piano chords clash with ricocheting guitar notes, and delayed loops of vocal harmony rounds create a pastoral chill. Even the most inspired moments on Lost Sides, though, make it difficult to overlook the embarrassing glut of superfluous filler. Do the Doves' fans really need a pretentious pseudo-classical version of the Lost Souls highlight ""Break Me Gently"" to introduce the proceedings? How about a Chemical Brothers-aping glowstick nightmare called ""Crunch"", suited in mid-90s breakbeats and k-hole psychedelia? Or ""Down to Sea"", a maudlin rewrite of Lost Souls' ""Sea Songs"" whose sluggish tempo and gratuitous reverb render the exuberant original utterly lifeless? The most confounding aspect of the domestic release of Lost Sides is that it fails to include the UK version's bonus disc of seven remixes from the likes of Four Tet, Magnet and Echoboy. Had Capitol included these previously unreleased remixes with this collection's stateside edition, it's remotely possible that there would be enough new material here to entice U.S. listeners. Otherwise, for the most part, anyone who wants this stuff already has it.","The Law of the B-side states that the luscious dregs of unused material doled out by artists on overpriced import ...

Salmiakki,Sami Koivikko,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2aabf31b7dc7155c61/1:1/w_160/08a4531b.jpg,2004-02-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4569-salmiakki/,Shitkatapult,"One of the most striking and unexpected things about the first wave of microhouse artists is the number of different directions in which they've moved in such a short amount of time. The original templates set by Thomas Brinkmann, Luomo, Isolée, and Matthew Herbert, among others, broke house music down to its most skeletal and microscopic elements. That deconstruction of house's sometimes rigid rules freed producers from the demands of the dancefloor and created a lot of space in which they could weave or add any number of seemingly disparate styles and accents. Now after years of healthy explorations of the house side of tech-house, an increasing number of artists-- including Finland's Sami Koivikko-- are marrying those detail-oriented impulses with more driving, traditional techno. Koivikko's initial flirtations with microhouse resulted in the Kut Pulatin series, three subtle, spacious singles of increasingly intelligent minimal dub-techno. Koivikko's profile was raised when some of his tracks were lifted for Kompakt mixes: ""Brythe"" is on Triple R's too-often overlooked Friends and ""Grunis"" is on Tobias Thomas' exquisite Smallville. Koivikko has quickly followed with his debut, Salmiakko, which strays from the Kompakt aesthetic that first brought him wide attention. Salmiakki is the third jewel in Shitkatapult's 2003 triple crown, following the ambient washes of sound of Apparat's Duplex and the lubs and skips of Anders Ilar's Everdom. On it, Koivikko has largely abandoned the atmospherics of his previous work for a more athletic sound. Like MRI, Koivikko has adopted a more traditionalist stance. Yet whereas those disco/house classicists celebrate All That Glitters, Koivikko does almost the complete opposite, dissecting the robot-funk of classic techno. Of Koivikko's earliest tracks, only ""Brythe"" is included here-- and that's no bad thing, considering that its buoyant shimmer is still the standout in the Finnish producer's arsenal. Elsewhere, Koivikko's work is downright robust. In comparison to most of his peers, he raises the BPMs and places more emphasis on bass, rhythm and propulsion than he does on texture or atmosphere. Like Sascha Funke's Bravo and Villalobos' Alcachofa, Salmiakki oscillates between private listening and more ""public"" sounds (although it leans more heavily to the latter) and still retains more than a few pools of dub. The result is dubby techno-- call it mood music to cut rugs-- that's made just as attractive by its thrust as it is by its tone, and is highlighted by the melodic motorik of ""Kampakuta"", the I-94-meets-Autobahn drive of ""Materialist"", and the noirish ""Matkani"". Microhouse has become so healthy so quickly that it's spawned not only a variety of styles (from the glam of schaffel to digital disco to the neuroromantics of The Present Lover) but also a legion of artists who are doing everything but following blueprints such as Herbert's ""Going Round"" or Isolée's ""Beau Mot Plage"". Salmiakki and DJ Koze's upcoming Kompakt mix offer further indications that microhouse's original elements are rapidly disintegrating. Koivikko is eating the tail of tech-house, winding through its brief history and starting again with a more strict genre sound; DJ Koze's mix does the opposite-- casting such a wide mix that it risks not having an identity at all. Koivikko's record is more effective but possibly more worrying. Thus far, microhouse has been a consistently surprising sound. Its progenitors have ducked and weaved rather than strayed down the dead end of traditionalism. A potential concern is that if producers do pass go and end up back at the starting line they risk embracing the retro novelty and empty revivalism that is skillfully avoided on much as Salmiakki.","One of the most striking and unexpected things about the first wave of microhouse artists is the number of\n ...

Along the way they've folded in some Brazil and a whole lot of Brian. With Beat Maize & Corn, they've stripped their music down to its bare essence and vacuum-sealed it. Here, High Llamas are in essential oil mode, where a few drops could be used to color any number of pop music styles from the last 100 years. For good or ill, this is Sean O'Hagan at his purest and most minimal. You don't often come across a modern album that sounds so damn old. With the arrangements O'Hagan has chosen, Beet Maize & Corn could have been played faithfully in 1850. Though the sleeve lists O'Hagan on electric guitar, you never hear it. Every other instrument is acoustic. Most songs are built around his nylon-stringed strumming, with bits of piano and vibes, and then plenty horns and strings added for coloring. Shakers and rim taps on a couple songs constitute the entirety of the percussion. If there's even the slightest hint of ""rock"" to Beet Maize & Corn, it's the softest variety ever played. It's an old fogey of a record, but still timeless in its own way. It's difficult to imagine what would occasion it, but if in the year 2040 I were to pull Beet Maize & Corn from the shelf and play it for someone who'd never heard of High Llamas they probably wouldn't come close to guessing its age. No crackle, so it can't be 1935. No lounge irony, so it can't be 1995. Just simple melodies, not-so-simple harmonies, and the same strings/horns timbre that's drifted in and out of pop song fashion since the wax cylinder. The tunes, though. Goddammit, why can't they manage the tunes? Sean O'Hagan is the best possible argument for melody writing being an inborn talent. If great melodies were simply a matter of hard work, then O'Hagan would be at the top of the craft. But for all his perfectly pitched arrangements and restless harmonic movement, we still have his drab songs sung by his dull voice. The ""best"" songs here, like, uh, ""High on the Chalk"", I guess, are barely more memorable or noteworthy than the worst. Sometimes a particular swoop of strings will get me, as on the painfully nostalgic ""The Click and the Fizz"", other times the background vocals (including contributions from the late Mary Hansen) will grate slightly, as on ""Porter Dimi"". But that's about it for the ups and downs. Mostly, Beet Maize & Corn just hangs in the background, which I reckon is A-OK by Sean O'Hagan.","High Llamas have always had a base of tastefully arranged chamber-pop from which they've roamed and dabbled in other ...

Obrigado Saudade,Mice Parade,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c454eb335119a49ed913/1:1/w_160/b430c9df.jpg,2004-02-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5260-obrigado-saudade/,Fat CatBubble Core,"I wish I could come up with a cool anagram for my name. Or at least a sensible one. I've tried for several train rides now and about the best I can come up with is ""A Joint Rage."" Some others: ""A Jargon Tie,"" ""Tora GI Jane,"" ""Jeana Griot"" and ""A Gear Joint."" I think it's the ""J"" that throws things off. There are only so many places in a word where you can put that thing. Adam Pierce, on the other hand, is sitting pretty. Not only can you jumble up the letters in his name to get such useful not-sequiturial phrases as ""A Mad Recipe"" and ""Acid Ampere"", you can also get ""Mice Parade"". And as Pierce has now proven over the course of five albums, Mice Parade is a damn good thing. The usual terms often get bandied about at Pierce's expense when talking about his music: post-rock, IDM, organica, even new age (wait! Don't hit ""back"" yet!). But the music he makes is, for all intents and purposes, genreless, which likely explains why people have such a hard time defining it. His sense of arrangement and typically static harmonic structures frequently lend his music an otherworldly, trancelike aura, but the more subtle element that so often makes it transfixing is rhythm, which is never absent for long. Every carefully placed element in his arrangements somehow nudges the song forward, from obvious things like Pierce's impressive drumming and inconspicuous programming to more unusual elements like his kinetic acoustic guitar playing and always-handy synths. Pierce's acoustic work is especially omnipresent on Obrigado Saudade, often forming the backbone of its compositions. ""Milton Road"" rides solely on the back of his frenetic strumming, sweeping in with freezer blasts of overdubbed electric guitar at carefully spaced intervals. He spends most of his time alone on these songs, joined by guests on fewer than half of the tracks. In fact, he gets a full band together only once, for ""Mystery Brethren"", a breathtaking improvisation that gets off to a jumpy start with swirling keys and clouds of vibraphone riding Pierce's sizzling, repetitive drum groove. Chris Conti's guitar is less percussive than Pierce's typically is, but still has that perpetual forward momentum that distinguishes Mice Parade. HiM's Doug Scharin gets behind the traps for ""Out of the Freedom World"" (a titular response to Mice Parade's own ""Into the Freedom World"", from 2001's fantastic Mokoondi), laying down a typically solid foundation for Pierce's flights on the cheng, a Chinese harp of which he's made excellent use since first introducing it to his music four years ago. It's not all instrumental pattern-building, either: Pierce lends his detached tenor to the driving, acoustic guitar-led ""Focus on a Roller Coaster"", lending the track an uncharacteristic sense of form and melody. It seems unlikely that Mice Parade will ever make a truly amazing album-- the music is almost too consistently gorgeous to create any defining moments-- but so far Adam Pierce and his abettors have yet to make an album that falls short of worthwhile. This is music just about anyone can enjoy, either for close listening or simply ambient sound, and that's perhaps where Pierce's use of an anagram of his name for his main musical project becomes most appropriate. The structure of this music allows easily for the free rearrangement of a set group of sounds into a huge number of different patterns and textures, and the more you rearrange, the more interesting those patterns and textures become.","I wish I could come up with a cool anagram for my name.

Set List,The Frames,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be11c0084474cd0c2e0f/1:1/w_160/6809e325.jpg,2004-02-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3174-set-list/,Anti-,"The Frames might be superhotshit in Ireland, but their careful, blowsy blend of cock-rock swagger and trad-folk delicacy has long slipped past the ears of most Americans, despite loads of rousing recommendations from Brian Eno and million-star reviews from almost every Irish periodical ever. After nearly fourteen years of touring (and four full-length LPs), the band has opted to release a 13-track live album, Set List, as proof of their insane stamina and hyper-dedicated following: If nothing else, the record is a hard and fast testament to the goofy fervor The Frames are capable of inducing in eager European crowds. The tragic flaw of the live record is that it almost always offers an entirely compromised version of the genuine experience-- a watery, dull, one-dimensional representation of something that should ideally be transcendent. The Frames are stellar songsmiths, and Set List certainly proves that they're equally capable live performers, but by far the most interesting aspect of this record is the foot-stomping fervor of their perpetually singing-along crowd. Anyone nauseated by the prophetical leanings of Dashboard Confessional shows (check small clumps of skinny kids mouthing every lyric in earnest, whimpering along with their hands clenched into euphoric fists), or freaked out by the beer-soaked ""Bruce!"" bellows that send quivers through Giants Stadium whenever Springsteen plays, might be equally shocked by the enthusiasm of The Frames' adoring fans, who seem to be perpetually trembling with excitement. Somehow, The Frames have managed to capture the sweaty, breathless communion of the live show in some oddly convincing ways. If you can get past gaping over the hollers of the audience, Set List just might be compelling enough to encourage new listeners to check out The Frames' proper discography. Recorded over four nights at Vicar Street in Dublin, Set List runs through the band's standards (see opener ""Revelate"" and the scream-along fest of ""Star Star"") and offers a single new track (seriously, how are these kids still singing along?), the quietly confessional, heavily falsettoed ""The Blood"". Frontman Glen Hansard is always playful, leading his bandmates into bits of Marley's ""Redemption Song"" and Cash's ""Ring of Fire"", and offering plenty of charming between-song banter. The Frames have long imbued their playing with a certain elasticity, each song bending and shifting like a pulled rubberband, and it gets easier and easier to understand how fans can become so enraptured by the tug: Colm Mac Con Iomaire's fiddle-playing is breathless, and Joseph Doyle's backing vocals are expert, lifting Hansard's vocals and guitars onto a perfect pedestal. Alternately earnest and teasing, tracks like ""Stars Are Underground"" and ""Santa Maria"" prove that The Frames are actually far more than the sum of their recorded parts. Set List is not their first live record (see 2002's flaccid Breadcrumb Trail), but it is easily their most convincing plea for your ticket-buying attention.","The Frames might be superhotshit in Ireland, but their careful, blowsy blend of cock-rock swagger and trad-folk delicacy has long ...

For obscure acts of the 90s finally sucking some surface air, subpar is the new par. Those of us who have long pursued John Darnielle's bronze crumbs will head down to our record stores today in our scarves and messenger bags, expecting an opus, but we will leave nonplussed. We Shall All Be Healed is like an ugly, hollow sports victory for a team anticipated to blow away the opposition. If this had been our first game, we would never have become such huge tailgating losers. And we are full-on fans. We cling to Darnielle's early cassette-only releases for reasons, we are starting to think, more biographical than qualitative. We mail-ordered, awaited, and then owned everything listed on his Internet discography (except the annoyingly ""never released"" projects), but were reduced to eBaying most of our archives to pay for our divorces. We started bands that ripped off the ""Going To __________"" titling habit he kicked long ago, and many of our sophomore efforts contain a song called ""FM"", embarrassingly attributed to Darnielle due to our ignorance that he was covering Steely Dan. We are thankful for how Darnielle expanded our definition of ""punk"" to contain acoustic odes to cartographers and unsexy species. We gather Darnielle's bootlegged covers (most recently of Suede and Neutral Milk Hotel) to survive the winter. Though Darnielle now maintains a degree of prodigality, we no longer view the fattening of his man-and-machine ""production"" as an evil on par with Converse's selling out to Nike, even if we're still unsteady about its political ramifications. We always love to hear Darnielle again, though he never stays gone for long. On this album, he still decrees (rather than ""sings"") his lyrics with the adamancy of the virgin, as if he'd been a preoccupied town crier in a past life. Producer and friend John Vanderslice may lower the vocals and distort them, but Darnielle thankfully still sounds as if he's reporting from some Protestant, pre-compromise utopia under siege. But the only surprises Healed holds is that Darnielle has nothing new to teach us, and that the album triggers our memory of Donald Gibb's character Ogre, from that movie about the misfits with the same goals as the meatheads, rumbling ""Nnnerrrds!"" Healed begins passionately enough, but by now we have a right to take Darnielle's consistency for granted: He has become that boring but dedicated partner whom we must leave because we can hear the club down the street, and we fear that we're missing some of the too-much that is going on. ""Slow West Vultures"" is an indictment of unsustainability that establishes the album's pace, tone and scope, but I don't buy any of it, with its ""urgency"" (the full-band Mountain Goats attempt rock to the extent that The View attempts in-depth current-events analysis), and its lyrics that go down like Maoist slogans with a sense of privation (except for ""get in the goddamn car""), and its Aguilera-caliber vocal shudders, and its timid impression of a big finish. ""Palmcorder Yajna"" manages more intensity, and a great image, though Darnielle will recycle it: ""Reflective tape on our sweatpants."" But the song's unjangly R.E.M.-ness never changes, sending the hungry collector back into his/her (okay, his) archives of Midnight Oil. ""Linda Blair Was Born Innocent"" proves to be a tease of a title, and fails to analyze how her most famous film was about the church's demonization of female sexuality; it's a ho-hum ching-a-linger about being ""hungry for love"" and ""going downtown."" Nora Danielson (who also played with Darnielle on 2001's Devil in the Shortwave) acquits herself on this song, and throughout the album, with her violinistry, but not distinctively: Except for the few seconds when she apes The Dirty Three, she evokes Alastair Gailbraith's earlier Goat complements. ""Letter from Belgium"" and ""Your Belgian Things"" constitute the most prominent examples of Darnielle's trademark globalization, and they're limited to the land that hilariously tricked all of us into watching Marxist fantasia The Smurfs during the commie-blasting 80s. The second of these songs is the more effective, but Darnielle's nasal-Donahue emerges intermittently, and is less digestible than in previous years. The rest of the album wallows in similar okayness (I am forgetting the name of the critic who wrote, in Full of Secrets: Critical Approaches to Twin Peaks, that television's success rests in its ability to provide 24-hour partial satisfaction). ""Mole"" is a cousin of Guided by Voices' ""I Am a Tree"", and it breaks from its Hill Street Blues-theme homage for a climax that has nothing to do with the rest of the song. ""The Young Thousands"" is, you know, rousing (dig that wall of Darnielles!), and boasts one of the album's few soul-rending lyrics, but we fans have heard this kind of heralder before. So ""Cotton"" features a decent bebop breakdown, and we hangers-on can't complain about ""Home Again Garden Grove""'s patented hyperharmonizing, anxious chords, and war/suicide/jellyfish imagery. As much as we may be proud that Darnielle has graduated from the Crayola artwork of Shrimper to 4AD's hegemonic cursive, as much as we may internalize his shoulders' evocation of our mother's osteoporosis, as much as we respect the Vanderslicing that coheres ""Against Pollution"", We Shall All Be Healed is complacent, formulaic for a trailblazer, lapped by Destroyer, optimistic-but-joyless in that it is pessimistic-but-punchy, and gooped with the silly putty of vagueness and cliché. Aw hell, this feels like narcking on a chum, but Darnielle has perhaps been made ironically complacent by his suspicions that humans are getting the world that they deserve. Either that, or his folk has outmatured us.","Sigh. For obscure acts of the 90s finally sucking some surface air, subpar is the new par. Those of us ...

Zoot Woman,Zoot Woman,by: PJ Gallagher,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab4d9d034d5c69bf3fd3/1:1/w_160/03eefc7b.jpg,2004-02-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8956-zoot-woman/,Wall of Sound,"Few things bring to mind the phrase ""kiss of death"" more than a sophomore offering from any band lumped into the crush of The Larry Tee Electroclash Attack of Two Summers AgoTM. Zoot Woman was a full-fledged member of that blitzkrieg. Cuts from their debut, Living in a Magazine, littered the countless electro comps sandwiched between Fischerspooner centerfolds and rubber-banded onto the new Ladytron release. Zoot Woman reviews were packed with so many references to other electro acts it was difficult to tell who was really doing what, and why we should care. Happily, this is all over. Electroclash is fading like a fond but embarrassing memory, like the time you made out with the really skanky VJ because he promised to play that Stardust video you really like. But Zoot Woman is still having a go at it, and they've returned with an album that sticks close to their first recipe, bringing back the fun with a more polished and occasionally darker sound. It's full of their familiar hooks and beats, and more of Johnny Blake's suave-yet-gruff vocals. Think of a French Kathleen Turner without the weird accent. And male. With a throbbing bassline out front and sharper electric guitars pushed lower into the mix, Zoot Woman leads off with the first single, ""Grey Day"". Existing in some no-man's-land between dance and rock, it would make a welcome addition to a Britpop dance night where the kids are used to turning medium tempo tracks into full-on rave anthems. ""Taken It All"" slows things down, adds a bit of faux-70s glamour, and reminds us that guitars will be taking a backseat to keyboards for the remainder of the journey. ""Hope in the Mirror"" infuses a bit of breezy pop silliness into the mix with light keyboard chords and stylized guitar riffs. Clearly the one-off track in the lot, ""Snow White"" channels Elliott Smith for an acoustic ballad peppered with sub-glitch noises and a front-and-center drum kit. The instrumental ""Calmer"" weaves in horn and backwards samples and sounds like clean/smooth/calm early Beta Band. The album ends with ""Half Full of Happiness"", not quite brooding but full of enough moody, flipped around backwards samples that something is obviously amiss. Warning: the last two minutes drone on long enough to bring down the room, and should be probably skipped. Zoot Woman isn't essential, but it is infectious. It won't find an easy home on most dance floors, but it will mix in well at the beginning of the night before the lipstick is smeared and the vodka can remove nail polish. So put up with one more electro reference and take Miss Kittin's advice: play it at a backyard party with friends, sing along in the car, or bribe the bartender at the hotel lounge to slip it in. And karma sutra training would probably help, too.","Few things bring to mind the phrase ""kiss of death"" more than a sophomore offering from any band lumped into ...

Amplify 2002,Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81613d197565213958f/1:1/w_160/1cfafa1e.gif,2004-02-01 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2037-amplify-2002/,Erstwhile,"This balloon is filled with water. I took it to the sink, attached it to the faucet, and let the water in until the slack in the balloon's thin, rubber walls was gone and the water occupied as much space inside as possible, while still allowing me to remove it from the small hydrant and tie up the end. A full balloon is kind of perverse; it begs to be exploded, and if I lived two floors up, I probably would have dropped it to the sidewalk without a second thought. The water has nowhere to go from within, and the tight, bulging skin of the ball is so reminiscent of a young woman's breast that most people are embarrassed to hold one. However, the most interesting part of a full balloon is not on the outside, but its saturated inner vacuum of water and captive air. If I could swim on the inside of this balloon, I would hardly last more than a few seconds before my head burst. The pressure, already near a critical point, would be magnified every time someone handled the outside, shifting currents of force inside, similar to the earth's tremors in the deep sea. The only way to escape the chamber is to release pressure and hope that in the minute, violent transition from the point of explosion to its surging release I'm not blown to bits as well. This is the crux of high pressure: can't live with it, and sometimes its release causes even more damage. Onkyo appeared in Japan in the late 90s, as sort of an inverse of noise music and typically Japanese extreme renderings of free jazz and improvisation. Music writer Patrick Boeuf states as much during a short, interesting essay inside the Amplify 2002 booklet. He notices the tendency for intense upper register tones juxtaposed with silence, and I would apply their relationship to the tension and release of pressure inside the balloon. Judging by the nature of its participants' performances, Onkyo (fitting under a wider umbrella of ""electro-acoustic improvisation"") is a study in the transition between almost unbearable pressure and tiny resolve. Where silence builds considerable, tangible tension, more so when a large ensemble is able to sustain it for long periods, the minimal sound put forth by guitar, sampler, mixing-board-- or whatever Otomo Yoshihide was pounding on during his duo show with Günter Müller-- represents the tease of resolution. It's a tease because with Onkyo, there's never really a full release. This is part of what makes it different from noise, and in fact, most other music on the planet. The Amplify box set (seven music CDs, one DVD) documents a festival of the same name organized by the Erstwhile label's Jon Abbey, with assistance from Headz label owner Atsushi Sasaki, and musicians Toshimaru Nakamura and Taku Sugimoto. Held over three days in Tokyo, October 2002, Amplify-- subtitled ""balance""-- featured the best-known Japanese Onkyo performers, as well as European improvisers Müller, Keith Rowe, Bukhard Stangl, Thomas Lehn, Marcus Schmickler and Christof Kurzmann, who, while not following the same paths as the Japanese musicians, are certainly among the most respected electro acoustic improvisers today. In fact, it's the differing approaches of the Europeans and Japanese on Amplify that contributes some of the tension; here, that is inherently a good thing. I was most fascinated by Jonas Leddington's DVD documentary feature ""balance beams,"" comprised of several performances, interviews, 5.1 surround sound mixes and subtle, hypnotic scenes of Tokyo street life. As much as modern electronic improvisation might seem visually irrelevant, Abbey correctly points out in the booklet that there's no substitute for witnessing this music. Performance highlights on the DVD include an incredible show by Cosmos (Sachiko M and vocalist Ami Yoshida), Otomo and Müller's show featuring the aforementioned pounding session and a frenetic set by Lehn and Schmickler, wherein sounds (and body movements) fly by faster than my eyes can process. The final audio CD of Amplify contains a performance of seven guitar players, and Rowe's ""treatise"" with the musicians on the DVD is a humbling, funny peek at how up in the air this music must be, even for its major proponents. Earlier, Rowe admits to having few ideas about how he will proceed even as his fingers approach his guitar at the start of a performance, though somehow the uncertainty surrounding this music seems perfectly appropriate. The audio CDs are divided into festival shows (discs three through six), shows organized around the festival by Nakamura and Sugimoto (one and seven) and one new studio release by Nakamura and Müller entitled Tint. Tint will doubtlessly be of interest to fans of both performers, and doubles as fine case on the differing approaches between Onkyo and European electronic improvisation. Nakamura's perfect sine, emitted from his signature no-input mixing board, hovers above Müller's more traditionally expressionist, laptop-assisted sounds. In some instances, Müller actually provides a rhythmic pulse, and though his preference for sudden changes in tone and mood should conflict with Nakamura's relatively serene, minimal style, I find the result more along the lines of a summit between two colleagues; one gushing with enthusiasm and exotic detail, the other nodding and smiling politely. Of the festival discs, my favorite performances begin with Cosmos' set at the start of disc three. For my money, Sachiko M and Yoshida, along with Nakamura and Sugimoto, are the most purely representative of the Onkyo sound and concept. Sachiko's sine acts as both a piercing, desperate stream of air escaping from the balloon, and as a thin blanket of light enveloping the entire ceiling of Cosmos' performance. In turn, Yoshida is the embodiment of pressure and release, as she contracts her chest and throat muscles to form seemingly inhuman (and sometimes almost imperceptible) sounds. Their track is an inspiring model of tension and the companionship required for an artistic duo. Likewise, Müller and Otomo's performance on disc four is the work of two seasoned improvisers exploring their equipment, and one another. I think Otomo (using guitar, turntable and electronics) is a better natural fit for Müller than Nakamura, if only because the pair seems to have similar ideas about how to fill detail into space. Fans of atmospheric IDM along the lines of Fennesz or Philip Jeck would do well to listen to this duo's set. AMM alum Rowe performs with frequent partner Nakamura on disc five in what is probably the greatest surprise for me on Amplify. It's a surprise because of the consistently understated dynamics and progression of ideas. I had seen the duo in Houston last year, where Rowe offered much busier (and I think less effective) counterpoint to Nakamura's restrained mixing board emissions. Here, the two are content to wallow in pressure without the slightest hint of stress. Contrast this with the Nakamura-Lehn duo on disc one, as Lehn's versatile analog synthesizer creates sounds ranging from insect calls to industrial hum to barely existent electro-static. If at first Lehn's performance seems eclectic to a fault, all the more surprising then to witness his gradual concession to Nakamura's persistent sine in the track's second half. Despite the volume of material to digest with Amplify, my impression is that it represents a momentary transition. Utah Kawasaki (half of Astro Twin, along with Yoshida) writes in the booklet about his curiosity with the future of this music. If there is a single thesis present in Amplify, it's that in meetings between Eastern and Western musicians, over the course of a single, extended event, whatever aim this small group of people shared will have changed slightly. Or, it will have been refined and improved. Even as a consequence of releasing pressure is that the original form loses its substance, nothing prevents new forms from being created, explored and eventually spawning still more. Abbey's box set raises a signpost for the persistent change and transient brilliance of these musicians' work.","This balloon is filled with water.

Apropa't,Savath y Savalas,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35fc0084474cd0c0266/1:1/w_160/bed10115.gif,2004-02-01 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7008-apropat/,Warp,"Who is Scott Herren, really? He's recorded under so many aliases, it's hard to know whether his birthname is itself just another ruse. Granted, Herren's never been a man of many words: all of his projects, to this point, have been primarily solo and instrumental-- the closest he's come to vocals are through the cut-up guests and female oohs that appear on his now-legendary albums as Prefuse 73. When he recently put his Delarosa + Asora project out of its glitched-out agony, you could say it split in two: the live studio work continued under the name Savath & Savalas, while the hard-cutting intricacies were swallowed by the Prefuse LPs. Back in 1999, Savath & Savalas's debut, Folk Songs for Trains, Trees and Honey came off not as the duo or trio that its names would suggest, but as a single source of the kind of warmth and thickness seldom found in hip-hop or post-rock. With Herren on drums, bass, and keyboards on most tracks, it was all of a piece: slow, meaty beats overlaid with layers of bells, vibes and Rhodes for a wide open feel, with the occasional synthetic flourish. The 2002 Rolls and Waves EP was jazzier and slicker, but clearly another live-but-alone project. So Herren deserves admiration for taking such an extreme left turn with Apropa't, a spectral collaboration with a Barcelona singer, with songs written together in Spanish and Catalan. True, he's been running the Eastern Developments label in Atlanta for years, helping friends like Kopernik and Lori Scacco put out just this sort of sleepy, eccentric album. But it's still a shock to hear the planet's sickest beatsmith sing airy backup vocals while strumming a nylon-string guitar. Now that the Prefuse persona is so well-established, of course, you'd be right to wonder what he has to lose if a side project like this flops; he's been touring as Prefuse straight through its release, after all. But if you take him at his word, he's not dabbling. On his now-native Barcelona: ""I'm not a tourist. I went there for my soul. What we're doing is a great expression of why I'm there."" And about the kitsch-value of a token Latin project: ""We're not on some pseudo-anything."" He even calls himself Guillermo now. I need to get something off my chest. ""On the last Prefuse record I told somebody that it was a break-up record,"" Herren is quoted in a recent Urb cover story. ""So what happened? Everybody asked me about it and I had to relive that moment over and over again. It drove me to insanity. So this time I swore I wouldn't do it, but I'm doing it."" Readers, I may or may not be the one responsible, but early last year, he told me this, and I instantly spread the information all over the face of this tan-on-cream website. And I would do it again, happily, because the torment of rejection was scribbled all over that album for the world to see. For all Herren's red herrings about ""psychedelic Spanish steez"" and the ""is what it is""-ness of his latest effort, Apropa't also fits with what he has revealed about his life last year: that in settling into expatriate life in Barcelona and struggling to accept the permanent absence of the Spanish father he never met, he happened into a slow-burning but all-consuming friendship with a Catalan singer named Eva Puyuelo Muns. This is really her record. She is responsible for its consistently cool, bittersweet feel, which feels like it could accompany a tale of star-crossed love set in the Arctic summer. All the songs are put together simply-- vague hooks broken up by chronic lulls where the verses should be-- and the tracks bleed together as if drawn from a place where eerie music is always writing itself. The tone is reserved and cryptic, as if Scott and Eva have taken some heartfelt lyrics in English and then translated them into Catalan to keep us from prying too deeply into their business. The focus remains on Eva's voice, even as Herren undergirds it with the help of Josh Abrams, John Herndon, and John McEntire at Soma Studios in Chicago. The album starts with a burst of noise that's dirtier and more restrained than the one that sparks Folk Songs. Immediately we're in a cold, bright place: jangling chimes instead of vibes, lean driving drums instead of fat beats, and a mess of flutes, harmonicas and synths weaving us right out of the picture. ""Balcón Sin Flores"" drops a haunting lament behind a veil of twining metal reeds, and ""A La Nit"" provides another brief taste of trees and honey, with a warm fretless bass bending into cribbed cinematic strings. Halfway through this short album, however, its tracks have failed to change keys, and one gets the keen sense that Apropa't is going nowhere. ""Ràdio Llocs Espacials"" and ""Víctima Belleza"" reinforce the suspicion, oddly spare lullabies with steamy pauses instead of verses. Too late, ""Interludio 44"" distinguishes itself with a refreshing array of pure tones, with erratic envelopes and stochastic pitch changes adding up to a slow harmonic drift. Some later songs are just wordless humming, not neutral, but designed to somehow lure us in while at the same time warning us off. This may be Herren's least accessible project to date. Like sand, the harder you squeeze it, the more it slips through your fingers. Apropa't fades into the walls if you listen too long. But maybe it's just trying to keep some unfathomable secret. So far, it's done a good job.","Who is Scott Herren, really? He's recorded under so many aliases, it's hard to know whether his birthname ...

Pink Abyss,Shalabi Effect,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b79d034d5c69bf2ebf/1:1/w_160/789c9b4b.jpg,2004-02-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7091-pink-abyss/,Alien8,"Okay, so you've got Herb Alpert, alright? He's got his trumpet with him and he's doing his thing, blowing smooth leads with an easy sense of cool that seems to come naturally. He's backed by a couple of members of Spector's Wrecking Crew and they're grooving, deep in the moment. Oh, and they're all standing knee-deep in the bubbling swamps of Dagobah, and there are thousands of Imperial stormtroopers engaged in an intense laser battle with a ragtag group of rebels all around them. To many, this circumstance is incongruous; to Shalabi Effect, it's all in a day's work. In fact, they've actually approximated this very scene I've described on ""Blue Sunshine"", one of a handful of tracks on their third album that incorporates unabashed pop in ways only a group of avant-garde tricksters like these four Quebecois noiseniks could. It's clear from a trip through their back catalog that Shalabi Effect are no threat to the charts, but their particular brand of mildly psychedelic soundscaping has always managed to remain accessible relative to its closest counterparts, so the fact that several songs on the so-unsubtly-titled Pink Abyss sport memorable melodies and rather conventional structures shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. It does represent an expansion of the band's aesthetic territory, though, and they cover the new ground well, perhaps even better than they address their past. Lest I have you believing that Osama Shalabi and his associates are one step away from hiring The Matrix and ditching their tablas at Goodwill, I should point out that, as they draw pop convention close with one hand, they punish it with the other. Just as they assault guest trumpeter Charles Spearin (Broken Social Scene, Do Make Say Think) with sawtooth waves and gurgling ambience on ""Blue Sunshine"", they can't keep their slimy hands off icy chanteuse Elizabeth Anka Vajagic's swooping, trip-hoppy delivery on ""Bright Guilty World"". She swoons over brushed drums and a creeping bassline, a standard enough arrangement, but the song's edges are filled with ominous swells and unsettling clumps of barely subdued noise. ""Iron & Blood"" opens as squishy gothic zombie pop featuring a moaning chorus of la-la-la's and some disembodied piano parts, but it slowly morphs into a gradually accelerating guitar raga, ending at a raging clip and providing the kind of taut climax that this band once avoided. They do still make room for a few pure sound collages, most notably ""Message from the Pink Abyss"", which opens the album with the stomach gurgles of cyborg aliens and panicked murmurs of forest nymphs, a squelching, breathing heap of noise that frankly isn't terribly captivating-- oddly, it feels like the most predictable track here. The album closes with ""Kinder Surprise"", a song that is, in many respects, the embodiment of its title, a gentle stream of organ and guitar cut through with bird songs that never reaches for the unsettling dissonance of the rest of the album. Pink Abyss is something of a musical shift in gears for Shalabi Effect, but in the end, it actually mirrors the band's two previous albums in its very unpredictability. It's never quite as arresting or inscrutably powerful as The Trial of St-Orange, but is every bit as worthy and forward-looking.","Okay, so you've got Herb Alpert, alright?

The World of Arthur Russell,Arthur Russell,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f513d19756521389a3/1:1/w_160/bfb420b1.jpg,2004-02-01 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6907-the-world-of-arthur-russell/,Soul Jazz,"There appears to be a typo on the usually on-point Soul Jazz label, in that an 'S' is missing from the title of their attempted overview of the enigmatic New York scene cellist Arthur Russell. If anything, there were many musical ""worlds"" for Iowa-born Arthur Russell, and he floated between them effortlessly in a way that, up until death from AIDS in 1992, no one else had. There was the world of Indian master-musician Ali Akbar Khan, in which Arthur used his cello to trance-inducing effect. There was the world where his cello shadowed the beat-poet Allen Ginsburg at readings, as well as the world of The Kitchen, where he premiered his peculiar minimal compositions while also rubbing elbows with composers like John Cage, Rhys Chatham, and Philip Glass. He was in the rock world, too, nearly joining the Talking Heads and forming the short-lived Flying Hearts with ex-Modern Lover Ernie Brooks. He even briefly produced quirky tracks in the rap world, frustrating young rapper Mark Sinclair who would one day go on to make it as the meat-headed action hero Vin Diesel. And then there was the world of disco music, where one night in 1977, a DJ saved his life. That DJ, Nicky Siano, would collaborate with Arthur the following year (in a session featuring disparate musicians like David Byrne, Fluxus member Henry Flynt, and the Ingram Brothers) under the name of Dinosaur for the first 12-inch disco single on the Sire label, the leftfield staple ""Kiss Me Again"". A jubilant marriage of clacking castanets and bells, horns and breathless divas, Byrne's early Afrobeat guitar scratches and Russell's infinitely funky cello, its effect on dancefloors remains iconoclastic and ecstatic, a hot disco joint with little trace of Saturday Night's fever. Unfortunately, neither that track nor the similarly rubbery ""Tell You (Today)"" were licensed for this compilation, although both can be found on the crucial overview of early 80s dance weirdness, Disco Not Disco (which also features a superior mix of his Indian Ocean track, ""Tree House/School Bell""). Despite these painful omissions, the towering high points of Arthur's extraordinary club music are finally gathered onto one disc, in one world. The set opens with the disco favorite ""Go Bang #5"", as mixed by Francois Kevorkian. From the drunken Don Drummond-esque trombone, weird Bitches Brew-style keyboard doodles, and crisp hi-hats cutting into the hand drums to the mingled masculine/feminine chants of ""I want to see all my friends at once go bang, go bang, go bang, get BANGED!!!"" its dubby pleasuredome message is undeniable and infectious. Similarly lascivious is the Larry Levan mix of ""Is It All Over My Face"", whose lyrical meaning vacillates between that of come-on and unbridled aural beatitude on the dancefloor. Both tracks embrace the seeming conflicts of simple physical release and higher levels of ecstatic pleasure and simply let it all go. With long-time supporter/studio engineer Bob Blank's wife Lola and son Kenny providing the dramatized womanly tone and child-like chirp for 1985's ""Wax the Van"", Arthur worships the sun, mans the van, and sails towards it like Icarus, seeking to be up ""on the higher hill."" Underneath all these echoing voices (including his own mumbles), he stretches pulsing bass, percolating congas, and an ocean of polyrhythmic waves into a weird dance song constantly in-flux. When he takes to singing himself, Arthur's voice has a slippery, androgynous nature to it: a breathy, muffled baritone one moment, a cartoonish croon the next, as evident on the way-too-short Walter Gibbons mix of ""Let's Go Swimming"" (see Disco Not Disco 2). The ultra-obscure ""Pop Your Funk"" has him pulling out his own rockabilly-meets-Yello goofiness. Two tracks are taken from the unfortunately deleted collection of songs, Another Thought. ""Keeping Up"" features a fuzzy, incessant cello as propulsion and the backing voice of 80s trivia answer Jennifer Warnes (who, you might recall, was up where she belonged with Joe Cocker, and had the time of her life opposite a Righteous Brother on the Dirty Dancing soundtrack). ""A Little Lost"" shows Arthur's ability to concoct a poignant, bittersweet pop song with just cello, guitar, and his echoing voice. The bowed solo in the middle is astonishingly lyrical and emotionally direct, and the final few seconds of his double-tracked voice singing the chorus is a delight. These songs serve as bookends for what I consider the apex of all Russell's powers and all his worlds: the seemingly infinite yet merely thirteen-minute ""In the Light of a Miracle"". Merging his Buddha-infused minimalism with the rippling Indian percussion and sustained brass breaths of long-time collaborators Mustafa Ahmed and Peter Zummo, they hover over a gentle four-on-the-floor pulse of devotional bells, vamping Rhodes, piano and strummed guitar. A choir of vaporous voices (including Tower of Meaning conductor Julius Eastman and Elodie Lauten) emerge from a cloud of holy sound, Russell's bowed cello shimmering like columns of white light, the sound of Paradise Garage and Nirvana itself. As the grave nature of his illness manifests, the earlier, earthly pleasure of his disco songs become as caterpillars, giving way to something more beautiful and elusive. Songs like ""Schoolbell/Treehouse"", ""Let's Go Swimming"" or ""Go Bang"" evolve into something ethereal and beyond rhythm. The enchanting melodies brought forth in the mid-80s on World of Echo (to finally be reissued this year) or Another Thought are formed from his fragile, luminescent voice and cello, these two components bathed in nebulae of infinite echo, suggesting a space loosed from gravity's grip. To hear the changeling voice of man and instrument move as one (as on ""Treehouse"") is to imagine a butterfly in flight: whimsically fluttering on bubble-gum beats, curlicues of noise, and petals of melody. He reveals organic patterns scarcely glimpsed or grasped before taking off yet again on light-seeking flight beyond this world. That some of that beauty is caught here is heavenly, indeed.","There appears to be a typo on the usually on-point Soul Jazz label, in that an 'S' is missing from ...

It's a fact I find dispiriting, yet quite the rule: Save an opportunity to score a few second's face time on the latest shock brand of reality television, the rewards don't justify the risk these days. Conformity pays and pays well. I take in uptown Charlotte, surveying battalions of reinforcements along Trade Street as the mere differentiating factors between any two brave jaywalkers are found in the silver letters of a briefcase monogram or the fit on a pair of pleated khakis. There's no pageantry, no ostentation, no grandstanding-- no damn fun. And I'll wager now that An Albatross will never play here. This transplanted Pennsylvanian is good for at least a word of warning to the band: Do not schedule us. This banker's paradise couldn't host any of Philadelphia-bred An Albatross' wildly off kilter expositions of dissevered carnivalesque dementia. Depending on when and where you catch them, you could witness anything from costumed sock-hopping to orgiastic food fights-- and all set to the band's sub-minute, licentious flurries of proletariat dance metal intoxication. We Are the Lazer Viking, the band's sophomore effort, captures eleven songs in about eight minutes. Ranging in length between :21 and 1:24, these brief tracks spotlight vocalist Edward B. Geida III shrieking his way through volatile bursts of digital meltdown and pure metalthrashing. New to the band is a second keyboard player, which serves to clean up the sound a bit; his oddly inviting Farfisa melodies form the bedrock of most of the album, surfacing even when you don't have time enough to bob your head but twice. The highlight might be the 1:13 of ""The Revolutionary Politics of Dance"", and (1:24 later) the :42 of ""Get Faster, Cry for Happy"". Both songs blend electric grindcore bursts and wavelike synth-lulls into supremely rhythmic bouts of delirium. Of the three instrumental tracks, ""J7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j"" sounds like a peek at the broiled labor of a steel-factory, while closer ""W7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7"" is cartoonish enough to feel at home on a Max Tundra album. Oh, brave Vikings of the North, your apocalyptic unrest is valiant. Though I suppose the live show of foreboding destruction is the real An Albatross experience; the record doesn't satisfy.

48 Months,Asheru & Blue Black,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a185b1335d7bf169829e/1:1/w_160/e61a61e3.jpg,2004-01-29 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/422-48-months/,Seven Heads,"From the very genesis of this motley twenty-something bastard that backpackers like to call ""hip-hop"" and cultural studies professors label ""rap,"" there have always existed two predominantly opposed beat-making ideologies. No, it's not an ""East coast/West coast"" thing (at least not outwardly), but for ages now, there has been a marked difference between the studio-slick, synth-heavy bounce of a Dr. Dre or Timbaland production and the crackling, sample-heavy boom-bap trademarked by producers like DJ Premier, Pete Rock, and Jay Dee-- and in the war being fought for commercial radio supremacy on the forefront of hip-hop's Diaspora, the Timbalands have won by a landslide. If it wasn't for Kanye West's soul fetishism, the future of popular hip-hop would seem to leave little room for beats made with simply a sampler and a drum machine (check Outkast's latest or Freeway's ""Flipside""), which leaves little else than nostalgia for hip-hop traditionalists. Fortunately, nostalgia's sounding alright these days: Some of last year's best hip-hop albums came from out of the vault (Pete Rock's unearthed work with InI and Deda, and Peanut Butter Wolf's classic collaboration on Charizma's doomed debut), and with 48 Months, the latest record from Seven Heads' resident dynamic duo Asheru and Blue Black, it's looking like this year may be no different. 48 Months isn't a reissue per se-- much of the material included here has previously appeared in other forms, from treasured 12-inches to the group's 2001 debut, Soon Come-- but it manages a similar vibe as these two University of Virginia grads' reminisce on their college rhyming days. Many of these cuts date back to the early one-off 12-inches Seven Heads would cut before they had the money to distribute Asheru and Blue Black full-lengths, but the bulk of consistently stunning material these guys recorded that failed to make the cut for Soon Come is almost inconceivable. The 88 Keys-produced uptempo jazz-hop hoe-down ""Jamboree"" breathlessly rubs shoulders with more obscure undie-classics like the Djinji Brown-produced underground-manifesto-by-way-of-kettle-drum-workout ""The Music"" (sample lyric: ""Hip-hop will never leave its rightful rulers/ That's why I still make jams for B-boys and oldschoolers/ While y'all be at the jewelers, I'm dropping gems"") and the Rhodes-laced ""Better"". Furthermore, the record's opener, ""Mid-Atlantic"", flips the chorus of J-Live's classic ode to travel, ""A Charmed Life"", and drops in the midst of an Asheru production of wavering vibes notes, Rhodes chords, and that ol' Primo boom-bap to head-nodding results. That said, there's little on 48 Months that was overtly groundbreaking in its day; most of these tracks are burdened by the ""conscious"" idealism of the doomed, Rakwus-ignited mid-90s underground. And yet, the record's predictability is precisely what makes it so moving; 48 Months only falters when it attempts to appease buyers with ""previously unreleased"" club remixes like the lame-titled ""Soul Dub Version"" of ""Smiley"" and the uninteresting Seven Heads freestyle session with J-Live, Grap Luva and Sondia, ""How You Livin'?"". These low-points notwithstanding, 48 Months further fuels anticipation for Asheru's upcoming solo album, and serves as a hip-hop time capsule for an era when cats like Common Sense used to rap (not sing) and Mos Def wasn't the Hollywood go-to for a black male love interest and Andre 3000 was just 'Dre and everyone thought The Roots were crazy for playing it all live and Jay-Z only rhymed about ""Money, Cash, Hoes"" and Eminem was unknown even on the Detroit club circuit and...","From the very genesis of this motley twenty-something bastard that backpackers like to call ""hip-hop"" and cultural studies professors label ...

Action Pact,Sloan,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a45f5e6ef95969320868/1:1/w_160/1aa80c2a.jpg,2004-01-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7249-action-pact/,BMG,"Sloan have been conquering power pop for over a decade now with an incalculable and possibly illicit debt to every great glam, punk, and hard rock band of the 1970s. The songs are irreproachably written and rhapsodically performed, and yet they remain incarcerated within the shackles of influence. It's not even as clear-cut as a derivative band churning out songs not up to par with the icons they emulate; on past albums, Sloan has written better songs than anything The Rolling Stones have put out in 20 years. It's nothing more nor less than comfort food: virile riffs, clunking drums, four-part harmonies, and disparate songs with lyrics that range from the exhaustive task of getting a girl to love you to the exhaustive task of getting a girl to love you for a slightly longer period of time. As anyone who's ever lived through a reality I like to call ""perpetual pain and torture"" knows, comfort food is often valuable, even necessary. There are a lot of accolades to shower upon a band that masters such difficult terrain. Sloan has effectively perfected Pitchfork's ""7.0"" ranking starting with 1994's Twice Removed and continuing to the present. If one were grading the band's ability to sound like ""7.0"" rankings, they would receive a ""10.0"" with honors-- a quintessentially inessential band. They're always five or six feet from greatness, which is probably close enough for all but those with preternatural musicality or, alternatively, blindness. Vastly unsurprisingly, Action Pact does nothing to develop or modify the plan of attack. There has been a proposition put forth for some years now that Sloan is gradually and achingly achieving some sort of mighty unity between their four members/songwriters, as if they were unwilling participants in some evil incantation. Allay your fears: They are here to kick out the jams, crush your square parents' scams, and get the hell out. Nothing more. Thus, the welcome and predictable opener, ""Gimme That"", is garage-pop that resists description because it has been described so many times before (in my first paragraph, for example). Whether this album warrants purchase can be decided from the second song: The lyrics are, ""You know you're wrong,"" the excess is converted into cowbell, and the guitar snaps into a deceptively simple circle that can accumulate a few brief moments of melancholy amidst the glee. For the most part, however, the riffs are addictively frivolous in the AC/DC/Aerosmith school of riffs with the laughable shuttle-launching production of prog (courtesy of Tom Rothrock). Of course, when combined with torrents of three chords and the occasional drop of angst, this bears the potential of a muddled, second-rate pop-punk with crestfallen teenage vocals that comes to full bloom on ""Who Loves Life More?"" And then, carrying on a 70s tradition that's gone from Bowie to Big Star, there has to be one slower, more melodic piece about silence and aging as a respite from the rest of the album's rock glory. ""The Rest of My Life"" fills this space admirably with its jangled, sing/speaking guitars and the ""I started thinking 'bout the rest of my life"" solemnity. Sloan is not anyone's favorite band. It's doubtful Sloan's mom even places them in her Top 10. But there's simply no way to disrespect or disdain them. They're like the 2 Fast 2 Furious of pop. The car-crashing movie is about cars crashing and nothing else; the nostalgic jagged pop band, Sloan, is about nostalgic jagged pop and nothing else. They're a band with their heart worn on their sleeves. And even though that heart used to belong to a lot of celebrities from 1974, Sloan reminds us that stealing can be a badge of honor as well.","Sloan have been conquering power pop for over a decade now with an incalculable and possibly illicit debt to every ...

Dear Bicycle,Nathan Michel,by: Casey Rea,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45769fc7814a47cd870/1:1/w_160/d8d0d2b6.jpg,2004-01-29 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5263-dear-bicycle/,Tigerbeat6,"In this, the age of the laptop, mobility and fluidity have become watchwords of the modern electronic composer. An idea is only as valid as the speed with which it can be documented and processed. The art of collage and cut-up have been present for a great deal longer in the literary and visual arts world; it's only been with the recent advancement of computer technology and sound destroying/rebuilding software plugins that music has been so democratized. The last tethers to the recording studios of yore have been severed, and the musician is free to draw inspiration from sources all around him-- the terrestrially mundane can be elevated to the celestially sublime; all it takes is imagination and familiarity with one's favorite software. Nathan Michel is counted among the increasing number of these electronic alchemists. Though somewhat obscured by his higher profile compatriots at Tigerbeat6, he's shown a remarkable penchant for daring yet highly listenable cut-and-paste. There is, of course, the typical madcap grabs at popular music, as the ghosts of club funk and the knowledge/acceptance of IDM form the skeleton of Michel's abstracted architecture. But what separates this recording from most of his contemporaries' efforts is his genuine sense of wide-eyed wonder, a childlike fascination with each new musical shape and juxtaposition that drifts by as the album unfolds. There's a palpable feeling of discovery on each track, as though Michel himself were delighted by every gurgle, pop and coo. Recently, musicians operating within this genre have been increasingly unable to resist adding sung vocals, often to weak and or/embarrassing result. Nathan Michel is again an exception; his vocals occupy the same relative space as any of the other delicate carnival attractions he's displayed. I get the sense that he's less concerned with why he should be suggesting these moods and textures, and more appropriately with how they sound in context. This golden rule, which should be the common denominator of electronic exploration, is often forgotten or temporarily ignored, in favor of progress and novelty. ""Magellan Fields"" is a perfect example of the spontaneity and fearlessness this album evokes. Slightly detuned acoustic guitars are cut and re-assembled (a la The Books) to form a comfortable nesting place for a gorgeous, unprocessed electric guitar solo. It's a nice juxtaposition, but more importantly, it's refreshing to hear this familiar voice in a modern electronic recording. The landscape is shifted, the redundant and conventional is suddenly made fresh again, and expectation is turned on its ear. Electronic music is possibly on the verge of a serious progression. The old classics are just that: wonderful historical landmarks in the pantheon of a music that demands progress and motion, even in stillness. The tools are there, and composers like Michel are taking full advantage of them. For those interested in bearing witness to such developments, Dear Bicycle is a gorgeous documentation of the real-life thrills that can occur when the rules of musical convention cease to apply.","In this, the age of the laptop, mobility and fluidity have become watchwords of the modern electronic composer.

Para Dieswärts Düül,Amon Düül,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18413d1975652138658/1:1/w_160/b5545947.gif,2004-01-29 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/421-para-dieswarts-duul/,OhrOhr,"Most of German communal outfit Amon Düül's records were culled from a single, epic jam session in the late 60s. What that means for listeners is a vast collection of material that, if you're a fan, never fails to delight. However, since the ""band"" was quickly dwarfed by their mutinous former colleagues in Amon Düül II, their reputation has tended to sag near areas suited more for slightly embarrassing little brothers and mix tapes you made in fifth grade: charming in their way, but otherwise best not brought up in conversation. The most renown Amon Düül record, Psychedelic Underground, is indeed semi-fascinating in small doses, but after a while, my attention always lapses and the ragged (albeit inspired) performances begin to morph into a formless, meandering goo. Judging the original Amon Düül against their more musically inclined successors, or really any other band, is probably unfair. They might very well hold up as well as any other hippie commune's drum circle cuts would, and given the group's proximity to future krautrock legends should give them an edge. For this reason, 1970's Para Dieswärts Düül is a better yardstick by which to measure their purely musical contributions. Rather than compiling still more hazy footage from group space-outs, Amon Düül's third record (originally released on the legendary Ohr imprint) features actual songs, very much in a free-folk vein, but with English lyrics, melodies and basic rhythms nonetheless. If you're hoping for a relatively earthbound intro to the band, though, this is still pretty out there-- and truthfully, I still prefer modern groups like Charalambides to Amon Düül. Still, Repertoire's new reissue of their most easily approachable record reveals that even though they could pull together an album of songs when need be, they weren't necessarily songwriters, or even a terribly interesting group of musicians. The lengthy ""Love Is Peace"", which originally filled all of the LP's first side, highlights the band's penchant for tuneless balladeering and the mileage one can wring from a single chord on captive acoustic guitars. The male vocalist (one of many musicians identified by name on the album, but not according to what they played or sang) reminds me of a more stable Damo Suzuki, though when the group harmonies enter during the ""chorus,"" the band could be any number of psychedelic nature-folk units, one part Donovan, another Tom Bombadil. At one point, everyone stops down to a series of echo-drenched guitar arpeggios that do lend the piece a spacy ambience, but can't quite make up for the ensuing seven additional minutes of stream-of-consciousness poetry jamming. It's a shame, because the rest of the record isn't bad. Originally, the (almost) rocking ""Snow Your Thurst"" and genuinely alluring ""Paramechanische Welt"" made up the entire LP, but the reissue includes the melancholy single ""Eternal Flow"" and an alternate, electrified version of ""Welt"" entitled ""Paramechanical World"". Both ""Welt"" and ""World"" are examples of the kind of laid-back, sunny folk that works as both psychedelic mantra music and straightforward folk-pop, of the kind CSN&Y modified into outright pop and took to the bank. There isn't much in the way of lyrics, but the moaning vocal melodies should be put in a time capsule as perfect examples of the deeply impassioned, disembodied floating lines that have yet to be improved upon since the Age of Aquarius. Whatever you think about the first Amon Düülers, they had flower power down pat.","Most of German communal outfit Amon Düül's records were culled from a single, epic jam session in the ...

Single Three EP / Single Four EP,Papa M,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe9c0084474cd0bfa32/1:1/w_160/d5bd84ac.jpg,2004-01-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11800-single-three-ep-single-four-ep/,Drag City,"Patient: I know I got one of them disorders. I'm stalking Dave Pajo, the man behind Papa M, which is not the name of a failed late-80s reggae crossover, but the name of a contemporary math-rocker-cum-quasironic-balladeer. I read Pajo's Livejournal. I print out the pictures. I buy a new ink cartridge when my printouts tint all funny. I've labored to create extensive analyses of his resume and his dandruff. See my assessments of his EPs Three Songs, Songs of Mac and first two tour singles. Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. Well, fanhood's not necessarily a pathology, though many who succumb to it end up unduly regarding their subjects with aggression that suggests emotional reassignment. To what degree would you say you irrationally ""subscribe"" to Pajo's work? Patient: That's just it, fakedoc! Pajo's embarked on this somewhat regularly scheduled release-fest. He has his once-mighty label Drag City distribute a three-song blurt every month or so. He calls the singles an ""audio tour diary,"" but here's the real fuck-you-Charley about that claim: His band Zwan imploded, and his solo outfit is not on tour! So why these do two recent issues feature Travelocity artwork of a highway horizon and a railroad crossing? Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. Why do you feel the need to make sense of Pajo's career when your own life is such a shambles? Those Polaroids of your ""DNA collection"" in the garage were very distressing, to say the least. Hair, and blood... Patient: ...and Cheerios. Why oh why doesn't Pajo record under a more stealable name? ""Papa M"" is as peer-to-peer proof as ""The The""! When I try to download him, I get Madonna's ""Papa Don't Preach"", Papa Roach's ""M-80"", and Run DMC's ""Papa Crazy""! Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. Why don't you try to describe his appeal to me, an outsider? Patient: Okay, on Three he ""covers"" the Celtic traditional ""Wild Mountain Thyme"", which you might know from renditions by James Taylor, Glenn Frey, Marianne Faithful, Sandy Denny or Roger McGuinn. At least two of those people have been filmed ruminating behind the wheel of a sports car. Just like Pajo's sometime recording and touring partner's recasts of standards, Pajo changes key lyrics: here, ""lassie"" becomes ""sweet potato."" At least he's finally crediting his covers, which is more than can be said for his early vocal work. Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. ""Patient draws false connections, and derives deep purposes from their connotations. Suggestive of late-onset schizophrenia."" Patient: After the strings and female backups of that opener, Pajo delivers an acoustic breakdown of Lowell George's classic bit of Stuckey-iana, ""Truckstop Girl"", a nugget of freighter-core already revisited by The Byrds. Only it's not entirely acoustic. At 3:33, a wailing-cellophane electric guitar solo kicks in! As any occultist can tell you, ""333"" was all over Madame Blavatsky's sketch of King Solomon's signet ring hexagram. Adolf Hitler planned his suicide on April 30, 1945, at precisely 3:30pm. The White House presented its Middle East road map to Sharon at 3:30 on April 30, 2003. President Bush landed on the Abe Lincoln for his ""U.S. Fatalities Not Even Halfway Accomplished"" speech at 3:33pm EST, May 1, 2003. The time around April 30-May 1 marks the celebration of the Pagan holiday Beltaine/May Day. Did I mention that this EP is Pajo's third in this series and that it contains 3 songs and comes after an EP called Three Songs? Jesus spent 33 years as a mortal and 3 days dead. Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. Please keep twaddling while I press this button which will alert the restraining orderlies of their need to come and bum-rush you. Patient: ""Who Knows"" is one of those great ""full-band"" Papa M tracks on which he accompanies himself on vocals, keys and at least three echoey guitars. His production is badass, especially the crisp drums, reminiscent of those on his full-length Whatever Mortal's requiem for The Simpsons, ""Krusty"". This song pales, though, next to Four's equally layered ""Long May You Burn"", the sweet archness of which recalls Will Oldham's ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"", which, coincidentally, Oldham has redone for that cave-in-to-fair-weather-fans album of favorites he made with Trashville sessionaros. ""Burn"" might be the best thing Pajo's lain down, but for the annoying loop of whispers. With its imagery of snakes and fire and family values, this one's ready to join the great apocalyptic oldies. Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. What do you mean by ""apocalyptic oldies?"" Patient: Have you ever listened to ""Stand by Me""? What part of ""if the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall, and the mountains should crumble to the sea"" don't you understand? Pajo's tune is ready to join that classic. Its video should consist of slo-mo shots of the roster-calls of baseballs teams that recently lost the World Series high-fiving each other. The song should be licensed out to a hipster dramedy on The WB called Ian's Creek. Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm in general. Patient: The six-minute ""Local Boy Makes Good"" might be a rocker, but it's almost too confident and measured. I am reminded by its outsized squalling Royal Truxery of how record stores display Pajo's EP sleeves in huge, plastic box-set cartridges that won't fit inside my preventive girdle without suggesting prostate cubism. ""Local"" sounds like Hayden or some such overheater. The only song I haven't touted yet is ""Red Curtain"", an imposing banjo slowdown that Folkways types will find sprinkled with the ashes of Roscoe Holcomb and Sandy Bull, except for its gleefully anachronistic shout-out to The Modern Lovers. And get a load of the CD artwork! A bird finger! Pa-jo's not gonna take it! No! He's not gonna take it! Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. Here, ""take"" this pill from a company protected in the Homeland Security Act from lawsuits regarding mercury's link to autism. If you like ""hard rock,"" you'll love ""hard science!""

The Lex Diamond Story,Raekwon,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f4b1335d7bf16985eb/1:1/w_160/8a16d2ac.jpg,2004-01-29 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6906-the-lex-diamond-story/,Interscope,"After 1999's lackluster Immobilarity, Raekwon's third and latest full-length has a lot of making up to do. However, the lack of name producers (one of the record's contributors disparagingly calls himself Crummie Beats) and the absence of RZA from the album credits seemingly dooms The Lex Diamond Story to mediocrity from the start. Good news, though: Raekwon thankfully swerves around the R&B; flavored synth-hop of his last outing here and, surprisingly, stumbles onto his own proverbial Stillmatic, a rather self-conscious and haphazardly successful attempt at recreating the sprawling criminology-laden glory of his landmark 1995 debut, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. The album fittingly opens with a lackluster intro that tears a page from the RZA handbook to laughable effect: As a rainstorm pours in the background, we're treated to the poorly recited ""legend"" of Lex Diamond (Raek's ill-advised some-time alias here). Fortunately, the rolling, percussive barrage of ""Pit Bull Fights"" quickly kicks in, and Rae shocks the world with a classically inspired verse. The nostalgic album highlight ""All Over Again"" fares even better: Over a Kanye West-derived production of chipmunk-soul vocals, choppy percussion, and gushing strings from newcomer Mercury, Raekwon reminisces of his early days with The Wu: ""The Clan were one of the greatest/ We did platinum back in '93/ We was living who y'all trying to be/ RZA had a vision/ Instead of cooking coke in the kitchen/ He told the god hit the booth and start spittin'."" Furthermore, on ""Missing Watch"", Raekwon and Ghostface recreate the classic chemistry they shared on much of Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. Even conceptually the track is brilliant; what could be more suited for a unselfconsciously ostentatious guy like Ghostface, the kind of guy who actually walks around wearing a gigantic gold-plated hawk on his arm, than a song about losing your watch that ""costs about a mansion"" while out in a club? Over a wailing electric guitars, Rae and Ghost frantically jar, ""DJ turn the fucking music off/ We got announcers we want ya/ To listen clear/ We just lost about a mansion in here/ If we don't get it back it's gonna be a problem/ Ain't nobody leaving alive until we find it!"" Unfortunately, those are just about the only highlights within this glut of pseudo-commercial, RZA-lite sonics. ""Ice Cream Pt. 2"" features forgettable cameos from Method Man and Cappadonna, and an instrumental so unnecessarily syrupy that I was worried any minute Mariah Carey might break out on the track's hook; it's so awful, I even had to remind myself I enjoyed the original. ""Robbery"" is a shameful posse cut, where Ice Water Inc. (Raekwon's new crew) spits inspired rhymes like, ""'Cause like the bomb, I'm waiting to blow up."" ""Planet of the Apes"" is another bout of patriarchal insecurity-driven blather, where guests Capone and Sheek Louch run threats like, ""Me and chef spark massive murder/ Killings, I scramble anywhere,"" and ""The Hood"" is built on the same clichéd piano melody that EZ-Elpee made famous over a decade ago (at least they decided to give Isaac Hayes' wildly oversampled ""Walk on By"" a rest). In trying to recreate the energy of his earlier work, Raekwon's made The Lex Diamond Story a considerably better listen than its hapless predecessor, but its lack of creativity and innovation ultimately doom it to irrelevance: Who'd rather listen to this than Cuban Linx?","After 1999's lackluster Immobilarity, Raekwon's third and latest full-length has a lot of making up\n\ to do ...

Hypnotic Underworld,Ghost,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf1a5e6ef9596932335f/1:1/w_160/706a23e6.jpg,2004-01-28 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3440-hypnotic-underworld/,Drag City,"Despite a seasoned aversion to hippies, I purchased Ghost's gorgeous self-titled debut in 1993 at the Princeton Record Exchange, about three years after its release. Fresh out of an SST-dosed high school experience, the Tokyo band's crystalline chamber folk, swirling incantations, and tendency to play and squat in Buddhist temples, abandoned churches and caves not only signaled my entrance into a more expansive musicality, it linked them on an aesthetic and spiritual level with the apocalyptic folk of one of my favorites, Current 93. Besides the dream catching, the group's uncanny ability to turn new-age atmospherics into blistering psych transcendence linked them solidly with Magic Hour, another of my early obsessions. And though I'm still patiently awaiting the collaboration with David Tibet (who, interestingly enough, is currently working on a project with psych pin-up boy Ben Chasny), I was floored in 1995 when Ghost and Magic Hour went on tour in the U.S. and Japan. To my ear, both groups benefited. On one side, the trip inspired the jingly acoustic-centered instrumentals, ""SunsetOne"" and ""SunsetTwo"", on Magic Hour's final opus, Secession '96. It also planted the seeds for Ghost's 2000's full-length collaboration with ex-Magic Hour rhythm section, Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang on the best Damon & Naomi record in some time. For Ghost, Magic Hour's rock excess invaded their pristine habitat, leading to the mastery of a heavier, rock-monster strain of psychedelia on subsequent releases. And nowhere is the rock more intense than on Hypnotic Underworld. Since Ghost's inception in Tokyo in 1986, the band has released consistently solid, ambitious records; but on their seventh full-length, the sextet transcends all of their prior rock outings (though the beautiful psych-folk Snuffbox Immanence still stands as the best of their quieter material). It's the first long player since 1999, and it combines the strongest aspects of its predecessors, resulting in an unbelievably beautiful mix of ethereal improvisation, blasted guitar (think Zeppelin), heady prog, Golden Earring swagger, Incredible String Band-styled naturalism, a gorgeous, slow-motion, circus-music cover of Syd Barrett's ""Dominoes - Celebration for the Gray Days"", and a melancholy take on Earth & Fire's ""Hazy Paradise"". Toying with the usual end-of-album epic, Hypnotic Underworld unfolds assuredly with the 23-minute title track. Broken into four distinct movements, the first, ""God Took a Picture of His Illness on This Ground"", is a 13-minute improvisational piece recorded live in the studio. It's spare, discordant heterophony lined with intermittent percussion, electronic bursts, brushed or scraped strings, down-the-well percussion, and whinnying saxophone. The instruments Ghost brings to this record-- contrabass, cello, mellotron, lute, Celtic harp, recorder, hurdy gurdy, tabla, 12-string acoustic guitar, theremin, flute, bouzouki, etc.-- create strong, surprising musical landscapes. The second section, ""Escaped and Lost Down in Medina"", a seven-minute, multi-layered piano-and-horn-driven epic (check out the tambourine in the left track) evokes the dense and sprawling work on 1994's live record, Temple Stone, as well as some anonymous 60s jazz freakout or fellow Japanese improvisors, Trembling Strain. But it's the three-minute third section, ""Aramaic Barbarous Dawn"", that sets the tone for the remainder of the album. Opening with near-cricket chirps and fabulously catchy O.D. oscillations, it tears into heavy guitar riffs and a rock-anthem chorus of voices before multi-instrumental vocalist Masaki Botah takes control, rising from the other voices, and arcing as triumphantly as Queen. The opening suite is capped with ""Leave the World!"" a 22-second exclamation of death-metal drumming (cymbals, snare, hi-hat) and frantic keys. Each of the seven remaining compositions locates an enjoyable moment, before tearing beautifully through to the other side: ""Piper""'s forlorn whistle launches into 70s jazz-rock and back; ""Holy High"" introduces pulsing Celtic psych; and the ten-minute ""Ganagmanag"" moves from flute swells downward into plucked strings a prog time-shift, echoed shouts, Botah's breathy count-offs, and tribal drums. Everywhere, empty spaces are lined with powerful augmentations like tiny trills, subtle noise accents, repetitions, and rock flourishes. For instance, when the Barrett cover that closes the record whispers to an end, the band kicks into a stage-clearing maelstrom of manic church organ, vibrating shouts, gongs, bells, war drums, and wiry feedback. It's this sort of unexpected pomp and swagger, mixed with the solemn ambiance, that clearly separates Hypnotic Underworld from the tree-hugging psychedelia of yore. Much more could be said, but it's more important to state plainly, in barest terms, that Ghost have emerged as one of the most formidable (and important) rock bands I know. And Hypnotic Underworld is their rollicking masterwork.","Despite a seasoned aversion to hippies, I purchased Ghost's gorgeous self-titled debut in 1993 at the Princeton Record Exchange ...

Never Never Land,UNKLE,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e8ea9e61561daa5924/1:1/w_160/a730fd19.jpg,2004-01-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8358-never-never-land/,Mo'Wax,"Six years on from its release, Psyence Fiction-- the long-simmering pet project of Mo'Wax founder James Lavelle and his then-UNKLE co-conspirator/meal ticket DJ Shadow-- still ranks as one of the most anti-climactic and jaw-dropping disappointments of recent years. Seemingly powered by Lavelle's own sense of self-satisfaction, the record pulled off an odd triple crown: it was overcooked, half-baked, and underdone all at the same time. An epochal mix of atmospheric, experimental hip-hop and soul-stirring rock, Psyence Fiction was an unapologetic attempt to create an epic Statement of a record, but while long on star power and ambition, it came up short on little things like, oh, vitality, restraint, emotional resonance, and tunes. From the go, Psyence Fiction was highly anticipated by writers who assumed it would produce greatness. Instead, they got lazy Hello Nasty melodies, Entroducing-outtake breakbeats, and guest spots that seemed mismatched with the project itself. Despite Mike D's phoned-in wisp of a cameo, the biggest raspberries must go to the always punchable Richard Ashcroft whose ""Lonely Soul"" is so seeped in new age pandering and the drive to be Very, Very Important that, were compact discs not limited to 80 minutes, it would probably still be teasing us with false stops and pointlessly unspooling to this day. Lavelle's decision to follow with another UNKLE record is laudable for its gumption if not its wisdom, but it's no surprise that, as much as the four-years-in-the-making Psyence Fiction was anticipated, Never Never Land was ignored (even by your pals at Pitchfork-- after all, the record was released in the UK more than four months ago). After mostly handling the conceptual and marketing details of the first UNKLE record, Lavelle took a greater role in the musical conception of this disc. DJ Shadow is out as Lavelle's right-hand man, now replaced by the largely unknown Richard File (though it might have been wiser, if only for publicity, to bring back the DFA's Tim Goldsworthy, an original UNKLE member from the pre-Shadow days). And the new roster of guest stars-- among them, Stone Roses vocalist Ian Brown, Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, and Massive Attack's 3D, plus uncredited appearances from Brian Eno and Jarvis Cocker-- doesn't have the same sort of A-list ring offered by the first record. And yet, in spite (or because?) of all this, it's an improvement on the past. Never Never Land seems to address its predecessors' failure and Lavelle's own spiraling career right from the start, as a spoken-word sample (rather wince-inducingly) describes life as a series of peaks and valleys. Lavelle's basic approach to music-making hasn't changed. He still trades in texture and atmosphere, favoring sweeping strings, cinematic grandeur, a mix of pop sensibilities with downtempo music, and an obsession with science fiction. The addition of File lends a more human quality to the tracks, largely because his hand guides a series of voices whereas Psyence Fiction had Shadow dealing more with a series of personalities or stars. File's arid singer/songwriter approach and wistful vocals lend Never Never Land a breezy quality, but also little to pin down or ground the tracks. Rhythm is almost completely replaced here by often drifting atmospherics, and of File's key contributions, only the graceful ""What Are You to Me?"" really shines. When beats are central to the tracks-- as on the Joy Division-sampling paranoia of ""Panic Attack""-- they're oddly compelling. Of the guests, 3D's ""Invasion"" chides Bush and Blair (a theme also hinted at on the Temptations-quoting ""Eye for an Eye"") but pulls too few punches, Homme's ""Safe in Mind"" is spacious but forgettable, and Cocker and Eno lend a couple of hands to a sleepy ambient exercise. Oddly, Ian Brown's batty echo chamber ""Reign"" is appropriate spliff-casualty stuff and among the album's strongest tracks. So Never Never Land is far from being either vindicating or enthralling. It's sometimes paranoid, sometimes aimless head music. This time, there weren't any UNKLE action figures or other branding attempts, just a quiet record that was quietly released and has (already) quietly slipped away. It's just as well: Considering the buildup to, quality of, and career fallout following Psyence Fiction, anonymity may suit Lavelle. It at least positions him to regroup, crawl out of his valley, and aim once again for those peaks.","Six years on from its release, Psyence Fiction-- the long-simmering pet project of Mo'Wax founder James Lavelle and his ...

Prairie School Freakout,Eleventh Dream Day,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3fea9e61561daa742c/1:1/w_160/69b6011d.jpg,2004-01-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2742-prairie-school-freakout/,AmoebaAmoeba,"Flip through your calendars and count the days: It's been nearly fifteen years since Chicago's Eleventh Dream Day released the Wayne EP and its accompanying full-length, Prairie School Freakout. And although the manic-panicked smoke of the late 80s/early 90s alt-rock boom has long since cleared, a handful of acts have yet to see their legacy become the namedrop-du-jour for wristbanded up-and-comers or bespectacled college radio purists (see the somehow-still-ubiquitous Sonic Youth, the beloved Pixies, or the soon-to-be-reissued Dinosaur Jr). For whatever reason, Eleventh Dream Day are still waiting to be slapped with a golden sticker of canonical approval, despite the necessary elements already sitting firmly in place (a disastrous major label tenure at Atlantic, distant boy/girl interplay, tons of distorted guitar, and general commercial unresponsiveness). Until now, Eleventh Dream Day have been strangely excluded from the 120 Minutes nostalgia club, which is stupid, considering the band's palpable influence and impressive fury. Unsurprisingly, Prairie School Freakout eventually fell out of print, prompting Chicago-based indie Thrill Jockey to reissue the record, along with the Wayne EP, as a double package. Recorded in six sweaty hours in a polluted Louisville swelter, Prairie School Freakout is a frantic, occasionally hysterical burst of irrepressible guitar rock that the band admits is ""pretty much live,"" save a dubbed bass note and some extra guitar squeal. Picking up and moving past where the band's eponymous debut left off, Prairie School ultimately solidified EDD's mission as super-distorted Crazy Horse disciples with an overabundance of post-adolescent fervor. And some insanely loud amps. As sticky and pure as the transplanted living room on its cover, Prairie School opens with boiler ""Watching the Candles Burn"", a fiery guitar assault in possession of the greatest bad insult ever (""If looks could kill/ Here's looking at you""), and follows up with ""Sweet Smell"", another prickly guitar throwdown. Nearly everything about Prairie School Freakout is unapologetic, but frontman Rick Rizzo and guitarist Baird Figi's ridiculous guitar solos are just so audaciously wanky that it's almost impossible not to stick your tongue out and air along with them. Janet Beveridge Bean's drums (check her in Freakwater) and Douglas McComb's bass (check him in Tortoise, Aluminum Group and Brokeback) are both driven and perfectly able, although the throbbing rhythm occasionally seems like just an excuse to slather on more guitar. Still, the hyper, overwhelming kinetics at work here are clearly the product of four reeling heads, and while Prairie School Freakout may not be EDD's most accomplished or comprehensive effort, it's certainly their most explosive. The very best reissues create tiny glitches in our cultural timelines-- conceptually, they challenge music to supercede its original context, and to translate itself into an entirely new (and sometimes drastically different) artistic lexicon. Obviously, nothing is ever realized within a cultural vacuum, but that doesn't necessarily deny records a capacity for timelessness-- the best albums can be appreciated both inside and outside of their founding circumstances. Prairie School Freakout may be instantly recognizable as a holdover from the pre-grunge alt-rock rise, but it's still got plenty of ass-kicking glory left inside. Which, as far as legacies go, really isn't too bad.","Flip through your calendars and count the days: It's been nearly fifteen years since Chicago's Eleventh Dream Day ...

Punk Rock,Mekons,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41cea9e61561daa808e/1:1/w_160/59ce440e.jpg,2004-01-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5209-punk-rock/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"The difference between ""quality"" and ""nostalgia value"" is as simple as checking whether a song still speaks to you ten years after you discovered it. That should be simple, but it can be hard to cut through the baggage that comes whenever a familiar artist wanders back in time: When someone digs up their old material, it's assumed to be more of a sentimental gesture than a substantial one-- unless they've got an even thinner gimmick in mind. So it's hard not to get mired in expectations when you learn that the Mekons recorded Punk Rock after their 25th anniversary tour, and that it captures fifteen songs that they wrote at the band's birth (1977-81), but recorded-- some for the first time-- in the last couple years. It's a relief when the Mekons ditch all ceremony and basically treat this as a lark; they aren't trying to get ""loud and sloppy"" again, they don't expect reverence when they cue up ""Never Was in a Riot"", and the mishmash of approaches to this stuff-- from studio to live recordings, mbira-colored ballads to raw shouting-- suggests nothing but a genuine curiosity for what kind of use they can beat out of these songs. And these are fifteen of the most lumpen bashed-in songs the band ever wrote, hard knobby droppings that stomp and gnash in fast bursts. Even the scope is stunted: The ""can't get ahead"" frustration of songs like ""32 Weeks"" reminds us that this band raged harder at the landlord than the Queen, and the live takes on ""Dan Dare"" and ""Fight the Cuts"" are pounded down like a poor man trying to squeeze coal into diamonds. As for the slower tracks, ""Work All Week"" drops the angry stride of the Quality of Mercy is Not Strnen original, though its poignancy comes less from the lyrics than the weary way Jon Langford sings 'em: ""I'll work all week to buy a ring/ Extra hours to get real gold."" ""Rosanne"" is even more cutting: ""If you have other men I will like them/ If they take you, come, I'll forgive you/ But if they take you away I will cry."" And although they didn't have any zombie songs to dig up for Sally Timms, she gets the next best thing: the axe murder story ""Chopper Squad"", where the words run out quickly but the banjo gets to wander into dissonance. But even as Punk Rock shows that The Mekons have far better musicians today than when they were first fumbling around with Gang of Four's instruments, it also proves they're better songwriters. The songs still have something to say, but now they sound like the musings of someone who never got out of his first basement apartment. The Mekons are one of those rare bands that never stopped sounding ""punk,"" that never got slow, boring or sane: They just broadened their horizons. And based on this evidence, it's a good thing they did.","The difference between ""quality"" and ""nostalgia value"" is as simple as checking whether a song still speaks to you ten ...

Dreams of Water Themes,Adventure Time,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a183ea9e61561daa4807/1:1/w_160/29ba2dab.jpg,2004-01-27 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/420-dreams-of-water-themes/,Plug Research,"Since the release of his 2002 debut, Invention, I have been quick to purchase, post-haste and unheard, any album bearing Daedelus' name. The album's sound, largely sourced from old 78s, created one of the more unique sounds in IDM this decade, and worked primarily due to his clear respect for the material: he never aimed to displace so much as a crackle, fearing he might disrupt the musty spirit of the samples that attracted him to them in the first place. It hasn't hurt that his sense of humor has always shone through as well, from last year's brief Household EP, to the quirky avant-nostalgic production behind the Busdriver & Radioinactive's The Weather. But something's happened. Late 2003's Rethinking the Weather, a Daedelus-spawned remix of his work on the aforementioned Busdriver & Radioinactive LP, was atrocious-- a lukewarm, unfocused (and unnecessary) compilation of reworked material that lacked both enthusiasm and creativity. And now the guy's collaborated with Dublab's Frosty to schlep together a lazy, mindless and utterly tedious waste of plastic and good cover art titled Dreams of Water Themes. I don't know what to think anymore. If a song doesn't plan on having a compelling structure, the composer ought to attempt to make each moment of the song-- by variety, or some hook, or some curious sound-- compelling in its stead. Adventure Time seem to disregard their only responsibility to the listener, namely, to spare him of boredom. And this oversight is most obvious when their debut tracks reach their climax, as they often do, within the first thirty seconds of the song, then bask like half-wits for anywhere from three to four more minutes with nary an alteration. In effect, one could digest the entirety of Dreams of Water Themes in a few minutes simply by clicking through each track's opening sequences and moving on to the next; this summary includes the four run-of-the-mill speech samples comprise their own tracks and add nothing to the album, except as a reminder that, if you bought this album, you totally got ripped off. The bass, drum and bell groove of ""The Age of Aquariums"" is certainly promising, and nearly interesting upon a middle-eastern flute's entrance and the camp jazz vocal sample, but plateaus in energy and ideas. The Clouddead-meets-L.L. Cool J's ""Phenomenon"" novelty that is ""Whetting Whistles"" features the faux-intelligent wordsmithery of Pigeon John, who, whether he's being ironic or enacting a persona or doing whatever intelligent rappers think they're supposed to do, embarrasses himself with lines like, ""There's one thing I learned on the North Hills streets/ A man has to work if a man wants to eat."" Final track, ""Rusty Anchors Wrestling Waves"", wanders for seven minutes so aimlessly that one can only conclude it serves as the grab bag for all the samples that Daedelus and Frosty couldn't work into other tracks. ""Kappabashi"" is the only track on Dreams of Water Themes that doesn't suffer from a shameful paucity of ideas, and is actually quite good. Here, the duo cooks up a distinctly 60s Blue Note feel around a minor third piano progression reminiscent of John Coltrane's ""Giant Steps"" that eventually settles into a blues with a spatter of strangely echoed vibraphone samples. Children play in the background every so often, and an honest trumpet drone eventually sounds in concordance with gargled strings and piccolos. A rich and vibrant sound collage, ""Kappabashi"" not only comprised Adventure Time's most realized effort here, but also seemed to be the one in which both Daedelus and Frosty had much at stake emotionally. At the very least it's a tenderness that we know Daedelus is able to muster; hopefully this Adventure Time ship will dock for good.","Since the release of his 2002 debut, Invention, I have been quick to purchase, post-haste and unheard, any album bearing ...

No More Songs About Sleep and Fire,Poster Children,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a109b1335d7bf1698169/1:1/w_160/d4532afa.jpg,2004-01-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6437-no-more-songs-about-sleep-and-fire/,Hidden Agenda,"The scene is Downers Grove, Illinois, 1995. In the musty, cigarette-reeking studio of WDGC, projecting literally dozens of watts into the west suburban Chicago sky, a young boy palm-sweatingly broadcasts a phone interview with his favorite band to three or four listeners. Struck with a speech impediment from talking to rock stars, the boy stammers out an Interview 101 question on how their latest album is selling. ""We just sold our 200th copy,"" quips the bassist, ""meaning our certification has been upgraded from cardboard to styrofoam."" The heavy-sweater was, of course, me; the band on the phone was, of course, the Poster Children. As teenagers who care about such things tend to do, I had made the Posterkids my pet band, the group just obscure enough that I could appear one step ahead of my peers, accruing precious ""you mean you've never heard...!"" points with their anime-inspired album covers. Not only were they my first interview (and close to my last-- I never did get very good at it), but the first time I moshed/crowd-surfed was at one of their shows (after being dropped off at the Wrigleyville Dog by my parents), and their RTFM album was the subject of my very first published record review. This trip down memory lane isn't entirely self-indulgent, as the Poster Children themselves seem infected by the nostalgia bug on No More Songs About Sleep and Fire, their first album in four years. After a 16-year career which peaked commercially halfway through with a video on 120 Minutes and a doomed record deal with Sire, the Champaign quartet is in joyous regression, hearkening back to their Steve Albini-produced punk debut, Flower Plower. It's hard not to call it a midlife crisis, with a new tight-bodied drummer standing in for a new tight-bodied girlfriend. But lest my comparison has you imagining the musical equivalent of the bald guy in a Porsche, let me quickly state that the Posterkids sound positively ageless through No More Songs about Sleep and Fire, not having missed a flailing beat through the intervening years of decreasing tempos. Temperance anthems ""Kate"" and ""The Bottle"" cruise through high-RPM states like a teenage straight-edge band, though the message packs more punch from musicians old enough to buy alcohol. Political rage is manifested well in the brutally indignant riff of ""The Leader"", even if the megaphoned lyrics bring to mind the episode where the Simpsons join a cult more than a sports- and sex-obsessed State of the Union Address. Themes of nostalgia and backwards time-travel coalesce with ""Western Springs"", appearing in the traditional Poster Children second-track single position. Fond reminiscence of suburban homes, chemical green lawns and full refrigerators, the song highlights the chain-link interplay of brother guitarists Jim and Rick Valentin with bassist Rose Marshack, the group's vocation as computer programmers in Champaign's Silicon Cornfield leading to jittery rock made up of tiny complementary parts. Highlight reel: Fretslide sirens ricochet around chanted vocals through ""Flag"", R. Valentin works his David Byrne impression on museum-punk ""Sugarfriend"", the group revisits their too-caffeinated-to-properly-shoegaze past with ""Shy"". That the Poster Children have abandoned their tech-forward leanings (they were also the first band I saw sport a laptop on stage) to their ambient side project Salaryman is only half a shame; their binary skills were always better suited to CD extras anyhow, like the album-length commentary track that graces No More Songs. And despite a slump in the middle of the album, overall it maintains surprisingly high quality, proving again that the Posterkids are subject to a shallower slope of diminishing returns than other bands of their era. By looking back to their giddy-punk roots, the Poster Children swig from Cortez's water fountain, and in the meantime manage to throw this indie-jaded reviewer back to the good parts of being 15 again.","The scene is Downers Grove, Illinois, 1995.

Phantom Planet,Phantom Planet,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04f13d197565213835c/1:1/w_160/16793c8a.jpg,2004-01-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6258-phantom-planet/,Sony,"Okay, I get it: I have to write about the music now. Yep, Jason Schwartzman is gone (though he did participate in much of the recording process), and Phantom Planet have recorded a square-one, hear-us-again-for-the-first-time, career-redefining rock album in his wake. This, their self-titled stab at garage-rock celebrity, has forced me to shelve my arsenal of diversionary Slackers 2, ""California"" on Leno, O.C. soundtrack-ready, pop-by-the-numbers japes in favor of-- what a concept-- actually telling you something you didn't already know about the record. But first, let's get through the basics: legendary indie producer Dave Fridmann was enlisted for the project in a counterintuitive push to navigate the turbulent asteroid-fields of distortion, drive, and relentless energy Phantom Planet storm through here. The guys do ease up somewhat in the second half, but the net result is a record of overwhelming deconstruction and newly explored territorial demarcation. On their new self-titled LP, Phantom Planet are unapologetically retrofitted (current trends withstanding), distortion laced, galvanic, garage-rock ""with an edge."" In fact, the lead single ""Big Brat"" is decidedly less instantly infectious than anything the band has recorded to date. Driven by pummeling drum work and a distorted bassline, the track's linear progress is impeded only by a moment of tainted, chaotic reprieve before it summarily reemerges for a propulsive flourishing squalor. Alex Greenwald's vocals have taken on an insouciant sneer, and for the most part (as on this track), his choruses rarely articulate any newfound sense of melody, but rather serve as a breaking point for his bleary-eyed, slurred and spat verses. He sings with enough jaded conviction to convince you he's in no way affiliated-- nor even so much as interested in-- Oscar after-parties and Paper-sponsored celebrity get-togethers. Songs such as the opener ""Happy Ending"" and the second half's obligatory pace setter ""Jabberjaw"" offer a churlish delivery of heavily front-mixed, unflaggingly bushwhacked drum and bass leads, behind which Greenwald's verses and subtle guitar melodies take temporary shelter from all the clutter, shifting only enough to flag down an austere rhythmic verse to chorus handoff. ""Happy Ending"" is an example of the formula at its most virile, boasting a catchy guitar rhythmic breakdown, and ""Badd Business"" finds similar success through a ska-tinged (well, it's the ""tinged"" that saves it) bass beat and a quick lived group-shouted choral explosion. The breaking point of the album is the slackened-guitar-strap, hair-in-eyes eruptive shoegaze toss-off ""You're Not Welcome Here"", where all strengths past and present fail to carry the track as a purebred rocker. Like it or not, some off The Guest's finest moments were a result of Phantom Planet's willingness to deliver unabashed pop melodicism, and while the scraps of this feast remain scattered about and buried within this new album, there are none on this track. The second half of the album, then, showcases the worth of enlisting Fridmann. Both ""By the Bed"" and ""After Hours"" retain the simple delicacy of Phantom Planet's earlier work, and though newly framed as subdued rockers, they deliver fine moments of relative retrospection and tepid seduction. Greenwald's vocal delivery takes back the frontline on ""After Hours"", as he coolly chastises L.A.'s pretentious nightlife, smugly singing, ""You dress so nice/ You dress to kill/ They drop like flies, but/ Who's the funeral for?"" So, too, does the opening half of ""Knowitall"" ride this wave of retro-pulsed, softly spun revelation, before succumbing to an unfortunately predictable cathartic chase and burn flourish. Thus, it unfolds; a band eschewing its strengths can both find success and disenfranchisement. Fortunately for Phantom Planet, this album offers a good deal more of the former, but even if it represents method-acting at its finest, I'm willing to suspend disbelief long enough to let the curtains fold.","Okay, I get it: I have to write about the music now.

The Complete Recordings,28th Day,by: Philip Welsh,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86f9d034d5c69bf3a42/1:1/w_160/4f19c397.jpg,2004-01-27 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8248-the-complete-recordings/,Innerstate,"It's like those Chinese dishes where beef and chicken are stir-fried with lobster and shrimp, and the mind's gustatory processors can't quite figure out what the hell to do with the combined meat/seafood taste-- I can't think of any other era in music that allowed the ""good band/bad producer"" gene to flourish the way 80s ""college rock"" did. Cheap synths will always sound flat and dated in ways that not even the venerable Mellotron can match, and bad new-wave keyboard washes upstage the most earnest Velvets/Beatles/Byrds ripoffs. Like the old saw goes, it's all in the mix. I bought those Let's Active reissues last summer and was appalled: ""I used to listen to this unicorny shit? Ech."" After similarly unsatisfying re-encounters with The Rain Parade, Three O'Clock, Thin White Rope, Vietnam Veterans, Robyn Hitchcock & The Egyptians, early Screaming Trees, etc., I was ready to write the whole 80s neo-psych-cum-roots-rock movement off as a necessarily naive but ball-less forerunner of grunge, Terrastock, Elephant 6 and all the other genres and scenes of the 1990s in which bands figured out how to recreate-- a la Borges' Pierre Menard-- your basic psychedelic mindfuck. So I wondered about my 2004 reaction to 28th Day, now reissued with almost three times as many songs as the original boasted. I loved their Russ Tolman-produced EP when it came out on Enigma in 1985-- it was the record to put on when you were suffering a gray bout of R.E.M. or Dream Syndicate oversaturation. The band, based in the dinky California college burg Chico, consisted of a teenage Barbara Manning, her boyfriend Cole Marquis, and inanely coifed drummer Mike Cloward, none of whom (with the exception of Babs on a rare release or two) have wowed me much with their output in the two decades since. Marquis, in particular, has seemed a lost cause-- his Downsiders most often remind me of The Hooters or The Call. So what went wrong? For their youth, both Manning and Marquis tapped into a timeless source of guitar/bass/drums rock, and even by wizened/jaded 2004 standards, this stuff still sounds as beautiful and rich and satisfying as it ever did. Anthems of heartbreak, odes to inarticulatable sadness, paeans to the dead! Sandy Denny could have sung most of these tunes without breaking a Brit-folk sweat. ""25 Pills"" and ""Pages Turn"" have to be a couple of the stokedest West Coast jangle-pop songs ever written. And not enough praise can be given to ""Lost"", in which Barbara's perfect backing-vox lift Cole's preternaturally world-weary chorus to West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band heights of poesy. And ""Holiday""! And that tripped-out live cover of George Harrison's ""It's All Too Much""! Why doesn't Barbara write songs like this anymore? It's flawless: verse/chorus/verse, an unrepentant fansong to all the bands she's ever loved, yet simultaneously totally unique and itself. Indeed, this is what it sounds like to be young, gifted and white-- or at least, how it sounded in 1985. From the sound of it, 28th Day were intent on being the proverbial Best Band in the World, writing and playing from the collegiate perspective that says desire and true grit are all you need. How American-- how naive to all the squalor and decrepitude down the line-- except that, for a split second, as this CD testifies, they really were the best band in the world.","It's like those Chinese dishes where beef and chicken are stir-fried with lobster and shrimp, and the mind's ...

It only makes sense that they'd finally be ready to release a new EP at the start of 2004, if for no other reason than to keep themselves fresh in the public hivemind. After all, their audience is surely growing restless by now-- surely, Different Cars and Trains would tide them over until the next LP. Well, it would-- assuming it had the decency to offer new songs, which it doesn't. Rather, Different Cars and Trains-- as hinted at by the title, pulled from the lyrics of Neon Golden's ""Pilot""-- is a too-convenient stateside gathering of scattered remixes (and one B-side) lazily culled from the band's import-only singles (Pick Up the Phone, Pilot and Trashing Days), which have been available on P2P networks since shortly after Neon Golden's release. This, in itself, is fair, since not all of us are file-trading degenerates, and even fewer of us have access to (or can afford) costly imports; the real problem lies in that none of these tracks recapture the affecting solitude that haunted Neon Golden's best moments, and instead offer cold plates of commonplace, textbook IDM. The EP starts with two surprising remixes from Console, the primary alias of The Notwist's programming guru Martin Gretschmann. I say ""surprising"" because it seemed obvious enough to me that few people would be interested in hearing a proto-house remix version of Neon Golden's bluesy, banjo-laced title track. Gretschmann, apparently, felt otherwise, and situated the song's lonesome Wurlitzer chords and confessional banjo motif atop a jarring dance pulse; hearing frontman Markus Acher pleading ""don't leave me here"" over this incessant disco thump decimates the song's humanity. Console's ""Pilot"" remix (one of two reworkings of the song included) fares only slightly better. The same throbbing pulse is again employed, but is greeted here by obligatory reversed vocal snippets and languid rhythmic flourishes that only succeed in overwhelming the tasteful minimalism of the original version. The Console remixes are followed by the sole new submission on Different Cars and Trains, the instrumental ""Red Room"". Organic flute loops serve as an introduction, followed by percussion lines that roll by on the usual hi-hat cymbals and clicks, while standard electronic pings are added to the mix. Acher's coolly detached vocal melodies and uniquely identifiable guitar work are both sorely missed here, particularly given that they're such a defining element of the group's most recent sound. Fortunately, Different Cars and Trains' two closing tracks swiftly rescue the disc from total insignificance. Four Tet's Kieran Hebden and Manitoba's Dan Snaith offer a first-time, dream-team collaboration in their remix of ""This Room"". Over a driving funk break, the duo cooks up an ode to all things reversed: tunnels of backwards vocals, slide guitars, percussion and god knows what else swarm past in blurs, while washes of the original version's Rhodes keyboards constitute the pastoral chill evident in both artists' solo work. Interestingly, you can really hear who's responsible for what here, as the programmed jazz breaks echo those of Four Tet's Rounds and the dense wave of glassy chimes and looped vocals and instrumentation sound ripped from the same hard drive that produced Up in Flames. The closing remix of ""Pilot"", retitled ""Different Cars and Trains"", is also worth putting down money for. A contribution from Loopspool, a member of the Notwist-affiliated jazz project Tied & Tickled Trio, the rendition cleverly transforms the thirty-second dub-break of the Notwist original into a blissful five-minute space-out of hazy atmospherics and pungent basslines. These two closing tracks offer a glimpse at what might have been, had the band thought to outsource their remixes to artists (like, say, ones that aren't in the band) who might have had fresher and more varied takes on the Notwist sound. Instead, Different Cars and Trains stands as a disappointing, and rather uneventful, diehards-only affair-- a cheap tease to keep you on the edge of your seat in dutiful anticipation of whatever Germany's experimental pop heroes decide to do next.","It's been over two years now since the original release of The Notwist's landmark Neon Golden, an album ...

Kila Kila Kila,OOIOO,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e95e6ef95969322a91/1:1/w_160/2f2e386f.jpg,2004-01-26 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6014-kila-kila-kila/,Thrill Jockey,"Like a lot of people, I got into OOIOO at the height of a Boredoms fixation, when eY3 & Co. started to slow down and my ravenous hunger for Boreproduct could not be satiated. By the time Feather Float was released in 2001, I'd had plenty of time to fully absorb Vision Creation Newsun and the word on the street was that drummer Yoshimi P-We's side project carried a torch that by then had a flame a mile high. That claim turned out to be false, but I still enjoyed the hell out of their oddball pop/rock, and I appreciated the moments when they occasionally assumed the krautrock-worshiping drive of the mothership. Feather Float was OOIOO's second record, and they've had a Japan-only release in the interim. Now they return for their fourth album and Thrill Jockey debut. To this point, OOIOO has generally been a loud, energetic rock band with new wave leanings and an occasional fondness for tribal stomp, but on Kila Kila Kila, experimentation rules. Yoshimi is stretching here, trying her hand at extended forms, some new instrumental configurations, and compositions that depend heavily on repetition. Perhaps realizing that Boredoms may be no more, Yoshimi seems inclined to use their unique flavor of psychedelia for her own ends. Kila Kila Kila is severely hampered by a painfully slow start. The first three songs, which total roughly 17 minutes, go nowhere. The title track starts the record off with a minute-and-a-half of organ noodling and chattering voices, and then ""Ene Soda"" is five minutes of wind chimes, a single limp power chord that appears periodically, and some half-hearted howling by Yoshimi. ""Sizuku Ring Neng"" is a little better, with a discordant guitar riff that finally awakens the drums about six minutes in, but then the final five minutes just sort of simmer without reaching a boil. These are the kind of moments the Boredoms use to tease the listener before a dramatic crescendo, but here they just stretch endlessly to the horizon, parallel lines that never combust. Finally, with ""On Mani"" comes the first good song. With its twitchy guitar riff, trumpet and rollicking drums, it sounds like an epic, crazed rewrite of an old TV Western theme. That it eventually implodes into a quartet of strings working their instruments over with jagged sawtooth tones is even more inspired. Unfortunately, this plateau is not maintained, as Kila Kila Kila dips back into Dull Valley during ""Northern Lights"" and ""Niko Niko Niko"". Yoshimi has some interesting guitar work here, sometimes suggesting the noisy logic of the dueling lines that wind through Trout Mask Replica, but these tracks never catch fire. The 15-minute closer ""Anuenue Au"" ends on an exceptionally high note, however, delivering the kind of deep, expansive psychedelia that her regular band perfected. A throbbing mess of strings, beatific harp runs and wordless chants, ""Anuenue Au"" is a grand spire leading heavenward. I want to follow Yoshimi into the clouds, but most of Kila Kila Kila is heavy in all the wrong ways and strangely earthbound. With any luck, this is a palate-cleansing transitional record.","Like a lot of people, I got into OOIOO at the height of a Boredoms fixation, when eY3 & Co. started ...

Maldoror,Erik Friedlander,by: Jascha Hoffman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be86abf31b7dc7156169/1:1/w_160/8b36ec95.jpg,2004-01-26 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3287-maldoror/,Brassland,"In 1846, Isidor Ducasse was born to a French consular official in Uruguay. By 1862, he had graduated from a French boarding school, where he's said to have excelled at arithmetic, drawing, and Latin verse translation. He was known to his peers as a silent boy who wrote ""bizarre and obscure"" poems. At 21, he was described by his editor as ""a big, brown-haired young man, unshaven, nervous, of regular habits, and hard-working,"" known to his neighbors for banging out verses at the piano. A year later, under the pseudonym le Compte de Lautréamont, he published the Chants de Maldoror. His death in 1870-- at 24, the age of your humble reviewer-- went unexplained and unnoticed, fulfilling a line from his last book: ""I know my annihilation will be complete."" That it was, until half a century later, when surrealists started gushing over his dark wit and transgressive logic. Maldoror excited André Gide to the point of delirium, and André Breton went so far as to call it ""the expression of a total revelation which seems to surpass human capacities."" Maldoror is the kind of prose work that only a poet could love, a lavish and rapt necrocopia, fleshed out with obsessive rigor in a spirit that can truthfully be called cruel. If it has a plot, it is the narrator's descent into savagery and madness as he decides to follow the thorny path carved by his evil twin, Maldoror. But the whole thing is a little too decadent and far too choppy to be paraphrased. Producer Michael Montes, we are told, took the risk of making Maldoror the basis for an album of improvisations by New York cellist Erik Friedlander, his first solo release. The formula is simple: put a piece of Ducasse's text in front of the cellist in the studio, along with a few notes, and let him compose music to match it on the spot. It panned out, more or less, not because Maldoror was conceived as a series of songs, but because Erik Friedlander can do things with a cello that should have a reasonable listener fearing for her life. Rostropovich one second and Rottweiler the next, Friedlander is a credible threat, working over the poet's perverse logic with power tools. The results are surprisingly literal settings of the poems, some falling flat, some holding up to repeated listening as through-composed studies would. Others work better as scores to enhance the creepy effect of the prose excerpts printed in the well-designed (if maddeningly typeset) liner notes. We hear a single detuned tendril blossom into a blurry wall of thorns, cautioning the weak reader to turn around before he reaches the gate. ""For unless he bring to his reading a rigorous logic and mental application at least as tough enough to balance his distrust,"" warns Lautréamont, ""the deadly sins of this book will lap up his soul as water does sugar."" He makes good on this promise immediately, with a passage commanding the reader to grow out his fingernails so he can skewer the heart of a prepubescent boy, ""but not so that he dies, for if he died you would miss the sight of his subsequent sufferings."" The wind starts up, but its tenor lament is interrupted by gratings and gnashings. ""Then dogs, driven wild, snap their chains and escape from far-off farms,"" the poet starts in, as uneven figures come to the surface. ""Suddenly they stop, stare in every direction with a fierce unease, their eyes ablaze... as elephants in the desert look up one last time at the sky before dying, desperately lifting their trunks..."" Screeching octaves whine up at the moon, gasping for punctuation, sawing their own torsos with bitter fifths. Dawn breaks suddenly, and it's time for some airier mind games. ""O stern mathematics, I have not forgotten you since your learned teachings, sweeter than honey, filtered through my heart like a refreshing wave,"" pluck the arpeggios as they sketch a stream of open chords. Just as a halting melody surfaces, it gets swallowed by a honeydew froth, as math clears the air with ""an excessive coolness, a consummate prudence, and an implacable logic."" Not for long. A madwoman tiptoes in-- gnawing, scraping, sobbing, scribbling-- as if driven ""like a poplar leaf blown along by the whirlwind of unconscious powers"" toward a world ""she glimpses again through the mists of a demolished mind."" No sooner does she vanish than the poet begins a long slow metamorphosis, with an earthmelting drone offering up a fine bouquet of mud and mulch. ""I am filthy. Lice gnaw me. Swine, when they look at me, vomit."" As the reader looks on in horror, the cello drops tendrils as its master turns to fungus. ""Seated on a shapeless chunk of furniture, I have not moved a limb for four centuries. My feet have taken root in the soil forming a sort of perennial vegetation not yet quite plant-life though no longer flesh as far as my belly is filled with parasites,"" the poet declares proudly. ""My heart, however, is still beating.""","In 1846, Isidor Ducasse was born to a French consular official in Uruguay. By 1862, he had graduated from\n ...

The Devil Isn't Red,Hella,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c146ea9e61561daa7d69/1:1/w_160/4d74401a.jpg,2004-01-26 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3961-the-devil-isnt-red/,5RC,"I envision Hella canvassing stacks of Nintendo Power back issues in mom's attic, eulogizing the primitive lure of 8-bit home gaming. Both guitarist Spencer Seim and drummer Zach Hill openly pledge allegiance to the dusty gray console that reared so many of us-- Seim has even logged time in a Nintendo cover band. It shows. Hella dance a highly technical, relentlessly suffocating two-step of pummeling percussion and breathless guitar, which, for all their torrential fervor, retain the primitive simplicity of a single-minded two-man sonic tag-team. At the very least, The Devil Isn't Red systematically shakes down like it was the rocker's score to upper-level Tetris-- no matter how swiftly the pieces descend, Hella manage to drop them in place. For most of this record, Hella run a constricted gauntlet of tangled (if slyly unified) instrumental rock songs. Opener ""Hello Great Architects of the Future"" is akin to witnessing someone's garbled attempt to spit a string of unsorted numbers, where the mind desperately clings to pockets of order despite all attempts to randomly abandon them. Upon first witnessing such pyretic tracks as ""Suistyle"" and ""Top Twenty Notes"", you may question the duo's ability to replicate even a single run, given the seemingly off-the-cuff pairings of such polyrhythmic drumming and menacing guitar lines. But the code is pure-- Hella couldn't get no tighter. The title track, which features some nimble, Heroic Doses-style guitar jamming, and ""Welcome to the Jungle Baby, You're Gonna Live"", sport the purest rhythms, and as such, sustain longer than any of the album's other tracks once the disc stops spinning. Disparate onslaughts of complex rhythms blend seamlessly together with wrist-breaking punishment. And Hella shreds true even when they go digital: ""Brown Medal 2003"" sounds like a soup kitchen riot broken up by homeless robots, while ""You DJ Parents"" draws a straight line to antiquated game tracking. Without such inclusions, the record could play as a single 30-minute track, because for the most part, The Devil Isn't Red is unapologetically linear in scope. This reluctance to deviate from form both solidifies the band's grip and confines its orbit. Hella's technical proficiency is undeniable, but their vision is to be considered. I, too, once considered duct-taping Tetris into my Nintendo. My scores were stellar and my addiction certifiable.

Three Piece Suite,Jack Nitzsche,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9619d034d5c69bf51ea/1:1/w_160/4f445b0d.gif,2004-01-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5886-three-piece-suite/,Rhino,"Jack Nitzsche had his thumbprints over much of American pop, from the early days of the Wrecking Crew and Phil Spector's mono-lith of radio dominance through Neil Young's nascent ""Expecting to Fly' and the Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"", all the way up through schlocky 80s soundtracks for Starman and the cringing ""Up Where We Belong"" duet from An Officer and a Gentleman. There's also an infamous early episode of Cops where he appears as the weird cokehead that lives up in the Hollywood Hills. At the time of his passing, he was supposedly slated to work in the studio with Mercury Rev. Originally an Internet-only release through Rhino Handmade, Three Piece Suite cobbles together two finished albums Nitzsche delivered to Reprise in the early 70s, only one of which was to ever see the light of the cutout bin. St. Giles Cripplegate remains a confounding, confusedly hung mobile of muddy cattle skull and dry bones, made somewhere between Neil Young's Harvest (on which Jack banged piano as a Stray Gator and all but drowned out Neil in the delirious orchestration of ""A Man Needs a Maid"" and ""There's a World"") and his crossover to soundtrack work like the schizophrenic Performance and 1975's breathtaking One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. To the deaf ears it fell on from that coked-up era's ceiling (and to a confounded Reprise PR group who thought they were getting a hit like Harvest II some six scant months later), it was considered a ""classical"" recording. But what does that mean, aside from the fact that, yes, the London Symphony Orchestra does appear in its entire 130 pints of glory? The charts have an internal logic to them (at least in Nitzsche's fried-egg head), but the structure of the orchestra is abandoned in favor of neurotically emotional outbursts and chemically induced sensations of grandeur and paranoia. Tailored somewhere between the most schizophrenic and idyllic of tones, St. Giles is suspended above the feigned celluloid of fantasies, these six pieces tendering tempestuous moods that swoon between lusty volatility and a vertiginous lushness. Fervently sawed strings or delicately plucked pizzicatos hold the pieces afloat, and perhaps as a sort of pre-Boredoms number fuckery, track one is ""#6"", followed by ""#4 (For Mori)"" and so forth, concluding with the sixth movement, ""#5"". The clashing portions of the symphony brass and strings are titanic indeed, and more atmospheric than your Grandpa's Boston Pops records, but the results are schizophrenic Strauss and delusional Debussy. The unreleased record that makes up the second part of this disc would have been Jack's debut in the popular singer/songwriter vein so prevalent in So-Cal at the time. Given his gradual shift to film work, it was birthed out of a collaboration with director Robert Downey during the shooting of his Greaser's Palace. With a bit of imagining, it could be taken as a soundtrack of sorts, perhaps something with Warren Oates in it. One where the faces tic and squint in the hot sun, and characters have rash outbursts of emotions every other minute or so. Fans of Sunflower-era Beach Boys, Van Dyke Parks, Randy Newman, et cetera will have plenty to bask in here, lots of peculiar rays and haze, if not one of the weaker singing voices. Thankfully, Nitzsche's producer sleight-of-hand shuffles the sounds rapidly, and random changes make sense like dream-logic. Our man opens the album with a suite of sorts, smooth in his goodbye to ""Lower California"" before crooning out, ""I'm the loneliest fooool in the atmosphere,"" washing out to sea on his telltale tides of strings and piano. What follows is some south of the border jalopy-holler on ""New Mexico"", but even that disappears after a minute or two. Even ""Moodus Run"", a bluesy floppy-booted stomp, quickly dusts itself off with rubbed wineglasses, evaporating in the hot, hallucinating sun. That cues up the peculiar entrance of a young John Fahey, doing a surprising session of slide work for the wasted ballad, ""Marie"". After which, we arrive at the album finale, ""Number Eleven"", where the desert heat really gets to you. The track's tom-tom drums and prairie ghost reeds are quickly obscured by a dust-storm drone of symphonic hallucinations. The End? More demos follow. Unlike what we imagine most demos to sound like, here it's all silk lining, with more bows and strings than most artists see in a lifetime. Nitzsche sings all slurred again, drunk on strings, with weird odes to Carly Simon and the same blue-jean baby that Elton John would belt about on his own ""Tiny Dancer"". And Fahey reprises his role as the rambling guitar slinger, gracing ""Reno"" with his trembling slide. While definitely not for every taste, there is enough weird, early 70s sound to beguile the adventurous, and what more could you ask from such a collection? Or is it in the end a soundtrack for a lost film? Or is it neither, just Jack Nitzsche somewhere strung out on the ether between Boston Pops and orch-pop, his suit casual enough for reclining at the cabana, yet dressy enough for watching as evening's odd, drugged shadows crawl along the streets of Tijuana.","Jack Nitzsche had his thumbprints over much of American pop, from the early days of the Wrecking Crew and Phil ...

Cold Mountain,Jack WhiteAlison Krauss,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa8bc0084474cd0c11f8/1:1/w_160/a2ca7621.gif,2004-01-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8766-cold-mountain/,Sony,"Given the blank-faced antipathy normally reserved for film soundtracks, it was an especially curious genre-trump when 2001's roots-heavy O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack garnered itself shitloads of commercial success (over 6\xBD million sold!) and tons of critical woo-hooing (including a fairly unexpected Album of the Year Grammy). Credit superstar producer T-Bone Burnett's archivist instincts, or the lunatic collision of an Appalachian folk song and George Clooney's shameless mug-- either way, O Brother is single-handedly responsible for tugging the soundtrack out of its premature grave and granting American folk its first truly popular revival. For the Cold Mountain soundtrack, Burnett has burrowed back into his yellowing sack of nuggets and emerged with a fistful of gritty, mid-19th-century classics and long-lost Americana. The resulting record combines original orchestral scores, contemporary shape-note singing, covered obscurities, and freshly written songs, all held in place by the commercial super-spike of Jack White (and aided by the big-name-songwriter credits of Elvis Costello and Sting). White has always been vaguely preoccupied with his ever-important (if occasionally unclear) tenets of authenticity, and his work on Cold Mountain is an oddly telling mirror to The White Stripes' throwback blues-rock parade. In addition to being recruited for musical toil, White was also cast to portray a traveling Civil War-era troubadour in the film-- and his contributions to the soundtrack are guised in the exact same kind of otherworldly, hat-and-backpack costuming that his bit part openly demanded. No matter whether you credit White's sonic role-playing to his wider musical agenda (see the Stripes' incessant Delta re-appropriation) or just to plain old method acting, Cold Mountain is still a pretty convincing turn: Gone are the wild, fluttering yelps of his Stripes work, replaced by scrappy, talking-blues squeaks and gruff whispers, and his trademark guitar noodling has been mercifully superceded by scraped, tinny strings and perfect bluegrass picking. Performing a handful of traditional cuts and one original, White is ably backed up a dream-team of dusty country players, including Dirk Powell on banjo, Mike Compton and Norman Blake on mandolin, and Stuart Duncan on fiddle. White opens the record with ""Wayfaring Stranger"", a tortured traveling ballad (previously taken on by Johnny Cash, Sam Bush, Alison Krauss, and Emmylou Harris); while White's homeward-bound moans are sometimes disappointingly resigned, the trembling acoustics of his bandmates are more than sufficiently agonized, and ""Wayfaring Stranger"" is as inviting as it is defeated. White's lone original, the sweet and acoustic ""Never Far Away"" also benefits from the kind of soft, dynamic backing that Meg White just can't seem to provide for him (and sees more of Norman Blake's mandolin, with cello by Nancy Blake). White's involvement may be causing the most commotion, but it's the Sacred Harp Singers of Liberty Church that deserve all the tongue-wagging attention. Using traditional shape-note harmonies (a trend efficiently documented by Smithsonian brainchild Alan Lomax, and oddly resurrected last year by Portland indie-pop quartet The Joggers), the Liberty Church Singers warble in perfect, a cappella four-part harmony, their collective bellows bouncing up and down between each of the four shape-notes. Meanwhile, the Sting-penned ""You Will Be My Ain True Love"" is impressively voiced by bluegrass matriarch Alison Krauss, although her able pipes do little to transcend the over-arranged sappiness of the song itself, which features Sting on backing harmonies and a few too many weeping strings. Krauss' pairing with Elvis Costello, on the Costello-written ""The Scarlet Tide"", is far less overstated: A pretty (if ultimately benign) piano melody and some subtle cello rub quietly, backing up Krauss' breathy coos. Composer Gabriel Yared also contributes four sweeping, orchestral breezes that pile up on top of each other at the bottom of the record; while appropriate for the film, they're unnecessary and cumbersome on the soundtrack, upsetting the dirty, proletariat posturing of the album's other cuts. While the chances of the Cold Mountain soundtrack matching the success of O Brother are pretty scrawny, it's still an oddly compelling collection, with a small handful of traditional cuts finally getting the wide release they deserve. Far more interesting than a Jack White vanity outlet, the record is an engaging-- if inconsistent-- dip into grubby, pre-radio pop.",,7.1,

Her warm, full-bodied tone decorated both Around the House-- one of the more pleasant surprises on Pitchfork's Best of the 1990s redux list-- and the more jazz-inflected Bodily Functions, which should be a lock to place on a selection of this decade's top albums. This year, Herbert and Siciliano stick to their familiar roles but this time she gets her name above the title on her debut solo record, Likes.... Herbert has put a lot of recent effort into patronage: he's focused energies on his Accidental Records label (which recently issued the Matthew Herbert Big Band LP Goodbye Swingtime and the well-received You Are Here compilation) and has now assisted with production on Likes..., although the inspiration and credit should go to Siciliano, who recorded the album in her new self-made studio. Still, it (thankfully) doesn't fall far from the tree that Herbert and Siciliano planted together years ago: Sometimes sparse and always delicate vocals, clicking and whirring beats, the occasional funeral parlor brass and austere strings. Despite Siciliano's touch, it's the sonics that often take center stage on album highlights such as ""Same"" and second single ""Extra Ordinary"". The all-too-short interlude ""Canes & Trains"" is reminiscent of the fantastical mix of percussive clatter and top-hat-and-tails of Dancer of the Dark, and it segues well into the martial, back-alley rattle of Walk the Line, Matthew and Dani's most Tricky/Martina moment to date. The lowlights come with the straightforward electro-pop track ""She Say Cliché"", and ""All the Above"", featuring Herbert's Icelandic protégé Mugison, who proves an underwhelming match for Siciliano's vocals. A lounge version of Nirvana's ""Come as You Are"" could have been gauche, but Siciliano draws out the song's already languid tones with far-away sighs and the rather touching emphasis on the word ""memory."" It's the same trick that the Scissor Sisters do with ""relax"" on their Frankie Says: ""Comfortably Numb"" cover, but with a quite different effect. On Likes..., the overall effect is much as one would expect from Siciliano and Herbert. It's a record that, at its most atmospheric, hints at the Northern European noir of Nico, but splits the difference between the former VU chanteuse's early singer/songwriter work for the Immediate label and the darker tones of her 70s solo efforts. The middle ground may not be as captivating or unexpected as either extreme would have been, but there's still plenty to here to recommend.","Even if you don't know Dani Siciliano's name, you may very well recognize her voice.

Perpetuum Mobile,Einstürzende Neubauten,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc12ea9e61561daa73b1/1:1/w_160/ab0e4056.gif,2004-01-25 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2698-perpetuum-mobile/,Mute,"There was a time when Blixa Bargeld and his band were the spree killers rampaging through malls on busy Saturdays, all searing anger, deafening noise and violent flash. The visceral power of their first decade of work is undeniable-- they had christened themselves Einstürzende Neubauten (German for ""collapsing new buildings"") and they made music to match the moniker, employing scrap metal and dental equipment to give it the necessary sturm-und-drang. After releasing a series of lackluster albums in 1990s which lost the immediacy of their prime work, the band made an impressive rebound with 2000's Silence Is Sexy, and they've all but perfected the more restrained approach begun on that album with Perpetuum Mobile: Where once they embodied bursts of malevolent violence, they're now something more akin to a different kind of murderer: the long-term, reclusive serial killer, whose neighbors find to be the quietest, most polite person on the block, but who has secretly buried 48 bodies in the woods behind his house. On the whole, this is the quietest Neubauten album to date, frequently lowering to a mere whisper, but don't let this fool you-- no album this band has made in the past has bristled with so much latent violence or been haunted by a more palpable sense of unseen menace. Bargeld sounds unbelievably relaxed and calm, drifting amid music that violates your sense of what is harmonically and rhythmically decent, and the two main culprits of this are the percussion and programming. The album is precisely rhythmic, but mixed into the fairly straight rhythms are noises that scrape and warble, pitches that hide in unpleasant frequencies, and of course, Bargeld's measured German sing-speak. All of these elements combine to create such a seamless mix of the mundane and the sinister that it can't help but raise the hairs on your neck. This approach is used to devastating effect on ""Selbstportrait mit Kater"", the verses lurching along on a repeated bass note and scattered percussion as Bargeld delivers his lyrics on what sounds like the verge of anger. Instead of exploding, though, he simply allows the music to do it for him, in the form of some nasty, metallic slamming noises that rhythmically frame the subtly delivered vocal hook. The sprawling, 14-minute title track is incredible, clinging to a minimal electronic beat as the music mutates from quietly melodic passages to outbursts of metal percussion and into a terrifying verse backed primarily by the high-pitched vocal screech tones that Bargeld seems uniquely able to perform. The movement between extremes is kept unpredictable-- segments vary in length and intensity for maximum nerve-racking effect. Unfortunately, Perpetuum Mobile doesn't maintain this sinister tone for its entirety; the polite electropop of ""Youme & Meyou"" is especially lightweight, and sounds desperately out of place, too consonant to effectively meld with anything else here. Still, for the most part, this is a strikingly effective album, one whose dread and foreboding stick like residue after it comes to a halt in the player. These guys may not have the non-stop intensity they once did, but they've replaced it with a tension that's just as effective.","There was a time when Blixa Bargeld and his band were the spree killers rampaging through malls on busy\n ...

When the more popular drugs made you whisper to invisible snow-queens and crumple into fetus-like stupors for days on end, there was no place for California's loneliest Elvis-loving, hormone-injected, primordial punk freaks. Underrated, but undeterred, the band (fronted by Roy Loney and guitarist Cyril Jordan) hobbled together a couple thousand dollars in 1968 and self-released their debut-- a seven-song, 17-minute 10-inch called Sneakers-- and waited for the throngs of sunglasses-worshiping teenage girls. To no avail. When you call your band the Flamin' anythings, there is an intrinsic contract drawn up with the listener. In return for the listener's undivided attention, the Flamin' band henceforth must muster snarling, leathering pinnacles of claustrophobically entwined guitar riffs and brutally overwrought vocals. At this early stage, the band simply couldn't quite contend with the ambition of its name. Nevertheless, they did come bearing three guitars, knowledge of every genre since the 20s, and enough cigarettes to fill their gloriously tight pants tenfold. It was apparently ammunition enough to forge one truly great song. ""Golden Clouds"" begins with all the brio of a tempest and recedes into a smacking bar-band rhythm as Loney ends every line with a twanged warble he flagrantly copped from every Sun Records song he'd ever heard. If that musty analogy is going to be brought up, let's do another one: If the Groovies performing on Teenage Head and Flamingo were the American Rolling Stones, ""Golden Clouds"" is the British Rolling Stones. It's perhaps the single greatest defense of blatant plagiarism ever recorded. Confusingly, then, the rest of Sneakers makes for some of the most willfully diverse stylization in the Groovies' repertoire. ""The Slide"" is sung with such smoothness and schmaltz that Loney sounds like he's auditioning for The Drifters. ""Prelude in A Flat to Afternoon of a Pud"" could qualify as circus jazz with its chugging harmonica and gallivanting guitar. The most surprising element is the band's penchant for 20s and 30s burlesque. The inflection on ""Love Time"" and ""Babes in the Sky"" is alternately leisurely cabaret or a flapper dance. They may be gimmicks (along with the bluegrass ""My Yada""), but they're gimmicks that are played fast enough, filthily enough, or tight enough to clearly be the work of a band that was about to hit its prime. How could a song with the line, ""L-O-V spells 'love time'"" be anything less than an ignorant rock riot masterpiece? For added value, The Rockfield Sessions have been tacked on to this reissue. Thus, a forced condensation of the band's trajectory: Got signed by Epic, released one great record, got dropped by Epic, toured with the MC5 and The Stooges, released two sell-all-your-posessions-and-buy-1,000-copies records, fell apart in a pit of despair and anger, and, like all great bands, went to fix their lives in Europe. Always a bad idea. Loney was out, Chris Wilson was in, and the band set up in Rockfield studios in Wales with neo-50s rocker Dave Edmunds as producer. The Rockfield Sessions is four covers and three originals, and it just might be the best rock album of '72. After the goofily adolescent Sneakers, the springing brass accretion of ""Married Woman"" screams sophisticated ingenuity. It's everything you need in a rock song: the nonchalant vocals of a true rebel, lecherous lyrics, and a bashing band that chars itself into slow, circuitous remains by the song's end. This might be the worst song of the bunch, and it still slides its way into the hall of fame. Condolences should be given to Chuck Berry, The Beatles, Jerry Lee Lewis, and all those other founders of modern music; the simple fact of the matter is that the covers of ""Get a Shot of Rhythm & Blues"", ""Little Queenie"" and ""Tallahassee Lassie"" are likely the best out there. ""Little Queenie"", in particular, starts with dusty metal inertia and whips into a frantic strut with that ""go, go!"" chorus. It's sort of like all of Reefer Madness condensed into three minutes and pumped into your blood. The Groovies' original songs are somewhat perplexing in this company, eschewing the shredded majesty of 50s rock 'n' roll in favor of smoother production and slower, more elegant melodies. The individual songs barely need to be mentioned because most of them later appeared on 1976's power pop classic, Shake Some Action, and they've been venerated and covered by everyone from The Dictators to Yo La Tengo. ""Slow Death""'s cowboy menace bends and slides over absurdly depressing lyrics. It's suicide with handclaps and a ""yeah, yeah"" chorus. ""Shake Some Action"" is the definition of a hastily defined genre known as fatigue-rock; the lyrics weakly try to rattle the singer's stultified weariness. There is simply no way to deny the cool simplicity of a lyric like, ""I will find a way/ To get to you someday,"" particularly when it's choired and on top of the thin line between self-annihilation and euphoria. Somehow, the Groovies even mined this desolation to find one of the best prancing arena-rock choruses to ever grace a record. It's difficult to tell whether the mixes from this session actually differ all that much from the ones on Shake Some Action or whether it just feels that way in the context of the old rock standards. Regardless, the sequencing of The Rockfield Sessions shows that the transition from juvenile early punk to pop maestros was not quite as sudden as it seemed. That said, two of the seven songs are familiar to any Shake Some Action enthusiast, and ""Slow Death"" is probably familiar to everyone else whether they're conscious of it or not. Still, The Rockfield Sessions is as good a place as any to start a budding Groovies infatuation, as it marries their early grime and later tunefulness in one of the essential expatriate rock sessions of our times. That alone, however, isn't a reason to seek out this record. Instead, perhaps consumers should focus on how it's the best seven-side single ever released. True, in the context of the immaculate songwriting and professionalism of The Rockfield Sessions, the bizarrely added Sneakers can't help but seem inessential. Still, this is more the fault of the former than the latter. Pretty much any album you paired with The Rockfield Sessions would end up sounding inferior.","

Talkie Walkie,Air,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02c13d1975652138302/1:1/w_160/896497e3.jpg,2004-01-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/81-talkie-walkie/,Astralwerks,"When attempting to encapsulate the essence of Paris in a word, Evelyn Waugh endearingly deemed the city ""bogus."" In his travelogue, Labels, he wrote, ""It seems to me this scrap of jargon, in every gradation of meaning... gives a very adequate expression of the essence of modern Paris."" Thanks mostly to San Dimas High School, in the seventy sum years since Waugh's trip, the term-- and bogus journeys, in general-- has evolved into a firm negative. Waugh, however, enjoyed Parisians' ability to dismiss nostalgia in art and revel in the present without regard to the future, past, or public reception. In so few words, the French don't give a fuck. Because of this, American audiences continually underestimate French music, assuming our rigid filters of ""authentic"" or ""ironic"" apply. Admittedly, the cultural barrier is difficult to overcome: Daft Punk's masked robot disco, Gainsbourg's reggae, and Phoenix's flying-V Steely Dan tribute seem cute and studied when compared to the supposed bleeding-on-wax of our idolized Kurts and Jimis. As such, investing emotionally in ""Sexy Boy"" was akin to a Cubs fan buying playoff tickets. Air's revered debut hit cosmetic commercials within weeks of its release and goes great with a dry Chardonnay. 10,000 Hz Legend opened with synthetic voices proclaiming, ""We are electronic performers,"" before 10cc choruses toyingly queried, ""How does it make you feel?"" Which makes the overwhelming beauty and longing of Talkie Walkie that much more stunning. No longer are Air's sincerities lost in translation. The album title (no, they're not being cute, that's just how they say it in French) knowingly acknowledges this fact. Like the communication devices, Talkie Walkie sounds intimate, yet distant and distorted. Hope Sandoval nailed ""Cherry Blossom Girl"" on a demo, yet in forgoing guest vocalists for the first time, Air unerringly personalize their songwriting. Stomping piano and opiated gospel handclaps march ""Venus"" in a brutal funereal pace through keyboards that break like dead, pale winter sunlight and falling ice. Tolling bells and crickets take the song into twilight. Somehow it's numbingly romantic. Atonal music boxes, Plutonian pings, and digital fugues create a Side One that evokes purgatorial drifting, running out of oxygen, and passing into the light after a Space Walk disaster. The second half with the propulsive ""Surfin' on a Rocket"", whistling ""Alpha Beta Gaga"", banjo-laced ""Biological"", and the Japanese imperial garden suite, ""Alone in Kyoto"", reconstitute Brian Wilson's surfing symphonies through Bowie and Eno's Berlin flipsides. Nigel Godrich, rather than supplying his default clean, shimmering production that can homogenize artists such as Beck, Travis, and The Divine Comedy, betters some of his Radiohead A-game here. The album's chilling resonance is due in part to Godrich's anagogical recording of minimal instrumentation and digitally etiolated detail. Being the good Parisians of Waugh's estimation, Air load Talkie Walkie with images of moonbase love and alien encounters that neither mocks the comically misjudged visions of yellowed science fiction, nor longs for some utopian future. Air creates the alternate now, an environment that begs escapism without denying humanity. Talkie Walkie may mollify Air's overt Frenchness, but should in no way be deemed a sudden opening of the soul. In their insular way, Air have always been soul. They've simply grown more cosmopolitan, and not just in their solubility with vodka, Cointreau and cranberry.","When attempting to encapsulate the essence of Paris in a word, Evelyn Waugh endearingly deemed the city ""bogus.""

Hope You Fail Better,June Panic,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb4e5e6ef95969322ba4/1:1/w_160/5ab08fc6.jpg,2004-01-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6144-hope-you-fail-better/,Secretly Canadian,"As North Dakota's most prolific son has faithfully exhibited for over a decade, with a near Hollywood-scripted fearlessness: A man alone can charter a dangerous commodity. Adulteration is always a concern for a talent whose work is crosshatched with such distinctly rendered spiritual and philosophical allegiances, but when he drew up plans for Hope You Fail Better-- an album that would further explore the same intimate themes of frustrated devotion and mortality that haunted 2002's dauntless Baby's Breadth-- he chose, for the first time, to enlist a steady cast of players to tour and record the album. Thankfully, this decision hasn't diluted the unsettling potency of his vision, which unfolds as feverishly as ever; rather, it breathes new life into his usual message. Crafting a lonely funereal strain for the opening stanza of Edna St. Vincent Millay's ""Dirge Without Music"", Panic's opener instantly digs into his earthworn philosophy. Millay, typically known for her precocious sexuality and malcontent's bohemian sensibilities, here offers no resignation to death's inevitable calling, and Panic delivers her words acutely and mournfully. His conversional bent sobers the text's underlining message, and plays excellently as an introduction to Panic's dusty temperance. The brisk fever of ""Let My Lungs Coin Words"" is the first indication that his decision to expand was not ill-forged. Panic sounds renewed and even transcendent as, with the help of producer Daniel Smith of The Danielson Famile, Panic's elfin, Dylanesque warble rises just enough above the jangling sway to project itself fitfully. ""Breach Birth Control"", ""The World Is Not a Place"", and ""Paint Legs on the Snake"" rollick, too, while Panic even utilizes handclaps, though the mood never truly lightens. Fettered both by fears of dying and of not truly living, Panic teetertotter's his way through the recording. The album's true voice might be heard through ""Both Sides of the Paper"" and ""On 'H's' They"", where you can hear gusts of wind pass portentously through weathered windvanes as Panic reports, with Jason Molina-esque conviction, ""Every new day is further from where you can go to be with those that died."" He sweeps death under the rug with the closing four tracks, the strongest batch on the album. Each hems in a line Panic has sewn into his intensely personal brand of distorted alt-country for all of Hope: ""Getting Over Joy""'s slick slide guitar line, the inflated grandeur of ""Expensive Attic"", and the ponderous call to death of ""Leaving Me My Eyes"" all anchor the mood that almost ballooned away in the middle of the album-- though in no way due to any relenting philosophical exploration. He simply sounds more alive than ever. The gentle, clean swabs of acoustic guitar and saloon-slapped piano on ""That's the Moon, Son"" end the album with his most traditional structure and message. It feels like an answer, or at least a call to a drifter's end, a solidification of thought. You may not be swaying like paper in the winds of change, or ruminating daily on the distance you've marked for death, but for the duration of Hope You Fail Better, you'll swear you are.","As North Dakota's most prolific son has faithfully exhibited for over a decade, with a near Hollywood-scripted fearlessness: A ...

Leave Your Name,Statistics,by: Alan Smithee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64fb1335d7bf1698dce/1:1/w_160/99a76125.jpg,2004-01-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7730-leave-your-name/,Jade Tree,"Why splinter groups from splinter-groups? Why spin off spin-offs? Why make a spectacle of yourself? Why, indeed, Statistics? Desaparecidos co-songwriter Denver Dalley now finds himself at the reins of this solo project, just another in a long, unending line of hopeless supporting acts led by a sideman from a semi-popular indie band. These projects sometimes reap fantastic results, but judging from this debut outing, Dalley's future could hardly be bleaker. To begin, Dalley possesses neither heart nor soul as a lead vocalist, and his milk-warm emotional outpouring of tiresome, overwrought subject matter could get lost in a crowd of two. That these are the best assets of Statistics is a sad fact, but that he spends half this album relying instead on flak-shot instrumentals is simply fatal. Of Leave Your Name's eleven songs, five are nebulous, inscrutable ""experiments in sound,"" including the near five-minute closer ""Circular Memories"". In a way, this could be seen as a positive trait, but the lack of sentiment in these ambling post-rock passages, which all boil over with bombastic riffage and gratuitous drum rolls, is every bit as insipid as Dalley's plaintive, weeping vocal outbursts. Perfunctory mood-setting stabs like ""Chairman of the Bored"" (nice one!) and ""Accomplishment"" at least confine themselves to runtimes of less than three minutes, but nonetheless taxi along on piano or acoustic meandering above linear backdrops of half-baked ambience. ""Sing a Song"" opens with unsettling Oakenfold-bred resonance giving way to Jealous Sound jangle-pop-by-numbers, replete with predictable shifts in dynamics and antiseptic crescendos. Same goes for ""Hours Seemed Like Days"", which boasts the record's most obnoxious lyrics, opining how ""claymation is gone and now it's all become CG"" in an embarrassing tone of false nostalgia. Lamentably, +/- has already run the numbers on this hybridization of purebred-rock-to-shakedown-ambience, only with a touch of innovation-- and on a track like, ""A Number, Not a Name"", Dalley proves he's a far cry from Tamborello as well. Pigeonholing this record into a simple genre like ""emo"" or ""post-rock"" or ""sadcore"" is impossible, as its focus is far too splintered to qualify for any one in particular. I can, however, tell you what it's not: a record you haven't heard before.","Why splinter groups from splinter-groups? Why spin off spin-offs? Why make a spectacle of yourself?

Refractured,Joy Division,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3c5e6ef95969322b7b/1:1/w_160/6e218c24.gif,2004-01-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4342-refractured/,Alchemy,"This introduction is as inevitable as its subject: Ian Curtis took his own life. Unable to reconcile the strains of Joy Division's growing fame and impending tour of America with the stringent, idealistic demands of his own artistry, faced with a lifetime at the mercy of his worsening epilepsy, and dealing with a divorce from his wife less than a month earlier, on the morning of Sunday, May 18th, 1980, Curtis chased a viewing of Herzog's tragic Stroszek with liquor, pills, and finally hanged himself. Many artists have suffered untimely deaths, but few have been so broadly perceived as having their greatest achievements yet to come, as Curtis was. That his plight was in some ways so apparently easy to relate to-- finding the dreams of fame he harbored as a working-class youth in Macclesfield tarnished as he came closer and closer to the reality of stardom-- makes it nearly impossible to separate his brief life from his work; that his plight was simultaneously so alien-- few people can understand the pain of contending with such a permanent, crippling disease-- makes it harder still. That is how the story of Joy Division ends, and nothing that they have ever produced has been, or will ever be, viewed outside that context since his passing, nor should it; Curtis killed himself, in part, for his music. With the release of Refractured, presumably the ultimate live document, such considerations are even more important; his death also ensured that few of Joy Division's fans would be able to experience the band apart from their modest studio output. Live, they played barely a hundred shows, only a dozen off England's shores, fewer of which were well recorded enough to endure-- and thanks to the outstanding, groundbreaking production of Martin Hannett, Joy Division's studio output is leagues removed from their monumental live presence. Hannett applied exceedingly modern (for the time) digital filters to their mixes, fueling the sense of alienation inherent in Curtis' bracing, anxious lyrics with even more distance. His pioneering use of delay made Joy Division's barbed, jarring threats seem impossibly remote, like atrocities viewed through the lens of a camera. Seen in the morning paper, the awful scenes captured in photos may resonate emotionally, but never nearer than arm's length. That illusion of removal is a potent counterpoint to the emotional turmoil of Unknown Pleasures, and even moreso on Closer's grim march, where it becomes a necessity; as mercurial and aloof as Curtis often was, even at a distance, Joy Division's brutally confessional nature is almost overwhelming. Nevertheless, Hannett's production techniques practically made him a fifth member, to the point that Unknown Pleasures was all but disowned by the band in spite of his interference. The raw urgency of their live performance had been replaced by a bitter, reigned-in tension, equally gripping, but not what they set out to record; not until 1999 was an attempt made to properly master and document a live performance and finally balance their album presence with the unfettered immediacy of the stage. Factory's choice, however, was the bafflingly low-quality Preston Warehouse 28 February 1980; although it showcases Joy Division near the peak (and, sadly, the end) of their career, it has been described by band members as ""the worst fucking show we ever did,"" due to numerous technical mishaps. A far superior performance at Les Bains Douche in 1979 soon followed (along with some material from the January 1980 performance in Amsterdam's Paradiso), though, and comes very close to suggesting the real power the band commanded onstage. The concerts are uniformly excellent, regardless of wildly fluctuating sound quality between discs and some redundancy among the sets; all recordings are also readily available elsewhere-- the original Fractured box, released in 2001, already compiles Les Bains (with the extras from Amsterdam, already a bootleg old enough to have crossed the Atlantic on the Mayflower) and Preston. The originals were just barely a step removed from posthumous cash-ins but served a need. However, to box up widely available material for more money, as Refractured has done, with the pointless inclusion of a t-shirt (an awful iron-on of the Refractured logo) and a small, reprinted concert flier circumnavigates greed and sets sail straight for stupidity. As a final incentive, the box also comes with a hand-signed and numbered note from whoever runs Alchemy calling you a sucker. That said, the recordings themselves are remarkable portraits of what an entirely different creature Joy Division became onstage, and for anyone who isn't intimately familiar with them beyond Closer, or Substance, or even the limp, isolated live inclusions on Still, this collection is simply incredible. Fundamentally, Joy Division's inspiration was drawn from the aggressive spirit of punk-- a fact made stunningly evident in their live recordings as they relentlessly tear through sets. Their oppressive testaments to loss, reflection and regret are left at the studio; live, Joy Division embodied fiery condemnation, Curtis' every scream daring the audience to try and share his burden, laughing as they (of course) flinch at the prospect. His on-album brooding becomes pure catharsis when given an audience upon which to inflict it; Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook's measured interplay becomes a deafening, numbing thrash, and Stephen Morris' drumming, in particular, is absolutely unstoppable. Without exception, every minute of every song presented here is performed with passion and energy, and much of that starts with Morris; even the more resigned tracks are made ominously transient from his intensity, and the aggressive numbers become truly suffocating. ""Love Will Tear Us Apart""'s breathless fatalism is so much more tenuous, sped up dramatically and embellished with a desperate crescendo at Les Bains, highlighting some of Morris' most impressively, and frantically, improvised fills. His skittering hi-hat sets a blistering pace for ""Transmission"" in Amsterdam as Sumner's slashing guitar cuts in and out; at Preston, he drives ""Interzone"" at an unthinkable pace, nearly drowning out Curtis due to poor recording issues, but making his few screams to the surface even more incredible. Morris sets the tone throughout, and Curtis, Sumner and Hook unfailingly, unflinchingly rise to meet him, giving themselves over to the audience in some of the most wracking performances ever likely to be captured to tape. Only the majesty of ""Atmosphere"" slows the proceedings; as the final number at Les Bains, it is the great winding down of the universe-- no other song carries such a beautiful sense of finality. Admittedly, live recording techniques of the time create a distance all their own in the recordings-- the quality of the Preston recording is particularly terrible, often muddying Curtis' performance to the point of incomprehensibility (when it isn't totally inaudible)-- a unique natural alternative to Hannett's studio-processed subdual of Joy Division's ominous presence, but a minor shame nonetheless. Originally, these recordings overcome the obstacle through sheer strength of the band's will to be heard. Les Bains Douches, by itself, is flawless; of the available recordings there are none better. Amsterdam features a brilliant set with a few gaffes and an even-keeled performance that might be the least energetic but is still unquestionably great. Even Preston is impressive; if anything, the faulty mixing and an ""off"" performance humanizes them, makes them seem uncomfortably imperfect in direct contrast to their sterling critical image. And that's finally the killer; Refractured presents these recordings with an unbelievably amateurish two-second gap between tracks, shattering the whole intent of the live recordings in the first place. These recordings are a marvel no matter what, but to fail to capture the essence of a live show so spectacularly is a crime. In the end, that's the point: This box tries to bring Joy Division out from behind the studio glass and present them, and mainly Curtis, in all the awesome, terrifying conflict that he channeled through his voice and his music, the conflict that eventually led to him taking his life; to simply present them in the most honest, impassioned way possible. The individual recordings, and even the original Fractured box, succeed flawlessly; all Refractured succeeds at is inflicting an injustice on otherwise classic performances.","This introduction is as inevitable as its subject: Ian Curtis took his own life.

Sound Murderer,Remarc,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f3c0084474cd0c0172/1:1/w_160/b7c612bf.jpg,2004-01-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6905-sound-murderer/,Planet µ,"Looking back on 2003, among the sounds that Pitchfork may have undervalued are crunk and the ragga-jungle revival. Granted, they weren't ignored-- each of them scored a few reviews and a handful of well-deserved praise. But by the time David Banner got screwed and chopped, the ""Meringue Remix"" of ""Get Low"" slipped onto the radio, the Soundmurderer + SK1 12-inches received proper release, and Tigerbeat6 released a handful of records that didn't treat jungle and drill sounds like aural raspberries, it became more clear that these were a couple of the most under-told stories of 2K3. When it comes to the ragga-jungle revival, the place to start is still where the present meets the past: Soundmurderer's Wired for Sound features a trio of breakneck mixes of some of most ruff, masculine and steely-eyed moments in first-wave ragga-jungle. A tall tale of ragga-jungle's history, Wired for Sound re-cast its rhythmic innovation as all peaks and no valleys, a frenetic series of whipsmart neck-snapping drumbeats which, in the right hands, isn't actually that much of a fib. Fittingly, one of the producers who most heavily features on Wired for Sound is Remarc, who in 1995-97 released ten singles of uncanny power and elasticity on labels such as the legendary Suburban Base, Dollar, Kemet, Labello, and White House. Sound Murderer collects most of those tracks-- many of them on CD for the first time-- on a well-deserved Remarc full-length. (A second compilation of Remarc's work, Unreleased Dubs 94-96, will be released on Planet Mu on CD and 4xLP in late spring.) Despite the variety and a near-chaotic intensity of Remarc's re-wiring of the empty promise of rave to the sinisterism and dread of darkcore, the origin of each of these tracks lies on the flipside to the Winstons' 1969 top 10 soul hit ""Color Him Father"". Like many junglists, Remarc built his tracks over the ""Amen"" break, which is derived from ""Amen Brother"", a break that is sort of to jungle what ""Apache"" is to hip-hop: perhaps the integral strand in each sound's genetic code. Far from the IDM-leaning of jungle's over-ground, more white-washed head music, these are tracks of urgency and dread that appealed to/soothed the paranoia of too many years of drug use as much as it did to embody the thrill of communicative dance music. And yet, it's more sonically stuffed and sophisticated than both its spliff-cloud brethren and the drill-n-bass snobs who later delighted in rubbing sludge over melody rather than marrying them to any great effect. Among the few Remarc classics missing from this comp is perhaps the most extreme, the cold sweat of ""Ricky"", a track so overcome by drug-induced paranoia that it sounds like an anxiety attack on acetate. What is here includes some of the most deft manipulations of rhythm of the jungle era, from the drums, sub-bass and congas in your face of ""Unity"" to the self-explanatory yet still funky title track to already exalted classics such as ""R.I.P."" and ""Thunderclap"". The snaps and skitters of Remarc's robust breaks color his tracks without pulverizing them, whether laid alongside the bravado of Jamaican patois or gunshots or more unexpected and docile treats such as or Spaghetti Western whistling or delicate string lines. After years of jungle being associated with too much of the latter and not enough of the former, this is a welcome resurrection.","Looking back on 2003, among the sounds that Pitchfork may have undervalued are crunk and the ragga-jungle revival.

Wow! / The Magick Fire Music,Jackie-O Motherfucker,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9baea9e61561daa7059/1:1/w_160/85f2c227.gif,2004-01-22 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11763-wow-the-magick-fire-music/,ATP,"I'm gonna let all you indie kids in on a secret: There are at least three writers on the current Pitchfork roster that-- oh my god-- enjoy the music of the Grateful Dead. Personally, I go for Anthem of the Sun, while Rob Mitchum's favorite era is '77-'78, featuring the Godcheauxs. Heck, the Richardson household even owns that atrocious disco album the Dead made. So we love us some freedom rock, man! While we can't quite get with either Rat Dog or The Dead (and only Mitchum would be so depraved as to trade Phish concerts), we've had to look for our vital instrumental noodling outlets elsewhere. Following a two-disc set recorded in Europe (ker-splat! goes the ice cream cone in your rainbow afro) none could be finer and weirder than the loose and sprawling collective of Oregon, New York, and DC weirdoes that by the nom de plume of Jackie-O Motherfucker. They've been jamming cross-country and swapping tapes of live shows through their U-Sound Archive for a few years now, and news of this two-disc reissue of vinyl-only releases from the turn of the twenty-first century had us filling balloons with hippie crack and suede-brushing Birks in anticipation. Originally shoveled into duct-taped sleeves from the compounds of Thurston Moore and Byron Coley's esoteric Ecstatic Peace! label back in 1999, The Magick Fire Music coasts out on the slow, simmering waves of a Zildjian Cymbal Ocean, drifting for 15 minutes of bliss and never-ending nerve-melt on the opening ""Extension"". Ten players rotate in and out of the mix, the group mind honed in on the disengaged mantra-riff and a slow expansion out on the rolling toms. The piece evolves like some great barrier reef, beyond the usual group sounds that get clumped with Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Yet they don't really scrabble about like the shadowy black ids of New York's No-Neck Blues Band, either (who they always get lumped with, for being American and weird), instead moving as one before dying with the utmost group-grace. ""The Cage"" and ""Second Ave. 2AM"" pluck a half-parched guitar twang from the desert dust of Ennio Morricone and utilize them to very different effect. The former stays with the dried hide of the riff, chewing at it and finally reaching a tremolo-ing state with scratched record gasps (or are they barks?) by the eleven-minute mark. The latter piece proceeds to beat the western guitar lick like a dead horse, driving it into the ground with free horn skronks that make lips crack. Underneath the lurching gait of a wandering horse clomps a trip-hop anomaly that lopes against the clattering battery of drummer Jessie Carrot. As the double LP plays out, a comfortable pattern gets set. Simple textures, either from reverberating guitars or primitive electronics set the mood, and the remainder of the band buoys it as best they can, more content to keep the moment aloft than to necessarily move things forward. There's no need to go somewhere necessarily, so why not just enjoy the moment? For ""Jugband 2000"", an awkward drum-machine and disquieting reverb magnetizes the digital detritus of snipped voices and CPU bloops. Two minutes in, a swell of guitar and cloudy Gamelan clangs provide lift, but the background ranting remains, neither enunciated nor erased, and it keeps the piece from either enjoying sweet drift or making a concrete statement. ""Quaker"" similarly meanders like blown cone smoke in a dorm drum circle, the textures of thumb piano, jaw harp, toms, a gurgling rice-pot, and surf guitar froth slowly mingling with some spacy FX for a prolonged (albeit mild) buzz. While plenty of other JOMF jams take anywhere from five-to-eight minutes to start cranking, Wow! (originally a UK release from 2000) starts off keyed-up. ""Black Squirrels"" gets built with pecan clacks and nutty vinyl scratching, promptly riding a nicked Appalachian lick up Himalayan heights. As opposed to waiting eight-to-ten minutes for peaks and plateaus, it gels better than horse hooves into a jubilant jamboree between the Owsley acid-spritzing guitars of Tom Greenwood and Jef Brown. Billy Crowley even frisbees brief thumps of a house record into the percussion dogpile for Bacchanalian good measure. The reduced group (for the most part a septet) whirls in glee, spinning a good nine minutes before plunking down into the kalimba-like opening of ""Wow"", which pokes percussion about into other folk forms. It never literally lives up to its name or the dizzying heights of its predecessor. Instead, it shivers and wheezes, two Dirty Threes taking a pack-a-day breather. Their shared vision gets beat-ific three-quarters in, though, gleaning light lavenders glimpsed at dusk before Sonic Youth's Bad Moon rises. Closer ""Love Horn"" indulges a bit too much in their love of newbie free jazz, the horns squawking out some sympathetic textures that verge on noxious. For over two hours, though, they bring the jams, and this reissued set will make any head most grateful.","I'm gonna let all you indie kids in on a secret: There are at least three writers on the ...

Degenerate Introduction,Dub Narcotic,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2c9d034d5c69bf53d3/1:1/w_160/33696377.jpg,2004-01-21 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2470-degenerate-introduction/,K,"Like The Exploding Hearts or Metallica before them, Dub Narcotic Sound System had a pretty bad van accident last year, swerving to avoid hitting a deer. Luckily, nobody died, though it was severe enough that Calvin Johnson and bassist Chris Sutton were hospitalized. Benefits were held, and before too long, the band was rested and healed. In that context, you could view Degenerate Introduction, the band's sixth full-length (and first in five years) as a comeback celebration of punk-rock resiliency. (Get up! Ride that funky horse again! Show some resolve!) As they've been doing since 1993, Dub Narcotic concoct a mix of reggae, dub, hip-hop beats, sludgy garage, and Calvin's party-boy monotone in search of nothing more than a packed dance floor. (And it's a good thing they just wanna dance, because when CJ gets political on ""Blood Flow"", the sophomoric name-calling doesn't move beyond ""Ashcroft is an ass,"" ""Colin Powell is a corporate marionette wet dream,"" and ""Cheney is a heartless corpse."" Agreed, man, agreed, but c'mon, Belafonte, where do we go from there?) You hate to kick someone in the shin when they're already nursing wounds-- especially when those cuts and bruises occurred in the course of saving Bambie-- but damnit if Degenerate Introduction doesn't make any sort of kindness incredibly impossible. I've always been a Calvin apologist and was a huge Beat Happening fan, so when I say that the majority of these nine tracks are emphatically embarrassing, please know that I'm also blushing myself. While I don't think a dud like this diminishes Johnson's past musical work, how many of these misfires can a person take before they turn their attention elsewhere? In Dub Narcotic, there's an overwhelming sense that Calvin's lost touch with his strengths. Or maybe this project doesn't suit his better qualities? I know the guy has it in him; he formed Dub Narcotic just a year after Beat Happening went out with the triumphant swan song You Turn Me On. Occasionally, there've been a few flashes of guest-spot enjoyment: ""C Is the Heavenly Option"", Johnson's stumbling collaboration with Heavenly, made for a nice mixtape gag in the early 90s; he keyed-in adequately hushed background vocals for Modest Mouse's ""Head South"". Bar none, the most successful sustained post-Beat Happening project, The Halo Benders, works largely because of the pleasing juxtaposition of Johnson's guttural frog voice against Doug Marsch's high-end howl. (Plus they've covered the Smiths and basically sound like Built to Spill with Calvin on the guest mic.) Here, though, Calvin's only vocal foil is Liardbird's Heather Dunn, who seems to be trying as hard as she can to sing horrifically off-key on the endlessly bad ""Fuck Me Up"". (Bring back Lois! Bring back Miranda July!) As proven on past Dub Narcotic efforts, Calvin himself is no Tikiman, King Tubby or Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, so his cravings for ""old-school grooves and rare hip-hop beats"" are embarrassing, especially when laid down over an awkward human beatbox and a drum that comes in a fraction of second too late. The self-referential ""Dub Narcotic Groove"" proves that perhaps Johnson really is the indie rock Paul Schaffer: His shoutouts to Olympia and funtime sloganeering (""The dance floor is your friend!"", ""No room for squares out on the dance floor!"") are ingredients for an awkward jam at the 12th Annual K Records Retirees Fundraiser at the Punk 'n' Twee Hall of Fame. In this broke-ass, no-voice context, the best tracks are the instrumentals. The relaxed, pleasing ""Code of the West"" is performed with Melodica, a la Augustus Pablo, and ""Mate's Revenge"" is eight minutes of noisy, convincing dub-psych, rife with guitar manipulations, handclaps, sax screech, pitch shifts, super wah, fluctuating drums, intergalactic soloing, and flippant instrumental turns that equally recall Temple of Bon Matin and Cul De Sac's ecstatic mid-90s jackpot, I Don't Want to Go to Bed. These two tracks alone save Degenerate Introduction from complete dissolution. Still, Dub Narcotic's aim has always been to bring people to their feet, and that they find the most success with the least dance-inflected tracks should serve as a wake-up call: DJs who clear the floor don't get invited back.","Like The Exploding Hearts or Metallica before them, Dub Narcotic Sound System had a pretty bad van accident last year ...

Ringodom or Proctor,Head of Femur,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c14eabf31b7dc71565d3/1:1/w_160/eb74c175.jpg,2004-01-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3972-ringodom-or-proctor/,Greyday,"Somewhere in my small but wildly varied assortment of LPs, I have this album by English-by-way-of-Germany prog-rockers Nektar called A Tab in the Ocean, which has some seriously ugly cover art (a green decaying man-woman taking hits from a celestial bong on a, well... I suppose it's a tab in the ocean) and contains songs that, for all their effort to sound otherwise, can't help being pop, even when they're drawn out to fill the whole side of a record and smothered with obtuse, fantastical lyrics and tiresome organ recitals. I'm reminded of this record, of course, by Ringodom or Proctor, the ambitiously weird, but still gloriously accessible debut from Head of Femur, a Chicago-based band of Nebraska natives featuring Mike Elsener of Solar Wind, Ben Armstrong of Commander Venus, and Matt Focht of Bright Eyes. The trio and their vast cast of co-conspirators run The Beach Boys and Caravan through an Elephant Six meatgrinder and wind up with eleven oddball chamber-pop suites full of left turns, ambitious orchestration, and music box explosions of melody. Producer AJ Mogis (The Faint, Get Up Kids, Mayday) has his hands full throughout, balancing top-heavy verses containing multiple vocal tracks and a motley assortment of violins, French horns, flutes and keyboards with minimal interludes of creaking harmonies and repetitive percussion or accordion patterns. In terms of scope, it resembles Ween's The Mollusk without all the bathroom humor; it even bursts into the occasional sea shanty. Opener ""January on Strike"" swerves from an almost industrial rhythmic assault into a slow, majestic passage that drifts into a buildup that finally deposits you in the propulsive opening verse of ""Curve That Byrd"". The loopy bassline and big three-part harmonies make for a colossal hook, and the song returns to this structure after several detours, including an anthemic guitar passage backed by marimba, and a huge violin-drenched chorus that features four interlocking vocal parts. That's a ton of stuff to absorb in the space of about six minutes, which is apparently just the way the band likes it-- every one of their songs includes at least three distinct sections and usually a couple of tempo changes. ""Yeoman or Tinker"" runs through strange sections that sound like a room full of clocks, buckles under the weight of massive horn and string bombast, and cools off with harmonies and piano, while ""Acme: The Summit of a Mountain"" is a boisterous anthem for kids who feel pressured into attending institutions in which they have no interest, like summer camp and tech school. It's probably the most straightforward rock song here, though it's got nothing on the sunshiny dancepop of ""Science Needed a Medical Man"", a bell-and-horn-dappled blast of melody about the return of the first man to travel at the speed of light to Earth, and his subsequent death from the strain. Where Head of Femur finally differ the most from an old band like Nektar is the fact that they embrace their pop core, no matter how much prog apple they pile on around it. Ringodom or Proctor certainly has its flaws-- plenty of lyrics that sound too much like placeholders, and arrangements that sometimes get too opaque are the two most worthy of note-- but for a band just starting out, it's an impressive statement of purpose, and the tease of waiting to see if they can refine and sharpen this sound for a second go round is overwhelming. Head of Femur definitely bear watching in the future.","Somewhere in my small but wildly varied assortment of LPs, I have this album by English-by-way-of-Germany prog-rockers Nektar called A ...

The Homeland,Bobby ConnThe Glass Gypsies,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a646c0084474cd0c0912/1:1/w_160/14c284fa.jpg,2004-01-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1580-the-homeland/,Thrill Jockey,"A quick glance at the artwork accompanying Bobby Conn and the Glass Gypsies' latest release reveals the defining principle of Conn's work: unapologetic excess. Even if you ignore the image gracing the cover-- an enormous Masonic pyramid alluding to the United States' Great Seal-- the interior notes still feature a painting of a magenta helicopter landing on a golf course, with Conn and his Gypsies proudly vamping around a hole, chests revealed, heels high. As usual, Bobby Conn's outfits are as glitter-perfect as his sound, but on The Homeland, Conn's bombastic, prog-funk diddling (firmly rooted in Parliament, Bowie, and yes, Styx) gets mixed up in his equally flashy protest-ready agenda, thus making The Homeland a ridiculous mix of 70s glam and suit-and-tie politics. The best way to describe The Homeland is as a self-contained circus, but one without the burlesque growl that absurdist carnival-sloggers like Tom Waits or Firewater consistently peddle: nothing here is laced with subtlety. The sonic equivalent of hula-hooping ladies and dainty brother/sister high-wire acts (in matching sequined leotards!), The Homeland is sparkly and perpetually overstated, a clown car spilling over with big red noses and three-foot shoes, as studied as it is camp. Conn's pastel pleather suits are part-Prince, part-Ziggy Stardust, and just about the last thing you'd expect to see a protest singer sporting-- which is nicely subversive, since, as its grandiose title so boldly suggests, The Homeland is essentially a protest album, a caustic, quasi-righteous diatribe against America's current political regime. That Bobby Conn is the made-up messenger of this statement is both strange and gratifying: Conn is making broad political arguments against the American government (see nearly every track, especially ""We Come in Peace"", ""Relax"", and ""Home Sweet Home"", or ponder lyrics like, ""We are your friends/ We come in peace/ We brought our guns to set you free.../ Say goodbye to all your history/ Come and join our family""), but he's doing so while sporting high-heeled, lace-up boots (in bright New York Dolls white) and playing jam-lite boogie guitar. Conn's work has always been overtly political, but gone from The Homeland are the hedonistic, coked-up sex stories of Conn's past (who can forget the gums-only fellatio promise of 2001's ""Whore""?) replaced by not-so-secret conspiracy theories (""I didn't need to get elected/ When I was born selected"") and sweeping political laments. There are a handful of departures (""Bus No. 243"", about riding drunk around London Bus No. 243), but most of The Homeland is preoccupied with taking the same anti-Bush stance over and over again. Despite Conn's impossibly explicit agenda, fans will find still plenty of tights and riffage, sunglasses and swagger, drum machines and big, warbling vocals. And unlike the piles of self-proclaimed heirs currently mucking up the once-despised 70s guitar landscape, there's something persistently uncool about Bobby Conn-- and it's that kind of fuck-off, punk disobedience that makes him such a convincing portrait of pure, unfettered rock abandon. Anyone who's read a few chapters of The Dirt gets how wearing eyeliner can be a dangerous occupation, no matter how big your guitar amp is, and Conn's complete disregard for contemporary expectations (and hipsters relentlessly pushing irony) is delightfully unexpected, if ultimately underwhelming.",,5.8,
The Homosexuals' CD,The Homosexuals,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c150abf31b7dc71565da/1:1/w_160/ab59e7cc.jpg,2004-01-21 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3974-the-homosexuals-cd/,ReRReR,"Here today, gone tomorrow: Perusing Johan Kugelberg's list of 100 ""best"" DIY punk singles from the Ugly Things zine is a lesson in the fleeting bursts of creativity and desperation every collector of rare shit must wade through. I've never really been bitten by the collector bug personally, but have known enough people who have that it's become pretty easy for me to spot what they're looking for. Generally, bands that didn't last very long and put out records very few people heard (preferably self-pressed, and certainly vinyl- or cassette-only) find their way into collector hands almost as quickly as they disappeared. Sometimes, these folks uncover real hidden gems. For every few dozen of deservedly forgotten garage punk artistes, there's a band that could have been contenders in the world of the living had their luck been better. British trio The Homosexuals fit this bill, and I've a feeling that anyone into those hallowed days of apathy, art and the anti-social in the UK during the late 70s will be happy to know they existed. The Homosexuals were a strange prospect. Seemingly, their music should fit into a similar spot as that of angry young men like Wire and Magazine who carried their penchants for art-school angst in the midst of proto-thug posturing, like badges of authentic alienation. And of course, in many ways, these bands were alienated-- at least from what had been passing for British rock prior to 1976. However, L'Voag (aka Jim, Amos, and now, Xentos), Anton (aka George Harassment) and Bruno were also part of a different scene, where more ""progressive"" notions of artistic protest were at stake: This Heat, Family Fodder and Chris Cutler's bands Henry Cow and the Art Bears were some of the names going at it in these circles. So what and who were they? And where have they been for the last 25 years? The band actually formed in 1977, shortly after L'Voag noticed Bruno in protest at a National Front gathering/riot, while Anton answered an ad. After choosing a calculatedly provocative name, the three set about playing and recording a little on their own, and the following year, engineer Chris Gray (brother of producer Nigel Gray) brought them to Surrey Sound to record all of the music that ended up on the original Homosexuals' Record, and indeed, everything on this CD reissue. Their first release was the ""Hearts in Exile""/""Soft South Africans"" single, which was given extra collector life by its placement on Kugelberg's list (as was their seven-inch, ""You're Not Moving the Way You're Supposed To"", not contained on this album). The band released a couple of EPs from these sessions on Black Noise Records, as well as working on myriad solo projects before splitting in the early 80s. The Homosexuals' split was no mere parting of ways, but a complete severing of ties. Bruno actually gave the tapes that became The Homosexuals' Record (reportedly from a cassette dub of masters he'd destroyed) to Cutler's ReR in 1984 without consulting the rest of the band. Before anyone could do anything about it, the record had been released and already gone out of print. Just like that, you get a lurid backstory, a flash of music, and fuzzy details over who did what to whom. Result: punk legend and collector fantasy. Today, L'Voag is the most musically active, having most recently released music as Xentos with Die Computer Trip Die-- though as with all things Homosexuals, specific details on the musicians are sketchy. The music on The Homosexuals' CD is a sprawling bag of angular power-pop, quasi-dub, garage-punk and other stuff I'd liken to Faust or some such lunatic mob if I had to. In fact, I have a Homosexuals cover of Faust's ""It's a Rainy Day Sunshine Girl"" on CDR, which I still can't fit into this whole story. Suffice to say, were it not for the rudimentary production values, I'd say these guys would have given any of the big post-punk bands a run for their money in terms of both songwriting (the impact of these songs is almost impossible to deny) and sheer diversity. This reissue doesn't collect everything The Homosexuals did, but it does emphasize what a great, fun, strange band they were. ""Hearts in Exile"" is the perfect punk love song, with a slow-building intro of slashed guitar and L'Voag's cryptic description of ""bloodshot eyes/ Appetizing, isolation.../ The messages of radio,"" his voice coming and going and bathed in reverb; it's all very hard to pin down, as if the song might suddenly fade out into nothing at any moment. And then comes the hook, featuring a four-note, pleading guitar riff that conveys heartbreak masked by aggression perfectly. Even better is the punchy, ambitious ""Astral Glamour"" (also the name of a pending three-disc set planned by Chuck Warner's Hyped to Death label later this year), a shiny piece of power-pop that would sound as good coming from early XTC as it would have on The Who's Sell Out. Nonsensical lyrics (""Astral glamour semen in the region"") barely hide the infectious, incredibly concise strains. By all rights, this should have been a hit, as should either version of ""Soft South Africans"" contained here. Elsewhere, The Homosexuals ram out tunes with speed-of-light abandon. ""My Night Out"", ""Technique Street"", ""Vociferous Slam"" and ""A Million Keys"" all clock in at less than two minutes and are explosive bits of jagged post-punk along the lines of Gang of Four. However, L'Voag is a much more overtly passionate vocalist, going for broke on pretty much everything. He bleats lines like, ""Lovers licking labia seem satisfied, satisfied,"" as if shouting over a mad crowd of sweaty admirers and psychopaths. ""Divorce Proceedings from Reality"" and ""Neutron Lover"" proceed with similar zeal, but with the immediacy of great, sparkling pop. A far cry removed are tracks like ""All About Cheap"" (the DIY aesthetic defined) and ""Mecho Madness"", using the limited studio technology at their disposal to construct strange, damaged art pieces reminiscent of concurrent Pere Ubu. The worst part about a release like this is that if you want more, you're virtually out of luck. The remaining Homosexuals material is all from the same period (excepting an EP recorded after L'Voag left the band), but if you want to find out ""what happened next,"" you'll have to search the various long-gone solo projects including Amos & Sara, George Harassment, Sara Goes Pop, and Nancy Sesay & The Melodaires. Warner's set should take care of some of that, but there are still holes in their official discography. However, now that there's a legit (and presumably well-distributed) CD issue of The Homosexuals' music, I bet their legacy gets a boost. The music speaks volumes for itself.","Here today, gone tomorrow: Perusing Johan Kugelberg's list of 100 ""best"" DIY punk singles from the Ugly Things zine ...

The Real New Fall L.P. (Formerly 'Country on the Click'),The Fall,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3c5e6ef95969323000/1:1/w_160/0c80ccb9.gif,2004-01-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2975-the-real-new-fall-lp-formerly-country-on-the-click/,Action,"There's a 1987 interview with The Fall where everyone's favorite repellently preening pest and poet Mark E. Smith is asked to give his Ins and Outs. (A small sample: Ins - Ultra-flash black people, Asian pop groups, and James Cain; Outs - Scotch pop groups featuring pseudo-intellectuals, the Iraq war, and Eddie Murphy.) When read again 16 years later, the underlying moral is this: Mark E. Smith was always right, and always will be. His image is right. His politics are right. His precipitously craggy face is right. More fundamentally, his rampageous, begrudgingly musical wreckage is right. Lord knows his indignant, dragooning rigmarole is about as necessary to rock 'n' roll as Elvis and felonies. Sure, he's released enough mediocre-to-awful albums to sustain entire countries, but one gets the curious sense that at some point in the future (say 20 years), it'll turn out that Smith was right yet again, and we just weren't clever enough to acknowledge it. This is probably a bit of a quandary for Smith. Oh, of course writhing masses of pinheads and blockheads still tirelessly berate The Fall (often with good reason), but, for the last decade, even the insults are now termed in the same way you insult Dylan or Leonard Cohen. Much to the chagrin of everyone involved, Smith has become the primordial prophet. He has nowhere left to go, nothing left to see. The faithful may still cling to decayed compilations in certain Yahoo! chatrooms, but there's nary a shred of anticipation to be found. More bad news: The Real New Fall LP is as valuable an album as anything The Fall ever released in the 1990s, and Smith's vocals and lyrics have been reinvigorated since his work with the listless line-up on Are You Are Missing Winner. To get our parameters set, there are hardly any rockabilly brambles, trivial dub jumbles, or any other excursions into the myriad genres The Fall helped cultivate. But then, if you listen to The Fall for diversity, you're missing the point. Like always, enjoyment of The Fall is directly proportional to one's tolerance of whatever sludge, flare-up or balderdash is repeated ad nauseum for a song's entirety. A reviewer's Aristotelian notions of what constitutes aesthetic truth are emptied in a blink of one of the yawping brutalities on this album. On ""Theme from Sparta F.C."", Smith may shout, ""I don't have a jack knife,"" but clearly no one told the guitars. Elsewhere, ""Contraflow"" slides shackled, trodden quagmires between verses. The riffs are barbed and boiled, flaunting menace, flouting melody, and about to topple off of Smith's face. Towards the end of ""Last Commands of Xyralothep via M.E.S."", the guitars are at such an unbearable pitch that the production sounds like literally rocking the needle off its groove. Any subtle departures from the typical Fall sound are on the hushed folk-rock on ""Janet, Johnny + James"" or the deceased, out-of-key back-up vocals on ""Mike's Love Xexagon"". Smith's lyrics are at a near career-best of insolence and nonsense. They're brilliant if you wrangle an understanding, and even more so if you can't. By the second song, he's already gone fishing, fled a pet cemetery, and successfully shoved anarchy onto the desk of a jingoistic Dolly Parton-Lord Byron alliance. On ""The Past #2"", he finally liquidates the concepts of time and truth themselves. There's an entire song committed to portraying Brian Wilson as a furtive despot and Mike Love as Christ, and on the Lee Hazlewood-written ""Loop41 'Houston"", he keeps inadvertently slurring ""Houston"" into ""sedition."" It's their best album since 1996's Light User Syndrome, which may seem like faint praise until we recall that The Fall have released enough records to bankrupt entire record store chains. (It's also notable because 2000's The Unutterable was perilously close to greatness as well.) The Fall have been defrosted yet again, and there should be rejoicing in the streets. They're as brittle, volatile and consistently riveting as any band out there, and even though no one could possibly take Smith seriously anymore, it insinuates that there's still enough justification here to warrant following The Fall's devious discography into one more decade.","There's a 1987 interview with The Fall where everyone's favorite repellently preening pest and poet Mark E.

A Heart & Two Stars,Music A.M.,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44aeb335119a49ed8f8/1:1/w_160/cb4084fe.gif,2004-01-20 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5566-a-heart-two-stars/,Quartermass,"The cross-pollination between indie pop and laptop IDM continues. It was an inevitable junction, really, as the aesthetic values and fanbases of these worlds have so much overlap. But it's everywhere now. The abstract laptoppers are incorporating vocals and remixing pop artists; the indie rockers have IDM side projects. On its first album, Music A.M. is finds itself in the midst of this fertile ground. The band is new but the players have been around. Luke Sutherland, who used to front the Too Pure bands Long Fin Killie and Bows (and now plays violin for Mogwai), sings and plays guitar. Volker Bertelmann is on keyboards and computers, and Stefan Schneider, the driving force behind To Rococo Rot, contributes bass and synth. They're an exceptionally quiet and cozy ensemble that fuses post-rock instrumental interplay and glitchy, spare electronics into well-crafted songs. They're also one of those perfectly named bands. On a rainy Sunday with a thick New York Times to get through, all I need is a pot of black coffee and music that sounds like A Heart & Two Stars. Sam Prekop's solo album is an acoustic record for this mood, but Music A.M. comes from gurgly circuitry. It reminds me a bit of Tortoise's TNT, with a side of pop structure and minus the jazzy runs. Sutherland's guitar is plucked as his lines wind around the melody, Bertelmann trades out percussion for rustles, clicks and pops, and Schneider is instantly indefinable as he smothers it all in an electric blanket of bass and synth chords. There's a ton of space and the instruments continually reference the tune at hand in some way. And the vocals, despite being quietly half-sung by Sutherland, are surprisingly melodic. Of course, post-rock bands have been whispering their way through the occasional song since the early 90s, and so often it seemed a cop-out, the only signal a tone-deaf vocalist could broadcast. But Music A.M. get the technique right. The quality of Sutherland's lyrics helps immensely, requiring more attention than one usually grants music this soft. His lyrical skill shouldn't come as a surprise since he's taken time off music to publish one well-received novel (1998's Jelly Roll) and has written another, but it's unusual to hear words so clear and evocative in this setting. Rather than hiding behind opacity or Grubbsian wordplay, Sutherland's words are direct. He can be a storyteller in the Aidan Moffat mode as easily as he delivers absurd haiku. ""Black Flash"" is like a grainy dream as it tells the story of a downtrodden professional wrestler who, while pinned to the canvas, catches a glimpse of his brutal long-lost father in the audience. ""Bit Wheel"" compresses its narrative into a series of three-word lines that start as banal as possible (""boy meets girl"") and end fantastical, as estranged lovers roll through town suspended atop a runaway Ferris wheel. About half the tracks on A Heart & Two Stars are instrumental, and I heard and enjoyed the record a dozen times before the words registered at all. It's fresh and balanced and easy to like right away. But it's also rabbit hole of a record, inviting you to inch a little closer until you find yourself enveloped in a strange and exciting world. Those kinds of records tend to have staying power.","The cross-pollination between indie pop and laptop IDM continues. It was an inevitable junction, really, as the aesthetic values and ...

Before & After,Wannadies,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa8ab1335d7bf16996a8/1:1/w_160/c09ee10d.jpg,2004-01-20 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8765-before-after/,Hidden Agenda,"You know, if a band's first language isn't English, I don't think it's unreasonable to give them the benefit of the doubt when a mangled phrase slips out, or when the sentiment is about a million years out of date in our own slang (see: The Notwist's ""One with the Freaks""), but sometimes you just have to draw a line. Plainly, Sweden's The Wannadies have a high degree of fluency with English. They've been the country's premier Britpop export (aside from maybe Kent) for a full decade now, belting out the hits in a foreign tongue like it was no big thing. But, god, the chorus to this album's second single, ""Piss on You"", is a fucking atrocity. To wit: ""So I piss on you/ Piss on you/ I piss on you/ Oh yes, it's true/ I piss on you/ I know I do/ Piss on you."" These words, delivered in sing-songy, sincere male/female harmony, were so confounding to me upon first listen that I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. On top of that, the song's opening line goes, ""I like rock, but you give me the blues,"" which opens a whole socio-musicological can of worms. You see, the idea is that she gives him something he doesn't want, but rock is based on blues to begin with, so it isn't really that far off, and certainly it's no grounds for being pissed on. At any rate, it's one of the worst singles I've heard yet in this nascent century of ours. Thankfully, it's also the absolute nadir of the album at large, so everything else comes up roses by comparison. The album is deliberately divided into halves, with all of the uptempo stuff frontloaded, and the ballads pushed to the back-- the residual effect of the band's original concept for the album, which was to record two separate albums and release them together in the same package. One album (Before) was intended to be the ""party record,"" with quick, snappy tunes you might dance to, while the second (After) was to be the ""comedown,"" full of ballads and slower tracks. It's clear from the final version, however, that this concept could never have played out effectively, since the band simply doesn't vary their sound enough to really convey different moods-- the slow tracks feel just as upbeat as the fast ones, and the fast ones aren't terribly danceable in their own right. Besides, Pulp already executed this concept by accident with Different Class and This Is Hardcore, and frankly, I don't see anyone beating that pair anytime soon. Ultimately, The Wannadies are exactly good enough to pull off a 36-minute pop record, so it's for the best that they left their lofty ambitions at the curbside and concentrated on writing pure sugar like ""All Over Me"" and ""Disko"", the latter of which leads off the After half of the album with a slippery lounge groove, some big guitar hooks and the best drum fills on the record. ""Come with Me"" is the cream of the ballad bumper crop, with a nice waltzing beat and sparse piano backing the by-now familiar tenor/soprano combination of Pär Wiksten and Christina Bergmark. It all adds up to a nice enough look back at the glory days of Britpop through Scandinavian eyes, though one that's hardly essential for non-fanatics. If nothing else, the sunny mood is an improvement on the forced anger that plagued 1999's Yeah, though for prime Wannadies, your best bet is to dive in to the band's 1997 self-titled American debut, which shows their craft in fuller flower.","You know, if a band's first language isn't English, I don't think it's unreasonable to give ...

Cellar Door,John Vanderslice,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9165e6ef95969321356/1:1/w_160/afe88611.jpg,2004-01-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8403-cellar-door/,Barsuk,"In the discussion of music, our beloved protestant work ethic often takes the form of a seemingly paradoxical double-standard. On the one hand, we expect music to demonstrate effort and skill beyond what we consider ourselves capable of-- hence snarky and devastating dismissals to the tune of ""give me a few days and even I could make that album."" At the same time, we have little tolerance for anything that seems forced-- ""effortless"" is tossed around as a compliment just as certainly as a lack of effort is cited as grounds for dismissal. The amount of care and consideration John Vanderslice puts into the minutia of his records is beyond impressive. Over the course of three solo albums since the dissolution of his band MK Ultra, Vanderslice has proven himself to be not only a skilled songwriter, but one of the most unique, talented and thoughtful producers working in indie rock today. Vanderslice's ""sloppy hi-fi"" approach marries the grandiosity of Dave Fridmann's fuzzed-out, super-compressed sonic palate with the subtle charm and inventiveness of lo-fi techniques, and has resulted in some of the best-produced indie rock to see release in the last several years. While this attention to sonic detail is one of Vanderslice's greatest strengths, it often seems to limit him as well. Vanderslice will sometimes pack a song full of so many masterful arrangements and subtle textural shifts that the songs themselves fail to be as riveting as they should be when viewed from a distance. Though every song he's recorded is host to a plethora of riveting and intriguing sounds, these sounds sometimes fail to come together when taken as a whole-- comfortable midtempo pacing gets a little too comfortable, melodies seem tacked on, and the song itself comes across as an afterthought to the brilliantly conceived production and orchestration. For this, his fourth album, Vanderslice seems to have scaled down the bells and whistles that adorned his previous solo outings, placing a greater emphasis on his own unique delivery. As a singer, he's remarkable and distinctive, and on Cellar Door, he explores the range and impact of his voice to great effect. On ""They Won't Let Me Run"", Vanderslice abandons the restraint that often characterizes his singing and comes away with a poignant, pretty and memorable song that rivals his best. It's one of many songs on Cellar Door to explore the theme of families, and things that interfere with and complicate them. ""When It Hits My Blood"", another one of the album's standouts, begins with a confession, ""I stole from my mother,"" before revealing that the aforementioned mother is, herself, a ""pill fiend."" The song benefits greatly from Vanderslice's production talents-- this man can do things with a piano and a drumset that would make Steve Albini blush. Ultimately, though, one wishes the song would build to something slightly greater than it does-- not because it renders the song any less enjoyable or affecting, but rather because it prevents it from the transcendent greatness it comes so close to achieving. The more uptempo numbers are similarly promising. ""Coming and Going on Easy Terms"" is significant not only for its melodic excellence, but for its instrumentation as well, allowing each its own voice while paying great attention to their interplay. ""Pale Horse"", the album's leadoff track and original title, shows the influence of Vanderslice collaborator John Darnielle of Mountain Goats in its sound and approach alike, and proves one of the most engaging songs on Cellar Door. The only objectionable thing about Cellar Door is that it is, yet again, not the earth-shattering album Vanderslice has been almost-making for the last four years. Fortunately, his love of sound and ideas alike comes through with much more clarity than on 2002's Life and Death of an American Four-Tracker, which would seem to indicate that he's gradually progressing to a peak where his defining artistic statement can finally be made. Indeed, the most promising thing of all about Cellar Door is that it contains moments in which the music sounds, well, effortless. Further honing his songcraft and embracing the unique characteristics of his voice, Vanderslice is beginning to write songs that are every bit as elegant as their arrangements. Over the years, John Vanderslice has always been more than eager to give credit to his friends, his collaborators, his influences, and even his equipment, but Cellar Door is another compelling piece of evidence that the main attraction is, and always has been, Vanderslice himself.","In the discussion of music, our beloved protestant work ethic often takes the form of a seemingly paradoxical double-standard.

The Sand and the Stars,Movietone,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ebeb335119a49ed817/1:1/w_160/83bfa31a.jpg,2004-01-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5471-the-sand-and-the-stars/,Drag City,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Love of the Last Tycoon contains a passage that reads: ""It would come in some such guise as the auto-horns from the technicolor boulevards below or be barely audible, a tattoo on the muffled drum of the moon. He strained to hear it, knowing only that music was beginning, new music that he liked and did not understand."" The book's climactic love scene served as the basis of a Movietone song from 2000's beguiling and beautiful The Blossom Filled Streets. Yet the description above continues to lend itself to the Bristol group's follow-up, The Sand and the Stars, in that their music embodies both closeness and distance, the encompassing sounds in between (be they boulevards or heavenly bodies) as much a part of the music as the music itself. This is not accidental: the quintet lugged recording equipment out of their home studio and into churches and warehouses, up a cliff, and even into a bay near Land's End to capture that quality. The incidental, environmental sounds infuse with guitar, dulcimer, banjo, brushed drums, cubist bass, and the pastoral whispers of Kate Wright and Rachel Brook (who offset the brunt of early Flying Saucer Attack with a gentle serenity in her maiden days). The songs in turn reflect the cyclic patterns of ebb and flow found out there in the elements. ""Ocean Song"" gently sways along with the tremolo guitar and malleted patter of toms, as dripping water makes its own rhythm somewhere deeper in the mix. ""Let Night In"" vacillates between Rachel's ""Chopsticks""-piano and more pedal-heavy resonance, accompanied by her husband's strums. Harmonizing with accordion and wine glasses on ""Pale Tracks"", Sam and Matt Jones have all the morose male throat of the early, shadow-shrouded records of their fellow stable-mates Palace Brothers. Perhaps to keep up with the incoming tide, Movietone expand to nine players for ""We Rode On""-- here, clarinet, trumpet and saxophone breathe along with the bay. ""Snow Is Falling"" imagines a subdued, small Mingus group accompanying Vashti Bunyan through the drifts swirling at nightfall, juxtaposing a dark, walking bass with the lighter exhalations of Kate Wright. The only bit of abstract noise to make it over from The Blossom Filled Streets comes in the organ interlude of ""Not Even Close"", and even that recedes into subdued guitar and the banjo and wobbly jazz of ""Red Earth"". The final two songs of the disc find the group wandering about with their instruments out to the beach itself. ""Beach Samba"" is as joyful and refreshing as a quick, chilly dip with Shirley Collins, Astrud Gilberto and Lionel Belasco, while closer ""Near Marconi's Hut"" finds Kate Wright alone on a coastal path at night, with only her guitar to warm her voice and a lighthouse to shine in the darkness. In its final minutes, The Sand and the Stars gleans a delicate, human music between the distant heavens and cold terra firma.","F.

Underachievers Please Try Harder,Camera Obscura,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f513d19756521392da/1:1/w_160/933bbf6e.jpg,2004-01-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1748-underachievers-please-try-harder/,Merge,"Many of the most enchanting and popular indie pop records of the past few years have been filed under lap-pop/indietronica. By marrying The Field Mice's shimmering sonics with (where applicable) lovelorn lyrical impulses, those on the Morr and City Centre Offices rosters, Múm, The Postal Service, Freescha, Casino Versus Japan and Broadcast have been providing the warm hugs for the Darla set that used to be administered by post-C-86 jangle-pop. True, The Aislers Set, The Lucksmiths, and The Clientele have continued to proudly (and successfully) wave the flag for more classic melancholia, but in the first couple of years of this new millennium, too few other have bands managed to approach their charm. However, in the past year or so, there's been a shift back toward the more traditional indie pop thanks to the slight return of Belle & Sebastian and records by Saturday Looks Good to Me, PAS/CAL, Pipas, The Happy Couple, Ballboy and, most of all, Camera Obscura. The Scottish band's second album, Underachievers Please Try Harder, captures a portion of the wispy bedsit magic that used to mark some of The Field Mice's best work and boosts it with the lush, ""Hazey Jane II""-like chamber-pop of Belle & Sebastian's first flourishes of glory. (Admittedly, as a co-ed, Glaswegian sextet, B&S comparisons would have come fast and easy even if Camera Obscura hadn't once featured Richard Colburn on drums or got their foot in the door of public consciousness with a single produced by Stuart Murdoch, ""Eighties Fan"".) Underachievers was released in the UK last year on Spain's Elefant Records, and now Merge spreads the word in the U.S. and adds B-sides ""I Don't Want to See You"" and ""Footloose and Fancyfree"". Ignoring the infantilism of some of the more twee indie pop, Camera Obscura scold immature relationship decisions on ""Teenager"", offer tender advice on ""A Sister's Social Agony"", and go on the make on ""Suspended from Class"". Their honest, wide, and adult approach to heartbreak, romantic liaisons, and escapism is extended to the subtle range of influence-- most of which is shown off on the tracks sung by John Henderson. ""Before You Cry"" is a graceful nod to Nashville, ""Your Picture"" is a dead ringer for Leonard Cohen, and Motown stomper ""Let Me Go Home"" is the best of their soul boy all-nighters. Camera Obscura keep their cards closer to their indie pop chest when Tracyanne Campbell is alone on the mic, and, despite the success of the aforementioned tracks, are all the better for it. ""A Sister's Social Agony"" apes the gentle harmonies and chimes of sibling-led vocal groups Four Freshman and The Beach Boys-- an appropriate and sly arrangement for the subject matter. Best of all are the gentle, luminous ""Suspended from Class"" and ""Books Written for Girls"", each of which feature self-deprecating lyrics, tender arrangements, and a lifeline for heart-on-sleeve acoustic pop.

Cloudz,Sunroof!,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5beea9e61561daa51e7/1:1/w_160/c6b2560b.gif,2004-01-19 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7587-cloudz/,VHF,"Matthew Bower, the body behind England's Sunroof!, seems unusually preoccupied with staving off redundancy: Cloudz is not only markedly different from his earlier records, it's also an album so internally varied that it feels almost genreless, coyly hopping from ambient ooze to craggy noise to thick, droning waves of guitar. Considering Bower's ample discography as an avant-noise artist, it was once reasonable to accuse him of cribbing an agenda from his mold-cracking predecessors (see: Rhys Chatham, Glenn Branca, La Monte Young). But no matter how heavily annotated his previous work may have been, Cloudz is a stubbornly contemporary record, taking its cues from modern technology and aesthetics. For those familiar with Bower's former experiments, both as Sunroof! and with his old band Skullflower, Cloudz may seem like a shockingly docile departure, without a single hike into harsh, bleating, feedback-heavy noise. Instead, Bower serves pretty half-melodies and blurry, pre-dawn beats, sketching a vague, meandering, half-lit landscape. Even at its most aggressive, Cloudz is still far more gentle and inviting than anything else Bower has done, and while the sudden shift into tranquility (slyly hinted at on the second disc of 2002's Bliss) might perplex some longtime fans, it also backhandedly suggests that Bower's frame of reference has finally expanded to include some of his current droner-peers (see: the easy atmospherics of Labradford or Stars of the Lid). Appropriately, each song on Cloudz has been designated its own ""cloud,"" qualified only by a corresponding track number. Ultimately, Bower's additional nomenclature is almost laughably unnecessary, considering that these compositions evoke more than enough white, wispy images all on their own. Cloud One, the buoyant ""Machine"", layers loads of smooth, chirping bleeps (including samples of twittering birds) over a soft piano line, each tone just sweet enough to sound vaguely celestial, building nearly ten minutes of peaceable, meandering light. ""Viva"" mixes in bits of crank and crunch; ""Tornado Rose Canoe"" is packed with Bower's classic guitar squeal, including a big, sweaty electric solo. While occasionally mesmerizing, Cloudz is still more effective in theory than it is in practice. Extended exposure quickly reveals the gaps in his matrix: Bower's aggressive pursuit of diversity, while not necessarily responsible for an inherently disjointed product, does break the sense of cohesion and atmospherics that's necessary for these sorts of albums to function well over time. By opting for internal tension over cohesion, Bower takes a big gamble with our attention spans that, while admirable, doesn't fully pay off.","Matthew Bower, the body behind England's Sunroof!, seems unusually preoccupied with staving off redundancy: Cloudz is not only markedly ...

Greenhouse: 20th Anniversary Edition,Absolute Grey,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1829d034d5c69bf299c/1:1/w_160/092c3a72.jpg,2004-01-19 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/419-greenhouse-20th-anniversary-edition/,DBK Works,"Funny that, so far, only the most stereotyped aspects of 80s music (Plasticine posing, early beta-phase FX) have been obsessed over, while the plugged-in, underground jangle-pop of the early 80s remains obfuscated like the mossy gray overgrowth on the cover of Murmur. Fortunately, recent weeks have seen reissues of albums by the Mitch Easter-fronted jangle-pop band Let's Active, and now, Rochester-based Absolute Grey. Largely forgotten upstate-- save for a handful of fliers, an entry in Trouser Press, and generous remembrances by band peer Peter Buck, Bangs biographer Jim DeRogatis and former Forced Exposure scribe Byron Coley-- Absolute Grey's last LPs only saw daylight in Greece. Now, hoping to set matters straight, DBK has given their debut the remastered treatment. Beth Brown's melodic yearning on ""Saving Face"" hints at an alternate universe in which R.E.M. was femme-fronted, though its Rickenbacker jangle is more receptive than Buck's and its rhythm not quite so wooden as it breathes and spirals through longer six-minute pop structures. On ""More Walnuts"", a feeling of teen love resounds with a solid, slightly psychoactive backbeat, the new world's apologetic ""So. Central Rain"". Other tunes like ""Sidewalk"" and ""Remorse"" sport the spartan instrument flange that echoes other paisley poppers of their day, not to mention the tint (and bangs) of Echo & The Bunnymen. Bolstering these studio baby-steps, this new edition of Greenhouse is augmented by a live version of their ""Memory of You"" and an underground-obligatory cover of the Velvets' ""I'm Beginning to See the Light"". Both show the peppy exuberance and limber interplay between drummer Patrick Thomas and bassist Mitch Rasor, giving Brown's voice plenty of room to soar. The album is also accompanied by a live disc whose title, Bless Their Pointed Little Heads: Live at Scorgie's bares the group's adoration of circa-'67 Jefferson Airplane (it should not be bemused as expansion upon their earlier live album, A Journey Through the Past, which evokes Neil Young). It shows the band indulging in a more psychedelic space, leaning towards early Fillmore West music expansion within pop structures, while similarly maintaining diligence in the face of extended jamming proclivities. The ""poetry"" cringes at moments, though, and Brown's out-of-nowhere screech of ""We hate ice cream... the mouse ran up the clock!"" breaks the otherwise hypnotic and harrowing mood of ""Two Years a Handshake"". Only four songs from Greenhouse are documented live; the recording instead chooses to showcase the band's songwriting range, which not only rocks out with ""Getting Me Down"" and ""Candy Canes"", but also includes The Dream Syndicate's ""Tell Me When It's Over"". Before they shoot through ""Willow"" (complete with a brief, quicksilver soaring inside its instrumental break), Absolute Grey use their brief time onstage to breathlessly insist that the audience go see Invisible Party, Pat Casket, and Personal Effects open for Alex Chilton, still relatively unknown himself. For a second, it sounds as if they were already aware of the impermanent aspect of underground pop and the giddiness of its unimportant importance.","Funny that, so far, only the most stereotyped aspects of 80s music (Plasticine posing, early beta-phase FX) have been obsessed ...

Pyramid Electric Co.,Jason Molina,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c449eb335119a49ed8f3/1:1/w_160/9d96cf27.jpg,2004-01-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5565-pyramid-electric-co/,Secretly Canadian,"Exhibit A: ""If I wanted to play to fucking assholes, I would have played in New York City.""
--Jason Molina, to Athens, GA patrons, August 2002 Note - Exhibit A: Mr. Molina followed The Sunshine Fix and Snowglobe that night, but was opening for a then very-uncelebrated Polyphonic Spree. He'd been invited for some kind of ""showcase."" He explained that he would deliver both worlds of Songs: Ohia-- the solo performer and the full band-- but made it clear that the crowd had to be good during the solo stuff in order to be rewarded with a full band show. Molina had a right to expect an attentive crowd, having been specially chosen for this non-tour-stop event. He began to heckle the room as it socialized throughout his set and drowned out his mopey, Pyramid-ish hero-and-guitar material. ""Why did you ask me to come here?"" ""I'm not doing anything until you shut up."" Etc. He tailored his set to a semicircle of anemic boys and girls who tried to ""feel it,"" honest, but Molina's fragmented, voyeuristic ballads can seem self-directed and standoffish. Just before the show devolved into a filibuster, Molina gave the good kids two full band songs (one of which was the majestically serious ""Farewell Transmission"", from what would be his final album as Songs: Ohia), and then told them that he'd planned to do more, but oh well, not now, you drove-all-night-to-see-me shitbonnets. One year later, opening for Enon, Molina would ""rock out"" the whole set, and remain humble-- affable, even-- as if he knew the squirmy throng lacked the patience to comprehend his one-man chariots of fire. Exhibit B: The Velvet Underground's Moe Tucker, in the Half Japanese documentary The Band That Would Be King, twice bemoans how ""sick"" it is that fringe artists have no chance of ""making a limited living"" via their music because they are denied access to major means of publicity and distribution. Note - Exhibit B: But, but, but Moe! Even in this freest of states, we can't just do what we want and sustain ourselves. Within the existing structures that bind this planet's inhabitants, we can't all go write poems and massage pianos and practice your patented doon-doon-doon-PUH on our skins. Who would build airports and overpasses and laundromats? Whose punk fancy would those endeavors fulfill? And perhaps fringe artists such as Jason Molina are too plucky and impulsive for mass consumption. Molina obviously lives for the song itself and its power to baptize his (or his characters') demons. If he were market- or fiscal-survival-driven, why would he interrupt his thrilling evolution with this recorded-in-2001, stripped-down, ""vinyl-only"" throwback to least-beloved discography-cloggers such as Our Golden Ratio and The Ghost? Those aggrieved collections contain naught but solo murk. Why didn't Molina ""return to basics"" with some interesting noise-tracks and drums, as he did to liven up Protection Spells? And if he was going on sabbatical from Albini, to skulk back into Mike Mogis' arms, why not hang some atmospheric scraps on the songs' bones, as he did on the incomparably haunting and underrated Ghost Tropic? Exhibit C: ""Using images from the craft, scientists have determined the age of the universe, about 13.7 billion years, and discovered that a mysterious energy, called the dark force, is causing all of the objects in the universe to move apart at an accelerating rate. This force is still poorly understood.""         --Paul Recer, Associated Press, January 2004 Note - Exhibit C: From news item entitled ""U.S. Allowing Hubble Telescope to Degrade"". Try to connect these dots: Jason Molina allowed Songs: Ohia to degrade. Often, humans celebrate their ""earthiness"" by broadcasting their affinity for ""red"" mud. NASA is refocusing at the behest of an unelected defense-industry bitch. They are shifting their energies to the moon, a hunk of dead rock on which our country won a gladiatorial drag race/pissing contest with ""red"" Russia (resulting in the mass manufacture of Tang, Velcro and lubricants for machines as well as humans). Jason Molina has shifted his energies to utilities concerns, such as Magnolia Electric Company, but he frequently refers to the moon. Mars is the ""red planet."" Pyramid contains a cathedral-wrecking piano dirge entitled ""Red Comet Dust"". Interplanetary travel is as excruciatingly slow as this album. I think you can detect the conspiracy-dandruff here. When MolinaGate blows wide open, we will learn how he maintains such a grip on the dark cosmic force, while proclaiming, ""I want to be true like the solid earth."" (A death wish?) Exhibit D: Since he busted onto the scene in 1995, Jason Molina has released an estimated 23 songs that are over seven minutes long. Note - Exhibit D: ""Jason Molina"" is not a post-rock quintet, nor is he Bob Dylan, but this record's best songs are the monsters. ""Long Desert Train"" is the least adorned and most traditional, and its list of insecurities is harrowing. The title track is Mogis' showpiece, as Molina sounds like he's reluctantly gigging at a wedding chapel on a tin replica of Noah's ark. The song is about ""our"" adaptability to heinousness. (Molina loves these kinds of generalizations, things ""we all"" go through.) ""You'll have friends who won't come home/ You'll see their bones not separate yet from death/ You'll get used to it."" Need I mention the war on war? Need I mention that death is a character on most of this album's songs, an active participant with fireballs and a language? ""Honey, Watch Your Ass"" is one of the best Molina compositions ever, ever, and it convicts its neighbors of slightness. Despite a lyric that hands critics a hammer (""It's like nothing's got a pulse""), the song communicates its danger, passion and withdrawal vividly and urgently. The clunkiness of some of the other songs' lyrics, and the inevitability of their imagery must be embarrassed to run up against showstoppers such as, ""She smells a little like a train."" Exhibit E: ""In a world without sadness what would there be to encourage attachment to our children or our partners?""
        --Lewis Wolpert, Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression Note - Exhibit E: The reviewer's mother spent one Christmas-- this woman loves Christmas-- in solitary confinement at a state prison. One of the reviewer's high-school girlfriends just got killed in Iraq. The reviewer's exercise bulimia has reached stage four (called ""Omelet Equals Treadmill"" by doctors). Sanatorium residence runs in his family. The poor reviewer, impervious to ""real-world"" pathos, regularly weeps along to albums, having disproportionately privileged their status as safely manipulative/triggering commodities. The reviewer takes Jason Molina too seriously, having collected all of his releases, as if they were buffers against some fundamental lack. But even the reviewer can find mirth and consolation, in a bawdy Britcom, or a backyard fight between a raccoon and a cat. Just as Elliott Smith's ""Needle in the Hay"" was perfect for the suicide-attempt scene in The Royal Tenenbaums, any song on this album would complement a still-photo montage of a prolonged labor ending in a miscarriage. Exhibit F: ""Don't believe the hype.""
        --Public Enemy, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back Note - Exhibit F: Secretly Canadian's website explains that Molina camped out in the studio like Mary Shelley for this album, but the album's songs keep their distance from the listener. Molina feels everything, to an almost macho, almost Russell Crowe extreme. Secretly Canadian cites the vocals of Ali Farka Toure, but the reviewer only hears the guitars of Ry Cooder, or slowed-down soul/funk greats, in Molina's choral, and occasionally erect vibrato. Keeping this album would be like saving some shed space for a cool-looking but dead lawnmower. Pyramid Electric Co. is a thing of beauty and mystery, but its skin is chafed from wallowing, and I am its Debra Winger, slurping up mascara. If you ""get"" it, congratulations; you're impenetrable.","Exhibit A: ""If I wanted to play to fucking assholes, I would have played in New York City.""

Sunny 16 EP / Speed Graphic EP,Ben Folds Five,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdea13d197565213b658/1:1/w_160/ea72e035.jpg,2004-01-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11741-sunny-16-ep-speed-graphic-ep/,iTunes,"O! the razor sharp loneliness of the one-man band! Multi-instrumentalists take heed: just because you can play every key, string and percussive surface on your album doesn't necessarily mean you should. There are reasons that the band format has dominated the music industry for the better part of ever, that most of the Songwriter Hall of Fame consists of duos, and that peanut butter sandwiches taste better with jelly. Everyone needs a collaborator. Ben Folds managed to skirt this immutable law two years ago, when he ditched the Five to do the alone-in-the-studio thing for Rockin' the Suburbs. Though better than it might've been, Suburbs was nonetheless no great evolutionary leap forward for Folds, consisting of largely the same proper-name ivory-pop he made with Robert Sledge and Darren Jesse (if a bit heavier on the tissue-box Harry Chapin son-love ballads). Which raises the question: if you're not going to change the sound that got your CD into every college girl's sun-visor disc wallet, why fire your band? These EPs, released under-radar-stylee through that radical indie warehouse iTunes, would seem to present the perfect secret stage for Folds to branch out into new areas, as he brings a few members of his touring band in-studio for two no-frills quintets of new material and covers. And yet, Sunny 16 and Speed Graphic find the piano-man following the same old steps, with BFF trademarks like fuzz-plucked distorto-bass, rampant harmonizing, and liberal application of lyrical swear-snark appearing with no less frequency than usual. Thematically, ""There's Always Someone Cooler than You"" is a dilution of the Bizkit-taunt ""Rockin' the Suburbs"", which was in turn a dilution of the hipster-roasts ""Underground"" and ""The Battle of Who Could Care Less"". Whereas the wry skewering of the latter track were dead-on observations chased with unshakeable minor-key doo-dooing, the voice of ""Always Someone Cooler"" is more a condescending curmudgeon act, no longer laced with that little twinge of self-effacement that leavens the scolding. In fact, the majority of Sunny 16's lyrics appear in the form of parental commands: ""There's never gonna be no moment of truth for you,"" ""You've got to give the people what they want,"" ""Go bless someone else for a while."" Sit through this much piano-bench lecturing and you start to understand why Folds can't hold a band together. Sunny 16 barely scrounges up a Mendoza line average, the only standout being ""Rockstar"", where Folds' key-banging revisits the chordal triumph of oldies like ""The Last Polka"" and the admonishments seem at least partially self-directed. But these good feelings are quickly snuffed by his dreadfully saccharine cover of The Divine Comedy's ""Songs of Love"", a track that excuses a certain level of romanticism, but not the overwrought string section spackled on by Folds in lieu of the original's awesomely tinny harpsichord. Less grating is his take on The Cure's ""In Between Days"" on Speed Graphic, done fairly straight; like his old cover of Built to Spill's ""Twin Falls"", the song acclimates surprisingly well to piano interpretation, even if it misses its old acoustic chug. Of Speed Graphic's originals, only the anxious drumming and Joe Jackson chording of ""Protection"" comes off as more than a castaway, while dreary-slow material like ""Wandering"" and ""Give Judy My Notice"" continue adult-contempt-orary pandering for the ""Brick"" audience and moms who discovered Ben on United In-Flight music videos. That three of the short-player's five tracks are older compositions only now being laid to tape might excuse the lack of progression evidenced here, but the songs also do little to dispel the notion that Folds is scraping the barrel of his range. This EP series was initially planned as a trilogy, but for whatever conspiratorial reasons you want to dream up (certainly not sales, as both have done rather well on Steve Jobs' idle finger to the record labels), the third part was recently scrapped. Perhaps Ben's taking the collaboration maxim to heart, though future projects with Bens Kweller and Lee (still waiting on my royalty check, guys) and, gulp, his second with William Shatner, appear less than promising. In the meantime, anyone who once had a soft spot for Folds' days of poor arithmetic can only hope he'll snap out of his slump, rather than follow the all-too-familiar rock-pianist descent into jazz cover albums and Disney scores.","O! the razor sharp loneliness of the one-man band!

Margerine Eclipse,Stereolab,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56813d1975652138f4a/1:1/w_160/6fc45e14.jpg,2004-01-15 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7502-margerine-eclipse/,Elektra,"On one hand, you have a group that have clearly said everything they wanted to say, whatever it is they wanted to say. This is a pretty common criticism of bands by people who probably stopped listening to the records years ago-- though to be fair, if that's your idea of a flaw, Stereolab are deeply flawed. It's certainly something I've considered from time to time. Why it should come up more often with this band than, say, Radiohead, is another question. Apparently, ""ruts"" are not inherently bad, and it turns out the majors have been demonstrating this for as long as ""pop"" meant ""popular."" No, I don't think the fact that Stereolab have been making variations on the same record every year for almost ten years is the reason they briefly fell out of favor. This is fashion, you understand, and if anyone should understand the stylish generation, it's the Lab. Of course, Stereolab never really fell ""out of favor,"" per se, but getting two people to agree on the value of their indie-pop stock is a tall order. The main problem is that taking stock of the band's place within a contemporary context assumes that they were ever really ""contemporary."" Even back in the days when they might feasibly have been playing ""indie rock,"" all of their musical cues were throwbacks to the vintage post-rock power of folks like Neu! and Raymond Scott. Their imagery was all fluorescents and retro-futuristic schemata, even before their music became the same. Their Marxism was about ten years too late to really be cool-- but as they consistently demonstrate, their kind of ""cool"" is, at best, a paradox. Furthermore, and perhaps most on point, their music hasn't actually gotten any worse over the years. That may sound like a backhanded compliment, but in the faces of a significant faction of former Stereolab fans who think they've gone soft, it's practically blasphemy. You know, in merely quantitative terms, the ratio of good songs on their records is about the same as it was during their perceived mid-90s ""peak,"" and I would argue that their music is actually more interesting now. Their preference for lounge and faux-acid jazz textures tend to polarize people, which I guess is a good thing considering my fear of a pending acid jazz revival. All of this brings me to Margerine Eclipse. As a reward for sticking with me this far, I'll get right to the point: if you hated Cobra and Phases, Sound-Dust and Dots & Loops, you'll probably have little need for Stereolab's eighth proper full-length. All of the hallmarks of latter-day Groop are here: harpsichords, silly (yet great) 70s analog synthesizers with futuristic roto-bossa beats, and plenty of dreamy harmonies to fill out the barely existent song structures. Mary Hansen's presence is missed when you hear Laetitia Sadier spot herself on the high vocals, though it's easy enough to imagine her back in there if you want. All of it is very easy, which is a perfect way to sum up a new Stereolab record: easy to predict, easy to criticize. And easy to like. I should come clean in that I never hated post-ETK Stereolab, so the familiar movements of Margerine Eclipse aren't really a disappointment as much as yearly revisits from old friends. When the band released an uninspired Instant 0 in the Universe EP in 2003 (coming off their first year without new studio material since they started making records), it looked momentarily as if the train was stopping. Now, the notion seems funny because listening to bright, buoyant tunes like ""Le Demeure"" or the fantastic opener, ""Vonal Declosion"", reminds me that they'll probably keep going like this until they're gone. The aforementioned ""Vonal Declosion"" rings in the new record with a flash and the trill of the Farfisa, as the bass dances below Sadier's well-worn rhythmic French nothings. What's more, as the band transitions into a section sounding ripped out of Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking"" and Mary Tyler Moore Show incidental music at once, supermarket strings enter on the left and reveal Stereolab's true calling for delivering Perfect Pop for Then People. ""Cosmic Country Noir"" pulls out the classic robotic Wurlitzer drum machine patterns for more antiqua-groove, though the main body of the song is more reminiscent of The Free Design than Kraftwerk. ""Margerine Rock"" doubles back on Stereolab's way with pop history by sounding most similar to their own music, circa Mars Audiac Quintet, even if guitars can't quite mask their now low-key charms. More fitting seems the poignant ""Dear Marge"", with Spanish guitar, gliding Farfisa, percolating synth and Sadier's counterpoint vocals so obviously being transmitted to Hansen somewhere off in the cosmos. The song is nostalgic, but handled with such care that its sweetness never approaches saccharine sentiment, or worse, stale lounge-pop. They ensure the song's fate by galloping out on a disco-funk plane right out of an Earth, Wind & Fire record. (Okay, so restraint isn't really Stereolab's thing, but damn it, they just have such good taste in sudden disco flashbacks.) Ultimately, Margerine Eclipse probably won't be received as a ""return to form,"" other than to say it's perfectly in accord with everything they've given us for the last several years. It won't gather them new fans, etc. etc., though I think that's an unfair way to judge a record. Times have changed, and the band hasn't, so you might just as well praise them for sticking to their ideals instead of latching onto some trend (Tim Gane does dancepunk, anyone? Bad example, I'd listen to that). The best way I can think to hear Margerine Eclipse is as another in a line of accomplished, eternally pleasant and intermittently brilliant Stereolab records. Really, it's just that easy.","On one hand, you have a group that have clearly said everything they wanted to say, whatever it is they ...

Pieces,Millennium,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43769fc7814a47cd81c/1:1/w_160/308ab59c.jpg,2004-01-15 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5546-pieces/,Sonic Past,"There's an old L.A. music biz tale that details a stunned Brian Wilson accidentally overhearing a recording session down the hall from his own. As the story goes, Wilson was hanging at Studio Three West with Pet Sounds collaborator Gary Usher in the spring of 1966 when he caught snippets of a recording conducted by 21-year-old wunderkind Curt Boettcher. Boettcher, fresh from producing The Association's first record, and with something of a rare talent for soaring, angelic vocal arrangements along the lines of Wilson's very own, took Wilson and Usher by complete surprise. In fact, legend has it that Boettcher's ability to produce majestically layered instrumental and vocal pieces seemingly at the drop of a hat threw Wilson for a loop, and is rumored to have started the breakdown that would ultimately destroy his Smile project, and indeed his life ever after. Even if you don't buy the story, Boettcher's effect on L.A. pop cannot be denied. Usher would soon pull him in as a collaborator on what would later become Present Tense by Sagittarius, a psych-pop outfit whose only LP is one of the great, lost classics of ""sunshine pop."" Boettcher's other major projects in the 60s were work with his own band The Ballroom, and later, a curiously overlooked record by songwriter supergroup The Millennium. In addition to his love of exquisite harmony vocals, Boettcher's stereo productions were remarkably crisp for the time-- certainly more so that Wilson's concurrent adventures in mono. I'd say Boettcher's own songs (and that of most sunshine pop artists) usually weren't of the same depth as Wilson's, but that's another argument. The Millennium was comprised of several successful songwriters and musicians living and working in Los Angeles in the mid-60s, including Lee Mallory, Sandy Salisbury and Joey Stec. All had worked with or around Boettcher and Usher, and proved themselves capable of delivering on what would become the largest recording budget in Columbia Records' history to that point. Their result was 1968's Begin, and though it's probably the single greatest 60s pop record produced in L.A. outside of The Beach Boys, it (like Wilson's music) found itself very much outside the times that year. After Begin tanked, the band was dropped from Columbia-- setting up the perfect cult record years later. Of course, the band had planned to make many more albums, and Pieces collects demos intended for their follow-up. Anyone hip to The Millennium or other Boettcher projects might recognize many of the songs here, as they've been released before as Again, though Pieces includes many tracks that failed to make that compilation. Most importantly, almost all of these songs will be of interest to folks looking for perfect pop in the mold of The Association, Beach Boys and even into the budding country-rock of The Byrds. ""I Just Don't Know How to Say Goodbye"" is an almost perfect realization of the styles of each of those artists, though the tune and loose, gentle optimism of Salisbury's vocal give it a strength to stand on its own. The song, with rising, major-key guitar figures and a folkish bent (much of this music could have worked in a completely acoustic setting) did show up on Salisbury's 1968 solo LP. ""Can You See"" is one of many Stec/Michael Fennelly songs (the pair was also responsible for the magnificent ""To Claudia on Thursday"" from Begin), and is a typically upbeat, sunny tune that might pass for The Monkees were it not for its surprisingly down-to-earth lyrics lamenting love lost over material concerns. The strength of the writing throughout the album is such that the band's failure to break through is a little shocking. ""How Much I Love You"" is a tender acoustic ballad also penned by Stec and Fennelly, and though it probably helped give birth to Jewel mk. I, it's nonetheless at once achingly melancholy and performed with professionalism that could have made it a hit in another universe. The same goes for the pair's ""Sometime or Another"", though this actually approaches indie-torch song along the lines Uncle Tupelo. Although not every song on Pieces matches up with the band's best, none of it ever really betrays its origination as demo recordings. Boettcher obviously had some hand in this, though since all of the band were insiders to some degree, it's not surprising they had access to studios and engineers no other similarly unknown band could ever dream of. Song like ""Suspended Animation"" (first rate country-pop with a strange sci-fi theme) or the Beatlesque ""It's You"" sound better than 90% of the music to actually chart in 1968. The latter song in particular, with its pristine harmony vocals and chugging, ""Baby You're a Rich Man"" bass work, makes it hard to believe Clive Davis never saw anything in these guys. If all of this is news to you, my advice is to run out in grab a copy of Begin. After that, check out Sagittarius and Boettcher's other projects. And then, when you think you've run out of sugary fun-time pop with a faint dejected edge, head here. The Millennium deserved better way back when, but anyone interested in 60s pop and folk-rock should have no problem digging them now.","There's an old L.A. music biz tale that details a stunned Brian Wilson accidentally overhearing a recording session ...

Pieces of April,Stephin Merritt,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43deb335119a49ed8d5/1:1/w_160/b295c0d9.jpg,2004-01-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5239-pieces-of-april/,Nonesuch,"Despite the laughably appropriate indie filmmaker penchant for Stephin Merritt's music, all of his songs incorporated into movie soundtracks thus far have been fairly unconvincing. Anyone who remembers the Ashley Judd Oscar bid, Someone Like You, knows both that a wristwatch will disappear if you unflinchingly stare at it for more than an hour in a dark theatre, and that 69 Love Songs' ""Absolutely Cuckoo"" didn't exactly fit into the proceedings. Fighting back the inclination to blame all our pop music woes on the Judd family yet again, the incompatibility of Merritt and the movies is probably the electro-troubadour's own fault: his music is just too witty, too perceptive, and too memorable to make any sense in another medium. Still, if someone put a Howitzer to an ambitious filmmaker's head and told them to make some sort of Merritt vehicle (trust me, this happens all the time if you stay out too late on 4th Street in Downtown L.A.), the only satisfactory result would have to be about frigid undergraduates seducing wintry laundromat workers in libraries. It was with weary eyes, then, that the world received Merritt's first album-length soundtrack for 2002's ode to statutory rape, Eban & Charley. The franchise was underwhelming to say the least, the only similarity between the album and the movie being that shy, barrette-fastened teenagers bought them for birthday presents to seem controversially sophisticated. Now, because Merritt is eminently, eccentrically charismatic (and because 90 percent of his career output has been worthwhile), we're willing to give him another chance-- particularly because the film he's scoring stars a pseudo-post-goth, emotionally fragile Katie Holmes reconciling with a dope-smoking cancer victim. Though it's as close to a perfect setting as the music could get, the actual movie didn't give much presence to these songs (excepting the one written specifically for it). Regardless, Pieces of April stacks four new Magnetic Fields songs (none of which were even in the movie), one new Merritt song, and five previously released Magnetic Fields/6ths songs on one shorter-than-the-movie's-theatrical-run 27-minute CD. The new Magnetic Fields songs will, thankfully, not raise any eyebrows; the enthusiasm and sparkling spontaneity is, like always, pressed into ukuleles and tucked into preposterously addictive Yamaha sound settings circa 1985. ""Dreams Anymore"" has the sort of lambent whimsy-chimes that accompany all good dream sequences while the lyrics and the ever-imperious harmonium solo do everything in their power to disown that image ""'cause she don't believe in dreams anymore."" ""Stray with Me"" is not nearly as engrossing: it proves you can add however much cello you want to a song and it can still sound like a bad Eels B-side with a Jimmy Buffett bassline and lyrics worse than the titular pun. Merritt's ""One April Day"", the only song specifically commissioned for the movie (and given any substantial screen time) is quiet, pleasant, ignorable, and full of sparse mandolin and light tambourine. Needless to say, it sounds like a soundtrack when the cardinal rule of a good soundtrack is to do whatever's necessary to make sure the album doesn't just sound like a soundtrack. With that in mind, the other two additions are easy to savor, particularly in contrast. ""Heather Heather"" begrimes Merritt's music box effects and has some genuinely arresting lines: ""We belong together/ Like sex and violence/ Like death and silence."" Strangely, it gets progressively more rocksteady in the last 30 seconds, which is either brilliant or incoherent depending on your intelligence. There's also one song that fills enough criteria to clearly announce its candidacy for ""great song"" status: ""All I Want to Know"" has the usual slender drums, bells and synths, but the chorus, built off of an erratically simmering uke solo, is an expanding pop incline performed with just the right vocal histrionics, while the lyrics are as knowingly torn between irony and sincerity as anything Merritt's ever recorded: ""Is there nothing nohow left to save?/ Tell me tonight or not at all/ We'll have to fight/ I can make last call, and play a little pinball."" Even if it's not in your Top 10, it smashes the smattering of 6ths tunes on here, all from the unresponsively received and unresponsively performed 2000 album, Hyacinths and Thistles. The Momus collaboration, ""As You Turn to Go"", is lethargic, tedious and haphazardly instrumented. It should be the perfect place to highlight the lyrics (or at least it would be if they weren't so uncharacteristically vapid and painstakingly grumbled). Luckily, the remaining are all ""First Song on Your 1999 Mix Tape"" cuts from 69 Love Songs: the barbershop-enunciated reverent country-rock clomp, ""Epitaph for My Heart""; the trotting, giddily reflexive ""I Think I Need a New Heart""; and the flopping, carnivalesque chorus of ""The Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side"". Any Merritt fan worth their daintily-held white burgundy probably owns five of the ten songs on here. When we use calculus, we find that this means the average Merritt fan will be spending upwards of $11 on thirteen minutes of new music. That's about $1.20 a minute, and unless you're receiving aural, intellectual and physical pleasure during that period, that's just too much. If, on the other hand, you saw the movie, decided the music held some promise (or just find the movie so remarkable you need to constantly evoke it) and wanted a quick sampler, this is a cautious buy/download on your way to the Magnetic Fields full-length that's supposed to be released later this year.","Despite the laughably appropriate indie filmmaker penchant for Stephin Merritt's music, all of his songs incorporated into movie soundtracks ...

Secret Wars,Oneida,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9dac0084474cd0c26de/1:1/w_160/ab68a993.jpg,2004-01-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5999-secret-wars/,Jagjaguwar,"One of the greatest benefits of tracking Oneida's career-to-date has been the relentless refinement of the 60s-influenced psych juggernaut they got rolling into a mesmerizing drone-rock hybrid seven years ago; every album has demonstrated constant development toward their uniquely iterative rock dynamic. No matter what the current musical climate, Oneida have never deviated from their unique sense of manifest destiny. The goal is outwardly simple; for seven years these Brooklyn boys have been striving for nothing more than the single Perfect Riff, the fundamentally isolated element around which all songs can be built. The ancient Greeks knew it in legend; medieval astronomers predicted its eventual return through the movement of planets, but none ever witnessed the Return itself. The Hippies may have come the closest, dropping acid and swallowing Quaaludes in the hopes of just glimpsing it; some found inspiration in their quest and paved the way for others to follow, but the One True Riff was still never found. But perhaps not for much longer: Oneida know things that mere mortals do not, and they can see things no one else can see; time was, they were prone to acid flashback meltdowns and psych jams like their forefathers, but recently, Oneida have begun to surpass mere psychedelia into the realm of pure hypnosis. Each One Teach One devoted an entire disc to the exploration of the phenomenon. It was music as anesthetic, pummeling listeners with cascading sheets of sounds, piling repetition atop repetition until the mounting pressure revealed a diamond, the One True Riff. Possession and knowledge are separate things, though, and the path to mastery did not come quickly enough to save that album from misuse and abuse of the newfound power. Secret Wars is the first step toward the combination of Oneida's monolithic psych-rock and the numbing riff iteration they've spent so long deriving. The foundation of Secret Wars is repetition on a massive scale; songs are built atop the constant cycling of hyper-minimal progressions, fairly bludgeoning the listener into a state of docility with as minimal an approach as possible. Sometimes Fat Bobby provides the key hook on the organ, other times Hanoi Jane's bass locks the groove, but the end results are almost always uniform: spiraling, acid-washed descents into cultivated monotony based on little more than bar or two stacked again and again. For the first time, though, they've figured out how to tweak the patterns, modify them without breaking them, and seamlessly mesh these forays into drone with the psych-rock in which they've always been so proficient. ""$50 Tea"" may be the most perfect example; the shrieking organ-grind from Hell begins the cycle, but slowly gives way to pounding bass and guitar underneath the trance-like vocals, and each instrument comes to the fore to carry the drone before the song's end. ""The Winter Shaker"" and ""Changes in the City"" play like a continuation of ""Sheets of Easter"", full of plodding riffs like a shot of novocaine to the frontal lobe, but this time with dirge-like vocals to match, seeing the album to its natural conclusion in turn. Again, the results are startlingly effective, taking hold at some primal, subconscious level and holding on until the end, but by being the most overwrought of the bunch, they highlight a few of Oneida's remaining faults: when reduced to just a storm of looping noise, the sonic concussion they create is easier to shake off, and more importantly, they're hampered by some not-insignificant production issues. For all of their bombast, the mix on Secret Wars is totally flat; vocals are strained, and the waves of sound aren't as immediately imposing as they ought to be. To be truly effective, Oneida needs to tower over the listener, and in that respect, they still fall short. Nevertheless, Secret Wars is the first really unified effort Oneida has been able to construct, finally striking the perfect balance between the classic slabs of psych you grew up on and new-school mind-control. They still have some studio issues to work out, but those are only a matter of time, so savor your remaining independent thought while you can; by next album it may be too late.","One of the greatest benefits of tracking Oneida's career-to-date has been the relentless refinement of the 60s-influenced psych juggernaut ...

The Young Machines,Her Space Holiday,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0b45e6ef959693235c2/1:1/w_160/d2de292c.jpg,2004-01-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3826-the-young-machines/,Mush,"The extended monologue of addiction and plummet contained on this CD is so wall-to-wall tragic that I reckoned it could only be assessed via method acting. But after countless listens, I realized that drinking four Clearchannels (one-third organic apple juice, one-third expensive gin, one-third cheap saki-- the kind with an ""intended for cooking"" sticker) wasn't enough. To truly pull a Clinton on this album's pain, I would have had to freebase suppositories, disown my circle, and score some fabric softener so the noose wouldn't burn as much. The good folks at Texas Instruments helped to determine the rating above, based on an average calculation of the 9.9 this release deserved for its conception and off-putting bravery, and the 3.9 it earns due to par loops and too-precious delivery. The Young Machines will rank among your favorite albums if you're someone's mortifyingly jaded ex, but if you come to it craving electronic vocal-pop keeping pace with anything north of Jimmy Tamborello's shoulders, you'll end up frustrated by the simple and repetitive violin bits that drive the big retro beats of ""Tech Romance"", ""Girl Problem"" and ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend"". These stately, neutered forays into gangsta's paradise don't do enough with their chamber-hop, though ""Boyfriend""'s choral punk-out at least adds variety. Lest you think any kind of rap reference is a sad stretch when discussing Her Space Holiday: the album was not just released on the primarily underground hip-hop label Mush, but its liner notes' brief shoutouts additionally thank Aesop Rock, Atmosphere, The Streets, cLOUDDEAD, and The Neptunes. This ain't your father's digital shoegaze. Mark Bianchi's life was in the shitter, if his lyrics can be trusted, yet his blippy backing tracks, despite their limitations (his own songs sound like his remixes of others' songs, etc) remain oddly ascendant in tone-- some of these could serve as Muzak for a tourist-town's rainforest or seahorse exhibit. The title track (and what a title, awesome in its own right, and suggesting such triumphs as the Young Fresh Fellows, Marble Giants, Gods, People, legend Neil, TV on the Radio's Liars, The Constantines' ""Lions"", and Pavement's Gary) is a stunner, a kind of IDM take on The Ice Storm's score, with anime musicboxery, and are those voices saying ""let go"" and ""save me?"" Avant-guardians will ruin my fun by crying Moby, but dig the layered reprise on ""The Luxury of Loneliness"". ""Meet the Pressure"" is a bitchslap to Bianchi's negative reviews and reviewers. I sympathize with the man's point: the de-evolution of labor involved in blurbiage and its reception is disheartening. 1. An artist labors to fashion an album. 2. A critic half-labors to fashion a review about how the album wasn't messianic. 3. A webboarder calls the critic a bald ugly fag. 4. A lurker misregurges the webboarder in an IM to his cousin: ""Don't download that band; their junk'll be stoops."" Bianchi's song is about meanness, revenge and lyric-misquoting. He includes a sample from an answering machine about his ""Internet press"" after he says some crits are ""hoping that their viciousness will boost traffic on their site."" But then he ruins his complicated rumination on the indie ""media"" with a fantasy (?) about the critic being cuckolded. I had to think of some of the disses my inbox has weathered (from artists I like, such as Ween and Cex) and the sensitivity expressed by other artists (Aereogramme and Songs: Ohia, who asked for my address-- I cling every night to my crossbow, Molina, with a Cape Fear tripwire around my lhasa apso). So if you're up to hearing what Kurtis Blow would sound like on Saddle Creek, or if you love cinematic self-vigilantism, or cover artwork that places engine gears in women's wombs, or if you've been waiting for a breakdown album since Kramer's The Guilt Trip, or if you can dig how ""Japanese Gum"" conjures a mood by suggesting Black Black brand (Engrish fans know their slogan ""Hi-Technical Taste and Flavor!""), buy The Young Machines. Few albums about druggies dealing with the death of a grandmother are as stark. Bianchi even admits to missing his mom at one intermittently moving point. But when his liner notes claim he doesn't deserve any of his fans, he's being way too hard on himself. Hopefully his devotees know their suicide watch etiquette.","The extended monologue of addiction and plummet contained on this CD is so wall-to-wall tragic that I reckoned it could ...

Amorino,Isobel Campbell,by: William Morris,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f313d19756521392d4/1:1/w_160/bb594f18.jpg,2004-01-14 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1746-amorino/,Instinct,"I'd had my fill of Belle & Sebastian by the time Fold Your Hands Child saw release in 2000, and gawked that year with voyeuristic wonder as their splinter projects, The Gentle Waves and Looper, slid into deserved ignominy. It seemed unlikely that Isobel Campbell's first solo record might be the statement of reformation that would break my spell of disenchantment with the band and their spinoffs, but I went into it with an open mind nonetheless. As a cellist and vocalist, Campbell's contributions to Belle & Sebastian ranged from harmlessly superfluous to irksome, and during her stint as the lead troubadour for The Gentle Waves, she rarely exhibited the merit to justify any sort of solo career, even while most of her work was pleasantly melancholic and remained respectfully restrained. For Amorino, however, that restraint has succumbed to an orchestral throng of players, who back Campbell as she unravels her featherweight whisper of a swoon over beds of intricately wrought, fluttering strings. As could be expected, the production is sharp, and the song structures are tightly wound and delicately unraveled. The problem is that the effort as a whole is too slick, and its charm suffers as a result. The stylistic approach of Amorino ranges from light New Orleans jazz to Lambchop-inflected chamber numbers, with the songs frequently gliding from breathy girl-pop to bebop without a single quirk. But while they do cascade with a certain cinematic grandeur, they generally lack the emotive prowess necessary to clue Campbell into any sort of revelatory or innovative ground. A classical sense abounds, but never delivers upon the pulling threads of musical sentiments past. ""The Cat's Pyjamas"" might be heard on a New Orleans Prohibitionist's night out, with Campbell playing the coy role of sophisticate. ""October's Sky"" and ""Song for Baby"" playfully hint at traditional and Parisian light jazz, augmented by fleeting buoyant string and flute lines. On ""Monologue for an Old True Love"", Campbell's orchestral backing makes its first vainglorious approach as she navigates a sea of bossa nova horns and 60s-inspired drum and guitar work. The problem being not Campbell's vocal touch, but her inability to emotively carry the more subtly melodic moments or the sweepingly faux-inspirational tones of revelation: her soft intonation lulls somnolently no matter the background fare. Whereas some moments (such as the more modern-flavored ""There Is No Greater Gold"") approach Moon Safari-inspired tones of soft concession, Campbell fails to gently brush strokes of naked disclosure the likes of Beth Hirsch. It's this ineptness to ever truly engage that sinks Amorino in the end. Though it just may be too pleasant to actually offensive, the absence of any epochal splendor remitted over the course of such a well-crafted effort does leave a mark. Or perhaps it leaves none at all.","I'd had my fill of Belle & Sebastian by the time Fold Your Hands Child saw release in 2000, and ...

Blackberry Belle,Twilight Singers,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8469d034d5c69bf39e1/1:1/w_160/d5dcf6d5.gif,2004-01-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8211-blackberry-belle/,One Little Indian,"There are few artists who can make self-loathing sound as arrogant or overconfident as Greg Dulli does, and chances are, he knows it. Over the course of his almost two-decade-long career, the former Afghan Whigs guru and current Twilight Singers mastermind has rarely deviated from the oversexed, drugged-out rock 'n' soul persona to which he so aggressively plays. Less a gimmick than a stylistic trait, his image and thematic technique has served him well: Congregation, Black Love, and the certifiable indie classic Gentlemen aren't just the sound of harrowing confessionals set against searing, stabbing guitar abuse and distorted squall, but also of a man at the top of his game achieving what he'd set out to accomplish from the very start: make brilliant rock records. Though he basically perfected his volatile blend of bar-table theatrics, melodramatic soul pomp, and Jaggerian rock swagger his first day on the job, it isn't necessarily such a bad thing that Dulli hasn't exactly been pushing the creative envelope of late. In fact, Dulli's music tends to suffer more from experimentation. In 2000, after six albums and fourteen years of Afghan Whigs, he conceived the Twilight Singers, a side project whose revolving lineup of diverse musicians was recruited as a means of freeing him from the confines of his identity as The Afghan Whigs' seething, dejected crowned prince. However, their unrelentingly demure debut, Twilight, proved Dulli's frothy croon is better suited to roaring accompaniment that can match the intensity of his cutting delivery. Thankfully, this kind of debauched, emotive overload makes a return on the Twilight Singers' latest, Blackberry Belle. There are moments on this record in which Dulli's band-- featuring guest spots by everyone from Prince protégé Apollonia, to That Dog alumna Petra Haden, to ex-Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan-- flawlessly recreates the vibe of the Whigs' heyday. Album highlight ""Teenage Wristband"" is a piano-driven cocktail of self-destruction, showcasing Dulli's penchant for rock bombast and spite-driven vocal histrionics. Even ethereal female background vocals from Apollonia and Haden can't cool Dulli down, as he menacingly coos, ""You wanna go for a riiiide?/ I got sixteen hours to burn and I wanna stay up all niiiighht."" ""The Killer"" also marks Dulli's most soulful performance in years; over a suave 2am groove and a wash of electric guitar fuzz, he urgently confesses, ""I caught a fever/ A holy fire/ 'Til I was crawling on the ceiling. Blackberry Belle is also injected with Dulli's trademark flair for concept; the record kicks off with the part-dirge/part-rocker ""Martin Eden"", which pays tribute to the Jack London novel that chronicles the exploits of a writer who commits suicide after being exposed to the pressures of fame (there's also a quote from the book in the liner notes, as well). But in standard Dulli fashion, the record's strongest trait is his cunning lyrics, which seem more overtly personal here than ever. This heightened sense of intimacy allows the delivery of lyrics like, ""Let me bleed/ For God has come to play/ So play me,"" to seem unusually convincing."" However, for all of Dulli's fantasies of martyrdom, his songs never come off as unrelentingly dark as his lyrics. Unlike the Twilight Singers' debut, Dulli's collaborators on Blackberry Belle most frequently serve as sublime accompaniment for his consummate showmanship. ""Esta Noche""'s proclamations of ""neverlasting love"" conclude in a rousing coda of spirited horn accompaniment, courtesy of session pros Kamasi Washington, Josh Lampkins and Chris Gray, while Dulli's taunts serve as a careful counterpoint to Jon Skibic's impassioned banjo playing on the stirring acoustic ballad ""Papillion"". Additionally, producer Mike Napolitano lends the record a cavernous, gothic ambiance that nicely enhances Dulli's moody musings. Given this context, it's of little surprise that Blackberry Belle's finest moment comes in the form of the Mark Lanegan duet that serves as the record's closer, ""Number Nine"". The track is a stumbling slow-motion dirge in which Petra Haden's longing violin notes entangle with Richard Ford's melting pedal steel lines, and the reverberating melancholy of Hammond Organ chords soothe Lanegan's trembling, gravelly basso as he sings Dulli's ravaged lyrics: ""You trouble me, and I ain't myself anymore/ I'm crawling around like a whore."" Whereas the guest vocalists on the Twilight Singers' debut, never seemed quite as inspired as Dulli, Lanegan's mercurial turn makes all the difference here, beautifully contrasting Dulli's wavering falsetto. It makes for what is not only the most moving moment on Blackberry Belle, but also one of the sublime highlights of Dulli's entire career. Ultimately, Blackberry Belle comes to serve as a rather inconspicuous career-defining moment for Greg Dulli; most songwriters who abandon their main gig to embark on solo ventures fail at recreating any of their previously recorded magic. That Dulli, with more than three years gone since separating from the Whigs and one solo flop already behind him, has regained his footing with an album of this caliber now separates him from any number of alternarock has-beens and reclaims his relative worth as an indie rock should-be.","There are few artists who can make self-loathing sound as arrogant or overconfident as Greg Dulli does,\n\ and chances ...

Blurred July EP,Caural,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5555e6ef95969320a9d/1:1/w_160/7aaf4e27.gif,2004-01-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1353-blurred-july-ep/,Chocolate Ind.,"A graduate of Chocolate Industries' eclectic Urban Renewal Program, Caural (aka Chicago multi-instrumentalist Zachary Mastoon) offers all sorts of mixed signifiers on the Blurred July EP, his miniature follow-up to last year's full-length debut, Stars on My Ceiling. Falling somewhere between lite-jazz, TNT-era Tortoise, Four Tet incidentalism, and aesthetically correct elevator chops, Blurred July includes three post-rock/hip-hop instrumentals, plus one slightly raucous vocal jam presided over by labelmate Diverse. Despite his knack for post-rock pastiche, Caural remains difficult to pin down. A recent piece he contribute to Dusted Magazine mentions Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein, Minor Threat's Complete Discography, the sheen of Slowdive and MBV, and Mille Plateaux's experimental ambient works as important musical building blocks. Blurred July, decorated by UK graffiti artist/MC Kid Acne (of Toah Dynamic), evokes old-school hip-hop commingling with underground comic books, Saturday morning cartoons and electronica-minded Flash sites. Or, though you may never see these masterminds in one sentence again, imagine the teeming gentleness of Nobukazu Takemura's Child & Magic revamped and expanded to include the moodier, noir moments of Glenn Frey's ""You Belong to the City"". Further complicating the catch phraseology, Mastoon gets all literary on us. If you've read Haruki Murakami's The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, the opening track ""Goodbye May Kasahara"" offers additional resonance. Begin by peeling back the Rhodes and pay especial attention to anything vaguely reminiscent of Murakami's mysterious and charming teenage character, May Kasahara. Maybe her unread letters, slight limp, beloved duck people. Nothing. If you take a step back, ""Goodbye, May Kasahara"" (note the comma) is the last sentence spoken by The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle's main character, Toru Okada (aka Mr. Wind-Up Bird). He's said it a couple of times, but at narrative's end, it's an unwilling renunciation of a more childlike path in life, a world of lemon drops, back-porch crushes and nervous kisses. Instead, Okada walks headfirst into a crumbling marriage, solitary ruminations, duty, adulthood's various shades of grey. I admire the romantic spirit. Though ""Goodbye May Kasahara"" doesn't capture the importance of this subtle departing sentiment, it is a pretty track. Beginning with fractured percussion enveloped by applause (and then more interspersed, pronounced handclaps), the song's accented by vibes, brushed snare, rattling shakers, vocal sighs, the strains of mechanization. Things pick up with a more pronounced drumbeat, the repetition of hi-hat, bass swells. I'd compare it to Susumu Yokota's ""Sky Blue"" or mention the acoustic/analog/synth vibe of Max Tundra's Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be without as many dips, shifts or sways. And then where? The second track, ""Blacktops and Plains"", confuses its forefather's easy-listening sleepwalk with Diverse's casually smooth, scattershot one-liners. An even more syrupy Jay-Z in love with fifty-cent words, he delivers his spiel over a busted-up and distorted drum track. The real charm's his laidback, mumbled chorus: ""Tryin' to open up your blacktops and plains."" Back on the original path, ""Visuals"" is a feast of rain stick, electronics, cymbal reverb, soft percussion and backwards dissolves. Caural samples a girl's voice and spits it back out in a leisurely, well-spaced loop. Yeah, digital-age Rod McKuen. Or a more structured, poppy take on Fennesz's ""Paint It Black"". Or Lali Puna veering onto an anonymous German countryside. The finale, ""Sipping Snake Blood Wine (Savath & Savalas Remix)"" is the Scott Herren remix of a track that first appeared on Stars on My Ceiling. This version removes the hectic sloppy kiss drumming of the original (it always reminded me of a cardboard 2x4) and replaces it with a sleepier percussive track. On the whole, the remix is cleaner than the original, jibing well with the other compositions. All this to say: okay, I'm not sure how to label Caural. In some ways, Blurred July's nothing more than another installment of trip-hop built-on Grade A influences, but Mastoon pursues his craft with enough creativity and smarts that, instead of spending time being dismissive, I'm just wondering where he plans to go next.","A graduate of Chocolate Industries' eclectic Urban Renewal Program, Caural (aka Chicago multi-instrumentalist Zachary Mastoon) offers all sorts of mixed ...

The Bluegrazer Album,Bluegrazer,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a448ea9e61561daa4e88/1:1/w_160/23e43d28.gif,2004-01-14 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1099-the-bluegrazer-album/,Local 33 1/3,"It's easy to underestimate the effect that motive has on the way a record turns out. Some set out to make a masterpiece, others to explore new sounds, and still others can't help reacting to newfound success, either by attempting to prove it wasn't a fluke or striving to distance themselves from the formula that brought them that success. And then there are those rare albums that develop organically from weekends spent casually recording with friends, miles from spotlights, with virtually no pressure or expectations to deliver. It's tough for an established band to make an album like this, simply because scrutiny colors everything a veteran band does, but hundreds if not thousands of ultra-obscure garage bands (and I'm not talking about well-funded, Detroit-aping Swedes here) across the country patch together inspired records simply by accident every year. If ever an album fit that description, it's this one, the grab-bag debut from Boston's Bluegrazer, which could probably be referred to as a side-project of Hip Tanaka's Joe Pleiman if that band weren't so ridiculously obscure themselves. So there's nothing for these guys to lose for trying everything, and try everything they do, piecing together a full CD of scattered ideas, wacky pop songs and assorted fits of lunacy, complete with a sort-of-tribute to They Might Be Giants' ""Fingertips"" concept, which comprised about 20 short snippets of music that spiced up their Apollo 18 album when you set your player to ""random."" Pleiman openly admits that the Johns' influenced his approach, though the Brooklyn-based duo only informs his actual sound very slightly. Truthfully, the 26 tracks on the album are about as focused as a Jackson Pollack painting, some of them sounding like they were banged out from conception to what you're hearing in about a half hour; others, like ""Turn It Over"", with its delay-drenched, angelic refrain and dry, aggressive verses, obviously took a lot of thought and post-production tinkering. There's total fluff like ""Jam On"", a hooky indie rock two-step that's so casually ingratiating you won't even notice how sticky it is until you're singing it in the car two days later, and über-oddities like ""Brendan Smith"", which is basically instrumental Wesley Willis, a bleepy Casio jam that seems designed purely to amuse. And then there's ""Word"", a great process piece that features a nasty fuzz bass and some surprisingly solid beats behind a collage of one-word answering machine messages Pleiman had his friends leave him. You get over-eager participants yelling things like ""Schmoopies!"" and more low-key offerings like ""verisimilitude,"" ""Netherlands,"" ""moist"", and, perhaps most tellingly, ""fingertips,"" but it's the way the music reacts to what's being said that makes it more than just a novel idea. Of course, amidst all the faux-country trucker songs, wistful folk tunes cropping up out of nowhere, and spiky, extemporaneous pop songs, it's really easy for a quietly fantastic song like ""Sister Sue"", with its flypaper melody and great off-the-cuff harmonies, to get lost, or at least hidden, in the shuffle. And that's really the biggest criticism you can level at The Bluegrazer Album. It's all over the place, and in its wanderings, it occasionally steps in something unpleasant or surrounds a great song with two pretty mediocre ones. Still, for all its unevenness, this album is about as much fun as you can have in 73 minutes without resorting to substance abuse.","It's easy to underestimate the effect that motive has on the way a record turns out.

To Live,Martin Rev,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f213d197565213899d/1:1/w_160/36408066.jpg,2004-01-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6904-to-live/,File-13,"The only reason to buy this record is to remix it. After his recent reunion with Alan Vega on 2002's American Supreme, Suicide's behind-the-boards man, Martin Rev, offers thirteen new tracks in search of songcraft. Since Rev is the funny old uncle of electroclash, who probably wears his shades in the shower and sleeps in leather bedsheets, To Live obviously has no difficulty sounding cool: his production is a physical assault, the music marching through what sounds like Boeing's biggest wind tunnel. In fact, playing it on cheap, tinny speakers seems to enhance it: all the colors bleed out to leave a violent, blaring grey of guitars and drum machines that loop in hammers through each song, too rusty to be industrial and too open-air to pass for tidy dance music. Except the final product is never a ""song."" Rev eschews choruses and bridges, which would be a fair enough approach if the verses consisted of something other than just breathy, inexpressive whispers. He muffles the lyrics so much that sometimes you can only make out the first few words: for one example, ""Places I Go"" goes, ""Places I go/ [mumble mumble]/ [Something] I [something]/ whsssssssss."" It's astounding to think what Rev could have had if only he'd brought a few decent vocalists in on the project to work off the beats, or replace the frankly vacuous lyrics, or to just give the record a focal point. As it stands, it's hard to imagine a bigger waste of great backing tracks. If you could break up the monotony that each of these tracks quickly and effortlessly slips into, you'd have amazing productions: each track starts off like a slap in the face, from the overdriven lounge music of ""Gutter Rock"" to ""Search for Stone""'s lithe keyboard hook. The roiling vibes on ""Jaded"" are spacy yet smooth, and the fuzzy-noise keyboard instrumental ""Shimmer"" evokes the feeling of having the wax removed from your ears and then plugged back in again. Suicide and Martin Rev fans could eat this up if they hone in on the good parts, but it's hard to guess why Rev considered these songs complete. To Live sounds like a workbook, full of half-formed ideas and tracks that show incredible potential if fleshed out. Unfortunately, even as a solo statement it offers few clues to Rev's vision beyond his bluntest, most consistent aesthetic preferences: the range of ideas is as limited as the sound palette, and Rev's still hiding behind the sunglasses.","The only reason to buy this record is to remix it.

Track: Array,Iven Schmidt,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63b13d1975652139131/1:1/w_160/81e5fe3c.gif,2004-01-13 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7709-track-array/,Ware,"With the high quality of electronic music of every conceivable ilk streaming from German factories like so many automobiles and methamphetamines, the sometimes unknown names of many of its purveyors can often be cavalierly bypassed on the strength of their labels' reputations alone. Stalwarts like Mike Ink's Profan, Stefan Betke's ~scape, and Peter Rehberg's Mego are no-brainers, the label identities as one with their masters' renowned monikers. The Ware label has quickly been building a solid reputation of its own, having issued a string of remarkable and consistent long-players over the past year. Markus Guentner's Audio Island was a song-based house epic; Coloma contrived poppy clicks of mod-glitch with astounding wordplay that absolutely shamed The Postal Service. And now Iven Schmidt's debut is before me, more rubbery in its dance-steps than its brethren-- and more club-oriented-- but no less catchy. Built around three previous Ware singles, the eleven tracks here stay uptempo. While not the first to explicitly craft a record around the concept of driving (or highways, or autobahns), Schmidt conjures up the sleek German design of today by hotwiring its primitive arcade heart and making a driving game out of it. ""Quest for Tires"" starts off like the Commodore 64's classic Night Driver game, all simple white dashes on a black screen before the bass and distorted patches shift up into something more akin to Pole Position-- the pulses and accompanying clicks seem almost kinetic as the track makes hairpin turns and musses up digitized hairdos. ""Digital Sun"" is a quarter-eater, too. With a bass like glycerin drops on a trampoline, Schmidt keeps his keys in a twitchy mode, flicking pings across the ears before breaking it all down into a distorted Nintendo ditty bouncing like Donkey Kong barrels. While ""Pocket Hero"" may be the track built from assorted Game Boy sounds, ""LSR"" is most gamey, combining canned handclaps with Mario fireballs and jump-blips. And if the classic arcade sentiments weren't conveyed already, ""Moon Patrol"" revitalizes that craggy, horizontal-scrolling shooter of yore with stun-synths and vocoded commands. Built from a crisp house beat, ""M Track"" drops in snips of distorted scratches until its breakdown reveals the crunching noises to be the edge of a biting melodic line. It stutters to a stop before bouncing back even harder with little pings darting out like Frogger in the tempered traffic of Model 500-type racecars and trucks. The cut-up vocals of ""Tanzmaschine"" are bit too distracting at the end of the disc, but it's the only speed bump on an otherwise thrilling ride through a very crowded and vibrant urban scene.","With the high quality of electronic music of every conceivable ilk streaming from German factories like so many automobiles and ...

Sky Meadows,The Pearlfishers,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1689d034d5c69bf295a/1:1/w_160/7e6474d9.jpg,2004-01-13 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6527-sky-meadows/,Marina,"This is the sound of a nice guy finishing last. David Scott, the unassuming core of Scottish pop outfit The Pearlfishers, has this nice guy thing honed to a fine, fine point. Which, to be direct, he should, considering that he's been playing the angle since 1984, when he recorded his first demos under the ill-advised moniker Chewy Raccoon. Scott obviously spends a lot of time soaking up Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson and Beatles (his website lists eight Paul McCartney solo records amongst his nineteen favorite albums), as every aspect of his music-- from the syrupy horns and willowy strings to the quasi-jazz chord changes and snatches of harmony vocals-- screams their influence. But if Scott doesn't possess the naturally appealing voice of many of his heroes, he at least gets by on a reedy tenor and enthusiasm. For Sky Meadows, he's joined by a small orchestra of collaborators. It's much the same setup he employed on 2001's Across the Milky Way, and to a similar result, coating each track in a thick lather of baroque instrumentation. The overall effect, though, is less a channeling of Scott Walker and The Beach Boys than some bizarre midpoint between John Sebastian's ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" theme and Mike Post's ""Hill Street Blues"" soundtracks, a too-polite concoction of inflated orch-pop perhaps best referred to as doormat-rock. A guy like Joe Pernice can get away with piling on the sugar like this because his songs are taut and tension-packed, but Scott's melodies and lyrics are too nondescript, and can't fully support the breezy sentimentality of the music without allowing at least some of it melt away into so much fey mush. I could swear I heard ""Todd is God"" on my last trip to the dentist. Still, a case could be made that The Pearlfishers are just occupying the niche left vacant by Prefab Sprout in the early 90s, and that such inoffensive indie pop still has its place in the world-- a case I'm not inclined to argue against. Plenty of people will find a lot to enjoy in this little ray of sunshine, even if it's not the masterpiece it wants to be. ""My Dad the Weatherfan"" is a fine song, for example-- perhaps the best The Pearlfishers have ever served up; with the same kind of bounding rhythm and bubbly piano that made Mull Historical Society's ""Watching Xanadu"" such a fun trip back to 70s A.M. and a unique lyrical narrative about a son admiring the accuracy of his father's meteorological predictions, it's the kind of bubblegum that doesn't lose its flavor on impact, and it's the song most likely to stick with you when the album's over. Unfortunately, nothing else reaches that height-- though I should note that there's really no notable low point, either. When closer ""Say Goodbye to the Fairground"" takes you out on a velvety-smooth ride through Kinksy nostalgia and hazy-eyed reflection, with the whole crew joining in for one last chorus, the sense of community and warmth pretty perfectly closes the book on this collection of songs. It also makes me feel awful for saying anything bad about The Pearlfishers. The reality, though, is that only hardest-core fans of breeze-blown orchestral pop will have any interest in checking this record out-- it's not the one to win any new converts for an already well-plied genre.","This is the sound of a nice guy finishing last.

Pose a Question,L.A. Carnival,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc35e6ef9596932311d/1:1/w_160/8ed3afc2.jpg,2004-01-13 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4957-pose-a-question/,Now AgainNow Again,"Does there exist a substratum of the musical elite more hermetic than hip-hop's own brand of nomad, the cratedigger? Equal parts obsessive, archivist, collector and artist, the cratedigger's life-consuming quest for the perfect breakbeat(s) magically transforms one's local Yellow Pages into a record collector's Holy Grail; while an individual's basement can be a vinyl-addict's utopia where time-forgotten funk manna patiently awaits discovery. The collectors are notoriously obsessive, eternally flipping through abandoned boxes to locate (and mine the fuck out of) that one brilliant twelve-second clip. And then there are folks like those mad Los Angelino B-boys behind Stones Throw Records-- namely Peanut Butter Wolf, Madlib, and Egon-- for whom sampling isn't enough: these guys actually go to the trouble of remastering and releasing these out-of-print obscurities on compact disc in what could only be described as a deranged act of beat-crazed taboo. Stones Throw has been opening hip-hop listeners' blunt-addled minds for some time now; stretching the conceptions of ""digging"" culture seems only a natural progression for the marquee label. Any single track off of 2001's archivist funk odyssey, The Funky 16 Corners, could be considered a proverbial wet-dream for DJs far and wide. And last year's reissue of Stark Reality's Now, through its solid selection of proto-funk grooves, not only exposed the blueprint for Madlib's trademark love affair with the vibes, but also saved plenty of sample-hungry tastemakers from shelling out hundreds on eBay for the über-rare vinyl original. The strongest of these inspired reissues yet, however, is the unabashedly multi-racial, Omaha-bred mutt-funk troupe The L.A. Carnival's early 70s release, Pose a Question. That the band's frontman, drummer and chief songwriter Lester Abrams is not a legendary icon of American funk is probably due somewhat to locale: raised in the racially segregated Omaha of the 60s with roots in both Native and Black American cultures, Abrams' music is imbued with a distinctly American conflation of funk, jazz and soul that drops overtly political overtones atop feverish, percussion-heavy grooves. Abrams' incendiary drum lines steal the show on almost every number; cymbals swing effortlessly as barrages of snare hits frenetically pop like ricocheting pinballs. What comes to identify Pose a Question, though, is Abrams' method of channeling his multi-ethnic American heritage through the genre-defying exuberance of his tunes. By having such movement within each number and throughout the sequence of the entire record (""Blind Man"" is straight Motown Soul, while ""Ron's Tune"" is a bossa-funk chill-out), The L.A. Carnival flaunt their diversity; the ultimate act of aesthetic revolt in the face of a black-and-white America clinging to its ideological labels and racial stereotypes. On the album's opener, ""Flyin'"", Ron Cooley's wiry guitar licks melt over a steady laconic funk bop, while Rick Chudacoff's electric bass notes pounce on the off beats before the chorus breaks in with the calming soul twinkle of a Rhodes piano motif. While on the album's showstopper, ""7 Step to Nowhere"", rolling percussion and jerky guitar chords hold the awkward 7/4 time signature together, only for the inherent calm of a lone jazz sax solo to cool-out the bridge section. While the arrangements on Pose a Question should undoubtedly break smiles across DJs' faces and get funk fanatics' heads' nodding, the lyrical content of most of these numbers sounds irrepressibly derivative of 60s idealism. In an age where even irony is coming under the gun, it's hard to take a song titled ""We Need Peace and Love"" seriously-- particularly when those are the number's only lyrics. Furthermore, the album's title track, with lyrics about the black ""brotha man,"" and laughably simplistic questions like, ""Can we all live together one by one,"" seem rather banal when heard in today's context. Of course, you can't fault a record for sounding like a product of its time (even if you can champion one that was ahead of it), and The L.A. Carnival's sweet-as-can-be, three-part vocal harmonies (courtesy of Leslie Smith, Arno Lucas and Abrams) generally help the revolution go down easy for even the most jaded listener.","Does there exist a substratum of the musical elite more hermetic than hip-hop's own brand of nomad, the\n ...

Heron King Blues,Califone,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e113d1975652138dfc/1:1/w_160/afacfc43.jpg,2004-01-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1243-heron-king-blues/,Thrill Jockey,"Inevitably, at some point in late summer, the landscape becomes vaguely obscene: August air gets thick and throbbing, heavy with a richness that's almost menacing. The sun hovers, uncomfortably plump. Lawn crickets yawn and twitter in double speed, their collective whispers slowly spinning into a single, disembodied howl. Everything else turns way too green. Listening to Califone's sweaty, blues-heavy scrap-rock is not an entirely dissimilar sensory experience: devious, fertile, and dangerously pretty, Califone records sound as futuristic as they do ancient, and as familiar as they do strange. With loops dredged from riverbeds and vocals rolled in salt, Califone spew a hoarse mix of synthesized sounds, sweeping guitars, and bizarre, snickering percussion, an enigmatic mix of real and imagined sounds. The band's latest, Heron King Blues, is no less curious-- it's impossible to tell if the record's echoing pings were tapped out on drums, programmed into laptops, or snatched from a dripping basement sink, each gleaming, viscous plop caught, unknowingly, on tape. Thus, the serendipity of Califone: the accidental orchestration, the mysterious creaks, the bits of poetry, the eerie omnipresence, the perfect, unnamable noise. Although not exactly a concept album, Heron King Blues was inspired, at least tangentially, by frontman Tim Rutili's recurring dream about a half-man, half-bird creature (check the freaked-out cover art), and brought into gritty fruition on the heels of Rutili's subsequent epiphany: the character his subconscious had (presumably) spun from nothing boasted inexplicable roots in ancient Druid legend. The story, as Rutili tells it, goes like this: a mischievous band of Roman soldiers discovered, in the final days of an otherwise pitiful siege against England, that their enemy lived in perpetual fear of a half-man, half-bird creature known as the Heron King. Hoisting a Roman solider onto stilts and slapping a heron mask over his face, the Romans sent a tipsy Heron King decoy careening into the middle of a British camp, watching as lines of English soldiers scurried off in terror. There are other Heron King fables circulating, and loads of half-man, half-bird deities nesting snug in leather-bound history books, but the actual circumstances of the King's story are mostly irrelevant: what matters is that Heron King Blues is possessed by the same kind of sweeping, metaphysical realization that goes hand-in-hand with discovering that you are, in fact, dreaming legends. The resulting album is haunting, nervous, and shaking with catharsis. On Califone's last studio LP, 2003's Quicksand/Cradlesnakes, Rutili and longtime percussionist Ben Massarella were joined by guitarist Jim Becker and drummer Joe Adamik, exchanging their revolving lineup (previous guests included former Red Red Meat percussionist Brian Deck, Fruit Bats Eric Johnson and Gillian Lisee, and Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo) for a more static stable of players. Now returning as a four-piece, Heron King Blues reflects the efforts of a tight, cohesive unit, despite the band's admission that most of the songs were improvised (see also Deceleration One and Deceleration Two) or written in the studio. With Califone's penchant for extemporaneous creation finally being properly indulged, Heron King Blues is an appropriately loose and sprawling record, requiring a bit more patience than some of the band's previous projects. Still, its weight is majestic. Opener ""Wingbone"" stacks gaping guitar and backroom percussion like bricks, building a spare wall of sad, groaning sounds. Rutili's careful vocal melody is what ultimately carries ""Wingbone"", his soft, throaty promises somehow both desperate and vacant; when Rutili gently mumbles, ""Fill my belly with your whispering,"" it's obvious that he could be speaking directly to his own songs. Inching close to eight minutes long, ""Sawtooth Sung a Cheater's Song"" is near-epic in scope, swinging from dusty country blues to sweeping orchestral laments, while the backwards disco-funk of ""Two Sisters Drunk on Each Other"" carries along a small army of drum machines, bleating elephant-horns, pump organ, keyboards, loops and squawking guitars. Individually, these songs may flutter from style to style, but each of Heron King's seven (eight counting an uncredited outro) tracks perfectly embody Rutili's increasingly perverse sense of self-discovery. If you pump Califone through a decent pair of headphones, it's alarmingly easy to synchronize your body to their songs: inhalations become bowed strings, heartbeats mimic steady, muted drums. It's the idea of being over-alive, too tuned in to the blood and gore of the universe. Sweltering and beautiful, Heron King Blues is a triumphant exploration of quiet excess.","Inevitably, at some point in late summer, the landscape becomes vaguely obscene: August air gets thick and throbbing, heavy with ...

Run into Flowers EP / 0078h EP,M83,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdfdeb335119a49ecfc7/1:1/w_160/a47ab710.jpg,2004-01-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11775-run-into-flowers-ep-0078h-ep/,Gooom,"As a subject for reinterpretation, the music of M83 presents a unique set of challenges. While many of M83's electronic contemporaries manipulate discrete, compartmentalized units of sound, M83 craft music that could most easily be categorized as monolithic-- sizzling walls of noise sculpted into moving, memorable songs. Where so many electronic musicians are content to simply create atmosphere or bring conceptual experiments to life, the songs are as integral to M83's music as the sounds that inhabit them-- in fact, the two often seem inexorably linked. Because of this symbiosis, reworking an M83 song, whether by cover or remix, would seem a difficult undertaking. In the wake of their epic Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, M83 have released these two singles, each of which is backed by a handful of reinterpreted tracks from the album. The single release for ""Run into Flowers"", the standout track from that album, is accompanied here by three distinctive and diverse remixes, while the ""0078h"" single takes a less traditional route, offering a live version of the album track ""Gone"", as well as a cover of ""In Church"" by M83 labelmates Cyann & Ben. None of these come close to surpassing the originals, of course, but each constitutes an artful, considerate and revealing take on the source material. By far the most accessible track on Dead Cities, ""Run into Flowers"" stands as the obvious choice for first single. A perfect representation of M83's strengths, the song is remarkable for both its intensity and its tenderness. Its hushed vocals, juxtaposed with glorious swells of digital strings, are the beating heart of Dead Cities, providing a locus of humanity amidst the album's surprisingly wrenching synthesized arrangements. By contrast, the song's remixes seem rather ordinary; in two out of three cases, the ostensibly shoegazey tendencies of the original are eschewed in favor of a more familiar beats-and-cuts aesthetic. French glitch-hop crew Abstrackt Keal Agram chop the vast and impenetrable ""Run into Flowers"" into more manageable pieces before fitting it with a sturdy backbeat and some additional vocal flourishes. The shift to a more straightforward rhythm robs the original of much of its unrelenting vibrancy, but the remixers wisely build to a surging crescendo, recasting the song's vocals as a disembodied mantra. Jackson's ""Midnight Fuck Remix"" is the most playful to be found here, projecting subtle micro-house manipulations atop the song's buzzing synth background. Kg's ""Ig Farbenvorschlag Remix"", meanwhile, adds swirling drums, guitars and white noise to the already dense original, but otherwise leaves the structure largely intact. The ""0078h"" single offers two subtler reinterpretations. A concert version of ""Gone"", replete with live drumming and haunting electric guitar, demonstrates that M83 have as much in common with crescendo-rockers like Explosions in the Sky as they do with their electronic contemporaries. The cover of ""In Church"" from M83's psych-folk labelmates Cyann & Ben replaces the overbearing atmosphere of the original with a more stately, vaguely baroque arrangement. The dramatic shifts in texture and dynamics that marked the original are replaced here by haunting, reverb-laden vocals and fragile plucked acoustic guitars. While not nearly as powerful as M83's version, Cyann & Ben's rendition of ""In Church"" is as different in effect as it is in aesthetic, and certainly a worthwhile and interesting B-side. There's not a dud to be found on either of these singles, but perhaps unsurprisingly, there's nothing really essential, either. One of M83's greatest strengths is the unflinching intensity they bring to their music-- in the interest of reinventing it, that intensity can't help but be disrupted. Those who are madly in love with this group should find these recast textures and reconfigured songs engaging, if not revelatory of hidden subtleties. If nothing else, these two singles prove without a doubt that M83 have found something all their own-- something too unique and stunning to be effaced by even the most dramatic interpretation.","

7,Philip Jeck,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09213d19756521383ff/1:1/w_160/748628db.jpg,2004-01-13 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4227-7/,Touch,"The inside cover of Philip Jeck's seventh solo album (typically great Jon Wozencroft design) contains a nice quote from critic Mort Goode: ""Johnny Mathis advances the art of remembering."" I don't hear Mathis on 7 (though he could be here somewhere-- with Jeck you never know) but I imagine these words appear because The Art of Remembering would be a great title for a Philip Jeck album. For most of the 20th Century, the phonograph record was the primary time-based storage medium. You could buy pre-made 8mm and 16mm reels, but home films never had the market penetration of recorded sound. Music, speeches, plays, sound effects, sporting events, even film storylines were preserved and sold on records. The vinyl record was one of the primary devices for storing culture's collective memory. Hundreds of millions of these fragments were strewn all around the world. What happened to all these chunks of data? Most decayed or were rendered obsolete and were tossed out, but plenty are still in circulation, and a good number of them wound up in Philip Jeck's record collection. Jeck makes music by playing, mixing and processing vinyl records (mostly obscure ones), and on 7, he reflects our memories back to us in a profound and terribly exciting way. Here, Jeck is at the peak of his creative powers. The first track ""Wholesome"" shows how damn pretty Jeck can sound when so inclined. You expect pieces built from old manipulated vinyl and loops to be prickly with a disturbing undercurrent, but ""Wholesome"", which isolates, stretches and repeats a Disneyfied swirl of night sky strings and impressionistic piano plinks, is like a flower in perpetual bloom. It gets distorted and blacker toward the end when Jeck rolls off the treble completely, but that's just the sun setting and, like e.e. cummings said, if it has to happen, this is a beautiful way. ""Wipe"" is just as lovely with a different feel, distant and lonely instead of warm and welcoming. It reminds me of Experimental Audio Research circa ""Tribute to John Cage in CAG*E"", music for drifting slow through space, a cold drone echoing in an asteroid's cave. ""Now You Can Let Go"" is where Jeck robs the memory bank for identifiable fragments. He turns crackly loops of locomotive chugs into percussion, pushes corny three-note jazz phrases nicked from a Steamboat Willie short into a dub chamber, and keeps a recording of a lathe humming along to bind it all into a singular sound machine. ""Some Pennies"" is doubly referential, as the ghostly bass ostinato looping through was also the central element of (the even more powerful) ""Vinyl Coda I"", recorded in 1999. It's an ominous piece of music, but somehow never threatens; despite its bleak overtone, ""Some Pennies"" is subtle and invites intimate observation. You want to inch closer and pick the piece apart, each layer of sound folded inside, a world within a world. I like to think of ""Bush Hum"" as a reference to our president and the violence that's accompanied his term in office, though the sleeve notes indicate that the sole sound source for the track is the ungrounded hum of a Bush turntable run through a delay pedal. Still, the abrasive, atonal buzz generated by Jeck's processed electrical circuit could stand in for the sounds of war. An atypical track for a man whose music always incorporates the friction of the physical, ""Bush Hum"" is nonetheless very effective. Closing the album is the 10-minute veil, a slowly evolving rumble of Wagnerian strings, the symphonic loops of Zauberberg Gas without the kickdrum. How did Johnny Mathis say it in 1957? Oh yeah, ""Wonderful! Wonderful!"" ","The inside cover of Philip Jeck's seventh solo album (typically great Jon Wozencroft design) contains a nice quote from ...

5 Easy Pieces,Scott Walker,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa885e6ef959693215dd/1:1/w_160/ebbb3ee7.jpg,2004-01-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8763-5-easy-pieces/,Interscope,"Anthologizing Scott Walker's career is a daunting task. Along with Walker, perhaps only The Beatles, Roxy Music, John Cale and David Bowie have engulfed themselves in both art and pop and created such riches in each vein. Incredibly, Walker swung much further in each direction than any of those other artists, singing standards (and other housewives' choices) on a TV variety show, and creating famously impenetrable, esoteric work on his most recent (a loosely used term here, to be sure) solo albums. Therefore, the first challenge of any examination of his career demands rectifying the split between his more populist and cerebral impulses. Happily, the five-disc, 93-track 5 Easy Pieces rises to the challenge, capturing the on-the-surface duality between Walker's MOR song styling and his avant-garde leanings, as well as demonstrating the common ground shared by everything he did in between. Born Scott Engel in Ohio, Walker was one-third of The Walker Brothers, a group of ex-pats sold back to America as the crooner arm of the British Invasion, but it was in the UK that The Walker Brothers had the most success, enjoying a pair of #1 singles and rivaling The Beatles, Stones, and Monkees as the biggest-selling band of the mid-1960s. (Conversely, their U.S. run consisted of just two top 20 singles.) The group disbanded in 1967, and Walker released four solo albums over the next three years, laying his expressive and sometimes bombastic vocals over lush string and horn arrangements. More a Left Bank stylist than a Las Vegas one, Walker's earliest solo records are best characterized by bawdy, cabaret-esque Jacques Brel covers. Soon, however, Walker shifted from song interpretations to original compositions. These songs, colored by existentialist musings, overweight prostitutes, Josef Stalin, The Seventh Seal, and the Sisyphean struggles of vulnerable, damaged souls, didn't sit well with his established fanbase. The commercial failure of Walker's fourth (and best) solo album, Scott 4-- the first of his releases to feature only his own songwriting, and one criminally not represented on this box by either ""Duchess"" or ""Two Ragged Soldiers""-- dented his confidence. After 1970's 'Til the Band Comes In-- a quick follow-up split evenly between Walker originals and covers-- also tanked, Walker spent the rest of the first half of that decade returning to his balladeer roots. During this time, he hosted his own TV variety show and released five limp albums of standards, film themes, and country-tinged pop covers. When a couple of mid-70s albums by the reunited Walker Brothers did little to stir the commercial or critical pot, Walker's career seemed stranded. Yet, unexpectedly, on a third Walker Brothers comeback album, 1978's Nite Flights, Scott kicked off the second half of his career, offering four original tracks-- his first compositions in eight years. Angular pieces with opaque lyrics and elements of both Krautrock and Sheffield's burgeoning electronic scene, Walker's new work couldn't have been further from the Nashville-tinged dirges that the Brothers Mk. II had been recording. After that release, Walker drifted further into reclusion, releasing solo albums in 1984 (Climate of Hunter) and 1995 (Tilt), only recently re-surfacing to do soundtrack, songwriting, and production work for (or alongside) artists ranging from Pulp to Ute Lemper to Sonic Youth. Earlier attempts to compile Walker's career have focused either solely on The Walker Brothers or his initial solo output. Of the latter, Razor & Tie's It's Raining Today is far too Spartan and scattershot to be recommended. The UK releases were only a slightly better bet: Sings Jacques Brel and Boy Child-- which compiles the best of Walker's own writing from 1967-1970-- are merely adequate snapshots of one particular phase of Walker's career. A specialist approach was also attempted by the compilers of 5 Easy Pieces, in which each of the set's discs is arranged by theme, or ""ways into the heart of Scott Walker."" The In My Room disc collects kitchen-sink dramas and lonely howls at the moon. Where's the Girl? is subtitled Songs of Lady, Love and Loss, but as its proper title suggests, the emphasis is on ""loss."" The third disc, An American in Europe, divvies up his ruminations on his home and adopted home-- thankfully including only one of his country-rock songs. This Is How You Disappear-- despite borrowing its title from ""Patriot"", a track on CD3-- is an alternate ""greatest hits,"" focusing on Walker's later, more avant-garde releases. Finally, Scott on Screen collects his cinematic works, most notably a portion of the score he composed for Leos Carax's 1999 film Pola X. With a large number of rare and out-of-print tracks sitting alongside most of his best-known work, this is a rare collection that would appeal to both Walker devotees and novices. And with a few exceptions, each disc is arranged chronologically, demonstrating in some cases that Walker's unusual path didn't have as many sharp turns as most would think. In My Room and Where's the Girl? each feature a half-dozen of the more dark, brooding Walker Brothers tracks. It's just as well: The popular Walker Brothers songs are easily found on bargain comps, and none of them are predicative of Walker's solo career. So, for example, instead of a U.S. hit like ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"", you get that record's stronger B-side, the Drifters-like ""After the Lights Go Out"". Each of these dozen tracks-- ranging from the full-throated Wall of Sound of ""Hurting Each Other"" (a song popularized by The Guess Who!) to the bedsit lament of ""In My Room""-- is a well-selected gem. The bulk of the first two discs, however, is made up of Walker's best-known solo songs: lush, emotionally engaging ballads such as ""It's Raining Today"", ""Montague Terrace (in Blue)"", and ""The Amorous Humphrey Plugg"". Among his rarer works here are the jazz-tinged ""Joe"" and ""Time Operator"", ""Someone Who Cared""-- the slow-burning highlight of Stretch-- and the largely forgettable Esther Ofarim-voiced ""Long About Now"" from Til' the Band Comes In. Where's the Girl? also includes a pair of dramatic, sprawling 11-minute epics written for German chanteuse Ute Lemper's 2000 album Punishing Kiss (which also features compositions from Nick Cave, Neil Hannon, and Elvis Costello), each of which is rich in both ambition and nuance. An American in Europe is the most accessible of the five discs. The first half (""Europe"") is highlighted by eight mostly buoyant, sexually charged and rousing Brel covers that no doubt caused more than a few blushes when they were first released. It also boasts Walker's excellent Brelian pastiche ""The Girls from the Streets"" and the Scott 3 highlight ""Copenhagen"". The ""America"" half kicks off with the militaristic march of ""We Came Through"", and includes the delicate twang of ""Rhymes of Goodbye"", B-side ""My Way Home"", and ""Cowbells Shakin'"", the title track to The Walker Brothers' Lines, and four of the more less-then-leftfield tracks from Climate of Hunter and 1995's notoriously difficult Tilt. Speaking of ""difficult"", the gloves are off on This Is How You Disappear, which for long-time fans is perhaps the most intriguing of the discs, as it tells a fairly linear alternate history of Walker's career. The disc has a mere three songs plucked from his late-60s period: much beloved B-side ""The Plague"", ""Plastic Palace People"", and ""Boy Child"". For the most part, though, it's dominated by the most crucial tracks from his post-1970 albums: four each from The Walker Brothers' 1978 comeback Nite Flights (the only ones on that album penned by Scott), Climate of Hunter, and Tilt. Walker's vaguely Frippian/Teutonic work for Nite Flights peaks with the underrated synth-pop of ""The Electrician"", a benchmark for the late-70s Berlin fashionistas and a template for the more uncompromising post-punk electronic artists such as Cabaret Voltaire and The Human League. The Climate of Hunter tracks are even more textural and abstract, and those from Tilt can be exercises in patience and endurance for some listeners. Scott on Screen is the set's least essential collection of music, but perversely, is the most valuable to the box, as it collects seven Pola X pieces, as well as works from nine additional sources (including, oddly, the recent James Bond film The World Is Not Enough). Cherry-picking a number of excellent curios from Walker's past (including a mere one cut from career low-light ""The Moviegoer"") and mixing them with his haunting orchestral work, Scott on Screen is the disc best approached as individual tracks. Of course, a document of Walker's film work was never going to be anything but slightly clumsy when presented on one disc, and it's a tiny quibble for rescuing a number of his lesser-known and difficult-to-find (even by file-sharing standards) works. An increasingly revered figure, Scott Walker is a singular craftsmen, one of rock's few individuals to demonstrate a willingness to both embrace elements of the unfashionable and ignore prevailing trends, yet also display an acute awareness of contemporary sounds. Forgoing many of the stylistic trappings of rock, Walker has explored a broad range of Western musical styles and displayed an intellectualism that is at times subversive, hilarious, cutting and poignant. It's a slight bit odd to attempt to delve into the heart and mind of one of pop's most anomalous and enigmatic figures by examining his work-- that's an approach more often reserved for long-departed painters, sculptors or writers who created in often self-conscious ""periods."" Therefore, as an exploration of an artist's psyche, 5 Easy Pieces is incomplete at best. More importantly, however, as an exploration of this artist's career, it's endlessly rewarding, almost wholly engrossing, and long overdue.","Anthologizing Scott Walker's career is a daunting task.

Everything Without All Inclusive,Schlammpeitziger,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a373ea9e61561daa4c9d/1:1/w_160/58bade9b.jpg,2004-01-12 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7024-everything-without-all-inclusive/,Sonig,"In a new year confronted with so much intriguing technology and music, the dedication of one's life to Casio keyboards requires a preternatural convergence of insolence, foolishness, and strangely consumerist fortitude. This willful deprivation may not quite be up to the same level as the infamous Ophir Prison Marching Kazoo Band, but, in its own quiet way, it seems as momentous and dangerous a sacrifice as anything religious leaders or secular professional sacrificers have ever undertaken. Like those ascetics, such loyalty deserves our begrudging respect, and no small degree of unfair ridicule. Schlammpeitziger, as should be readily apparent right about now, is no stranger to this ambivalence. The name alone all but threatens reviewers to assume Jo Zimmermann studied music solely so his pseudonym could be insulted. Another prevalent assumption among those new to the great IDM fanclub (endearingly called Schlammpeitzigerverrückteköpfe) is that the reliance on such basic hardware (his patented ""Casionics"") will produce droll, maypole-circling, percolating bouts of paradisiacal plop-pop. And, indeed, it's typically nostalgic to the point where you run the risk of accidentally preventing your parents from conceiving you. To the vexation of all those who create altars to their Pan Sonic 10-inches, however, there's not a damn thing wrong with Zimmermann's cloyingly radiant sunshine-in-the-ice-cream-truck delicacy. Everything Without All Inclusive is Zimmermann's first full-length since 2000, although the musician has been extensively name-dropped all over popular men's magazines since the superb compilation, Collected Simplesongs of My Temporary Past. The new album does not disappoint; it also does not thrill. Nevertheless, it's probably Zimmermann's best album to date. Strangely and unconvincingly, this claim rests almost solely on the fact that this record entirely abolishes any of the faint traces of diversity on his earlier albums. The opening track's menacing buzz may suggest some broad departure, but the warm, familiar fuzzes fasten the fate of the rest of the album as comfortably as Velcro. Distanced armament, circumnavigating valves and short-circuited beat-boxing all take their place as the delicate Casio mulls on and on, to the dismay of musical provocateurs and to the slothful joy of daydreamers. The most jarring sound is the clickity-clack of a jacob's ladder. The stone-skipping beat architecture invites all sorts of geeky adjective-analopuns, but the best one has to be pseudo-biologic virogenesis: microscopic organisms scurrying around, finding a spot they can mitosimate/replicate/whatthehell for a moment, and ending their woefully short ""life""-spans in a hail of soft bio-techno-Casio-bullets. It's never chaotic, but it sounds like if you left it unsupervised for 24 hours, things might get sort of rambunctious. Even though this is undoubtedly an album about happiness, tenderness, and other out-of-date concepts, there are more than a few dark patches. He may play a Casio, but he's not always Cardinal Pollyanna's keyboardist, annoyingly saccharifying a black-hearted congregation. Okay, I lied: he typically is, but there are still those scorched brass blasts that might as well have come out of the Taxi Driver theme, and those abrasive scythes that could either be a harvest celebration or a Texas scythe massacre, um, harvest. Also, as someone who listens to breaths and wind a lot (because I can't figure out these damn headphones), I have the authority to note that Zimmermann's blustery wind (in the Winnie the Pooh sense, not the Hurricane Mitch one) is about as good as any around, finding the middle ground between Kraftwerk's ridiculous mechanics and the hyper-avant-garde's ""no-thing"" recordings. For everything that recommends Schlammpeitziger, it is inevitably and undeniably redundant music; focus is not always compulsory, nor even possible. And the middle third reeks of mediocrity or worse: poor man's Atari music, bluntly stupid opera, creaking floorboards, overly derivative house, etc. The fifth track is flat-out, hard-lined nauseating for people that don't spend every waking minute at Disneyland. But the majority of the album is more of the same for people who enjoy that sort of thing: a harmless, even lovely, pleasure that may not exemplify standing-ovation genius anytime soon, but manages to easily and efficiently make comfortable, yet often complex, pop.","In a new year confronted with so much intriguing technology and music, the dedication of one's life to Casio ...

Introducing the Sounds of The Husbands,Husbands,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c14d5e6ef959693236a2/1:1/w_160/28e634eb.jpg,2004-01-12 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3971-introducing-the-sounds-of-the-husbands/,Swami,"A high percentage of 60s garage-rock bands probably could have done everyone a favor and stayed there. In the garage, I mean (very few of them managed to escape the 60s). Not many of these guys' ambitions ever exceeded the primal desire that coursed through the veins of our hairiest, most slope-browed ancestors-- the desire (of course) to rock-- and it's hard to fault someone for genetic predisposition. Some of these bands, like The Seeds, The Barbarians, The Godz, or The Sonics even wormed their way back onto hipster entrance exams as soon as someone accidentally mistook The Strokes' New York lofts for carholes. Certainly, the unbearably dirty, blues-infected sound of the 60s garage movement often made for incredible rock 'n' roll, but in the end, the sheer paucity of musical ideas at its core all but ensured two things: The vast majority of the bands, outside of a few select singles, sounded virtually identical. Rock was still in its infancy, and so most of these teenagers were drawing from the same exceedingly shallow pool of influences-- the founding fathers (Berry, Holly, etc.) and blues roots-- and though all of them were likely to know their way around a blues progression, most's knowledge of the blues was about as deep as a scratch on a John Lee Hooker 45. Super-primitive production techniques just short of hand-carving the vinyl then conspired to make sure that any attempt at subtlety was virtually inaudible. Bands couldn't even play out without their own raunched-up version of ""Louie Louie"", and if it wasn't better The Sonics' nuclear-strength rendition, they shouldn't have bothered. As a direct result of 1), most of these bands have been tidily forgotten, even in the wake of rampant revivalism. An ignominious end, for sure, but that's why we need bands like The Husbands; without them, who would remind us both of the visceral power of garage rock as well as why it was long-forgotten in the first place? After working on a litany of prior false-starts over the past few years, Sadie Shaw (ex-Vanishing) and Sarah Reed (ex-Lies) hooked up with Nikki Sloate (ex-No Knife) to form The Husbands (ex-every negligibly important band of all time) and play some old-fashioned, no-frills sludge. Introducing the Sounds of The Husbands fairly blazes through fourteen tracks of classic guitar-grind and drumming straight from the Meg White School of Percussion (School motto: ""Why are there so many different drums on this set?"") to close out at fast-and-hard 26-six minutes. But even within two tracks, it's clear that they have a judo hold on real garage rock. That's a mixed-blessing, sadly; just like the classics from which they draw their sound, it proves to be as intermittently refreshing as it is ultimately monotonous. Fortunately for anyone big on instant gratification, The Husbands produce like champs; the immediacy of these songs is never suspect. On nearly every track, nothing is withheld-- every chord, snare hit, bass kick, or cymbal crash is banged out full-force. Even if they were leaking oil, with four flats and a swarm of Africanized killer bees trapped inside the car, they'd still have the pedal on the floor, so give credit where it's due. On ""I'm Doing Fine"", they hold back just long enough, coasting on a slick little groove before all-out ignition on Sugar Pie DeSanto's ""In the Basement"", the album's only really impressive build. It's so impressive, however, that it becomes clear what a shame it is that they don't hold out a little more often. But The Husbands aren't the kind of band that trucks with pansy stuff like subtlety or restraint, and I reckon they'll pick a fight soon as look at you just for mentioning it. Sometimes that's fine, if the songwriting and energy can back up the full-throttle approach, but here it fails more often than it works, and that's the big problem with Introducing's abundance of misguided energy. Nearly half of these songs are covers. Extremely faithful renditions of The Barbarians' ""Take It or Leave It"", or Half Pint & The Fifths' ""Orphan Boy"" immediately stand out as the best songs here. The beautiful, pace-breaking versions of doo-wop hits ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and The Drifters' ""There Goes My Baby"" are fine, as well, but it takes a rare charm to muster the same magic as a great original. The Husbands, unfortunately, don't quite nail it, instead residing in a terrifying limbo where they play just well enough to fall short of evoking the feel of the source material, but perfectly adequately to overshadow their own songwriting, which can only come off as bland and (not accidentally) exceedingly derivative in comparison-- just like the old days. There's such a thing as too faithful; garage meant the world to punk and to the current state of rock 'n' roll, but homage or not, its faults are better left obscured in revisionist history.","A high percentage of 60s garage-rock bands probably could have done everyone a favor and stayed there.

Shutdown the Sun,Oranger,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f0c0084474cd0c2711/1:1/w_160/b64f2b4e.jpg,2004-01-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6022-shutdown-the-sun/,Jackpine Social Club,"Most of the time, cramming bands into geographic pigeonholes is a worthless exercise. Check the NYC chirping of yesteryear, when every post-punkish, well-dressed pack of players was unknowingly smooshed into context with The Velvet Underground, or even more awesomely, The Strokes. Some bands found their sound stupidly oversimplified, all of their peripheral influences spontaneously discounted in favor of press-ready convenience; other groups became unnecessarily puffed-up, needlessly sucked into a massive wave of buzz. Considering that most music fans weren't exactly pining away for another hollow, hype-heavy pseudo-scene, nor desperately awaiting news of another nonexistent city-based community, the band-as-local-spokesperson paradigm seemed (and continues to seem) like an especially dumb approach. San Francisco's Oranger might not be subject to the same kind of vacuum-seal as their East Coast brethren, but, like an awful lot of California-based bands with Brian Wilson/Gram Parsons cassettes overflowing their glove compartments, they still somehow perfectly embody the sea-salted landscape that spawned them. Oranger's breezy, 60s-inspired psych-pop borrows the classic California recipe of mixing guitar fuzz and sunny melodies; even their name seems designed to champion their decidedly West Coast roots. Oranger are postcard-ready California iconography. Shutdown the Sun is Oranger's third full-length, and their tightest effort to date: Abandoning some of the meandering, neo-psych tendencies of their past, Shutdown is packed with solid, intricately structured pop songs, each cut boasting a brassy, AM-radio throwback tinge. Singer/guitarist Mike Drake is the band's sole songwriter, and his vision includes plenty of Beatlesque melodies and soft, lilting choruses-- but what's most interesting about Shutdown the Sun is the record's versatility (a trait easily attributable to Drake's flexibility as a songwriter), and its accompanying cohesion, flitting seamlessly between tones (stands range from straightforward indie-pop to shaky, freewheeling garage riffage). The record's title track is a carefree, harmony-heavy bit of sun-song that lovingly descends into a closing freakout just spastic enough to distinguish the band from their by-the-books contemporaries (see Rooney, etc). ""Sweet Goodbye"" is all jangle and romp, its frantic keys and unapologetic guitar solo providing both point and counterpoint to the Rolling Stones; opener ""Cut Off Yer Thumbs"" features glorious pedal steel whines (guest-played by Chris ""The Texican"" Heinrich) and plenty of salty guitar twang, layered over enough soft drone and feedback to satiate even the most frigid lovers of post-rock. Which is all to say that Oranger are at their best when they deviate from standard indie-pop formula-- the more obvious tracks (see ""Going Under"") tend to do little other than bog the album down. The first 3000 copies of Shutdown the Sun come complete with a staggering 34-track bonus disc, comprised of rare and/or unreleased songs recorded between 1998-2002. Designed, presumably, to showcase the band's more experimental tendencies, From the Ashes of Electric Elves is an interesting side dish to Shutdown the Sun, but not an especially necessary one. Fortunately, the record stands alone: Oranger have managed to shove thick ocean breezes, cloudless skies, and California languor into every note they play, creating an album that's as appealing as it is light.","Most of the time, cramming bands into geographic pigeonholes is a worthless exercise.

Cast of Thousands,Elbow,by: Hartley Goldstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc275e6ef95969322da4/1:1/w_160/ded12af5.jpg,2004-01-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2719-cast-of-thousands/,V2,"Well, by now it's pretty much official: after 40 unrivaled years, the reign of The Beatles' idyllic melodies over British Rock has been usurped by Radiohead's cathartic explorations. A glance at the current UK album charts confirms it: Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head, David Gray's A New Day at Midnight and Muse's Absolution all topple Britpop's old school. The Stereophonics are the only band in the entire Top 40 that arguably aim for a Beatlesque sound, and they're more a poor man's Manic Street Preachers, anyway. It's still surprising, though, that many of Britain's current taste-making bands have been able to find such contemporary success abandoning The Beatles' formulas. At one point, Blur encompassed the very essence of British rock's pop-heavy exuberance; who'd have thought that, in the ensuing years, Damon Albarn would strike critical gold with alternative hip-hop experiments (Gorillaz) and dumbfounding collaborative world music projects (Mali Music) that adhere to little of Britpop's confining tenements? And what of one-time Blur nemeses Oasis, whose seemingly endless cache of anthemic choruses, ""psychedelic"" nonsense lyrics, and saccharine bombast made them, for better or worse, 90s rock legends? In recent years, their Beatle-cribbing has only led them into semi-retirement and complete creative bankruptcy. When the Manchester five-piece Elbow released their 2001 debut, Asleep in the Back, it was but one more successful debut from a British band drawing more inspiration from OK Computer than Sgt. Pepper. Reportedly three years in the making, the record made good-- at least commercially-- on the heaps of media-buzz that greeted its release, but ultimately proved anything but an uplifting listen. Bogged down in unassuming gray tones and irrepressible cynicism, the album's songs traveled on ominous basslines and nerve-wracked, guitar-based atmospherics. It was a record whose protagonists not only longed for escape from their surroundings (""Any day now, how's about getting out of this place anyways""), but also for liberation from themselves and those around them (""You're a tragedy waiting to happen""). Even before one can wrestle Elbow's new Cast of Thousands out of its shrinkwrap, the record seems a completely different story. Its cover is strikingly white (serving in contrast to their debut's gothic blacks and midnight blues) and depicts crude statues of a man and woman standing side by side. For all of Asleep in the Back's romanticizing of escapism, Cast of Thousands' overtly optimistic themes of togetherness will likely have more than a few fans' eyes rolling. Even the title is a statement of inclusion, referring to the thousands of fans at Elbow's Glastonbury show that acted as an impromptu chorus for this record's celestial denouement, ""Grace Under Pressure"" (the band even went to meticulous lengths to credit each of these fans in the liner notes). Fortunately, Cast of Thousands rides the borders of sentimentality expertly-- Elbow's new-found hope in unity may seem like idealistic drivel on paper, but is carried off on record with refreshing determination. Opener ""Ribcage"" ebbs on Ben Hillier's patently ambitious production work, which marries seething basslines to looping bouts of percussion and admittedly excessive vocals by the London Gospel Community Choir. However, the song is importantly as volatile as it is uplifting: Elbow frontman Guy Garvey's lyrical musings run the gamut from explosive (""We blew the doors, didn't we?/ We pissed in their champagne"") to confessional (""All you have is kisses/ And all I need is you""). This dualism haunts most all of Cast of Thousands, providing each number with an unstable elemental charge. The record is at its best when the band is at their most unassuming. Garvey may populate Cast of Thousands with ""fallen angels"" and ""fugitives,"" but his protagonists always remain likeable, and simply put, normal. On the string-laden acoustic ballad ""Fugitive Motel"", Garvey is ""tired"" and insists, ""Not 'til I can read by the moon/ Am I going anywhere."" Elsewhere, ""Not a Job"" may not be rock music's first stab at capturing the frustrations of a day job, but is probably one of a very few that neither advises its characters to quit nor exact sweet revenge on unfeeling supervisors. Garvey's lyrics avoid quixotic fantasizing and are all the more compelling for it: he temperately advises ""Not a Job's"" aggravated subject, ""You have to give yourself a break."" If Cast of Thousands is largely inspired, the album's grand finale, ""Grace Under Pressure"", is damn near revelatory. Over a rollicking, cymbal-heavy drumbreak seemingly lifted from DJ Shadow's sampler, Elbow are joined again by the London Community Gospel Choir and the thousands of their fans from the Glastonbury show, as they all sing in unison, ""We still believe in love, so fuck you."" It's as an incredibly moving moment; a wash of rebellious uprising over the sound of a band at the height of its creative powers.","Well, by now it's pretty much official: after 40 unrivaled years, the reign of The Beatles' idyllic melodies over ...

DJ Kicks,Chicken Lips,by: Nick Sylvester,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a130ea9e61561daa473d/1:1/w_160/1637fec1.jpg,2004-01-11 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1745-dj-kicks/,!K7,"""Cratedigging"" is one of those words that works fine in print, but Jesus Christ, if I ever hear anyone say it aloud in public I will punch him in the face. Call it what you want, but the digging of the crates (gah!) is London trio Chicken Lips' M.O. for their entry into !K7's laureated DJ Kicks series. Here are 21 vastly different cuts of little popular renown, culled largely from the 80s traditions of Hi-NRG disco and friendly-tempo dub. Along with these are a few tracks of recent vintage, including a Matthew Herbert remix and three written by Chicken Lips themselves, one of which has the best bassline ever. These three newer tracks throw the mix somewhat into flux. Not to say that it's a necessity of mixtapes or a requirement of the DJ Kicks series, but in general there's some sort of discernible common thread to a DJ-set style collection of tracks. If it isn't entirely because the tracks are of same time period, and, if it certainly isn't entirely because of similar genre, I would hazard that Chicken Lips picked these particular songs because in each, one element or another is, to put it crudely, not quite right. For many of the tracks, this peculiarity can be as simple as some incongruous synthline that works despite all odds; in the case of Nina Hagen's ""African Reggae"", for instance, it's as extreme as a German woman yodeling. This thread of transcendent weirdness allows Chicken Lips to seamlessly string together what would otherwise be deeply jarring sequences-- the mix consequently has both an esoteric feel that warrants much praise, and also an amateur and personal aura that ingratiates itself. Picking the best tracks out of oddball mixtape albums seems more of a personal task than a critical one, but if I may, in order as they appear: Matthew Herbert gives Norwegian vocalist Karin Krog's sultry ""Meaning of Love"" a glitchy treatment up to par with the best of his similar work on Secondhand Sounds, kindly minimizing the fete of its Brazilian-style flute-looped shuffle without desecrating it. Herbert's track is followed immediately by the timbales, key-tar, and low-coded chorus of Jimmy Spicer's classic hip-hop relic ""The Bubble Bunch"", which, if it does not win over the listener with its somewhat kitschy funk guitar riff, will do so by the force of nostalgia alone. Nina Hagen's ""African Reggae"", mentioned above for its German yodels, also sports an anthemic arena guitar solo that takes up the chorus melody of ""I... wanna go to Af-ri-ca""-- you'll hate it or you'll love it, but either way ""African Reggae"" is the track most indicative of the quirky Chicken Lips mix spirit, and perhaps the most memorable here. Beyond the meticulous amount of thought that informed their track selection, Chicken Lips also contribute the absolutely sick groove of ""Wind Ya Neck In"", a 5\xBD minute big beat track that, in a way, is the album's only true dance number, and betrays the group's pre-history as 90s house duo Bizarre Inc. Redeeming the five-song rut of relative bores that begins after Larry Levan's upped reworking of Gwen Guthrie's ""Seventh Heaven"", Chicken Lips keep the individual parts of ""Wind Ya Neck In"" relatively simple, but certainly not minimal. The track builds on the spastic stop/start sixteenth notes of a hi-hat and a fat three-note bassline, peppered with occasional percussive slashes and hazy humble synth tucked far away in the background. It is fittingly the longest track on DJ Kicks, followed immediately in sequence and length by Big Two Hundred's ""Suckee"", which has a similarly deep bass and big beat feel. Going from that terribly mediocre selection of songs in the middle of the album into the vibrant Chicken Lips number, one can't help but worry that the trio might develop something of a Michael Mayer complex-- always compiling others' work but rarely releasing their own. The other two Chicken Lips' tracks on DJ Kicks are fresh, perhaps more perfected takes on the Hi-NRG style, with their synths more finely timbre'd and an overall depth of sound much more realized than their vintage predecessors. ""You're Not Ready Yet"" pits a bassline against itself, whose unlikely jitter fights with its sloddy lowtones: background hands are clapped in what sounds like a basketball arena five miles away. ""Bad Skin"" closes the mix, approximating a radio cut-up style a la Akufen as tandem male/female love croons are interspersed among a shattered erotic sampling of I-can-go-all-nights and Baby-I've-got-it-bads. With any hope, Chicken Lips will suspend the cratedigging (they also did a mix last summer called Body Music for the Nite Life label), take Mayer's cue, and plan to release an album of original work in the near future-- the sooner the better.","""Cratedigging"" is one of those words that works fine in print, but Jesus Christ, if I ever hear anyone say ...

Goodbye Little Doll,EZ T,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce813d197565213b40e/1:1/w_160/106577d7.gif,2004-01-11 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2897-goodbye-little-doll/,Monitor,"Too much ""Americana"" or ""alt-country"" product seems eager to bore. Too many of the acts are either redundant tributes to better bands or materially nostalgic in the Cracker Barrel way, churning out prefab faux-rural simulacra. Fortunately, EZ T trots alongside those few scuffed-rhinestone acts able to use Americana's cadences to examine darker waves of grain. While you'd be right in assuming that Goodbye Little Doll's sound barely dodges cow-patties in that field of dreams between Wilco and Junior Kimbrough, the album's urbane nihilism and undertones of absurdity protect it from being confused with the O Brotherhoodlums whose ""agrarian"" poses are as transparently escapist as Disney's Main Street USA. Fans of Drag City's key post-folk dramatists might consider this album an all-star jam, since it boasts so many recognizable session-people (and even makes an argument that these musicians comprise much of the twisted Bonnie backbone that other bands are often accused of echoing). EZ T is lead by Will Oldham studio and concert collaborator Colin Gagon, features two members of Ned Oldham's Anomoanon, boasts Paul Oldham on bass, showcases the production skills of Bill (Smog) Callahan, and is seasoned with Smog backup singer Sarabeth Tucek's unadorned pipes. Gagon's voice suggests that he's a temporary medium for the looser ghost of Papa M's Dave Pajo, and the wishlist ""Central Control"" is practically an homage to the Silver Jews' David Berman (what with its great line about Nixon withering, and the mini-refrain, ""I want to drink my weight in blood""). So if you're keeping score, Liam Hayes' Plush project remains the only ""spinoff"" from this circle whose releases don't give their peers away. Let me not treat EZ T like Drag City apocrypha, though, even if Gagon's lyrical tone mirrors the observations of Arise Therefore's whoreson stranger, and even if he furthers that label's family-affair ethos by enlisting two more Gagons to accompany him. Goodbye Little Doll is somehow a singular beast, perhaps due to Gagon's tough mumble (the listener pictures an anemic Joe Don Baker) and his players' scrappier, less deliberate executions. Plus he rocks out! If you ever hoped to hear Bleeding Rearwater Revival cover the climax of ""How Soon Is Now"" (yes, the ""I go about things the wrong way"" part), then just wait for the final minute of the fence-torching ""New River"". Hell, the first line is startling enough: ""Mama, don't hang yourself."" And then there's the point at which the speaker reckons he ""could kill the president with my bare hands""-- The album is packed with raucous portraits of misfortunate mothers, sisters and children (imagine if the Donner Party was actually a shindig in someone's loft). ""Fingerless Children"" is a rewrite of the traditional ""Motherless Children"" popularized by The Carter Family and Blind Willie Johnson (okay, EZ T's arrangement wouldn't sound out of place on their producer's Rain on Lens). The parent and sibling on ""Cruxes, Cruxes"" even poisoned the song's speaker. Unlike exile-hungry hipsters, Gagon doesn't take domestic/matriarchal imagery for granted, and never insists that sisters lack mystery. (While I'm outing my womb-envy, I'll add that this album's worst repeat-play trait is its Chan Marshall-esque minor-chord minimalism.) If we're lucky, future Americana-ists will consult EZ T to learn how the credneck sound can be a vivid palette with which to investigate and convey complicated moods and ironies, just as some paper mills wait until night to release their pollutant clouds.","Too much ""Americana"" or ""alt-country"" product seems eager to bore.

Pussyfootin',The Capitol Years,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a519ea9e61561daa5063/1:1/w_160/e92ed89d.gif,2004-01-11 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1296-pussyfootin/,Full Frame,"So, I suppose the blurry creature being held up to the window in the photograph on this record's cover is a cat, and that the album title some sort of inane pun, but you could easily extend the title to apply to the actual music here: Pussyfootin' consists of gently rendered acoustic pop songs that decline to get up in your face, but not so light that you wouldn't notice having them around. But most clearly, the title refers to the fact that these are some of the earliest recordings made by The Capitol Years, back when it was just one guy named Shai Halperin who hadn't yet decided what he wanted to sound like; the disc compiles a bunch of songs he laid to tape way back when and ignored until finally releasing them in late 2003. The stuff he pulls from his body of 2000 and 2001 recordings offers portents of both of the directions in which his music career has taken him since then. The down-home vibe foreshadows the intimacy, if not the breadth, of his official debut, Meet Yr Acres, while the directness and umambiguously organic approach is more akin to 2002's Jewelry Store EP, the first Capitol Years album to feature a full band. There's a grab-bag of touchstones here, from obvious ones (Dylan, Parsons-era Byrds), to a few less expected ones (""There's a Bridge"" sounds like Leo Kottke backing Tom Petty). The Kottke influence becomes particularly apparent on the instrumentals ""Sloppy Train"" and ""South Jersey"", finger-pickin'-good guitar acoustic guitar workouts that help to pace the collection and make it feel more like a cohesive album. Shai obviously had more on his mind than acoustic folk when he recorded these songs, though, and subtle things, like the abundance of slapback echo on ""Those Who Suck Will Blow"" or what sounds like a flute mellotron on ""Hookers"" crop up unexpectedly to add other colors. The sound collage and vocal processing of ""There's a Starlet"" could even be called ambitious if it lasted for more than a minute. It doesn't all work, naturally, as ""Wear You Down"" sounds too worn down; the harmonies and slow, distant drums come across like The Kingsbury Manx recording after 65 continuous hours without sleep. ""Tumbleweed Prayer"", a cross-country collaboration with a songwriter named Michael Taylor, has a certain lo-fi charm to it, but it's also quite the patch job-- Taylor's vocal tape sounds like it was recorded in the foyer of a Dairy Queen on Fisher Price equipment, and it's out of time to the point where Shai's accompaniment has to drop out for a few seconds here and there and come back in when the beat is reestablished. A shame, too, because otherwise, it sounds like a pretty good song. Andy Rooney was just groaning a few minutes ago on 60 Minutes about taking stock of what's clogging up your closets each year, and deciding what to get rid of, and that seems to be what Shai is doing before moving on to the next phase of the Capitol Years. While Pussyfootin' works well as a stopgap, though, I'm more eager to see what he'll do on a full-length with his new band, which holds a lot of promise if their live show and first EP are any indication. At any rate, this exercise in cleaning house makes for an enjoyable record, and a satisfactory wrapup for this band's earliest phase.","So, I suppose the blurry creature being held up to the window in the photograph on this record's cover ...

"Spire: Organ Works Past, Present & Future",Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8159d034d5c69bf395f/1:1/w_160/aa142a83.gif,2004-01-11 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2036-spire-organ-works-past-present-future/,Touch,"In the liner notes of Spire: Organ Works Past, Present & Future, Touch's Mike Harding claims ""It is impossible to overestimate the influence of the organ on the history of music and sound."" Indeed, dating from before Christianity, the organ has undergone changes in both physical construction and musical importance. Today, many people probably think of churches as the best place to see and hear organs, but the instrument was at first rejected by Christian authorities for being too associated with secular music. In the Middle Ages, organs were first built into churches, though even then only to appease growing secular political powers. The instruments were soon built as part of the churches themselves, and anyone who has seen a particularly impressive organ towering over church patrons in an old cathedral can attest to their intimidating presence. However, to connect this ancient instrument to modern music and sound design (as Touch appears to do with this compilation), you have to look at arguably the most important aspect of the organ: chiefly, it represents the first time man attempted to create music using mechanical means, and in the process allowed him to create music theretofore unimagined. The first Greek organs were powered by air pumped from pockets of pressure inside a bucket submerged in water. Thus, it became possible to perform music without ever having to take a breath. Furthermore, organs were soon able to emit tones beyond the range or volume of any traditional instrument. In short, almost every musical tool, piece of electronic equipment or software can be traced back to this thing. Viva la pertinence. Spire is a collection of pieces ""inspired or more directly influenced"" by the organ, featuring a few Touch mainstays like Christian Fennesz, Philip Jeck and Biosphere, as well as actual organ composers like Marcus Davidson. In reality, very few of the tracks are actual organ performances. Most treat the instrument as merely a source, making Spire something of a radical organ remix record. Step back a few and it also works as pure ambience-- the naturally rich, rounded tone of the organs played or sampled overwhelms any attempts to subvert it. However, the two-disc collection also acts as a rare look back among contemporary electronica composers and producers at their ""roots."" Perhaps the day when we think of our generation's electronic music as being part of the same canon as the organ's isn't far ahead. Fennesz works with Sparklehorse's Scott Minor on ""Dwan"", a track they began working on while in residence at a Geneva festival. Performed on a distorted Wurlitzer organ, the track moves from static-ridden clusters to phased, melancholy progressions. At 2\xBD minutes, it ends far too quickly to really establish much mood, rather seeming like a quick summary instead of a finished piece. Similarly, Jeck's ""Stops"" is prefaced by a quote from famed French composer Olivier Messiaen, who contributed some of the most amazing music for organ of the 20th Century. In English, it reads, ""Music does not express anything directly,"" and is a perfect preamble to the dense wall of distortion Jeck applies to his major chord. Messiaen's quote betrays his beliefs in musical impressionism by way of Debussy (who also gets a quote in the booklet), and suits the often mysterious qualities of Spire. Biosphere's ""Visible Invisible"" is an original performance, and features the solemn tones of church organ as you might hear during a funeral Mass. He uses the instrument as a calming force, constructing the entirely uncluttered piece from overlapping consonances. It's the aural equivalent of faint blue and purple watercolors running together into a formless cushion. ""Askam Wind Cluster"", by erstwhile Cabaret Voltaire and Hafler Trio member Chris Watson, goes for the arch concept by forming his piece not from an actual organ, but from wind's convection currents, presumably acting in a similar way to air within the pipes of an organ. The rhythmic ""beat"" of currents demonstrates essentially pure ambience, and also a deceptively simple process of how organ music is produced. Z'EV contributes ""If Only That Love Lets Letting Happen (Organ Music for Organs)"", composed from fragments of Bach's ""Wenn Nur Den Lieben Gott Laesst Walten"", and like Biosphere, creates sweet, mystic calm out of overlapping tones. This is a far cry from Icelandic composer Finnbogi Petursson's ""Diabolus"", wherein two subsonic organ tones create a ""tritone"" interval, at one time referred to by Church musicians as the ""devil in music"" due to its extreme dissonance. Well, that's the idea anyway; Petursson's piece mostly seems like low-level hum unless you really get up close to your speakers (at which time you may experience some light nausea!). If you have zero interest in a bunch of guys playing with organs, Spire works about as well as any compilation featuring the same cast of characters would. Over time, Touch has left its brand on a whole school of sound design that takes into account classical and natural phenomena, so this set should at least be pretty cool for people already into their roster. Of course, you don't need any special appreciation of organ music to enjoy this, but it's sometimes reassuring to know the new kids still remember their basics.","In the liner notes of Spire: Organ Works Past, Present & Future, Touch's Mike Harding claims ""It is\n\ impossible ...

ae³o & h³ae,AutechreHafler Trio,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a150c0084474cd0bfda7/1:1/w_160/8c1ae43c.gif,2004-01-08 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/367-ae3o-h3ae/,Phonometrography,"Drone: as with anything else that rarely changes, it's necessary to latch onto subtleties. What minimal suggestion put forth by a drone is so easily applied to pretty much any impression you might have that, predictably, describing one often leads to vague subjectivities bordering on bad poetry. And as much as I'd love to go around proclaiming my love for ""deeply resonant, holy abysses"" (not), I wish there were an easier way to communicate the real power of the things. England's Hafler Trio are no strangers to an elusive clarity; rather, Andrew Mackenzie isn't. Mackenzie is the only current member of the self-dubbed h\xB3o, a group that at no point was actually comprised of three people-- unless you count their ""collaborators"", like imaginary scientists Robert Spridgeon or Dr. Edward Moolenbeek, both of whom were fabricated by Mackenzie and founding member Chris Watson (ex-Cabaret Voltaire) for their fairly astounding 1984 debut, Bang! An Open Letter. On that album, and on many early Hafler Trio recordings, tape edits and loops, found sound and Residents-style Dadaism ruled the day. Since Watson's departure in the late 80s, Mackenzie has gravitated more towards experimental ambient and drone music. Autechre, on the other hand, seem to have been moving in the opposite direction. 2003's Draft 7.30 might have been slightly more straightforward than 2001's extraordinary Confield, but could hardly have been further from ambient if it tried. Even the moments that might conceivably have been called ""drone"" (parts of ""Surripere"", for example) seemed skittish and nervous. Certainly a far cry from anything on the Autechre/Hafler Trio split aptly titled, ae\xB3o & h\xB3ae, a daunting exercise in ominous hum, icy space and digital resonance. In fact, I had a hard time locating anything obviously Autech'd, whereas the album has much in common with recent Hafler releases such as the Moment When We Blow Flour from Our Tongues EP. ""ae\xB3o"" begins as a high-pitched, muffled scream, clearly emanating from the cold circulatory system of a computer and without the slightest notion of making you feel all warm inside. Soon, what seems like white noise fills in the space beneath, and a bass-heavy generator noise becomes dominates. It reminds me of sound-sculptor Richard Chartier's album on American experimental electronic label Crouton from last year-- Hafler Trio have also recorded for Crouton, and fans of modern dark ambient and electronic will have much to investigate on their roster. ""ae\xB3o"" moves through long periods of relative calm (if you consider residual static hum calm), but never comes to a point of resolution. It's bleak, in the way any lack of root is bleak. It could also be endlessly fascinating in a chemically altered state. The second piece, ""h\xB3ae"", begins unassumingly with what sounds like a distant wind. Listening closer, there's also a faint sonar whistle, gradually growing louder. Then, the unison growl of jet engines overtakes the introductory ambience, eventually expanding into a massive howl. It sounds as if I'm being sucked into a giant black hole, passing through faster and faster, until nothing is really clear except that there doesn't appear to be a light on the other side. Midway through the 15-minute track, things become calmer for a short period, as the ""engine"" noises give way to the sound of actual flight. However, again a gradual increase in volume and depth is used as a device to reel me further into the cavernous house of mirrors that is the artists' preferred workshop. The track ends with the only rhythmically active section on the CD, as the previous noises are cut up into short, clipped propulsions before settling on a single distorted buzz-drone. Although Autechre and Mackenzie need little excuse to dive into the abstract, ae\xB3o & h\xB3ae is, as these things go, relatively accessible. For starters, there's much variation over the course of the two lengthy pieces, and things never really approach either pure noise or pure ambience. It's not the kind of record I'd play to chill out, but since there are hundreds of small details to focus on, anyone willing to block out some quality listening time (and not in need of any unnecessary ""songs"") could become quickly engrossed. Musically, it's consistently interesting, if a tad cold, so I'd recommend it with the caveat that you shouldn't expect much of a helping hand from the bands.","Drone: as with anything else that rarely changes, it's necessary to latch onto subtleties.

All Strange Beasts of the Past,Thuja,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a89d034d5c69bf3858/1:1/w_160/ff04fdae.gif,2004-01-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8052-all-strange-beasts-of-the-past/,Emperor Jones,"Listening to Thuja, it's hard not to imagine a pantomiming circle of witches. Or warlocks, I guess. All Strange Beasts of the Past, the quartet's fourth album, is especially backwoods esoteric. It's hard to say how much hocus-pocus is intended; you need to locate a certain mood to get it. If willing and able, maybe you should invoke the proper mood. Like wander a forest until you find the right tree. Try to sleep then. Wake up. Eat dirt. Ostensibly, these are the sorts of things that connect you to an environment. Or watch treetops catch the wind and assign meaning to the patterns of dispersal. If it gets cold, let needles and sap cover you completely. Or bed beneath a white cedar. Wake up again. Stay there. Build instruments. Adapt. Play something based on your experience. You can obviously enjoy this music without going mystic, but if you do follow this program, maybe you'll achieve a David Tibet-styled inward light, a glowing path towards deciphering the more cryptic messages embedded within Thuja's admirably understated, unformed folk. Though I live in overcrowded Brooklyn, I'm continually seduced by San Francisco's Jewelled Antler Collective. The best of pedigrees, Thuja's a Jewelled Antler supergroup that includes active members of The Birdtree, Blithe Sons, Dead Raven Choir, Id Battery, and Hala Strana. What bothers me as a city-bound fan of these free-psych folkies are the subtleties I might miss, the wilted tones drowned by the germ-infested subway, overdriven car stereos, and unending construction. Somehow the ""let's record in the woods"" aesthetic seems lost amid pornographic skyscrapers and memorials. Making things more difficult on their fourth stellar release, the quartet never musters a human voice. Without Glenn Donaldson's haunting vocalizations, especially effective on The Birdtree's brilliant Orchards & Caravans, the chill of the languidly paced instrumentals acts as a blank-eyed frontman spitting code. Here, he keeps quiet. Because of this dependence on instrumental interplay, I can't imagine these songs separated from one another. There aren't singles, or hits. No hooks or choruses. And the album reads weirdly when approached as separate fragments leading to a resolution. Instead, consider these compositions as interwoven moments in a single chapter. Maybe overlapping shadows. Actually, the same notion of serial compositions could be applied to the work of the Jewelled Antler Collective in general. In its oeuvre, subsequent projects are additional layers in a narrative that maps the players' aesthetic and social concerns: field recordings, collage, reworked standards, emulation of naturally occurring sounds, found instruments, melancholy tunefulness, mournful drone, deep listening, hybridization, and a disciplined but ecstatic improvisational sense. On All Strange Beasts of the Past, the compositional sense is languidly collagist. Sound patterns develop biologically and usher scattered movements and functions from one moment to the next. Eastern drone. Shakers take the forefront. Water droplets chime. Deep percussive hums create a foundation. Random bells and anarchic guitar strums add a sense of ghostly connective tissue to otherwise freeform acoustic ramblings. It's a cracked fireside chorus. As with a number of Jewelled Antler releases, the noisemakers are often unidentifiable: a water stick, crackling wood, synth drone, spring reverb, twittering crickets, violin. Recorded live with no processing, each tone has a pristine, temporarily dreamy feel, especially the ghostly, echoed pianos on track five, and the tapping and shuddering of tin or metal on track seven. Despite my emphasis on whispers, the volume does jolt upwards a during that seventh track. It's a 17+ minute incantation wrapped in the fits and starts of clanking bottles, background rattle, bowed strings, whirrs, upper-level screech, out-of-tune call-and-response, and a muted snarl. Even during its loudest moments, though, gurgling water and the ringing of acoustic strings are clearly discerned. It's an acoustic shout-- and compositionally, it's just as fractured as the six tracks before it. By avoiding a self-contained climax, the piece remains unresolved, assuring the listener this chapter's still open in either direction. And though I'm unsure where the story goes next, All Strange Beasts of the Past remains exquisitely opaque: ambient hiss recast as northwoods divination.","Listening to Thuja, it's hard not to imagine a pantomiming circle of witches.

Dreamspeed/Blind Light (1992-1994),Anton Fier,by: Alex Linhardt,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be81abf31b7dc7156165/1:1/w_160/f77f28e3.gif,2004-01-08 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3283-dreamspeedblind-light-1992-1994/,Tzadik,"There can really only be one strong complaint lobbed against this collection. The cover art, despite the utterly enrapturing beige vapor emanating from Anton Fier's bleary eyes and blearier cigarette, desperately cries out for a sophisticated lingerie vixen reading French poetry on a chaise longue somewhere in the background. It's already torn between channeling the French new-wave and solitary meditation, and it seems unjust to deny the audience that last image before they listen to an album as seductive, perplexing, serenely droning, and effortlessly cool as anything released in the last decade. Anton Fier, one of the more underrated drummers of the New York jazz/rock scene, has had a remarkable career. He was the drummer for The Feelies, The Lounge Lizards, and Pere Ubu, as well as a session musician for everyone from Jeff Buckley to Yoko Ono. In addition, he found the time to found one of the classic ""almost-classic"" non-bands of the 80s and 90s, The Golden Palominos. The two-disc Dreamspeed/Blind Light (1992-1994) compiles his two alluring, eternally out-of-print solo albums recorded in the midst of one of the Palominos' most fertile period. 1992's Dreamspeed would probably be entertaining enough if the line-up just stood there, staring at the walls: It features the usual Fier cohorts (Bill Laswell, Matt Stein), and adds Parliament/Funkadelic's Bootsy Collins, Otomo Yoshihide collaborator/poet Phew, Blonde Redhead guitarist Makino Kazu, and that great freakshow Zelig, Buckethead. Evidently, when you mix these colors, you get fearsomely confident tabla-smashing, lipstick-smacking, luminously malefic libidi-vertigo. While any clumsily monolingual listeners will have difficulty parsing the whole talking-in-Japanese thing Phew employs, let's hope, for everyone's benefit, that she's discussing the finer points of stealthily stabbing Mafiosi and the prostitutes that love them. This is dark, devious music as terrifying and romantic as Blue Lines, and as bewitching and angelic as anything the Palominos ever released. Who cares if the song titles deal with the Book of Jude and a Heidegger tome? This music should be scoring British gangster movies or, at the very least, trouncing Coldplay in the contest to see what music they should play before people hook up on The Real World: San Diego. This shouldn't dissuade anyone looking for experimentation: the title track develops Phew's impossibly arousing voice into some horrible Mengele experiment involving the voice box, a baby's tears, angry seagulls, and angrier dominatrices. Other songs pile heapings of trashcan drums and grating woodchippers on top of Zen waves of beatific placidity. The seemingly endless layering of Phew's vocal tracks start falling like a rainstorm, and pendulous guitar slithers out of silence with Doppler effects no mortal man could experience. For all the digital effects, the so-pomo-it's-not self-sampling, the looped vocals, this is immensely organic music; it basically drips all the vital liquids we hold so dear in a plangent mess all over your ears. It's drubbed, dubbed, drifting music at the pace of smoking cigarettes between midnight breakfast and sex. 1994's Blind Light stocks up on the members of Pure-era Palominos and, pretty obviously, it sounds very similar to that album. This is far from a bad thing. The masterstroke is the title track, beginning with filtered pseudo-gabba, launching into smoking jug-huffing, drunken Caribbean organs, and lumbering 12-strings. Elsewhere, the continuity of Dreamspeed is dispensed with in favor of startling periods of silence. ""Midnight"" gets some 60s soul momentum going, even putting some crowd cheers in, and right when the drums should be fading in, they fade out, which isn't even possible. On ""Clairvoyance of Self"", the song stops for a good two or three seconds any time another instrument or effect is added. Take comfort in the fact that it would be seamless without these stops, and it's seamlessly seamed with them. You win, you win. You lose, you win. Either way, you win. As with anything unavoidably beautiful and often low-key, there are moments that you might hear over a Starbucks speaker system. My advice: get a discount card and order a mocha. Then have sex with everyone in the room on top of velvet drapery. Then go to NYC to go see Fier jumpstart his career and reassume the reins of gorgeous atmospheric music: after many years of alleged retirement, he has recently performed with John Zorn and other old friends at Tonic in December. After two hours of this, even the lung cancer ward will be smoking.","There can really only be one strong complaint lobbed against this collection.

Duplex,Apparat,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a180b1335d7bf169828e/1:1/w_160/10a5a81a.jpg,2004-01-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/417-duplex/,Shitkatapult,"Music criticism (and listening for that matter) is never an exact art. As context shifts, so too does a record's resonance and weight-- looking back at 2003, I couldn't help considering which albums I had under- or overrated. Among those that I listen to more often now than I had thought I would are Richard X's Presents His X-Factor, Vol. 1 and Tobias Thomas' Smallville. Richard X is pop distilled, from start to finish, but Thomas' mix disc glides gracefully from the beatless to buoyant without any jarring moves. It's no surprise, then, that its bridge-crossing center features a couple of tracks from the Berlin-based, Kompakt-distributed, Marco Haas (T. Raumschmiere)-owned Shitkatapult label, whose minimalism and skittery, almost glitch-like beats marry the ambient and the experimental. Smallville includes a track each from Swede Anders Ilar and Finn Sami Koivikko-- two of three members of the Shitkatapult roster to release albums in 2003. The third is Apparat (Sascha Ring), whose Duplex LP veers away from the dub-meets-ambient and tech-house paths walked by Ilar and Koivikko, respectively, and sticks closer to more familiar, worn IDM roads. What Apparat does so differently from most of his bleeps-and-bloops counterparts is saturate the listener with a variety of sounds, from the sandpaper glitch of ""Granular Bastards"" to the horn-laden ""Negro Modelo"" to the tone poems of ""Contradiction"" and ""Wooden"", each of which feature vocalist Klas Yngborn. Despite his prevalence for creating a frozen ambient base in which he can skate and etch different grooves, Apparat is most engaging when he takes a maximalist approach. Which isn't to say that Duplex is an album of all left turns-- it's simply powered by its will to continue moving forward, never allowing its songs to settle firmly into melodies, nor leading its listeners merely in circles. Indeed, Apparat brings these songs to life by delicately coaxing a range of sounds from his IDM core: tracks such as ""Interrupt"" and ""Warm Signal"" begin with low hums, but seem to yearn to break out of their shells-- and when they do, whether it's with warm tones or a thumping bass, the effect is that same: a sort of journey not so much through sound, but from it, an audio exploratory than seems organic and somehow idyllic. ""Wooden"", with its martial beat and quivering melody, almost sounds avant-folk, delicately blending the acoustic and electronic like one of George's tracks through the woods. Saxophone and clarinet, Eastern melodies, road-movie-meets-Western guitar, Aphex-like bouncing balls, and the childlike ticks and tocks of Plone also adorn the record, each emerging naturally rather than seeming like window dressing. The result is clicks and cuts without the bells and whistles-- an IDM record you can love in a time when too many artists working within the genre seem as if they'd rather merely impress you.","Music criticism (and listening for that matter) is never an exact art.

Formations,Mileece,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c448eb335119a49ed8ef/1:1/w_160/e3c6556f.gif,2004-01-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5564-formations/,Lo,"As 2003 came to a close, I wondered if we should no longer be in a place where considering how music is made matters. Even though the last ten years or so have seen a once-hopeful, experimental community of electronic music producers graduate to the mainstream, I'd argue the timeframe has been considerably longer and the impact on all of music greater than we can discern. Sure, today things are possible in music no one could have dreamed of twenty years ago, merely due to technological benefits, but I believe the real revolution came to a head when the music we loved became digitally powered without anyone noticing. The moment when we stop hearing music as distinctly ""electronic"" seems like an important one, and I wonder if we're actually past that point already. Or whether that's a good or a bad thing. This question came to me while listening to English-born artist and programmer Mileece. The pieces on her debut, Formations, are based on natural phenomena such as light's changing patterns and the structure of snowflakes, all processed via self-authored programs. Yet, it isn't the inspiration I'm interested in, as musicians impacted by nature or even technology are hardly unique to our generation. What strikes me about Formations is that, despite its obviously studied, mechanical skeleton, it resonates as vitally as any other collection of ""real"" music. This stuff exists under the electronica umbrella because it is produced electronically, but it succeeds in part because its construction is rendered completely irrelevant. Mileece was born 1978 in London, where she had access to a recording studio from a very young age. In college she studied ""sonic art,"" wherein her studio and generative programming chops (using Super Collider) were honed. She trumpets a claim that computers can be changed from static objects into ""something capable of participating in the creation of music in a way which is interactive with the composer as well as the audience."" Of course, this isn't a new idea either among young IDM or electronic music composers. Still, the music on Formations seems less an experiment in laptop-based composition than plain old interesting music. That's a good thing, right? Bells pervade Formations. Mileece opts for the ping of small, clear music-box bells in all of the music here, creating a bright, percussive ambience, albeit slightly monolithic. ""Aube"" begins the record, and establishes the album's sound quickly. As the piece starts, the impact of notes slowly descending upon themselves as the tonality moves from major to minor briefly leads me to believe it may proceed into ""nostalgic"" IDM along the lines of Múm or Boards of Canada. However, Mileece seems more fond of micro-polyphonic clusters of sound. The melodies seem secondary to perpetual movement and the impression of direction. Since all of the music on Formations was based on natural patterns, and with ""parameterized chance"" written into her programs, looking for traditional structure might not be the best course of action. The title track wastes no time jumping right into the flighty, seemingly random sequence of pings from the previous tune. Where ""Aube"" progressed gracefully, this one is hyper. The tones bounce all around the mix, frantically moving out of each other's ways as new pings set forth. Musically, this reminds me of famed minimalist composer Terry Riley's classic Rainbow in Curved Air from 1967. The same major-key, otherworldly atmosphere is presented, but Mileece's piece takes on an added clarity, as if an ensemble of Gamelan players were invited to perform the lifecycle of diamond. Later on the album, ""Fern"" covers similar ground, but with a palette of darker blues and reds, rather than the vibrant oranges and yellows of ""Formations"". ""Nightfall"" is the only track to feature Mileece's vocals, and she uses them to sing a somber lullaby. She also adds sparse cello, and in the process is very reminiscent of Björk. In fact, my only real disappointment with Formations is that Mileece's non-electronic ideas aren't quite as mature as her more computerized ones. Still, over the course of the album, my overwhelming impression is that she has a gift for making calming, engaging music. And yes, that's a very good thing.","As 2003 came to a close, I wondered if we should no longer be in a place where considering how ...

The Angel of the Squared Circle,Pedal Steel Transmission,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16fc0084474cd0bfde4/1:1/w_160/a6c7ea0c.jpg,2004-01-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6534-the-angel-of-the-squared-circle/,Cardboard Sangria,"I already know what you're thinking. You've taken one look at the name Pedal Steel Transmission and you figure it could only be some sort of nu-country thing straight out of the midsection of the latest issue of No Depression. At least, that's what I figured it would be when I heard the name, but I could scarcely have been further from the truth. Sure, the namesake instrument puts in quite a few appearances, and there's twang to be had from time to time, but this is hardly your run-of-the-mill indie & western album, as this Chicago quartet swings through all manner of post-this and neo-that territory en route to making their wide-ranging, occasionally exhilarating sophomore album. The heart of the band's sound is really nothing terribly special-- if you've listened to an appreciable pile of indie rock records released since 1991 you've heard it all-- but where they take it is what makes it worth listening to. ""Breakin' Windows Everywhere"" is, at its core, a standard alt-country tune circa Anodyne-- it's got the smattering of banjo, the shuffling rhythm, the hint of twang in the otherwise urban accent and of course the keening pedal steel-- but it has the squirming ambient collage, ""It's Only a Day 'Til My Bed Is Warm"" for an intro, and these rushing Chicago post-rock swells interspersed throughout, stretching an otherwise ordinary song into a broadly eclectic mini-epic. And the mini-epic is Pedal Steel Transmission's true bread-and-butter. Witness the quaking, wah-drenched improvisation and murky Slint-channeling riffage of ""Gilman Report"", or the way ""Editene"" burns through a lengthy, herky-jerky intro before offering up anything like a verse. The album opens with the band's best mini-epic, a brilliant song called ""Waiting"" that initially seems to embody its title, droning on a remarkably slow Spanish guitar fade-in before sliding comfortably into a quasi-Latin groove for which Pinetop Seven deserve royalties. The surf-informed guitars flutter with tremolo around Dan Schneider's everyman voice, but once again, something that seems pretty straightforward at first takes a strange twist, as the band begins a build at the five-minute mark that lasts all the way to the nine-minute mark, distortion creeping in around the edges and finally overwhelming the song in a thrashing climax that lets out with a stuttering cadence and a final vocal tag. It's stunning. Unfortunately, the guys blow most of their load on that impressive opener, and the rest of the album has its share of filler, like the utterly MOR indie rock of ""Silent Like Hands"" and the wanking southern-rock jam that constitutes closer ""Baionette"". There's one more jaw-dropping song to be found, though, in ""I Saved the Last High Style for You"", a gorgeously tense nod to Black Heart Procession and Calexico that rests so precariously between sunny, rural prettiness and wrenching dissonance that it could constantly fall either way but somehow never does. The deep, groaning bass and doubled vocals conjure the coldest moments of Modest Mouse's The Moon & Antarctica, but I don't think I've ever heard a song that balanced contrasting elements quite like this one. Which is all to say that Pedal Steel Transmission have some tremendous songs on their second effort, even if their synthesis of dozens of readily identifiable influences isn't quite yet complete. If they can somehow manage to spin their finest moments into the fabric of a whole record, it's going to make for one spectacular album. As it stands, Angel of the Squared Circle is worth checking out for fans of music that resides in the cracks between subgenres, if only to hear this album's highlights and incredible promise of things to come.","I already know what you're thinking.
